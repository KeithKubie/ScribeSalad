00:00:00.338 --> 00:00:01.724
Voiceover:What I want to do in this video,

00:00:01.724 --> 00:00:05.053
is show that matrix
multiplication is associative.

00:00:05.053 --> 00:00:07.230
At least I'll show it for 2 by 2 matrices.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.888
And what I do in this
video you can extend it to

00:00:09.888 --> 00:00:12.634
really any dimension of matrices for which

00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:16.171
of the matrix multiplication
is actually defined.

00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:19.006
So let's look at 3
matrices, so let's say this

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:26.032
first matrix is A, B, C,
and D and this second matrix

00:00:26.032 --> 00:00:34.846
is E, F, G, H and then
finally this third matrix

00:00:34.846 --> 00:00:41.538
is I, J, and that's not the
imaginary unit I, just letter I,

00:00:41.538 --> 00:00:43.840
and this isn't E, this
is just the letter E.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.384
J, K and L, and I want
to look at 2 scenarios.

00:00:49.384 --> 00:00:52.030
So let me actually just
copy and paste this,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.915
So copy and paste.

00:00:56.915 --> 00:01:00.379
So I want to look at this
scenario where first,

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.214
I multiply the orange
and the yellow matrix.

00:01:03.214 --> 00:01:05.251
And I multiply that
times the purple matrix

00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:08.322
And then another scenario
where first I multiply

00:01:08.322 --> 00:01:10.718
the yellow and the
purple and multiply that

00:01:10.718 --> 00:01:13.451
times the orange and if
these two products based on

00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:17.232
how I, which ones I do
first come out the same then

00:01:17.232 --> 00:01:20.282
I've just shown that at least
for three 2 by 2 matrices,

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:24.109
that matrix multiplication is associative.

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:25.968
If we already seen that
it's not commutative,

00:01:25.968 --> 00:01:27.660
let's see whether it's associative.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.103
And actually I'll give
you the punchline, it is.

00:01:30.103 --> 00:01:31.534
But let's work through
it and I encourage you

00:01:31.534 --> 00:01:32.874
to actually pause the video yourself ,

00:01:32.874 --> 00:01:34.769
and try to work through
it with these letters

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:38.236
and then see if you got
the result that I just said

00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:39.890
that you should be getting.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.845
Alright, so let's
multiply these first two.

00:01:42.845 --> 00:01:46.499
So this product, I'm gonna
make it a little bit big.

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:58.160
So it's going to be AE + BG, then AF + BH,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:05.037
and then it's going to be CE + DG,

00:02:05.037 --> 00:02:11.002
and then finally it's gonna be CF + DH.

00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:14.346
And we're going to multiply
it times the matrix

00:02:14.346 --> 00:02:22.062
the matrix, I, J, K, and L
and what does this give us?

00:02:22.062 --> 00:02:25.552
And I'll just give us some
space to do this with.

00:02:25.552 --> 00:02:28.883
So this will give us, let
me give myself an ample

00:02:28.883 --> 00:02:31.455
amount of space, so it's
going to be this stuff,

00:02:31.455 --> 00:02:35.997
times I, so we could write this as I,

00:02:35.997 --> 00:02:38.410
actually let me just distribute the I.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:51.198
IAE + IBG + this stuff
times K, + KAF + KBH.

00:02:51.198 --> 00:02:53.280
I'm already gonna run out of space here,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.914
so let me clear this,
let me just keep going.

00:02:57.914 --> 00:03:00.419
And then we're gonna
multiply this, essentially,

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.558
we're going to consider
this row and this column.

00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:05.558
First row, second column
and so you are going

00:03:05.558 --> 00:03:22.990
to have JAE + JBG + LAF + LBH so,

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.627
these matrices are bigger
than I expected they would be.

00:03:25.627 --> 00:03:28.055
And then you're going to
have over here you're going

00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:30.783
to have this times this
plus this times this.

00:03:30.783 --> 00:03:40.995
So ICE + IDG + KCF + KDH and then finally,

00:03:40.995 --> 00:03:43.265
this times this plus this plus this,

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:46.203
or this times that plus this times that.

00:03:46.203 --> 00:03:58.718
So JCE + JDG + LCF + LDH, alright.

00:03:58.718 --> 00:04:01.252
Now see if we can power
through this one over here.

00:04:01.252 --> 00:04:04.270
So what is this product going to be?

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.359
This product if I multiply
by these two first.

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:18.052
It's going to be EI +
FK + EJ, no not plus,

00:04:18.052 --> 00:04:26.382
this is the next entry, EJ + FL,

00:04:26.382 --> 00:04:40.683
Then we have GI + HK and
then finally we have GJ + HL.

00:04:40.683 --> 00:04:44.067
Then it's all going to
be multiplied times ABCD.

00:04:44.067 --> 00:04:50.519
A, B, C, and D, and I'm going
to need some real estate

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:54.906
to do this, so let me do it
down here, I'll do it in green.

00:04:54.906 --> 00:04:58.239
So let me do a little arrow to
show, or actually I can just

00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:01.101
scroll over a little bit, that
actually might work out better.

00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:05.530
So what am I going to
get, so A times this,

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:19.438
plus B times this, so
AEI + AFK + BGI + BHK,

00:05:19.438 --> 00:05:22.220
then you're going to have
this row and this column,

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:39.298
So it's AEJ + AFL + BGJ +
BHL, close the brackets,

00:05:39.298 --> 00:05:42.672
now you're going to have C
times this plus D times this.

00:05:42.672 --> 00:05:53.495
So CEI + CFK + DGI + DHK and then finally,

00:05:53.495 --> 00:05:57.354
home stretch, C times
that plus D times this.

00:05:57.354 --> 00:06:06.596
So CEJ + CFL, and then
you're going to have,

00:06:06.596 --> 00:06:18.106
+ DGJ + DHL, now are these
two things equivalent?

00:06:18.106 --> 00:06:20.197
Well let's look at entry by entry.

00:06:20.197 --> 00:06:25.161
So, IAE, this is equivalent to AEI.

00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:28.247
Because we know scalar
multiplication is commutative,

00:06:28.247 --> 00:06:35.205
Now IBJ or IBG, you see it
there and you see it there,

00:06:35.205 --> 00:06:42.813
KAF, you see it there and
this is the same thing as AFK.

00:06:42.813 --> 00:06:47.573
And then KBH, this is
the same thing as BHK.

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:49.926
And you can go entry by entry, actually,

00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:52.779
let's just do that, I'll do
that really fast, so let's do,

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:56.732
so ICE is the same thing as CEI.

00:06:56.732 --> 00:06:59.497
IDG is the same thing as DGI.

00:06:59.497 --> 00:07:03.189
KCF is the same thing as CFK,

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:05.788
KDH is the same thing as DHK,

00:07:05.788 --> 00:07:08.015
and we go to the second columns,

00:07:08.015 --> 00:07:15.711
JAE, AEJ, JBG is the same thing as BGJ

00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:19.722
LAF is the same thing as AFL,

00:07:19.722 --> 00:07:23.016
And LBH is the same thing as BHL

00:07:23.016 --> 00:07:28.005
and then finally JCE is
the same thing as CEJ

00:07:28.005 --> 00:07:32.087
JDG is the same thing as DGJ,

00:07:32.087 --> 00:07:37.327
LEF, LEF, or is that LCF?

00:07:37.327 --> 00:07:41.159
Let's see, LDH is this right over here,

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:45.020
And so this one must be an
LCF is the same thing as CFL.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.881
Is this one right over here
an LCF, let me make sure,

00:07:47.881 --> 00:07:50.890
Cause that would throw
a major monkey wrench

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.029
into the whole operation, so
this entry right over here,

00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:57.598
is going to be, we get
that from multiplying

00:07:57.598 --> 00:08:00.614
the second row times the second column

00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:07.712
and we're going to get, we get JCE + JDG

00:08:07.712 --> 00:08:11.794
and then we have LCF,
yeah that's LCF + LDH,

00:08:11.794 --> 00:08:14.478
and so [you will] see
that these two quantities

00:08:14.478 --> 00:08:16.586
are the same it doesn't
matter if I multiply

00:08:16.586 --> 00:08:19.259
the first two first and
then multiply by the third.

00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:21.206
Or multiply the second and
third and then multiply

00:08:21.206 --> 00:08:23.174
by the first, now once again,

00:08:23.174 --> 00:08:25.518
this is the associative
property, I'm keeping them

00:08:25.518 --> 00:08:27.257
essentially in the same order.

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:31.796
Order matters, but as we
see, we can associate these.

00:08:31.796 --> 00:08:33.133
We can do the first two first

00:08:33.133 --> 23:59:59.999
or we can do the second two first.
