00:00:07.092 --> 00:00:10.192
Are you as good at things 
as you think you are?

00:00:10.192 --> 00:00:13.902
How good are you at managing money?

00:00:13.902 --> 00:00:16.732
What about reading people's emotions?

00:00:16.732 --> 00:00:20.172
How healthy are you 
compared to other people you know?

00:00:20.172 --> 00:00:23.114
Are you better than average at grammar?

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:24.701
Knowing how competent we are

00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:27.993
and how are skill stack up 
against other people's

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:30.172
is more than a self-esteem boost.

00:00:30.172 --> 00:00:34.714
It helps us figure out when we can forge
ahead on our own decisions and instincts

00:00:34.714 --> 00:00:39.393
and when we need, instead, 
to seek out advice.

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:42.705
But psychological research suggests
that we're not very good

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:45.664
at evaluating ourselves accurately.

00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:50.001
In fact, we frequently overestimate
our own abilities.

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.293
Researchers have a name 
for this phenomena,

00:00:52.293 --> 00:00:55.626
the Dunning-Kruger effect.

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:58.204
This effect explains 
why more than 100 studies

00:00:58.204 --> 00:01:02.465
have shown that people display 
illusory superiority.

00:01:02.465 --> 00:01:04.544
We judge ourselves as better than others

00:01:04.544 --> 00:01:08.134
to a degree that violates 
the laws of math.

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:12.665
When software engineers at two companies
were asked to rate their performance,

00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:17.637
32% of the engineers at one company
and 42% at the other

00:01:17.637 --> 00:01:21.224
put themselves in the top 5%.

00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:25.195
In another study, 88% of American drivers

00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:29.465
described themselves 
as having above average driving skills.

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:31.606
These aren't isolated findings.

00:01:31.606 --> 00:01:34.945
On average, people tend to rate
themselves better than most

00:01:34.945 --> 00:01:42.095
in disciplines ranging from health,
leadership skills, ethics, and beyond.

00:01:42.095 --> 00:01:45.756
What's particularly interesting
is that those with the least ability

00:01:45.756 --> 00:01:50.636
are often the most likely to overrate
their skills to the greatest extent.

00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:53.367
People measurably poor 
at logical reasoning,

00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:54.070
grammar,

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.117
financial knowledge,

00:01:55.117 --> 00:01:55.983
math,

00:01:55.983 --> 00:01:57.361
emotional intelligence,

00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:59.357
running medical lab tests,

00:01:59.357 --> 00:02:00.637
and chess

00:02:00.637 --> 00:02:08.238
all tend to rate their expertise almost
as favorably as actual experts do.

00:02:08.238 --> 00:02:11.397
So who's most vulnerable to this delusion?

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:15.718
Sadly, all of us because we all have
pockets of incompetence

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:18.638
we don't recognize.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:19.820
But why?

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.719
When psychologists Dunning and Kruger
first described the effect in 1999,

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.873
they argued that people lacking
knowledge and skill in particular areas

00:02:28.873 --> 00:02:31.329
suffer a double curse.

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.148
First, they make mistakes
and reach poor decisions.

00:02:35.148 --> 00:02:40.581
But second, those same knowledge gaps also
prevent them from catching their errors.

00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:44.449
In other words, poor performers lack
the very expertise needed

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:47.419
to recognize how badly they're doing.

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.419
For example, when the researchers studied

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.979
participants in 
a college debate tournament,

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:55.569
the bottom 25% of teams 
in preliminary rounds

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.623
lost nearly four 
out of every five matches.

00:02:59.623 --> 00:03:03.229
But they thought they were winning
almost 60%.

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:06.001
WIthout a strong grasp 
of the rules of debate,

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:09.550
the students simply couldn't recognize
when or how often

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.491
their arguments broke down.

00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:17.440
The Dunning-Kruger effect isn't a question
of ego blinding us to our weaknesses.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.541
People usually do admit their deficits
once they can spot them.

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:25.651
In one study, students who had initially
done badly on a logic quiz

00:03:25.651 --> 00:03:28.040
and then took a mini course on logic

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.081
were quite willing to label
their original performances as awful.

00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:38.071
That may be why people with a moderate
amount of experience or expertise

00:03:38.071 --> 00:03:41.291
often have less confidence
in their abilities.

00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:44.691
They know enough to know that 
there's a lot they don't know.

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:49.241
Meanwhile, experts tend to be aware
of just how knowledgeable they are.

00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:51.201
But they often make a different mistake:

00:03:51.201 --> 00:03:56.432
they assume that everyone else 
is knowledgeable, too.

00:03:56.432 --> 00:04:00.083
The result is that people, 
whether they're inept or highly skilled,

00:04:00.083 --> 00:04:04.352
are often caught in a bubble
of inaccurate self-perception.

00:04:04.352 --> 00:04:07.673
When they're unskilled, 
they can't see their own faults.

00:04:07.673 --> 00:04:09.461
When they're exceptionally competent,

00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:14.303
they don't perceive how unusual 
their abilities are.

00:04:14.303 --> 00:04:18.493
So if the Dunning-Kruger effect 
is invisible to those experiencing it,

00:04:18.493 --> 00:04:24.873
what can you do to find out how good
you actually are at various things?

00:04:24.873 --> 00:04:27.524
First, ask for feedback from other people,

00:04:27.524 --> 00:04:30.584
and consider it, 
even if it's hard to hear.

00:04:30.584 --> 00:04:33.235
Second, and more important, keep learning.

00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:34.935
The more knowledgeable we become,

00:04:34.935 --> 00:04:40.454
the less likely we are to have
invisible holes in our competence.

00:04:40.454 --> 00:04:43.333
Perhaps it all boils down 
to that old proverb:

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:44.835
When arguing with a fool,

00:04:44.835 --> 00:04:49.115
first make sure the other person
isn't doing the same thing.
