KOH KIM: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:10.862
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:00:10.862 --> 00:00:11.820
KOH KIM: Wait a minute.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.800
Our audience probably can
only speak English, right?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.170
They're not on YouTube--
not like the YouTube guys

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.550
who can turn on auto-translate.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.790
So let's switch
to English, right?

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.990
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: OK.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.510
KOH KIM: All right.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.480
Hi everyone.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.060
Good morning.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.280
So my name is Koh Kim.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.620
I'm part of the Google Play
business development team

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.660
here in Mountain View,
focused in games.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.550
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: So
I'm Yoshi, based in Tokyo.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.352
I'm doing the Google
Play's apps and games.

00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:37.060
KOH KIM: Today, we're
here to talk to you

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.160
about how to go global
with Google Play.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.320
As you've known from yesterday's
many various announcements,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.220
Google Play is a really,
really big marketplace.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.000
And so this morning,
we're here to talk to you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.810
about how to take
advantage of that.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.930
But what are some of the
best practices and tips

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.130
to go to a lot of
those foreign markets?

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.150
So let's just get
a general idea.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.899
So how many of you have come
here from outside the US?

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:02.940
Wow, that's a lot of you.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.090
Asia?

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.187
Europe?

00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:07.270
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Cool.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.650
KOH KIM: South America?

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.490
Brazil?

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.990
Really?

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.281
Why are you here to begin with?

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:14.780
The world's biggest
sporting event

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.210
is happening in
Brazil right now.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.620
I just came from there.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.300
I don't even know why I'm here.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.540
But that's amazing.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.870
Thank you for being here today.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.015
I'm really excited
to have you here.

00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:27.390
So let's just take
a look at what

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.050
the current world of Google
Play looks like right now.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.250
Those marked in
green-- Google Play,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.150
people all over the
world from 190 countries

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.304
download and install apps on
Google Play every single day.

00:01:38.304 --> 00:01:39.720
Those marked in
green are actually

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.560
some of our largest markets
not only by install base

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.240
but also by revenue.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.614
And what's really cool is
that it's not just the US.

00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:49.030
I mean, there's markets all
over the world for many of you

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.209
probably in the countries
that you've come from.

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:53.250
And then we'll also talk
about a little bit later

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.980
what some of our fastest
growing markets are.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.380
So this is an example of some
of the most popular games

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.330
in the US on Google Play today.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.440
And developers from
all over the world

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.430
are actually finding success.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.680
Those marked in
blue are obviously

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.190
companies that are based outside
the US-- in Europe, actually--

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.090
and in Asia, the Asian companies
are also marked in red.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.810
So that's at least a third of
these-- a third of these titles

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.780
have come from developers
outside the US.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.180
So what does it take
to expand your business

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.720
outside of your domestic
market and into the US,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.602
or in some other markets today?

00:02:30.602 --> 00:02:31.893
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: All right.

00:02:31.893 --> 00:02:35.780
expect It's expected in
my home country, Japan.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.320
So possible you
go to the global,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.189
or go to the specific
countries, so first of all,

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.100
you need to know the users.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.100
What's the users' behaviors?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.210
So this is-- my country
is Tokyo from outside

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.050
of the Tokyo to the commute
to the center of Tokyo.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.390
So in the trains, in dealing
with people's commuting,

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.270
people, what are they doing is
they've got the [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.140
They're touching
their smartphones.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.490
And probably they're
playing games,

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.270
or probably they're
messaging on their phones.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.260
So understanding the users
is pretty important things

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.860
as possible.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.990
KOH KIM: So Yoshi, what's the
average time someone in Japan

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.910
spends commuting each day?

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.920
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
So average commute time

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.330
is like 60 minutes,
only one way,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.792
in the trains--
probably the same

00:03:38.792 --> 00:03:42.667
as from here, city, to
the Mountain View, right?

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:43.250
KOH KIM: Yeah.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.020
That's about it.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.500
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
You had a commute--

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.050
KOH KIM: Well, yes.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.830
I do have to commute.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.246
Sometimes it's an
hour and a half.

00:03:48.246 --> 00:03:49.330
But I'm driving, right?

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.242
So I can't necessarily drive
and play games at the same time.

00:03:53.242 --> 00:03:54.950
That probably wouldn't
work out too well.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.783
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
Totally different deal.

00:03:56.783 --> 00:04:01.040
In here, the commute
is drive or by car,

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.530
but in Asia it's taking
the trains in a commute.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.885
That's totally different, and
the users are different, too.

00:04:08.885 --> 00:04:10.010
KOH KIM: So think about it.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.380
Two hours a day, five days a
week-- that's 10 hours a week,

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.675
times a month, that's 40 hours.

00:04:14.675 --> 00:04:16.760
That's a lot to game
time just in a train.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.339
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Right.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.880
KOH KIM: So let's
take a look at some

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.491
of the most popular
games by market.

00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:22.990
Yoshi, you want to
talk a little bit

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.650
about what we see
in Korea and Japan?

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.700
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: So in
Asia, a pretty popular game

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.800
is the casual games.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.500
So cute, the animal titles,
and then casual or super

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.330
casual games.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.090
And then several
times, the people

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.080
are tending to playing--
some people are tending

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.420
to playing the hardcore games.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.030
And in Japan, it's more
like some game system

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.670
combined-- like casual game plus
casual game plus monetization

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.620
systems.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.166
We call like me
casual games in Japan.

00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:58.655
How about the Western countries?

00:04:58.655 --> 00:05:00.280
KOH KIM: Same in the
Western countries.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.270
So in the US, it's
pretty well diversified.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.450
I mean, people will play
a wide variety games,

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.270
from casual Match 3
all the way to some

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.910
of the more strategy,
simulation-- some of the farms

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.776
and building games and
a lot of that stuff.

00:05:12.776 --> 00:05:14.400
But if you look in
Europe-- especially,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.050
let's say, in Germany and
Russia where some of our biggest

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.160
markets are-- it's a little
bit more interesting.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.844
You definitely see more of that
military, that medieval-esque,

00:05:22.844 --> 00:05:24.760
really hardcore themes
that are coming around.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.350
Like in Germany, they're really
all about that medieval fantasy

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.470
themed games, a lot of deep
strategy that's involved,

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.010
which is pretty apparent.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.630
And then also, they love their
football simulation games.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.874
I've never seen so many
football simulation games

00:05:38.874 --> 00:05:40.540
in my life-- football,
soccer, depending

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.014
on which country in
the world you're from.

00:05:43.014 --> 00:05:44.430
If you look in
Russia, they really

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.290
like their tank games and
their army games and things.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.890
But that's what's
really interesting.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.390
If you look at a
lot of these games,

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.970
the same game play
elements pretty much

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.190
resonate across the board.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.040
You have a lot of RPG
elements, a lot of, let's say,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.012
building characters,
going on adventures.

00:06:00.012 --> 00:06:01.470
A lot of those
themes are the same.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.928
It's just the way
that they present

00:06:02.928 --> 00:06:05.960
it is a little bit different.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.790
So now that you have an
idea of what types of games

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.010
are popular in each of
these markets and especially

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.030
around the world,
do you have a game

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.320
that you think
can be successful?

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.470
And if so, what do
you need to change,

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.960
whether it's how do you present
that game to your audience

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.310
or do some changes so you
can be successful for all

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.790
of those markets?

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.350
It's really just pretty simple.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.020
We kind of break it
down to three things.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.800
First, it's really
about how do you

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.234
acquire those users
to begin with?

00:06:32.234 --> 00:06:33.650
How do you convince
them, hey, you

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.980
need to install my game
because it's awesome?

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.660
So we'll talk a
little bit about that.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.380
And then the second is how
do you connect with that user

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.780
when they first get into game?

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.800
What is that on boarding
experience like?

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.106
How do you get them
hooked to begin with?

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:48.480
And then finally,
it's how do you

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.110
get those players to come back?

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.980
How do you retain those
players beyond the first week,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.754
but actually turn them
into a lifetime player?

00:06:55.754 --> 00:06:57.170
So let's start
with the first one.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.211
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Mhm.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.900
KOH KIM: So this is an image
of what the Google Play

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.629
store looks like today on device
and also on the desktop web.

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:10.170
What are some of the things that
you notice-- the first thing

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.800
that a user is going to see?

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.420
Well, it's clearly
the icons, right?

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.560
So let's take a look at some of
the different icons by market.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.090
Do you notice some
slight differences just

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.970
from looking at
the US and versus,

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.750
let's say Asia, specifically?

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.650
Well, in the US, you actually
see a lot more realistic

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.680
character designs, and
also a mix of-- there's

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.330
male characters, there's
also monster characters.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.249
So they don't really latch
on to a different thing.

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:38.040
And then if you look
in Korea, for example,

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.140
it's actually a lot cuter.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.579
You see that more anime,
manga visual style elements.

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:44.620
And so they've really
focused on cute characters,

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.786
unless you're a sports game.

00:07:45.786 --> 00:07:48.240
That's probably a little
weird if you focused on that.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.650
But Yoshi, what is it
like in the rest of Asia?

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.350
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
So in Japan,

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.200
obviously the dragon is
pretty famous in there.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.540
So put the dragons in the icons
is pretty popular right now.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.030
It's the top
revenue-grossing chart.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.500
And also, one more
trending Japan

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.020
is some cute cat in the icons.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.820
It's also pretty
popular in Japan, too.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.730
And also in Taiwan,
as well as Hong Kong,

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:21.040
is the Three Kingdom story is
pretty popular theme in there.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.977
That's pretty popular.

00:08:21.977 --> 00:08:23.560
KOH KIM: Lot of Three
Kingdoms, right?

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:23.780
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Yeah.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.780
KOH KIM: Everyone likes
cats all over the world.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.541
It's just whether it looks like
a real cat or a cartoon cat,

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:29.040
right?

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.123
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Yeah.

00:08:30.123 --> 00:08:32.985
In Japan, everyone's using
a cat for the games themes.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.700
All right.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:44.140
So we're just talking
about the icons.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.430
Then usually after you see the
icons, what the user will see

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.850
is your game titles.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:55.120
So this is an example of the
Clash of Clans and Candy Crush,

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.350
how to get in to
the Japan market.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.910
So the original
game's name is Clash

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.950
of Clans in the
English versions.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.020
Then they changed to
the Japanese version

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.990
is-- they make it the Japanese
name of the Clash of Clans

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.790
plus the original names.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.240
That's what the [INAUDIBLE] did.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.180
And also, the Candy Crush
Saga is more tremendous

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.130
changing the Japan market.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.340
And then they changed it.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.250
The title's name is
the only Japanese.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.490
And also, they took off
the Saga from their titles

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.620
for the Japanese
market, because a saga

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:36.990
is pretty-- doesn't
make sense in Japanese.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.990
So they took the Saga.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.110
Then they called it Candy
Crush in Japanese only.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.300
That's what they said.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.620
So right now, the
title is pretty

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.462
important after the icons.

00:09:51.462 --> 00:09:53.170
KOH KIM: So after the
players take a look

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.379
at the icons and the titles--

00:09:54.379 --> 00:09:55.711
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Screenshot.

00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:58.010
KOH KIM: --the next thing
is a screenshot, right?

00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.910
If you think about the Google
Play store listing, that's

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.576
the next thing they're
going to look at.

00:10:01.576 --> 00:10:03.960
So this is an example
of a game in the US

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.370
of what screenshots
look like to US players.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.760
Visual style's a little
bit different in the West.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.676
It's definitely more
focused on the game play.

00:10:11.676 --> 00:10:12.820
It's really simple.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.720
It kind of shows-- it gives
the player a better idea

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.500
what the in-game experience
is going to look like,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.290
or what the inside
of the application

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.260
is going to look like.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.505
But meanwhile, in Japan--

00:10:23.505 --> 00:10:24.880
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
Here you go.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.900
Well, It's totally different
from the Western titles.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.355
The Asian title screenshot
is using more bright and many

00:10:33.355 --> 00:10:37.310
of the characters
[INAUDIBLE] and try

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:42.360
to make it more like-- not
only the game scenes, also the

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.720
[INAUDIBLE] providing
more what the user can

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.830
play in the world of the games.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.290
That's the important
things in Asia.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.920
And also, in the
Google Play, you

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.310
can change the screenshot,
also the icons,

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:02.490
and you can change it in
there for each country.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.320
So you provide
the-- probably they

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.520
tweak those screenshot
for Asian market

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.935
as well as the US market.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.680
KOH KIM: So now
you got an idea how

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.470
to create the best store
listing for your game

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.042
in order to get those users
to install those games.

00:11:23.042 --> 00:11:24.500
Now that you've
got them to install

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.791
your game, which is awesome,
let's go to the next step,

00:11:26.791 --> 00:11:31.239
is how do you get them hooked
onto your game to begin with?

00:11:31.239 --> 00:11:33.780
So in that sense-- well, even
before we even get to the game,

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.420
let's just talk about
mobile networks.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.020
It's really important
to understand

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.430
each of your local
markets, but especially

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.252
what their mobile infrastructure
is actually looking like.

00:11:42.252 --> 00:11:44.210
This is an example of
me-- I downloaded a game.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.426
It's called Ace
Fishing from Com2uS.

00:11:46.426 --> 00:11:48.300
And it's actually a
pretty good fishing game,

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.216
but some of these games
actually just requires

00:11:50.216 --> 00:11:51.500
a constant network connection.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.920
So you can imagine when I
was in Brazil, sometimes

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.600
with all that many
people, the connection

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.650
can be somewhat unreliable.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.920
I get this notice
that says, hey, we

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.600
don't see that your device
is connected to a network,

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.350
so we are not going to let
you play the game at all.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.790
So you can imagine a
user for the first time,

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.530
if they have no idea that
you need a constant network

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.271
connection in order
to play the game,

00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:17.770
you can tell it's
probably not going

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.630
to be a great user experience.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.010
And so we definitely
encourage you

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.130
to do either one of
two things-- first,

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.650
definitely note in your
description on your Google Play

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.190
store listing if your game does
require a network connection

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.340
in order to actually
play the game.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:37.920
And then second, if you have
a constantly connected network

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.920
game, one of the things
you may want to consider

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.270
is an offline mode or another
game mode or an app mode

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.570
so that a user can still
do things within the game.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:51.630
But as soon as they get to and
actually connect to a network,

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.715
then they can start continuing
that game experience.

00:12:54.715 --> 00:12:55.840
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Right.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.440
KOH KIM: So let's
talk about what

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.939
UI and navigation looks like.

00:12:58.939 --> 00:12:59.980
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Yes.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.620
This is the pretty
popular games in Japan.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.510
And I'd like to explain
about the UI stuff

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:09.700
and what's popular
in the Japan market.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.900
So this is the-- those two
titles, Puzzle &amp; Dragons

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.470
and [INAUDIBLE], which
is the number one

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.610
and number three in the
top gross revenue in Japan.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:27.120
And the important thing
is, as I explained

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:33.000
before, Japan has
the commute culture.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.870
So basically,
those game is plans

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:40.830
and making for the days
commute trains cultures,

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.960
which is more [INAUDIBLE] mode.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.540
And so as possible, they play on
[INAUDIBLE] mode for the game.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.650
And also they put
as many information

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.580
as much as possible
in the one screens.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:14:01.940
But it's pretty complicated
information in the one screen,

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:06.980
but the user is pretty easy to
navigate in the one screens.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.950
For example, the one
thumb fingers, then user

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.330
can do whatever they
want in the one screens.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.350
That's the important
things in Japan.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.679
How about the American style?

00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:20.970
KOH KIM: In the American style?

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:21.670
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
Western style.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.340
KOH KIM: The American style, you
can see a lot of games actually

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.730
have a landscape mode, mostly
because it looks prettier.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.355
Most people are used
to landscape mode.

00:14:30.355 --> 00:14:32.985
If you think about how people
have played games or interacted

00:14:32.985 --> 00:14:35.035
with applications to
begin with, mostly it

00:14:35.035 --> 00:14:36.910
was on TV or desktop screens.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.792
So that's clearly
landscape mode.

00:14:38.792 --> 00:14:41.250
But if you look at a lot of
the navigation and UI elements,

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.340
they definitely take a backseat
towards within the game play

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:49.860
experience-- a lot simpler,
a lot cleaner UI look.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.675
If you want to access certain
other game trees or profiles,

00:14:52.675 --> 00:14:54.410
you actually have
to go to that file.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.580
It opens up another
screen-- rather than,

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.740
let's say, in some
of the Asian games,

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.530
you can quickly go to different
parts of different modes,

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:05.240
different sections of the game
would just all in one screen.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.050
So it's a little bit different.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.625
That's just how-- if you
think about game play times,

00:15:10.625 --> 00:15:11.580
it make sense.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.500
People prefer the simple
and more cleaner looks.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.949
But let's also talk about
in-game localization.

00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:19.240
So we're going to go to an app.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.115
We're going to take a
break and go to an app.

00:15:21.115 --> 00:15:23.980
So I do you understand
you guys are here.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.590
If you're big soccer,
football fans,

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.950
I know there's the
US/Germany match going on.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.700
So I actually, before,
went to Brazil.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.581
I actually used
Duolingo to learn

00:15:33.581 --> 00:15:35.080
a little bit of
Brazilian-Portuguese

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.340
so that I wouldn't be completely
lost in that country trying

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.550
to find my way to that stadium.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.809
And so what was really
interesting is that Duolingo,

00:15:43.809 --> 00:15:45.350
it's a foreign
language learning app.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.100
And what they did
is that they made it

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.410
a very consistent experience,
but they made sure

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.130
when they localized
in-game for not only a US

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.570
user but also a German
user, that they're

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.980
using the right words, the
right font style, and everything

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.280
consistent across the board.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.420
So any US or German can actually
learn some Brazilian-Portuguese

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.310
before heading to the matches.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.150
So what's really cool about
Google Play is in the developer

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.080
console, it actually does
provide some localization tools

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.700
for you to get started.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.890
You can get professional
translations directly

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.890
through the APK
translation service.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.030
That's found in the
developer console.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.840
Or alternatively, you can
also use a translator toolkit

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.310
to upload your strings,
XMS files, XML files,

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.170
and a translation
engine can actually

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.340
create localized
versions of that file.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.260
So we do provide a
lot of tools in order

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.080
for you to get
started in localizing

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.350
a lot of those markets.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:39.140
And clearly, you can see, I
can either be a US or German

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.930
and then learn
Brazilian-Portuguese.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:45.585
So, next slide.

00:16:45.585 --> 00:16:48.300
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
In Asia, the line break

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:53.440
is pretty important
in the Asian market.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:58.410
So this is the example of the
line break, correct version

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.940
and the incorrect versions.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:06.540
So the above one in Japanese
is, [SPEAKING JAPANESE].

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.579
This is the correct version.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:16.390
And right side is how to look
like from the user perspective

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.210
is, nice to meet you.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.490
My, line break, name is Kim.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.500
It's pretty natural
in the above side.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.510
But an incorrect version
is [SPEAKING JAPANESE].

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.620
This looks like,
nice to meet you.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:38.530
My na, line break, me is Kim.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.190
So, from the user
perspective, this

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:46.220
is the-- I'm not using
the unnatural Japanese

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.700
or unnatural Asian
languages, is the user

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:56.650
feel like, OK, this game is
not customized for my country,

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.060
for my languages.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:03.380
Then user easy to
leave the games.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:10.130
So the retention is using
the right line break

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:14.040
in the game, is pretty
important thing.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.180
KOH KIM: But this also
applies to the West

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.850
as well, and vice versa.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.492
So if you think
about-- especially

00:18:19.492 --> 00:18:21.450
if you're trying to think
about your navigation

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.610
buttons and your menu buttons.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.470
Asian languages are a lot more
condensed language format,

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.440
versus, let's say,
a Western language.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.870
That can take a lot of room.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:33.130
So you want to be aware of
what your menus look like,

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.170
what your buttons
look like, and then

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.000
just the amount of text that
shows up within the screen.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.620
Because the last thing you want
is text to run over the button.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.190
It would look really weird,
regardless of whether you're

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.910
from Asia or the US.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.390
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: So we
recommended that you check in--

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.180
so after you finish the
translation localization,

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.230
then check in and
then they ask you

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.760
did you make the local
language the native speakers,

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:04.340
and then check in if it
looks like a native or not.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.320
All right, fun part.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.070
KOH KIM: Fun part.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.880
Let's talk about how you
actually retain and make money,

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.520
right?

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.811
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: All right.

00:19:10.811 --> 00:19:14.504
So in here, do you know
the Gotcha System in here?

00:19:14.504 --> 00:19:15.170
KOH KIM: Gotcha.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:15.592
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Gotcha.

00:19:15.592 --> 00:19:16.280
KOH KIM: Anyone?

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.280
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: OK.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.280
I hope.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.750
So I'd like to show you
how the Gotcha works

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:21.936
in the game in here.

00:19:21.936 --> 00:19:23.810
KOH KIM: So you're going
to turn on the demo?

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:24.260
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Yep.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.660
I'd like to do the demo.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:30.272
So in Asian games, especially
in Japan games, so--

00:19:30.272 --> 00:19:32.480
KOH KIM: You're going to
show everyone your password.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.150
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Yup.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:35.700
All right.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.380
So I'd like to show the
Puzzle &amp; Dragons demo in here.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.750
And I'd like to show them how
to work the Gotcha in the games.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:48.990
So Gotcha is get the chance
to get the strong icons

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.510
or strong characters
in the games.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:56.850
No, they're guaranteed to
get the icons in the games.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:59.800
That's a different part.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.709
Let's hit start.

00:20:02.709 --> 00:20:04.500
KOH KIM: So in other
words, it's a lottery.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.090
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Yeah.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:05.590
KOH KIM: OK.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.181
How many of you are familiar
with Puzzles &amp; Dragons?

00:20:13.181 --> 00:20:14.180
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: OK.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:14.888
KOH KIM: Oh good.

00:20:14.888 --> 00:20:17.320
OK.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.060
So just explaining
for those that are not

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.540
aware of Puzzles &amp;
Dragons, it's developed

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.660
by a Japanese developer, GungHo.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.130
It's a Match 3 RPG
game that I was saying.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:31.220
So Yoshi's going to show you
one of the common mechanics

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.250
that we use to get users
hooked into this game.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.840
You fight monsters in dungeons.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.590
You collect them and
you build them up.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:43.970
In order to get new monsters,
you have to go to this dragon

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.145
that offers-- so we
have gift cards--

00:20:46.145 --> 00:20:48.020
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: So
I have gift card here

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.700
for this during the discussion--

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:52.950
KOH KIM: Because we want some.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:54.991
Because in order to progress
through the dungeon,

00:20:54.991 --> 00:20:59.910
it's actually a lot easier
to have more powerful eggs.

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.630
What is this one?

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:03.490
How do you like it?

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:04.404
No?

00:21:04.404 --> 00:21:05.070
not good enough?

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.300
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
Not good enough.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.300
KOH KIM: It's not
good enough for him,

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.940
so we're going to try again.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.580
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Try again.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.170
So this is a special
collaboration

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:16.210
with the Japanese
famous anime in here.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.884
Eh, [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:18.884 --> 00:21:20.800
KOH KIM: That's still
not good enough for you?

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.534
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: It's--
I think it's not enough.

00:21:23.534 --> 00:21:25.682
Let me try one more.

00:21:25.682 --> 00:21:27.140
KOH KIM: He has
very high standards

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.490
for what types of
monsters he wants.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.839
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
I want a golden eggs.

00:21:32.839 --> 00:21:33.380
KOH KIM: Try.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:33.880
Nope.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.470
It's another silver.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.110
I don't think you're
going to get it.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.309
Try again?

00:21:38.309 --> 00:21:39.600
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Once more.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.030
KOH KIM: One more?

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:40.410
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: One more.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:40.560
KOH KIM: OK.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.059
One more?

00:21:41.059 --> 00:21:43.385
All right.

00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:44.840
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: One more.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:48.149
I think it feels like
I can get the gold--

00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:49.440
KOH KIM: Are you feeling lucky?

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.420
Here we go.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.830
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
Here you go.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:54.940
KOH KIM: Not a thing.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.530
I don't think it's
happening for you.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:58.030
One more?

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:58.440
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: One more.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:58.939
KOH KIM: OK.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.060
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: One more.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.543
This is the last
chance, hopefully.

00:22:03.543 --> 00:22:06.043
KOH KIM: Are you sure you have
enough credit in your account

00:22:06.043 --> 00:22:06.980
to do this?

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.100
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Uh, yes.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.555
This is the last.

00:22:10.555 --> 00:22:11.430
KOH KIM: Last chance?

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.940
All right.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.273
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Here we go.

00:22:13.273 --> 00:22:14.760
Oh.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.440
Silver.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.520
KOH KIM: I don't
think it's your day.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:16.996
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: OK.

00:22:16.996 --> 00:22:17.472
KOH KIM: OK.

00:22:17.472 --> 00:22:18.472
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: OK.

00:22:18.472 --> 00:22:21.390
KOH KIM: How much money
did you just spend?

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:26.770
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
$25 in three minutes.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.660
KOH KIM: In three minutes?

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.890
I wish I could make that
return in three minutes.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:32.348
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
Anyway, that's

00:22:32.348 --> 00:22:33.720
the Gotcha system in Japan.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.820
So it's not only-- this
kind of the Gotcha system

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.200
isn't only in this
system in Japan,

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.660
but the popular games
is making the decisions

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.770
to making the monetizations.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:51.780
And then they tweak
the game balance

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:56.480
with the what character
is in the games.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:00.930
So when they're
making the characters,

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:05.570
then they're thinking
about how to affect

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.460
those characters in the games.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:11.980
KOH KIM: So what
about in the West?

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.240
So in the West, it's a
little bit different.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.000
Free to play mechanics
are-- those games

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.014
are more focused on
gradual learning curves.

00:23:19.014 --> 00:23:21.180
So I remember when I first
played Puzzles &amp; Dragons.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:25.102
Within five minutes,
they were telling me,

00:23:25.102 --> 00:23:28.980
this is the dungeon system,
this is how do you get Match 3s.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.200
Also, if you want to get better
combos, you have to do this.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.980
And they kind of
smash everything

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.660
in within the first
three dungeons,

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.840
which is supposed to
be 5 to 10 minutes.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.691
So whereas in the West, a lot
of the games, especially a lot

00:23:40.691 --> 00:23:42.190
of these premium
games, they kind of

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:46.290
introduce these new features
and game modes very piecemeal.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:47.970
It's more gradual
learning curves.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.680
They want you to
experience, OK, get an idea,

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.950
once you understand,
oh, match three things.

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.900
Oh, if you match multiple
then you get a combo.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.120
And so it's a different
learning curve

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.290
in a lot of those
games in the West.

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:02.200
And also, a lot of
these common game

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.280
play mechanics that you see, and
especially what they monetize,

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.582
is not necessarily based
on the lottery system.

00:24:07.582 --> 00:24:09.540
Well, there's some basis
on the lottery system,

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.670
but the focus is mostly
more on building--

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:15.310
on building items and
characters and buildings

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.750
of permanent value.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.580
And so this is
actually a screenshot

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.940
of Tiny Dice Dungeon
from Kongregate.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.030
They focus-- one of their
best monetized mechanics

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.000
is actually building new dice.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.440
So this game is all about,
you get better dice in order

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.290
to get better attack rates,
so sort of like a lottery,

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.690
but not really.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.470
But what's interesting is that
you can build better dice so

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.400
that you have higher
chances of, let's say,

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.700
a certain elemental
damage attack or higher

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.530
critical damage
and a lot of stuff.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:47.645
But in order to get those dice,
you have to put in more money

00:24:47.645 --> 00:24:50.610
to get these different
shards in order

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:52.780
to create those
more powerful dice.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.930
And so this is actually what
a lot of premium currency

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.660
is focused on, and
especially the monetization

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.370
among Western
players, because they

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.860
want to give these players
something that they can keep

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:07.910
versus a chance of getting
something that can be valuable.

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.610
So two totally different things.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:11.650
Last thing.

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:12.520
Prices.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.210
And so we really
want to emphasize

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.320
during your research on prices.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.040
People, if you look at-- this is
the difference between dollars

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.154
and euros, and I
think even in Europe

00:25:22.154 --> 00:25:24.320
they don't use a lot of
nines anyway, but especially

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.580
in the US, a lot of
prices end with nines.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.500
I don't know why.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.420
There's a pricing
study on this if you're

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.970
really curious on why this is.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.430
But if you look
in Korea and Asia,

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:34.960
everything ends with zeros.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.170
So that's something
you want to check,

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:39.760
because if you have a price
that ends with a nine or even

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.530
any other digit, it's
going to look really

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:44.300
strange to any player
or any user that's

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.660
trying to purchase any items.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:46.900
They're going to
think something's

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.330
wrong with the game,
and so they're not

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:50.020
going to end up
purchasing to begin with.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.478
So what's great
about the developer

00:25:51.478 --> 00:25:54.210
console is that we do have
a currency conversion tool.

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:57.100
You can input your main--
whatever your primary currency

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.060
is-- and then you
can see how that

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.050
will convert in each
and every currency

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.640
where we actually
sell into that market.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.400
And so you can modify in a
lot of that for each market

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.151
as you want.

00:26:07.151 --> 00:26:08.650
But these are just
some of the tools

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:10.483
that we have available
in order to make sure

00:26:10.483 --> 00:26:12.940
that your game or
your application

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.777
is locally relevant
to that user.

00:26:14.777 --> 00:26:15.860
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Yeah.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.890
In your main
countries, you should

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:23.500
make sure they manually
put the price [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.950
in your games.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:29.050
That would be great
for the users as well.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:29.800
KOH KIM: Next one.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.310
So let's talk about
the last part,

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:33.389
is now that we've got
their players hooked

00:26:33.389 --> 00:26:34.930
within the game,
let's talk about how

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:38.860
do you get them to come
back, and keep coming back.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:43.230
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: So,
this is the Com2uS games,

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.480
which is the Korean
game, [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.070
in the Japan market.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:54.590
So what they are doing is they
are doing the user support

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:58.260
in the local languages
in Japan, which

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:04.340
is the user can comment whatever
about the games in the user

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:09.210
view, and the contacts get
the-- this is a good chance

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:15.330
to reply to the user's comment
and the support the users,

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.300
and then get more good
retention from the users.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.260
So this is a pretty
good example in Japan,

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.240
and what the outside of
the Japanese developers

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.870
are doing in the user support.

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:31.210
KOH KIM: And to know Com2uS
is actually a developer.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:32.540
They're based in Korea.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:35.120
And so they actually do
this for English as well.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.180
And so for a lot of
developers, coming in,

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.600
talking to, and speaking,
responding to your user

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.250
in their local language
makes it that much better,

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:43.640
and they respond a lot better.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.015
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
And the user

00:27:45.015 --> 00:27:48.350
is thinking about, oh,
these guys are supporting

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:52.850
in their local languages, and
then, OK, I can trust them.

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:56.130
And then they play
more in the game.

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:57.890
That's important things.

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:02.150
And next one, as the
little tweak point

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:06.300
is, but the notification is
an important thing as well.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:11.440
From the user perspective,
this is the [INAUDIBLE] portal.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:17.440
They don't forget to localize
the entire notification

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.260
in the notification bar.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:24.670
So the subject is in
Japanese in this example,

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:31.180
but still the text
is still in English.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:35.720
And the user realizes, oh,
this is not localized perfectly

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.960
in Japanese in the
local language.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:44.280
So this might be-- the user
will probably think about, OK,

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.570
should I leave the game
or should I stay in there.

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:53.490
But that's the point, is don't
forget everything's localized

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:55.424
in the notification as well.

00:28:55.424 --> 00:28:57.840
KOH KIM: This is true if you
have a content update, right?

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.440
You've worked so hard to
make all this new game

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.900
mode or new content,
and then if you finally

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.510
push to users-- but if
they don't understand

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.960
what you just pushed,
then it defeats the point.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.619
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
Something update, OK?

00:29:11.619 --> 00:29:12.410
KOH KIM: All right.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:15.320
Let's talk about
purchase patterns.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.610
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
So this is the one tip

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:22.180
for entering the Japanese
market and the Asian market.

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:27.780
So our deal is that we can see
the many monthly limited peak

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.990
in once in a month.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.630
So because--

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:31.770
KOH KIM: And why is that?

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:32.811
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Why?

00:29:32.811 --> 00:29:38.390
Because we provide several
form of payment methods

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:44.830
for the Japanese users, one, as
a credit card, two, as a gift

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:45.440
card.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.430
I showed you guys, and sort
as data carrier billing.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.570
And then Japanese
users are allowed

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.780
to use the data calibering.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:59.880
That's making it once in a
month their peak revenues.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.730
And the data carrier
billing has the limitation

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:12.130
of the users in the month, which
is that everyone is spending

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:16.230
the money in the month, and
then attaching the limitations.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:18.190
Then they cannot buy anymore.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:19.630
KOH KIM: So when
does it refresh?

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.213
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
So refresh timing

00:30:21.213 --> 00:30:23.970
is first of the
month in Japan time.

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:30.200
So after you refresh
the limitations,

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.990
then a user immediately
tried to buy the contents.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:38.990
Then the Japanese developer
knows about [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:41.130
Then they make it
a special event

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.390
for this target, once a month.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:45.560
So that's why.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.840
Users, once you buy
and the developers

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.190
providing the good contents
and the super layer contents

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:55.550
in the months, then
making big revenues

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:57.620
in the Japanese market.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.941
That's a little bit, the
tips for the Japanese market.

00:31:01.941 --> 00:31:03.690
KOH KIM: And this is
not in Japan as well.

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:06.520
I mean, a lot of other
markets, like Korea

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.310
and even some markets in
Southeast Asia, a lot of people

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:12.330
don't have credit
cards, or they don't

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:15.590
tend to use credit cards to make
purchases for digital items.

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:18.700
And so they'll actually use
their mobile phone or carrier

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.320
billing, or they use gift cards.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.230
So it's actually really
good to understand not only

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:26.870
how a user plays but actually
how they actually do purchases

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:27.370
online.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.170
Because they'll help you better
position a lot of your items

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.500
and a lot of your
monetization mechanics,

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:36.090
especially within
the game or app.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:39.234
So the thing is, is not only
is it important to understand

00:31:39.234 --> 00:31:41.150
purchase patterns, but
it's also to understand

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:43.130
what types of holidays
or seasonal content

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:44.570
you can do to
bring players back.

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.870
And so Valentine's
Day is clearly

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:50.410
a holiday that's celebrated
almost everywhere in the world.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.990
And so creating any
content based on that

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:54.990
is a great way to kind
of get users into game.

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:56.840
This is an example of Badland.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.000
They've made special
levels to include

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.150
more of the Valentine's
Day content.

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:04.060
And so it's a good way to
delight your users coming in.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:07.120
But then we can even talk
about super local stuff.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.670
So let's talk about in Japan.

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:11.130
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: In
Japan, so back to the school

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.230
season in the US is
September, right?

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:15.130
KOH KIM: Yep.

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:16.707
Late August, and September.

00:32:16.707 --> 00:32:18.540
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
That's the-- everyone's

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:22.360
making a campaign in their
games or in the applications

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.880
in the US market.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:28.000
But back to Asia,
back to the schools,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.320
the campaign is the--
actually happens in April.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:38.730
So everyone's making games or
campaigns in the end of March

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:40.090
through to April.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.030
That's a different thing
in the local market.

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:46.920
And also, I would like to
mention about the long holiday

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.660
stuff.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:51.210
And in Asia, for
example, the bottom one

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:57.820
is the Golden Week campaign in
Japan, which is the long spring

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:02.570
break in May, in Japan,
and as well as Korea.

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:06.830
And that thing is
the long vacation

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.360
is specific for the
Japan and Korea market,

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.910
and then we make
in the campaign--

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.120
the developers
make it a campaign.

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.770
That's the different
thing on the other side

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:18.140
of the Western market.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.340
KOH KIM: Being aware
of these seasons

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.390
is actually very
important by region.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:25.790
I mean, I was just in
Brazil, and if you push out--

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:27.290
and it's actually
technically winter

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:29.310
there because it's in
the southern hemisphere.

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:32.342
So if you actually push
out a summer-themed content

00:33:32.342 --> 00:33:34.300
like with beach volleyballs
and all that stuff,

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.383
it's not going to make
sense because it's actually

00:33:36.383 --> 00:33:38.230
in the fifties and
raining and dark.

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:39.010
So--

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:40.440
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Summer
campaign in the winter.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.640
KOH KIM: Summer
campaign in winter.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.950
Yeah, that's probably not
going to make too much sense.

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:46.910
So it's very important
to be aware of that,

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:50.440
especially understanding
where your users are

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.260
around the world.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.510
Make sure if you're going
to push out seasonal content

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:56.989
that it's definitely
relevant for that region.

00:33:56.989 --> 00:33:58.280
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: All right.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:06.090
So our next step is, so
I talk to other users

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:10.909
into the game is collaboration
with the well-known IP license.

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:14.750
So this is an example of
the Japanese game Puzzles

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:15.580
&amp; Dragons.

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:19.949
So they tried to make in
the-- tried to acquire

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:25.730
new users to use the famous
well-known IP collaborations.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:29.900
The right size is-- they
collaborate with Dragonball,

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:35.270
and then users can actually
play the Dragonballs characters

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:36.820
in a game.

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:42.610
They make many new users coming
back to Puzzles &amp; Dragons.

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:46.070
And left side is [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:48.920
They collaborate with
[INAUDIBLE] as well, and then

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.340
making some campaigns and
then special dungeon in there.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.590
And hopefully--

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:56.550
KOH KIM: --get more users.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:59.180
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: They
can get more users in there.

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.430
So collaborate with the
well known IP license

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:06.650
stuff is pretty good
way to acquire new users

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:09.580
in Japan market, and in
Korea market as well.

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.430
KOH KIM: So that IP
actually doesn't only

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:12.720
have to be fictional.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.990
They can actually be
real life as well.

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:20.550
And so in Korea there's a really
big celebrity K-pop culture.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:24.300
Actually, Nexon has decided to
do a special campaign with one

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.330
of the very popular K-pop
girls band called Girl's Day.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:30.590
And they decided to build
kind of like their almost

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:33.740
in-game-- they build
an in-game character

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.020
version of all the
Girl's Day characters

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.370
for one of their MMORPG games.

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.369
And so it's actually
pretty interesting.

00:35:40.369 --> 00:35:41.910
It's just like
getting more users in,

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:45.550
understanding that a lot
of the users in that region

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:46.650
really enjoy K-pop.

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:51.230
They really follow a lot
of those celebrities.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.660
And so having them
be able to purchase

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.660
and even get a
chance to even get

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:58.000
some of these characters in
their game or their arsenal

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.520
is very, very attractive to
a lot of these users as well.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.430
So it actually
doesn't stop here.

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:07.360
We've only talked
about this whole thing

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.155
about acquiring, engaging,
and entertaining a player.

00:36:10.155 --> 00:36:11.730
It's only a single player.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:13.410
So we're going to
talk about what

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:15.740
happens when you get a lot
of those players coming in

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.260
at once.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:20.105
And so you get some very
interesting trends and new game

00:36:20.105 --> 00:36:22.715
play mechanics that
emerge, once not only you

00:36:22.715 --> 00:36:25.940
get more powerful devices
and really reliable networks,

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.710
but then you have tons
and tons of players

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.277
that are playing games or
interacting with applications.

00:36:31.277 --> 00:36:33.360
So let's take a look at
what's happening in Japan.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.651
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: All right.

00:36:34.651 --> 00:36:37.730
So those two titles are getting
pretty popular in the Japan

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:38.390
market.

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:44.080
And what they are
doing is the location

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:48.160
based API plus
real-time match players.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:53.430
Real-time match player is
getting popular globally,

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:58.010
but those two
titles you can play

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:00.280
with real friends,
close friends.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.480
And you can choose--
the one title

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.810
is you can choose the close
friends or the network friends,

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:09.270
and the one title is
only for playing together

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.220
with new friends only.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:15.750
But the playing with a new
friend with real-time match

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:18.090
player is getting
popular right now.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:22.930
And also the right side is
Slingshot Braves by COLOPL

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:27.900
and they are doing the sandbox
in there on this second floors,

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:31.150
and then you can
ask the COLOPL what

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:33.010
are they doing in the games.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:36.290
And then you can play the
big screen games right now

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:38.330
in sandbox.

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.760
KOH KIM: So then when
devices get more powerful,

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.857
this kind of what happens.

00:37:41.857 --> 00:37:42.940
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Yeah.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.810
As I explained,
the Japanese games

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:49.660
is pretty casual games and
then casual games combined,

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:54.590
but it's getting more
and more hardcore games

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:57.950
getting popular as well.

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:59.950
This is not the PC online game.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:03.440
This is the game
for the Android,

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:08.320
and they provide by the
[INAUDIBLE] name is [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.640
and they're using the
[INAUDIBLE] engines.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:15.560
And then those kind of the
match player hardcore game

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:19.980
is getting popular in Asia,
not only Japan and not only

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:23.600
Korea, in some other
Asian market as well.

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:29.300
KOH KIM: But as mobile gamer,
as the audience expands,

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.490
especially when we have one
billion plus devices out there,

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:34.490
it actually kind of gives
you more opportunities

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:36.420
for different game
genres to come up.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:39.882
And so, for some reason,
a lot of these games--

00:38:39.882 --> 00:38:41.465
you'll see High
School Story, and this

00:38:41.465 --> 00:38:44.970
is Episode-- that are kind
of reinventing this genre.

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:48.850
And it's called slice-of-life
and the drama genre in games.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:52.080
If you can remember, dating Sims
are actually a very popular PC

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.040
game genre in Asia,
but they haven't really

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.310
gained a lot of
traction in the US

00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:59.170
with the exception of the Sims.

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:01.930
But you don't actually see a
lot of that in mobile games.

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:06.160
And so if you think about how--
almost half of our audience

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.189
is female, but then
a lot of these people

00:39:08.189 --> 00:39:10.230
are going to enjoy these
different types of games

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.320
genres.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.778
So it's a really
interesting to see

00:39:11.778 --> 00:39:14.015
what new types of
genes and applications

00:39:14.015 --> 00:39:17.280
there are outside of
their traditional action

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.980
RPG and a lot of that
hardcore elements

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:23.280
that are arising in
the market right now.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.030
And what's also interesting is
that because it's not just one

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.590
player, it's about many players
coming together and building

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:31.350
communities around their games,
you see really interesting,

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:33.770
I would say, not just game
play, but interactions

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:35.670
that are occurring
within the game.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.410
Quiz Up, which is
the game on the left,

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:41.315
they actually have a discussion
forum for all of their players

00:39:41.315 --> 00:39:43.690
that are happening online,
and all these players actually

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:46.850
come in and talk about
all the different topics,

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:50.850
about the quiz topics, and
they actually talk about,

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:53.829
let's say, physics
or their favorite TV

00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:54.870
shows and all that stuff.

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:57.328
And so it's very interesting
to see the types of engagement

00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:59.350
that happens just by
having a discussion

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:02.011
forum or a real-time chat
feature within the game.

00:40:02.011 --> 00:40:03.760
And then if you look
at High School Story,

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.960
they actually allow
you to connect

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.980
all of those in-game characters
with your real life friends.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.700
And so it actually brings
this extra personal touch.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.440
I mean, imagine re-imagining
the high school life

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.397
that you wanted
to lead, but then

00:40:17.397 --> 00:40:19.480
you can put in all of your
old high school friends

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.460
or some of the
other friends too.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.690
So it's a lot of fun--
a lot of small touches

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:26.090
that we're seeing to bring
your current environment

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.185
into the application itself.

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.570
So let's talk about some
new, awesome markets.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:36.980
So remember all this before,
and some of the cool markets

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.640
that we're seeing with
a lot of crazy growth?

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:40.550
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
Where's the next market?

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:42.258
KOH KIM: Where is the
next market, Yoshi?

00:40:42.258 --> 00:40:46.540
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: I think
you can see the point in there

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:50.347
in the pictures, which
is Southeast Asia, maybe?

00:40:50.347 --> 00:40:50.930
KOH KIM: Yeah.

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:51.690
Southeast Asia.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:54.555
So Hong Kong, Taiwan has been
rapidly growing really fast

00:40:54.555 --> 00:40:56.390
in both terms of revenue.

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:59.390
Southeast Asia-- so places
like Indonesia, Thailand,

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.840
India-- tons of
installs, a lot of users

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.970
coming in playing games.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:04.820
But what's also
interesting, Brazil as well.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.530
And so if you see a lot
of rapidly growing stuff,

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:09.720
it's just people are
getting-- smartphones

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.882
and mobile devices are actually
the first real computing

00:41:12.882 --> 00:41:14.090
device that they've ever had.

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:16.400
So it's really exciting
to see some of the growth

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.790
and some of the
opportunities that you

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:22.535
have to get into those markets.

00:41:22.535 --> 00:41:23.360
All right.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.900
So what's next?

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.450
There, we have a
developer panel regarding

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.010
on Google Play
games on services.

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.218
That's happening later today.

00:41:31.218 --> 00:41:32.670
That's hosted by Dan Galpin.

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:35.810
And later in the
afternoon, Greg Hartrell

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.960
will be presenting about where
he thinks Google Play games can

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.350
go towards the future.

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:42.605
And so definitely
check those talks out.

00:41:42.605 --> 00:41:44.980
Really interesting things,
really awesome people too, so,

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.460
that you should get to know.

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:51.260
So thank you for
coming here instead of

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.000
going to the US versus
Germany match, which

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.871
I am going to go to next.

00:41:55.871 --> 00:41:56.370
So--

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:57.740
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: You
can see the second part.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:58.900
KOH KIM: I can go
see the second half.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:01.066
But if anyone-- we have
three minutes for questions,

00:42:01.066 --> 00:42:03.570
so if you'd like to ask a
question, come up to the mic

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:05.979
and we'll be happy
to answer them.

00:42:05.979 --> 00:42:06.520
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.320
Can you please talk a
little bit about live events

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.310
in Japan, how has it been run--
like those live events that

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:17.730
happen every day for a few hours
and give some rewards, which

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:19.380
is kind of a recent
trend, I guess.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:20.755
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
So, you mean

00:42:20.755 --> 00:42:22.650
the live event in the games?

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:25.460
How many games in the
live event in there?

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.590
So it depends on the games.

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:31.110
I see it several
games in my work.

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:40.800
And I saw the famous games
has like 20 or 24 live event

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.690
in the once time.

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:45.750
And then they have a two
week event, a one week event,

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:48.630
and the special event
is only one day.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:53.170
That's Japanese famous titles.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:56.510
AUDIENCE: Are there any
two hour, four hour events?

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:59.705
So twice a day, maybe,
or something like that?

00:42:59.705 --> 00:43:01.330
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
Four, eight hours.

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:02.959
KOH KIM: It depends.

00:43:02.959 --> 00:43:04.500
It depends-- I think
Puzzle &amp; Dragon,

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.000
they do something
during lunch time.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.080
But it also depends on the game.

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:10.650
I mean, what a lot of these
game developers in, let's say,

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:12.090
Korea, Japan, all
they do, they'll

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:15.310
analyze-- they'll take all
of their player behavior data

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:17.680
and see where the
most engagement occurs

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.250
within certain time periods.

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:21.200
So it's actually
very common to see

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.430
most of the sophisticated game
developers, what they would do

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:26.600
is they would identify
where, let's say,

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.215
during commuting times or
maybe during lunch hour,

00:43:29.215 --> 00:43:31.340
or maybe on a single day
they'd be like, hey, we're

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.950
going to do a live
event that's only

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:35.850
going to happen within
this four hours.

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:37.340
You're going to
get certain items,

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.370
or maybe certain drops
are going to happen,

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:41.200
that are going to be
more common than that.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.283
That's going to be useful.

00:43:42.283 --> 00:43:45.840
So it's their way to change
the balancing within the game

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.520
too, so they can encourage
different behaviors

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.640
or different types of items
and a lot [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.931
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: And
those are the-- too much short

00:43:52.931 --> 00:43:56.530
timing, you have to figure
out the [INAUDIBLE] as well.

00:43:56.530 --> 00:44:00.130
So once in the only two
hours, the event, then

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:05.380
everyone's coming in to
[INAUDIBLE] in two hours, which

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:13.700
is, [INAUDIBLE] is getting
cloudy and getting problems.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.700
So recently there's
some Puzzles &amp; Dragons

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:19.197
and some famous titles
doing a release update.

00:44:19.197 --> 00:44:19.780
KOH KIM: Yeah.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.910
Because it's hard
to balance that.

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:24.670
And also, play game services,
we have quests, too.

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:27.920
So it allows you to build those
types of events on the fly

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:28.790
without [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:29.520
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:29.870
KOH KIM: Yeah, no problem.

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:31.161
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Thank you.

00:44:31.161 --> 00:44:33.134
KOH KIM: 30 seconds.

00:44:33.134 --> 00:44:34.800
AUDIENCE: If I'm in
a different country,

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:39.600
do I see a different play store
with different language there,

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.930
or is it just one play store?

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:42.600
KOH KIM: Are you on
device or on desktop web?

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.558
Because on device, it
will depend on your sim--

00:44:44.558 --> 00:44:47.520
it'll depend on where your
account has linked to,

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.200
in terms of where you
made your Google account.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.820
But on a desktop web, for
just accessing Google Play,

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:56.630
it'll just show whatever that
based on the IP address itself.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:57.240
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.830
And then you had mentioned
some translation services,

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:02.790
I'm assuming for like the
copy for the Play store,

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:06.700
and then also you said
uploading XML files

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:09.937
that you would use in your
app, does that cost money?

00:45:09.937 --> 00:45:11.520
KOH KIM: So if you
want to hire, let's

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.200
say, the professional
translation services, what

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.600
it does is we kind of help you
connect to those translators

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:18.960
to give you a quote.

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.760
In most cases,
there are, I would

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.530
say, a lot less than what
you're going to see if you did

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:27.287
go elsewhere outside of our
thing, because of the volume.

00:45:27.287 --> 00:45:28.120
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:28.580
Thanks.

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:29.121
KOH KIM: Yup.

00:45:29.121 --> 00:45:30.420
No problem.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.330
All right.

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:32.380
Are we good?

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:32.917
Thank you.

00:45:32.917 --> 00:45:34.250
If you have any more questions--

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:39.934
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:39.934 --> 00:45:40.975
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Yay.

00:45:40.975 --> 00:45:42.641
KOH KIM: If you have
any more questions,

00:45:42.641 --> 00:45:45.090
I'm going to go see
a match outside.
