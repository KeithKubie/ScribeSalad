[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.320
MALE SPEAKER: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.390
interesting developer community.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.460
has asked this question.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.120
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.225
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:15.500
answer show.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.945
So, if any of you out there
would like to ask questions--

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.650
STEVEN BAZYL: Hi, everyone.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.760
We're back for another Google
Developers Live, talking about

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.570
Google Drive.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.580
And today we're going
to do an app review

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.520
on ASTRO File Manager.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.410
I'm Steven Bazyl and--

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.450
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: I'm
Alain Vongsouvanh.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.140
STEVEN BAZYL: Yeah, so
this is a great app.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.210
This is one of the first
mobile applications to

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.040
actually launch on Drive.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.190
It's a file manager.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.050
It's been around for a while.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.130
They have, like I say, a lot
of users, tens of millions,

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.680
and just recently, maybe about
a week or two ago,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.420
launched Version 4.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.740
Now, it's a complete redesign
of the application and

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.940
includes things-- and not just
a redesign for the ICS and

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.550
Jelly Bean styles, --but also
support for cloud services,

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.740
including Google Drive
and Dropbox.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.140
We'll take a look at that
in just a moment.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.590
I do have to get here.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.320
I do want to show you the Play
Store entry for this

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.170
application here.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.530
And you can actually
just see some of--

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.630
these are the older screenshots
for the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.150
application.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.300
I'll just launch
a few of these.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.900
It was a good app.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.190
Again, very popular, but I just
want to give you a sense

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.690
for what the old style of the
application is before we jump

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.540
into the new one.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.180
So let's actually go
switch over here.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.336
We have it up.

00:01:45.336 --> 00:01:46.640
I do have to apologize.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.350
We are in landscape mode.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.240
This app does look a little
bit better in portrait.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.810
So if you do have a Jelly Bean
device, and you want to try it

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.300
out and explore it,
you could do that.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.860
But this is the landing page
for the application.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.240
A few features I want to point
out before we dive into the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.370
drive-specific functionality
and how they did this--

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.730
and we'll talk a little bit more
about Android development

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.180
for Drive as we go
through this.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.320
But in addition to having some
very high-level functionality

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.690
here for accessing your files
organized by type so you can

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.120
see documents, music, pictures,
videos, my files,

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.710
these are all just built-in
searches that will find all

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.470
the relevant files for you.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.580
And the cool thing is it will
actually do this across all

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.920
your different sources, whether
it's an SD card,

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.320
Google Drive, Dropbox, or any
other network location that it

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.760
happens to work with.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.120
It does also have some built-in
tools that make it a

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.710
little bit more powerful than
just a file manager.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.470
You can see card usage in terms
of utilization, what

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.920
directories and files are taking
up the most space, a

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.530
Task Killer.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.490
Not something that you need on
newer versions of Android so

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.200
much, but they're for people who
do want to go in and just

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.060
force-kill different things,
and, of course, an Application

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.310
Manager as well.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.120
And if you swipe in the other
direction, we can see all the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.110
different locations.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.760
We have our local storage.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.400
We can access network locations
over Wi-Fi, Drive

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.190
Dropbox, and again, these
built-in searches here.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.630
So, pretty useful.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.610
And I'm just going to click on
Music here, just to get the

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.820
basic idea of what
this looks like.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.700
You can see here it's finding
different audio clips that are

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.350
on my device.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.810
We can actually change this
into a different view.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.940
Thumbnails for music--
not very useful.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.710
Let's go back to here,
and how about

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.960
we'll do pictures instead.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.620
So Pictures is something
that works much

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.230
better in grid view.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.270
You can see the default
thumbnails here, but these

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.590
will fill in as it goes through
and scans those files.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.339
So most of these are actually
on my local device here.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:25.960
We can go over and look
at Google Drive

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.890
functionality directly.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.450
So I'm going to go, and I
actually have this hooked up

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.010
to my Gmail account.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.280
And we can see here, it's
going to start to load.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.690
It is a little slower
than accessing

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.040
an SD card, of course.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.790
That's to be expected.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.280
But you can see here, it's
actually already started to

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.300
load in the content.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.980
We have thumbnails for
different images.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.900
These are little characters I
made for a barbecue we're

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.240
having, PDF files, ZIP
files, images.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.330
Basically these are using-- you
can even see here for the

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.980
PDFs, we're actually getting the
thumbnail images as well.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.690
And these are basically images
that are generated

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.220
by the drive API.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.710
And wall thumbnails, many of
these images and documents as

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.540
possible, and they're just
taking advantage of that to

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.660
give a really nice presentation
here.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.530
Using the app is--

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.680
let's go find a nice
little Google duck.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:35.492
I think I have in here a
nice Drive demo folder.

00:05:35.492 --> 00:05:39.410
Let's see if I can
get to it here.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:50.630
And we should have
some ducks that--

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.260
let's try this one here.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.580
So you could open that file.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.880
And I think this is
a Google Doc.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.000
Or maybe it's not.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.455
How about My Resume?

00:06:04.455 --> 00:06:05.805
We'll use that as one.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.220
We may be running into a little
technical glitch here.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.690
One thing I do have to
warn you, this is a--

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.090
oh, this wasn't a Google
Doc either.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.250
It was actually just
a Word doc.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.140
So I actually just launched
the built-in

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.520
document viewer for this.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.710
I can go back.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.310
Basically what I did want to
find was a Google document.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.970
Basically what this will do-- in
the case of we know whether

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.600
it's a Google Doc or
a spreadsheet or a

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.330
presentation--

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:44.210
is actually launch that with the
built-in Google Drive app,

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.830
so very useful.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.520
And Alain, you had done a
presentation on integrating

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.994
Android apps with Google
Drive back at I/O.

00:06:53.994 --> 00:06:57.010
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH:
That's correct.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.920
STEVEN BAZYL: I know we've been
a little bit slow to get

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.520
out one of the services that
people have been waiting for,

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.630
the Google Play Services.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.330
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: Still
not launched yet.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.670
So Google Play Services has been
announced at Google I/O

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.260
and hopefully should be
available shortly.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.760
It's a new set of services that
will be coming to Android

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.220
devices starting from Froyo.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.600
And it will provide a set of
APIs that will make it easier

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.010
for developers to authorize web
application to get access

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.160
to some Google APIs, such
as Google Drive.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.165
So, right now, the only way to
get an access token-- well,

00:07:40.165 --> 00:07:42.860
there are two ways.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.160
The main one is using
Account Manager.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.590
But the token you get back is
not linked to any API project.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:55.150
So, because of that, the Drive
API has no way to know which

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.820
API project is requesting
access to which files.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.770
And the Drive API introduced
a new set of permissions.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.350
Like an app can only request
access to files that it has

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:11.220
access to or the user opened
with these applications.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.010
And because the Account Manager
doesn't let Google

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:20.020
Drive know which API project is
requesting access, the API

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.980
won't work when requesting and
an access token with the

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.630
Account Manager.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:30.980
So I believe what ASTRO is
currently doing is using the

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.299
old API, which is called the
Documents List API, I

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:36.679
guess Version 3.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:37.159
STEVEN BAZYL: Yeah.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.360
I believe so as well.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.429
And it does have some

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:42.864
disadvantages for mobile devices.

00:08:42.864 --> 00:08:47.530
So some of the features, like
partial retrievals so you can

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.660
be selective in terms of the
fields that you download, is

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.080
not available in that API.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.460
But it is in the Drive API.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.440
Actually, it's really important
for mobile apps in

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.240
terms of minimizing bandwidth
usage, so taking advantage of

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.830
things like gzip compression,
selective

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.620
retrieval of fields--

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.960
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH:
JSON metadata.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.720
STEVEN BAZYL: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.230
The JSON is just a lot more
compact to begin with.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:15.410
I'm really anxious to get them
onto the new API once those

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.890
Play Services are released.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.010
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH:
Yes, me, too.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:20.520
STEVEN BAZYL: But they
actually did

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.250
a really good job.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.350
The nice thing is that
the APIs are

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.090
functionally very similar.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.710
You have the same type of
metadata, access to the same

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.830
thumbnails, downloading files
is pretty much the same,

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.010
regardless of which API
you use to actually

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.390
search for the content.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.570
So it shouldn't be that
difficult of a

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.570
change for them to make.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.720
And again, something we're
really hoping to see once

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.970
those services are
fully available.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.890
A couple little features in
the app I want to show.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.640
Let's do--

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.290
so we can do long presses
on different things

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.430
here to bring up--

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:05.890
we can actually Copy
files, Move, Trash.

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.560
We can actually send these off
to other applications.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.475
And this is just using the
regular Android intent.

00:10:12.475 --> 00:10:16.304
We can actually send a Drive
file to Google Drive.

00:10:16.304 --> 00:10:18.620
I'm not sure what
that would do.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.290
But they also have properties.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.320
So you can see here the name,
path to the file, MIME types,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.290
and everything.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.230
So this is pretty useful.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.620
There are some things
that might be

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.100
useful for them to add.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.760
So one of the things that's
missing in here is you really

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.530
can't take advantage of Drive's
sharing features.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.830
So we have in the API the
ability to manage the ACL,

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:51.580
share the file with
users or groups.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.940
That is not something that
they've have exposed yet

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.810
through their UI, but it is
available in the native Drive

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.030
client for Android.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.660
I'm a little torn, personally,
as to whether or not I would

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.980
recommend them actually
recreating that feature.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:11.020
It is a lot of work to build
an ACL dialogue and pull in

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.550
Google contacts and the circles
from Plus, and all

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.600
those different sources
of information about

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.385
who to share with.

00:11:20.385 --> 00:11:25.240
One thing that'll be interesting
is, for example,

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.480
for web application, we have
a sharing dialogue that's

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.590
embeddable with JavaScript.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.120
I think it would actually be
kind of cool if we could do

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.650
something similar for
mobile applications.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.280
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: Yes, it's
like providing intent from the

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:41.870
Drive app to start the sharing
dialogue for a specific file.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.270
STEVEN BAZYL: Yeah, it seems
like that would be a really

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.540
great feature.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.870
I know when you did your
presentation, you talked a lot

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:52.740
about building viewers and
editors for Android.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.750
And it seems like that would
be something to have that

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.280
share dialogue embedded in that
mobile application, that

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.730
native application as you're
working on the file and as

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.560
you're thinking about who
to collaborate with.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.480
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH:
Yes, I agree.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:12.500
So many of you may not know, but
the Drive app on Android

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.980
has an open weave integration,
the same open weave flow we

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.730
have on Google Drive Web UI.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.580
So you can click on a file, and
if Drive doesn't know how

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:28.740
to open, it will prompt the user
with a dialogue showing

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.930
applications but can respond
to this intent.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.180
And this works the same way
as the Drive Web UI.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.620
So it will authorize the app to
get access to the file and

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.980
then open the app with either
the file ID, if they're

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.270
integrated with the intent,
or the content

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.490
directly as a blob.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.280
As Steve mentioned, it would be
nice for the Drive app to

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.420
also provide intent to be able
to share files from another

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.280
application, let another
application start the sharing

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.200
process for a specific file.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.560
STEVEN BAZYL: Yeah, definitely
something that would be a

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.440
great feature.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.120
And I think we'll have to file
a feature request on our side

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.770
to see that in there.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:21.020
Overall, I'm really happy
with this application.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.386
I mean, file managers are kind
of one of those things where--

00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:26.710
it's not something you
use every day.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.390
But since I've had ASTROs, since
I've been working with

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:33.752
these guys, I do find more and
more occasions to use them.

00:13:33.752 --> 00:13:38.920
They're particularly great when
using applications that

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.820
download files.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.830
I have files in my download
folder and my SD card.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.700
I want to move those
into Drive.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:50.570
I've actually used that on a
number of occasions already.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.960
A lot of times when I uninstall
applications, they

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.890
leave behind files.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.540
It's a great way to go back
and clean them up.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.910
So it's not an everyday utility,
but it's really,

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:00.710
really well done.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:04.070
I love the new version
of this application.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:08.060
And as mentioned earlier, it is
right now only available on

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.690
devices with Jelly Bean.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.430
And I do know they're planning
on rolling out

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.690
ICS in the near future.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:17.630
It is really new.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.640
There still are some
kinks in there.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.140
But I know the guys
working on this.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.730
They're hard at work making
this really just a really

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.720
awesome app.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.580
And there's not a lot of
features that I think are

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.950
missing other than things like
the drive sharing and other

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.470
features like that.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.490
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: Do
you know if they use

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.885
the revisions feature?

00:14:37.885 --> 00:14:42.500
Like can you get access to
another revision of a file?

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.350
STEVEN BAZYL: That's a
really good question.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:48.870
And I don't think so.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:55.490
Let's actually take a look
at this one here.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:15:01.120
So I know they have some Google
Drive functionality.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.370
These are your shortcuts.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:11.520
On Properties, it does
not look like it.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.680
And if it is there, it's
not necessarily

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.600
obvious how to get to.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.210
But yeah, that's actually
another really good

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.690
suggestion, is accessing
revisions.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.060
That would be something that's
very Drive specific, though.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:22.640
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH:
That's correct.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.080
STEVEN BAZYL: Although
Dropbox actually has

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.060
revisions as well.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:29.370
So for the file systems that
have it, that would actually

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.490
be a really, really cool
feature to add.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:38.060
Yeah, it's a really, really
well-done app.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:42.010
And again, one of the first
mobile apps that's really--

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:46.250
I mean, it's super deeply
integrated with Drive.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.820
In a lot of cases, you could use
this in lieu of the actual

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.490
native Drive app.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.480
If you happen to work on local
file system and cloud file

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.300
systems together, it gives you
a nice, unified interface for

00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.550
doing that.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:04.660
I'm trying to think.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.680
Any other suggestions you think
would be really useful

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.850
or features?

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.890
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: Well, I'm
thinking when the Google Play

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:14.030
Services launch, it will
be nice for them to

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.540
migrate to a Drive API.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:19.940
And I believe it will make
things a lot easier for them

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.250
for the long run.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:26.850
Like dealing with JSON metadata
instead of XML, using

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.440
the lightweight client libraries
we do provide for

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.420
Java and Android, a lot of
this would make a lot of

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.160
things a lot more easier
for them and for

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.830
developers in general.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:38.530
STEVEN BAZYL: Yeah,
definitely.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:42.400
And again, for the performance
improvements of just having a

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:48.770
lot smaller payloads is really
important for mobile devices.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:53.040
So I think a lot of developers
are looking forward to having

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.132
the Play Services out there.

00:16:55.132 --> 00:16:58.570
I know there is a ton of other
mobile developers we've been

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.050
chatting to about Drive,
and they're

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.800
anxious to get started.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.349
So, I think that's all
we have for this.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:10.569
Again, you can check out the
app, if you have a device with

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:11.400
Jelly Bean on it.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.560
You can just download it
from the Play Store.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.579
Give it a try with Drive
and Dropbox and just

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:18.790
stuff on your SD card.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:24.130
And if you like the app, give it
a review in the Play Store.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.500
I think it's really solid and
really enjoyed working with

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.778
these guys to make
it a great app.

00:17:30.778 --> 00:17:31.630
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: Great.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:32.060
STEVEN BAZYL: All right.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.536
We will be back on Tuesday,
is that right?

00:17:35.536 --> 00:17:36.230
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: On Monday.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.610
STEVEN BAZYL: Monday.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:37.610
Monday OK.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:38.060
So, yeah.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:38.850
Be back Monday.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.830
I don't know what the topic is,
but you can check out the

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:46.310
schedule on the Developers Live
site, and we'll make sure

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.045
that's updated for
Monday's topic.

00:17:49.045 --> 00:17:50.630
OK, thanks.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:51.480
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: Bye.
