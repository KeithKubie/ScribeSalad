00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.356
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.870
And all of you here are
in for a treat today.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.750
Sam Gralla, who I'm
very impressed with,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.900
is going to tell us about one
of the most amazing things

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.600
that science has
done in a long time.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.320
And that's the measurement
of gravity waves.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.680
And he will describe it to us,
and at the end of the evening

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.390
we'll have a quiz.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.810
But Sam is a theorist working
on gravitational physics

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.420
and relativistic astrophysics.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.560
He's interested in the
strongest gravitational

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.160
and electromagnetic
fields in the universe,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.410
which occur near black
holes and neutron stars.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.250
And you heard a little
bit about this last week.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.410
Sam applies techniques
from diverse communities,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.860
relativity, astrophysics,
particle physics

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.750
to study the physical
processes occurring

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.000
in these extreme environments.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.810
His PhD is from Chicago,
and his postdoctoral work

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.750
is from Maryland and Harvard.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.580
And we're really lucky to
have Sam as one of our faculty

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.120
members.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.511
Sam, where are you?

00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:17.439
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.550
Well, what a pleasure to be
here in this beautiful hall,

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.790
in this great university
in this wonderful city.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.320
I'm a newcomer to Tucson.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.430
I've been here less
than two years.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.490
So I thought I'd
start by telling you

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.720
the story of how I came to
the University of Arizona.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.387
When you're a young theoretical
physicist, you apply widely

00:01:46.387 --> 00:01:47.970
and you hope you get
some interviews--

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.460
which, fortunately, I did.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.430
Now, a job interview
for a professor job

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.800
is a little different from
a normal job interview.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.980
It's really more like 20
or 30 interviews right

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.020
after each other.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.800
You meet with
everybody-- professor

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.230
after professor, half
an hour meetings.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.080
You barely have time to pee.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.580
If you're lucky, in
the midst of all this

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.540
you get to meet with the dean.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.780
Now, I had a thing I did
with deans on job interviews.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.240
The first thing I would do
when I got in the dean's office

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.540
is I'd take out a book
and I'd start reading it.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.730
That would get the
conversation started, usually

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.300
with something like,
what are you doing?

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.250
And then I'd say, you
tell me one thing--

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.520
if you're in a vehicle
moving at the speed of light

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.342
and you turn on your
headlights, do they work?

00:02:36.342 --> 00:02:38.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.080
And Dean [INAUDIBLE]
said the U of A

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.420
was the only one who
did not immediately

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.690
throw me out of the room.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.430
OK, I made that one up.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.180
That's a recycled
Steven Wright joke.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.990
But the comedian Steven Wright
has his interviewee in his joke

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.770
ask a really deep question.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.820
You go at the
speed of light, you

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.170
turn on your headlights,
what happens?

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.270
This is a good question
for two reasons.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.191
First, it pushes us outside
of our comfort zone, right?

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.690
You think you kind
of know how light

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.880
works from living with
light all around you,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.957
but as soon as you ask a
question involving where

00:03:17.957 --> 00:03:19.540
you're moving like
the speed of light,

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.070
you get a little confused.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.260
Maybe you don't
understand light so well,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.690
because you're used to
not moving that fast.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.270
The second reason Steven
Wright's question is a good one

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.130
is because it's
reasonably precise.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.320
It's not some vague,
can you make light stop?

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.500
It's some pretty precise
sequence of actions.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.440
You get in your car, you
get up to light speed,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.600
and you pull the lever
that would normally

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.010
turn the lights on.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.850
What happens?

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:48.870
What happens?

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.900
These kinds of questions
that are reasonably precise

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.170
yet push us outside
our comfort zone

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.260
are called thought experiments.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.080
And Einstein really
was the pioneer

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.730
of the thought experiment.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.120
He called them gedanken
experiments in German.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.760
This is not exactly the
kind of thought experiment

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.610
Einstein did, but it's close.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.500
And the answer to this
particular conundrum

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.630
was given to us by Einstein.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.750
The answer is you
can't go that fast.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.558
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.080
Seems a little
unsatisfying, but wait.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.620
Einstein didn't mean your
car won't go that fast.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.060
That's not what he meant.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.340
He meant you just
can't go that fast,

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.490
nothing can go that fast--
not your car, not a truck,

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.250
not a motorcycle, not a
plane, not a spaceship,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.894
not an ambulance,
not a backhoe--

00:04:39.894 --> 00:04:42.060
we have lots of those in
my neighborhood right now--

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.494
not a garbage truck,
not a fire truck--

00:04:44.494 --> 00:04:46.410
I have a two-year-old,
he really likes trucks.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.570
He knows about suction
excavators and so forth.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.090
None of your favorite
desert animals

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.297
can go that fast--
coyotes, road runners.

00:04:53.297 --> 00:04:55.380
You know those wolf spiders
that seem like they're

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.640
going the speed of light?

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.410
Those ones can't go that fast.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.870
You can't hit a baseball
that fast, a hockey puck.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.770
No elementary particle can
be accelerated that fast--

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.300
absolutely nothing can
go the speed of light.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.560
That's what Einstein taught us.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.816
There's a universal speed limit.

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:18.552
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.770
Now, this speed limit
is not Einstein's limit

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.440
where he'll come give you
a ticket if you violate it.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.030
This is a law of nature.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.200
You simply cannot go this fast,
no matter how hard you try.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.310
That seems well and good.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.770
We have the authority of
Einstein to back it up.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.000
But if you were a physicist
around Einstein's time,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.800
you might say, hey,
wait a minute, mister.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.000
That doesn't make any sense,
because of the following.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.470
I don't know about
you guys, but I

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.660
have memories from
when I was a kid riding

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.880
in the backseat
of my car, parents

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.650
driving me on the freeway.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.810
You're watching the
scenery go by, and then

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.830
all of a sudden, whoosh,
a car whizzes by you.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.677
Of course, they're just driving
60 miles an hour or so too,

00:06:02.677 --> 00:06:04.510
but they're going in
the opposite direction.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.070
So to you, they're going
120 miles per hour.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.360
Then there's a formula,
v equals v1 plus v2,

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.990
that if you wanted to, will
tell you how to compute this.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.840
And it's really kind of
indisputable, this formula.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.220
What is speed?

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.700
It's how far you go
in how much time.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.870
So if the car up here on the
left is going 60 miles an hour,

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.920
and in an hour then he'll
be 60 miles to the right,

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.090
and the other car will
then in that same hour

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.270
be 60 miles to the
left, so in one hour

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.100
the relative distance
is 120 miles.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.610
So they're going
120 miles an hour--

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.320
seems obvious.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.240
The person who is
skeptical of Einstein

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.890
now says, well,
what if I'm going

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.590
at 75% the speed of light?

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.420
Now this obvious
formula tells me

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.060
that I measured the other
car, [WHOOSH] the one going

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.990
by me, moving at 150%
the speed of light,

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.910
which is supposed
to be impossible.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.240
So here's another
thought experiment

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.270
that seems to reveal
something self-contradictory

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.400
about this universal
speed limit.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.040
We now have a situation
that theoretical physics

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.270
calls a paradox.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.500
We have two laws that
we really believe,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.740
but they're incompatible.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.310
You can't have the
universal speed limit

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:30.250
and the formula v
equals v1 plus v2.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.950
If you were a lesser
physicist you might think,

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.800
OK, well we know v
is v1 plus v2 That's

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.980
utterly trivial and obvious,
so Einstein must be wrong.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.400
But if you're
Einstein, you think,

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.280
we don't really have any
good experimental evidence

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.650
that v equals v1
plus v2 when you're

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.720
moving near the speed of light.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.250
We've only done
those experiments

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.610
at 60 miles an hour, which
might as well be standing still

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.080
compared to light.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.680
So which of these do we keep
and which do we discard?

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.940
We keep the speed limit.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.790
It turns out, that
formula is wrong.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.660
Now, as Professor Dienes
emphasized in the first lecture

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.820
in this series,
if you were here,

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.010
physics doesn't discard laws .

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.340
We don't establish laws and
then find out they're false.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.490
Instead, we realize that
certain laws may not

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.330
apply as widely as
we thought they did.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.270
In this case, v equals
v1 plus v2 is perfectly

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.250
true at 60 miles an hour.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.650
But it is not true near
the speed of light.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.740
And Einstein derived
the correct law.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.289
It's now up there on your right.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:42.500
You don't have to worry
about the details in the law.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.480
The point is, it reduces to the
old law when you're going slow,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.540
and it's compatible with
the other law of nature.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.102
So we've resolved the paradox.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.870
So now, you're not going
to measure 150% lightspeed.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.120
If you did the measurement,
you would in fact

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.110
get 96% lightspeed.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.460
If you actually got
your Doppler radar,

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.430
this is what you would measure,
the other car moving relative

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.360
to you.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.250
So everything is
happy with the idea

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.520
that nothing can go faster
than the speed of light.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.270
So what have we learned?

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.940
Is it about cars?

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.870
Well, it would also
work for trucks--

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:25.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.534
--motorcycles, planes,
spaceships, ambulances,

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:30.700
backhoes, dump trucks, fire
trucks, wheel trenchers,

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.050
suction excavators.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.050
All of your favorite desert
animals would observe this law.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:38.050
All of your favorite balls,
if you played sports,

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.340
would observe this law.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.780
Elementary particles.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.010
It's true for everything.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.870
When you think about
it, it's not really

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.530
about the stuff of the universe.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:51.720
This law doesn't care if you're
a Gila monster or a backhoe.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.990
This law is about
something more fundamental.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:10:00.180
It's really about
space and time itself.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.680
Now, why do I say that?

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.950
Well, think about how
I argued a minute ago

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:11.160
that this original v equals
v1 plus v2 law was so obvious.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.900
I said, well, the
car up there is

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.219
going to be 60 miles to
your left after an hour,

00:10:16.219 --> 00:10:18.510
and the other car's going to
be 60 miles to your right.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.030
So they're 120 miles
apart in one hour--

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.750
120 miles an hour.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.060
That argument gives
a wrong conclusion.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.620
The only slop in
that argument are

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.600
the concepts of space
and time, the idea

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.940
that if one goes 60 this
way in an hour and the other

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.090
goes 60 that way in an
hour, they're now exactly

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.620
120 apart in exactly one hour.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.610
That seems obvious to us,
but that's not actually

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.620
the way space and time work.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.050
Einstein taught us
that you can't just

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:50.090
add space and time together in
the simple way that you think.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.770
The theme of our lecture
series is rethinking reality.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:53.810
And this was a big one.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.120
This was 1905,
special relativity.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.600
Einstein really rethought
reality in a big way.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.046
Let me ask you another question.

00:11:04.046 --> 00:11:08.600
If I have a feather and a
hammer and I let them go,

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.540
which hits the ground first?

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.915
Well, in this room, the
feather would float down

00:11:14.915 --> 00:11:17.750
and the hammer would go
wham and hit the floor,

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.180
maybe damage the stage.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.920
But if we did this
experiment on the moon,

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.650
where there's no air--

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.850
there's just gravity-- in fact,
the feather and the hammer

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.794
would fall at the same rate.

00:11:31.794 --> 00:11:33.460
Now, this is something
that has actually

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.600
been known about gravity
since the time of Galileo.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.930
But the Apollo astronauts
actually did this on the moon

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:40.860
to dramatize it.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.370
There is actually a video of
dropping a hammer and a feather

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.280
on the moon.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.610
So this dramatizes something
that's unfamiliar about gravity

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:54.410
but absolutely true-- that
gravity, like the other laws we

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:59.110
have been talking about, acts
on everything in the same way.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.692
Can you guess what I'm going
to put up on the screen now?

00:12:01.692 --> 00:12:02.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.880
That's right.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.130
I could drop a truck,
a motorcycle, a plane,

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.460
an ambulance, a backhoe, a
Gila monster, a bark scorpion,

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.690
and a wolf spider.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.140
They would hit the floor at the
same time if there were no air.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:20.220
Gravity acts in the
same way on everything.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.460
Now, here's Einstein's
perhaps greatest insight

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.285
in a life full of
great insights.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:32.210
Gravity, since it acts the
same way on everything,

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:36.060
is also somehow not about
the stuff it's acting on.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.890
It's more fundamental.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:43.910
It too is just about
space and time.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:48.530
Einstein had this idea,
and five minutes later it

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.390
was still an idea, and
10 minutes later it

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.680
was still an idea.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.110
And it took him
five or 10 years,

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:59.900
really, to flesh this idea out
and turn it into equations.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.780
And the very first thing he had
to do to flesh this idea out

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.610
was to start listening to
his mathematician friend

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.524
Hermann Minkowski, who had
been harping on him saying,

00:13:08.524 --> 00:13:10.940
no, no, no, time and space
aren't separate in your theory.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.180
In your theory, Einstein, you
should think of time and space

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.750
as spacetime.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.280
They need to go together.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.160
So Einstein got on board with
this idea that there should be

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.160
spacetime-- three dimensions
of space and one dimension

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.030
of time--

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.270
and that somehow, gravity
should just be spacetime.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.150
And through much hard
work, he hit on the idea

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:39.700
that what gravity is, is
the curvature of spacetime.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.090
Now, that's a kind of
weird set of words.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.040
Why would he say that?

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.260
Well, we all kind of
know what curvature

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.440
is for objects in space.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.450
The surface of the
earth is curved,

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:55.870
or I could take a piece of paper
and curve it in front of you.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.990
We'd all agree on
what curvature meant.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.212
And there are
mathematical equations

00:14:01.212 --> 00:14:02.920
that have been known
for a long time that

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.430
describe the curvature.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.590
What Einstein realized
was that if he

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.530
uses the same mathematical
equations that

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.760
describe curvature of
two-dimensional sheets of paper

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.390
to the four dimensions
of spacetime,

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.340
he gets a theory of gravity.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.760
And the equation is up
there on the top right.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.790
So this little cartoon up here
you've seen in other lectures

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.890
if you've been coming regularly.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.340
This flexible fabric you
see looks two-dimensional

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:37.890
on the board, on the screen,
but it's just an analogy.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.040
It's supposed to represent that
the four dimensions, all three

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.830
of space and time, are curved.

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.560
And what makes the
curvature is matter.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.590
So the big red blob in the
middle might be the Sun.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.700
The Sun makes spacetime
curve, and then the Earth

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.150
orbiting the Sun,
say that white dot,

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.040
just follows the straightest
possible trajectory

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.760
in this curved spacetime.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:08.470
And that makes it go around the
Sun, giving rise to gravity.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.450
Well, this was the hard part.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.560
Once Einstein had
these equations

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.140
he had done the hard part
and then the real fun begins.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.570
And at some level, the fun
hasn't stopped since he died.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.030
He and many others
after him, including me,

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.530
are working out the amazing
consequences of that equation

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.440
on the top right.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.030
And the consequence
I want to tell you

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:33.680
about today is called
gravitational waves.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.930
If you really buy
into the analogy,

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.580
it's actually almost
trivial that there

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.710
will be gravitational waves.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:44.150
Because if I wiggled that big
red mass in the middle there,

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.210
clearly the fabric
is going to wiggle.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:51.170
Waves are going to go
out, waves in gravity.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:54.710
And indeed, Einstein got
that equation in 1915.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:16:00.740
And in 1916, one year later,
he had gravitational waves.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.650
Another good analogy
for gravitational waves

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.990
is waves on a pond.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:09.320
I don't know about all of you,
but I don't float very well.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.360
So if I go out in a
pond and try to float,

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.460
I end up kind of
thrashing all around

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.010
and I look a little bit like
the gentleman in that picture.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:20.650
There's waves going
out all around me.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:24.130
Now, if it was a really big
pond-- maybe a huge lake--

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:28.510
and we're on shore and we can't
see the man thrashing around,

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:31.090
we might still be able
to learn that there

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.690
was some thrashing going
on, because back at shore

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.370
we would see some waves.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.860
So you have to imagine
a really still day

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.872
where the pond doesn't have
any waves on it at all.

00:16:41.872 --> 00:16:44.080
You're sitting on the shore,
then all of a sudden you

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.940
see some ripples come in.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.460
You might be able to
learn from those ripples--

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.180
you could put a bob in the
water to measure the ripples--

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.685
and you might be able to
learn that there was thrashing

00:16:54.685 --> 00:16:55.769
around going on out there.

00:16:55.769 --> 00:16:57.268
And if you're really
good, you might

00:16:57.268 --> 00:16:59.320
be able to tell certain
properties, like how

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.870
big the man was, how
hard he was thrashing,

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:06.030
what frequency, and so forth.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.599
That's really the basic
idea of gravitational waves,

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:16.270
except now, instead of a
pond, we have spacetime.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.210
So you have some thrashing
around in spacetime.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.730
Here we have a pair of
distant black holes--

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:22.960
more on that later.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.780
But they're thrashing
around in spacetime.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:30.700
And so gravitational waves
go out, and back on Earth

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.890
you can try to
measure these waves.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.660
Well, how do we do that?

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.410
This is physics.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.600
We clearly need lasers.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.870
That's how you do it.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.260
You build two machines--
one in Washington state,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.080
one in Louisiana--
with big lasers.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.000
I'm going to explain
that in a minute.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.140
But here's a movie, just to get
you oriented to the process.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.960
Two black holes orbit and merge.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.050
A burst of radiation goes
off across the universe.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:02.470
Maybe it encounters some other
civilizations on its journey,

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.780
millions or billions of years.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.030
Finally, the
gravitational radiation

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.290
reaches us here on Earth.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.990
So we'll zoom in
to Earth, and you

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.020
will see an absurdly
exaggerated movie

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.930
of what the waves do to Earth.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.210
They stretch and shrink it.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.630
They distort it tremendously
in this absurdly exaggerated

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:24.590
video.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:25.460
Here's the burst.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.745
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.910
And then the waves are
gone off on their journey

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.590
across the rest of the universe.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.610
Now, those waves were
made by black holes.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.680
But we don't need black
holes to make waves.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.850
I'm going to make
some waves right now.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:46.460
I am shaking my fist, and I'm
launching gravitational waves.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.340
I'm launching gravitational
waves to the back of the hall.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.070
I am launching them to
the people in the front.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.110
Can you feel the power,
the awesome power,

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.260
of the gravitational
waves washing over you?

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.370
I'm shaking harder.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.530
I've doubled the
strength of the waves.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.300
I am now changing the frequency.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.970
The waves are now in
resonance with the human gut.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.310
Soon you will feel
very nauseous,

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.310
and it will get very messy.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.986
Is anyone feeling nauseous?

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:14.766
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.000
Yeah.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.390
So it is true that moving
matter makes waves.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:25.100
Any motion of matter disturbs
spacetime, sends waves out.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.300
And it is true that
the gravitational waves

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.060
stretch and compress and
stretch and compress.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.310
This is among the many things
that Einstein calculated.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:37.790
This is what the waves
actually do to you.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:41.510
First you feel a little tall,
then you feel a little wide,

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:45.020
then you feel a
little tall and wide.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.470
And you were all in fact
getting stretched and compressed

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.930
by the awesome power of
my gravitational waves.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.380
But you didn't feel it.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.516
So why is that?

00:19:55.516 --> 00:19:56.890
Well, for the
answer, we're going

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:02.440
to turn to Einstein himself,
1916, who gave us this formula.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.900
You don't have to worry
about the details,

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.770
but let me explain
what the symbols mean.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.654
h on the left is the strain.

00:20:10.654 --> 00:20:12.570
The strain is the same
thing an engineer would

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.180
talk about the strain on a bar.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.840
It's a measure of how much
stretching or compressing

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.470
force.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:22.920
Here we're quoting the amount
of fractional stretching

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.790
or compressing if the bar didn't
have any internal resistance

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.580
to stretching, if it were
really just a free-floating blob

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.480
of particles and the
gravitational wave washed by.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.920
If this h on the left was 1/10,
then that free-floating blob

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:43.140
of particles would stretch and
compress by 1/10 of its length.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.050
So that's what age the
strain is on the left.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.600
And on the right, with this
i double dot and this D,

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.020
you have some measure of
how hard I'm shaking my fist

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:56.370
and how far away you are
from my shaking fist.

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:58.050
But the elephant
in the room here

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:03.300
is the number on this
slide, 10 to the minus 44.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.330
10 to the minus 44
is a number so small

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.670
I don't think it comes
up even in physics.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.740
I have never heard of
a number this small.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:15.420
This number is as if you
took an atomic nucleus

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.330
and you lined up atomic
nuclei all the way

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:19.740
across the visible universe.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.220
That would take about 10
to the 44 atomic nuclei.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.070
That number, that fractional
stretching and compressing,

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:30.480
is as if the whole universe
changed by an atomic nucleus.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.640
That is not a lot of
stretching and compressing.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.370
And so when Einstein
saw this, he surely

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:40.000
thought, well, that was a
nice theoretical point I made,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.250
but we are never
going to see these.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.470
This is far too small.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.110
This is just theoretical
physics, never

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.155
experimental physics.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.390
Everything changed when
neutron stars and black holes

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:59.540
were discovered in
the '60s and '70s.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.210
If you came last week
to hear Professor Ozel,

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:05.220
you learned a lot about
neutron stars and black holes.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.190
They're unimaginably
dense objects.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:11.240
A neutron star has
the mass of the Sun

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.990
in the size of Manhattan.

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:15.970
That makes the density
of a neutron star

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.520
the same as an atomic nucleus.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.150
It's like an atomic nucleus
the size of Manhattan.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:24.280
It's a totally bizarre object.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.990
But if you took two such atomic
nuclei the size of Manhattan

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:32.830
and you had them orbit each
other at 100 or 1,000 times

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:34.510
a second-- which they can do--

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:37.120
that's a pretty hard
fist shake, right?

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.120
That might make some
gravitational waves.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.710
That can turn that 10 to the
minus 44 into a whopping 10

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.190
to the minus 21.

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.998
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:53.770
10 to the minus 21 is also
an extremely small number.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.480
And if you're me, you give up.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.350
But if you are one of the
ingenious experimenters

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.400
and theorists who thought
up the experiments I'm

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:05.030
going to tell you about
next, you say, wait a minute.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.350
10 to the minus 21--

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:09.290
if I build a
kilometer-scale device,

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:12.320
that's distance changes of
less than a proton radius.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.160
But I think I might
be able to do that.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.620
And Ray Weiss at
MIT drew this sketch

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.740
on the bottom left in
an internal MIT journal,

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.900
and together with Ron
Drever, Kip Thorne,

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.570
and many, many other
important players,

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:30.580
they put together the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.620
Wave Observatory, LIGO.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.830
Now, it's a little glib
to do this in one slide

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:41.730
and say 40 years, a billion
dollars, and 1,000 scientists.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.700
So I want to take some
time to really emphasize

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.280
how amazing this project is.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.190
As I'm going to describe
in the rest of my lecture,

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:53.790
this experiment has made a real
breakthrough the likes of which

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:57.900
comes along in my opinion,
once every 100 years at most.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.850
This is a real breakthrough.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:03.210
And this experiment really
was 40 years in the making,

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.280
and the National
Science Foundation

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.080
and research
universities in the US

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.410
provided all the seed funding
for the initial prototypes.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:14.580
The NSF picked it up and
funded it starting in 1994.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.910
And over 20 years, they kept it
going over changes of Congress,

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.680
changes of
administration, changes

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.990
of NSF program director.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:26.280
Everybody had the vision to
see this risky but high-reward

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.180
project through.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.610
And we should be proud,
as American taxpayers,

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.340
that through our elected and
appointed representatives

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.780
we supported this project.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.070
So what is LIGO?

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:38.230
There's two LIGOs.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.300
There's one in Washington state.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.700
There's one in Louisiana.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.060
And you can kind of make out
that there's a lot of tubes.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.770
In those tubes are lasers.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:53.420
It's the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational Wave Observatory.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.500
Let me tell you why.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.742
This device is called a
Michelson interferometer.

00:24:58.742 --> 00:25:00.450
This is something that
here at the U of A

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.100
we teach our
undergraduate physics

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.050
majors in the second
year of their study.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:06.600
So it's not
something I can fully

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.340
explain in the
next three minutes,

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.630
but I can give you the gist.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:13.780
The basic idea is you
shine laser light out,

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.140
you split it up, and then it
bounces off mirrors and gets

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.220
recombined.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.550
And then as a wave wiggles those
mirrors, the amount of light

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:23.590
read out changes.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:27.460
The reason you can do this
is because light is a wave.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.400
Light has peaks and troughs.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.410
And when two beams
of light meet,

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:36.700
if those peaks and troughs line
up, then you get more light.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:37.690
It's brighter.

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.300
But if those peaks and
troughs anti-align,

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.970
as shown here on the
right of your screen,

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.080
you get no light at all.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.320
So whether the peaks and
troughs are aligned or not

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.440
is a very sensitive
function of the distance

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.660
the light has traveled
in this setup.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:57.050
And so as the wave comes through
and wiggles those mirrors,

00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.290
the peaks and troughs change
their alignment and the light

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:04.010
read out on the right of
your screen changes in time.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:07.190
That is the light that LIGO
actually measures in order

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:10.850
to measure the changes in
distance of the mirrors

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.620
as that gravitational
wave washes through.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.400
Here's LIGO in a
kind of CAD drawing.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.540
It's the same concept, but with
lots of bells and whistles.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.130
These tubes are in vacuum--

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.020
it's a very large vacuum--

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.910
and there's all
kinds of tricks they

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:31.390
play to increase the power
in the interferometer

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:36.040
and to isolate it
from sources of noise.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.100
That's really the hardest
part of this whole business.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.280
You're trying to
measure distance changes

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.920
of less than a proton diameter.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.190
How do you do that when
a truck could drive by

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:52.190
and wiggle your mirrors by way
more than a proton diameter,

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:53.570
or an earthquake could happen?

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.330
What do you do?

00:26:55.330 --> 00:27:00.050
You need to be isolated from
environmental noise somehow.

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.260
And the way they do
it is as follows.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.740
They have this amazing gizmo,
this four-stage pendulum,

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.680
which you see the
design for on the left

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.540
and some photos on the right.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.010
And this provides two
kinds of isolation.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:15.750
There's active and passive.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:19.080
Passive isolation is like the
shock absorbers in your car.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.609
When you drive over a bump, the
bump hits your car pretty hard.

00:27:22.609 --> 00:27:24.150
But you don't feel
much of that bump,

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:27.030
because there's springs in
your car that damp that out

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.890
and give you a smooth ride.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:32.260
They use that kind of
passive noise isolation.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:35.290
And they also use
active isolation,

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.990
which is like your
noise-cancelling headphones.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:39.790
When you put them on
and turn on the power,

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:43.120
they actively cancel out
incoming sound waves.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.090
Similarly, they actively
drive this system

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:50.020
to cancel out any incoming
vibrations in the ground

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.080
that it's attached to.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.990
Now, this talk has
a lot of eye candy,

00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:00.970
a lot of really nice
pictures, movies.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.950
But I have to tell
you, this is the slide

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:04.750
that still gives me goosebumps.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.270
I remember vividly,
almost a year ago

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:11.260
exactly, when this slide was
released in a press conference

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.480
at the National Science
Foundation, which I streamed

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.140
here at the U of A for students
and faculty and anyone who

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.190
was interested.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.790
And when I saw that
signal, I thought,

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:22.900
oh my gosh, that's a
gravitational wave.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.420
Now, for you, it
may not jump out

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.670
to be a gravitational
waves so obviously.

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:31.110
But let me explain to you why.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:34.050
But before I do that, the most
important thing about this plot

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:37.980
are those numbers on
the top left, GW150914.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.650
That is 2015, September 14--

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.120
my birthday.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.865
The gravitational waves
arrived on my birthday.

00:28:44.865 --> 00:28:46.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:50.550
Thank you, universe, for
that birthday present.

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:52.650
OK, that's only the
most important part

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:54.370
of that slide to me.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.820
To the rest of you, let
me take you through it.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.410
First, look at
the vertical axis.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:01.180
It says "strain."

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.480
That's that fractional
stretching and compressing,

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.610
and it says 10 to the minus 21.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.301
This is from the
scientific paper.

00:29:08.301 --> 00:29:08.800
They did it.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.570
They measured those
wiggles that you

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:14.560
see in red are changes in
distance of a part in 10

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:19.390
to the minus 21, less
than a proton diameter.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.000
The x-axis, the
horizontal axis, is time.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.329
Notice, all this happened over
just a fraction of a second.

00:29:26.329 --> 00:29:27.870
And now let's look
at the red signal.

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:31.290
The red signal is what the
device in Washington state

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:32.600
measured.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.370
That's the readout, which
represents the changes

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:37.242
in distance of the two mirrors.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.460
Is that a gravitational wave?

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.900
Is it a truck driving by?

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:43.900
Is it an earthquake?

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:44.670
How do we know?

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:49.500
Well, on the second slide, you
see that same data on the right

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.760
over-plotted with the data
from the other observatory

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.400
in Louisiana, all the
way across the US.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.740
And they line up perfectly.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:02.190
There's no way that this same
truck drove in front of Hanford

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:04.920
and drove in front of
Louisiana at exactly whatever

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.727
it is, three milliseconds
apart, the time

00:30:06.727 --> 00:30:09.060
for the gravitational wave
to come from one to the other

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.280
in exactly the same way.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.560
They did a bunch of fancy
statistical analysis

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:17.000
to put some numbers to say that,
yes, that's not what happened,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.600
and yes, that's really
a gravitational wave.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.540
But this is why
I knew right away

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.400
when they put it up
on screen that this

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.720
was a gravitational wave.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.750
This signal was so
loud that you didn't

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:30.420
have to do any of that
fancy statistical stuff.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:34.532
It just says, wow, gravitational
waves from outer space.

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:40.970
When we physicists try to
understand these signals,

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.770
we often convert them to sound.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.600
It's a quick way to
get all the information

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.250
about amplitude and frequency.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.700
So now I'm going to
play the sound for you,

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.867
and you're going to
hear a bit of a thump.

00:30:52.867 --> 00:30:54.450
That's what it sounds
like if you just

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:57.330
take the frequency of
the wave and convert it

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.910
to a sound wave at
the same frequency.

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:02.160
You're going to hear
that thump twice,

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.980
and then you're going
to hear the same sound

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.990
but upshifted into
a frequency range

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:10.020
where your ear is more
sensitive to the features.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:14.011
[SOUND PLAYS]

00:31:16.865 --> 00:31:17.448
Hear it again.

00:31:17.448 --> 00:31:21.376
[SOUND PLAYS]

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:26.000
So that little whoop--

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.770
we have a name for that.

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:29.110
We call it a chirp.

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.304
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:31.304 --> 00:31:33.470
That chirp's going to come
back in about 10 minutes,

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:34.766
so let's remember that name.

00:31:34.766 --> 00:31:36.890
Let me play it for you
again in case you missed it.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:39.440
Again, the first thing you
hear is a kind of thump.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.880
That's the actual signal.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.410
And you're going
to hear that twice.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.330
Then you're going to hear
an upshifted version,

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.329
then you're going to hear
the whole thing again.

00:31:46.329 --> 00:31:50.840
[SOUND PLAYS]

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.300
Those are the waves from
a binary black hole,

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:06.110
two black holes that merged
1.3 billion years ago,

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:08.600
1.3 billion light years away.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.450
The waves came all the
way across the universe,

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.520
they came to the
LIGO experiment,

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.731
and they made that sound.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.300
How do we know these are
actually merging black holes,

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.170
like I said?

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:25.140
Well, again, they did a lot
of fancy statistical analysis.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.630
But for this signal, it
was so loud they really

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:28.890
didn't have to.

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:32.760
Again, this is a snapshot
from the scientific paper.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.000
On the top line, you
see the same two plots

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.410
that I showed you before--

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:39.510
the data from one
interferometer on the left,

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:43.060
and the two stacked on top
of each other on the right.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.760
On the second line, you see
a theoretical prediction,

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.370
a calculation from
Einstein's equations

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:52.080
of what the waves look like
if two black holes merge.

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.080
And then what do you do?

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.490
You subtract the two.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:57.430
You subtract the prediction
from the model, and what's left

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:58.900
should just be noise.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.150
And that's on the bottom.

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:04.030
So you see right away
that, what is this?

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:07.180
It's the normal noise in the
interferometer plus a signal,

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.321
which is merging black holes.

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:15.620
Now, the way these theoretical
calculations are done

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.090
is by a supercomputer.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:20.840
We take the equations that
Einstein wrote down in 1915,

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.020
and we solve them on the
state-of-the-art super

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.440
computers.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.670
Here's a simulation
of the orbiting

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:31.140
and merging black holes of
the same size and distance

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.730
from each other
that was measured

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:35.340
by the LIGO experiment.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.530
Now, you see the black
blobs and the tracers.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:40.140
That's just to orient your
eye as to what's going on.

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:44.310
All the interesting information
is in the arrows and the colors

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.890
and the shape of the
sheet below them.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:50.950
That's representing the
curvature of spacetime.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:54.820
You'll see now the simulation
will slow way down near merger

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:58.300
so you can see just how
distorted spacetime is getting.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.450
It's like a storm in spacetime
as the black holes finally

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:04.960
merge, and there's really
some cusp-y sharp features.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.900
There's a burst of
radiation, and then the waves

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:11.520
are off on their journey
across the universe to LIGO.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.320
Here's another fun video.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.840
This is the question,
suppose we were actually

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.000
near these black holes
and we were watching them

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
in a spaceship.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.230
What would you see?

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:28.166
Well, mostly you'd see
the stars behind you.

00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:30.540
And you don't see any stars
from where the black hole is,

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:34.340
because all the light has been
swallowed up by the black hole.

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.800
But you also see a very
distorted pattern of stars,

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.500
because the black
holes bend light.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.920
So the stars don't look
like their actual positions.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.920
They look very distorted.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.500
And I think we'll just watch
the end of this beautiful movie

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.000
together.

00:34:59.834 --> 00:35:01.250
Let me tell you
what they actually

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:03.350
measured for this system.

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:05.750
It's not about just detecting
gravitational waves.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:07.970
It's also about doing
astrophysics, finding out

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:09.140
what's out there.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.210
So how heavy were
these black holes?

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.540
How big were they?

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:17.320
The larger black hole
was 36 solar masses,

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.050
meaning it had the
mass of 36 suns.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:23.830
So I've drawn 36 dots
to represent that.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:27.470
This was reported in
the scientific paper.

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:30.140
The other black hole
was slightly smaller.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.790
It had the mass of 29 suns.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:35.620
And then they also
measured the mass

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:40.090
of the final merged black
hole, which was 62 suns.

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:41.600
So everything hangs together.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.955
If you take 36 and you
add 29, you get 62.

00:35:45.955 --> 00:35:46.913
It's simple arithmetic.

00:35:46.913 --> 00:35:48.998
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:53.440
Wow, you guys are
good at arithmetic.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:58.180
Yeah, 36 plus 29 is not 62.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.880
It's 65.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.940
What happened to those
three suns of mass?

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:05.890
Where did they go?

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:10.600
Believe it or not, all of
those three suns of mass,

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.030
the weight of three
suns, was radiated away

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:17.540
in pure energy carried by
those gravitational waves.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.720
This is e equals
mc squared energy,

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.000
Einstein's other equation.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.990
Right?

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:25.290
Except if you think about the
normal way we use e equals

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:28.020
mc squared energy-- you know,
something really impressive,

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:31.020
like atomic weaponry--
atomic weaponry releases

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.750
some tiny fraction
of the e equals mc

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:37.800
squared energy inside
your warhead, which

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.990
is not the mass of the sun.

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:42.600
Here you're releasing
all of the e equals mc

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.760
squared energy of three suns.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.230
That is a ton of energy.

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.420
And you're releasing that in
just a fraction of a second.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.210
And in fact, during
that fraction

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:53.700
of a second when these
black holes merge,

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.710
they're releasing more
energy per unit time.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:37:01.220
They're brighter than the whole
rest of the universe combined.

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.100
As theorists, we knew this.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.286
Einstein's equations
are well-established.

00:37:06.286 --> 00:37:07.910
We know how to solve
them on computers.

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:12.140
We can calculate that when
you merge a 36 and a 29

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.060
solar mass black
hole, you radiate away

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.100
three solar masses of energy.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.470
And we talked about this,
but now we've actually

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:21.110
observed it happen in nature.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:24.030
It's fantastic.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:27.570
Another really fun
part of LIGO's story

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:29.610
is this amazing signal
I've been telling you

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.850
about which arrived on my
birthday, September 14,

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:35.660
we almost missed.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:39.650
The LIGO experiment decided
to start their observing run

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:41.150
on September 12.

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:44.595
And the founder of LIGO, Ray
Weiss, was dragging his feet.

00:37:44.595 --> 00:37:46.220
He said, oh, it's
not quite calibrated.

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:46.850
We don't want to start.

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:47.990
Let's get it perfect.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:50.430
But the younger crowd
convinced him to go for it.

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:53.000
And we're glad he did, because
two days after they turned it

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.530
on--

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:59.060
this thing's been in the
works for 20, 40 years--

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.640
they measured this
spectacular signal.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.240
They saw something
else in October,

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.660
which was probably a signal--
they're not sure yet--

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.270
and then another
confirmed one in December.

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:10.280
Then they took the
experiment down,

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:13.407
upgraded some of the optics,
improved the seismic isolation,

00:38:13.407 --> 00:38:14.740
and they're observing again now.

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:19.340
Already, just from
one measurement,

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.500
we learned a little
astrophysics.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.170
First of all, we learned that
black holes can find each other

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:24.800
and merge.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.120
That's not obvious.

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.580
Predictions for how many
black holes there would be

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.730
and how often they would
merge were all over the map.

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:34.040
Now we have tight
constraints on that.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.630
And we really
discover a new type

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:39.110
of black hole, because
previously, from x-ray studies

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:41.930
there in the purple, we
knew there were black holes

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:44.750
of around 10, 15 solar masses.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:47.630
And from other studies, like
what Professor Ozel told you

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:50.120
about last week, we knew
there were giant black holes

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.540
of a million solar masses.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.290
And now we know that
there are also 40

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:56.990
and 60 solar mass black holes.

00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:59.830
So that's the weight
of these black holes.

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:00.769
What about the size?

00:39:00.769 --> 00:39:02.560
Well, to set the scale,
I'll give you a map

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.000
of the Eastern United States.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.420
I think that's the part I'd like
to blot out with black holes

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.370
right about now.

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:10.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:10.502 --> 00:39:12.460
There's the signal I've
been telling you about.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.740
That's how big those
black holes are.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:17.170
There's the candidate
signal, and there's

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:19.960
the smaller black holes
that were also measured.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:25.820
So these are state-sized objects
with the mass of 30, 40, 50,

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.665
60 suns.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.230
LIGO is just the beginning.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:36.330
We have two detectors, LIGO
Hanford and LIGO Livingston.

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:38.250
Those are the ones that
made the detection,

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.530
but there are many more
detectors around the world,

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:44.730
either operational, coming
online, being built or planned.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:47.850
And in five to 10 years,
we should have all six

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:49.530
of these detectors working.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:53.130
In Germany, the GEO
detector; Virgo in Italy;

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:57.890
LIGO India in India,
and KAGRA in Japan.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.570
It's great to have
more detectors,

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:04.020
because gravitational waves
are a little bit like sound.

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:06.700
You don't really know where
a sound is coming from.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.400
If you have two
ears, you can sort of

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.520
tell where it's coming from,
but not very precisely.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.080
If you have three
ears or four ears,

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.984
you could start to
tell more precisely.

00:40:14.984 --> 00:40:16.650
And if you have six
ears, you can really

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:18.240
start to get a good
handle on where

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.740
that sound is coming from.

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.710
So if we have six
detectors, we can really

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.350
tell where in the sky the
gravitational wave is coming

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:27.710
from, and we can tell our
astronomer friends, hey,

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:29.640
go point your
telescopes over there.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.588
You might see
something interesting.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.100
When we have these
six detectors--

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:40.740
and even before-- we have
a lot of fun ahead of us.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:43.220
We're super excited
about the first signal

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:46.080
we saw, merging black holes, but
we're going to see a lot more.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.760
I'm sure LIGO has already seen
more black holes, although they

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.530
don't tell people
who aren't officially

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.210
in the collaboration.

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.280
But I've heard rumors.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.140
There are supernova explosions.

00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:59.750
When stars end their
lives and explode,

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:01.910
they make these
giant explosions.

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:04.000
That probably makes some
gravitational waves.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.690
We'll hope to observe those.

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:08.810
My personal favorite is
merging neutron stars.

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:10.730
Again, a neutron
star is matter at

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:13.340
the density of an
atomic nucleus.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.020
We don't know very
much about matter

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.371
at the density of
an atomic nucleus.

00:41:17.371 --> 00:41:19.370
So we're going to learn
a lot of nuclear physics

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:22.580
if we can start seeing a lot
of merging neutron stars,

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.950
because those waves
carry information

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:28.750
about the process of merging.

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.430
We'll see rotating
neutron stars.

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:34.030
And perhaps most excitingly
is the question, question,

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:37.210
question mark on the
right, because we've really

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:39.610
opened a completely new
window on the universe

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:41.800
here with gravitational waves.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.340
And every other time in the
history of astronomy that we've

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.410
gotten a new way of
looking at the universe,

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:50.500
like when radio astronomy
started or x-ray astronomy

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.290
started, every time
there were expectations,

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:55.990
and there were huge
unexpected discoveries.

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:58.300
So perhaps most
exciting are the things

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.270
we don't know about that we
will discover with this new way

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:02.540
of seeing the universe.

00:42:05.447 --> 00:42:07.030
I'm going to change
gears a little bit

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:09.160
and tell you about
my own research.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.650
I work a lot on
gravitational waves,

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:14.470
and one question
we asked recently

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:17.200
was, what if a black
hole spins really fast?

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.770
You can spin a black hole, and
you can spin it really fast.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:22.726
You can't spin it at
the speed of light.

00:42:22.726 --> 00:42:24.100
Nothing can go
faster than light.

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.800
But you can get it really,
really, really close,

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.830
at least in principle.

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:32.610
So here's the sound
of a wave form

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:34.990
that is from a
normal black hole.

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:36.540
This is theoretically generated.

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:38.190
We just made this
on our computers

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:39.480
as part of the research.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.390
But this is just a
comparison signal

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:45.246
for what a normal black
hole merger sounds like.

00:42:45.246 --> 00:42:49.620
[SOUND PLAYS]

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.900
Right at the end there,
there's that [SOUND EFFECT].

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.300
That's the chirp.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.370
Chirp is the hallmark,
the calling card,

00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:57.510
of merging black holes.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:01.260
All the theoretical predictions
have always predicted chirps.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.210
And that's what LIGO measured.

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:04.980
But when we got one
of these black holes

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:08.490
spinning really fast, when we
finally cracked the mathematics

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:11.390
to let us explore this regime,
something very interesting

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:12.170
happened.

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.660
It starts the same,
but you're not

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.790
going to hear a chirp from this
rapidly spinning black hole.

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:23.242
[SOUND PLAYS]

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.790
It just sits on a single
note, and it fades away.

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:41.002
We call that a song.

00:43:41.002 --> 00:43:42.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:43.974
It's very different.

00:43:43.974 --> 00:43:45.250
It's not [SOUND EFFECT].

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:49.750
It's [SOUND EFFECT].

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:52.238
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:57.170
So why is this exciting?

00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:59.120
Well, in astrophysics,
we don't have

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.540
great ways of measuring how
fast these black holes spin.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:06.230
But now we can tell
that if you hear

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:07.820
a sound that doesn't chirp--

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.950
it just sings-- you're
looking at a black hole

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:13.190
spinning really,
really, really fast.

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:15.710
Now, we gave this
black hole a nickname.

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:18.130
And our scientific
paper has a funny title

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:22.190
up there on the right,
"Inspiral into Gargantua."

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:25.270
If you've seen the
movie Interstellar,

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:27.700
there's a black hole
called Gargantua.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.770
And it turns out, for
the plot of Interstellar

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:33.460
to make any sense at all,
that black hole Gargantua has

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:34.970
to spin very rapidly.

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:40.840
It has to spin with
99.999999999999%

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.510
the speed of light, 14 nines.

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:48.210
So, is Gargantua out there?

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:49.200
How would we know?

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.500
Well, if the next thing LIGO
hears, or some other experiment

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.890
in the future, if the next
thing they hear is this song,

00:44:55.890 --> 00:45:00.249
then we've discovered Gargantua.

00:45:00.249 --> 00:45:02.040
When I started thinking
about this problem,

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.860
I wasn't thinking about
astrophysics at all.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.510
Rapidly spinning
black holes turned out

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:08.850
to be a really good
theoretical testing

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:12.030
ground for the following sort
of pure theoretical physics

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:15.690
question that I'd like
to describe for you.

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:18.950
It's called the black
hole information paradox.

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:20.510
At the start of the
talk, I gave you

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:24.620
a paradox involving the speed
of light being the upper limit

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:29.510
that you can physically go, and
this formula, v is v1 plus v2.

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:32.990
That paradox was
resolved 100 years ago.

00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:36.527
This paradox is
still with us today,

00:45:36.527 --> 00:45:38.360
and it's really driving
theoretical physics,

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.120
I'd say more than
any other paradox.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.310
In its simplest form
the question is,

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:46.899
can you tell what was
thrown into a black hole?

00:45:46.899 --> 00:45:48.440
So these are thought
experiments, not

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.190
real experiments.

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:50.564
But we used to do
them with cats.

00:45:50.564 --> 00:45:52.670
We would throw the cat
into the black hole.

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.650
And then we started
feeling bad about that,

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:56.840
so now we use graduate students.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:01.790
That seems to go
over a little better.

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:03.230
But in these thought
experiments--

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:04.880
not real experiments--

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.460
we either throw a cat in
or a graduate student in,

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:10.280
and then we ask you
to come back later

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.440
and look at the black hole.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.830
And can you tell--

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:14.810
in principle, not in practice--

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:19.620
if it was a cat or a graduate
student that I threw in?

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:22.570
Einstein's theories say no.

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:24.780
The black hole-- anything
that goes into it

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.220
is, for all intents
and purposes,

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:27.330
gone from the universe.

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:30.540
You will never be able to tell,
in principle, whether I threw

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.740
in a cat or a graduate student.

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:35.480
But there's another
theory of physics

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.550
that you'll hear about
a lot more in two

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:40.640
weeks with Professor
Cheu's lecture, which

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.890
is quantum mechanics.

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:44.870
And all the
formulations of quantum

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:48.140
mechanics that we know
about have a fundamental law

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.120
that information is preserved.

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.100
In quantum mechanics,
you have to be

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.920
able to tell, in principle
if not in practice,

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:58.080
whether it was a cat
or a graduate student.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.680
So there's a fundamental
tension here.

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.410
And it's really Stephen
Hawking who first pointed this

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:05.480
out after discovering
some fantastic

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:09.140
properties of black holes
that made it very apparent.

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:12.590
His paradox is really
still with us today.

00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:14.750
Now, I did not solve
this paradox, alas,

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:17.540
when I was thinking about
rapidly spinning black holes.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:20.600
But it led to a new
prediction in astrophysics,

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.195
which just shows the
interconnectedness of science.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.400
In the last few minutes, I want
to take a step back and think

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.910
about where in the history
of science and astronomy

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:36.340
this gravitational
wave discovery lies.

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:40.060
You may know that
light is just one

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:43.180
wavelength of
electromagnetic radiation,

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:46.840
and radio and microwave and
infrared and ultraviolet

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:50.050
and x-ray and gamma ray
are other wavelengths

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:51.520
of electromagnetic radiation.

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:55.240
There's a whole
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:58.570
Astronomy really began
when Galileo first

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:01.150
turned his telescope
to the heavens,

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:02.950
and among other
things, discovered

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:04.239
the moons of Jupiter.

00:48:04.239 --> 00:48:05.530
You can see his sketches there.

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:09.580
There's Jupiter with four
little moons that he observed.

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:12.970
Since that time, we now
have astronomy in all

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.750
of these different wavelengths.

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:19.260
In radio astronomy, we've
discovered incredible things.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.170
That was the discovery of
neutron stars, in fact.

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:25.860
Up there in the top left, that
speck there is a whole galaxy.

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.710
That galaxy is
shooting out particles

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:31.920
moving near the speed of light
in a straight line for hundreds

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:36.150
of times the galaxy's size until
they make this beautiful plume

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:38.250
that we see in the radio.

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:39.720
Some of my other
research is aimed

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:43.570
at trying to understand what
the heck is going on there.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:45.670
In the microwave, we
can see light left over

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:47.430
from after the Big Bang.

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:50.025
13 billion years ago when
the universe was just

00:48:50.025 --> 00:48:50.920
a hot plasma--

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:56.220
no stars, no planets, just
hot plasma, no elements even.

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.310
In the infrared, we
can see galaxies,

00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:02.010
learn about their structure,
trace them through cosmic time.

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:04.740
In the visible, well, we've
come a long way since Galileo.

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.830
Now if we look at Jupiter with
our best instrument, the Hubble

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:11.250
Space Telescope, we get
that beautiful image.

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:12.510
That's not a painting.

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:15.000
That's a picture of Jupiter.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.080
In the ultraviolet
we can see the storms

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.780
on the surface of the Sun and
learn about plasma physics

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:21.280
at high temperature.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:24.220
These coronal mass ejections
that wipe out communications

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:27.100
here on Earth-- we can study
those, among other things.

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:30.130
And in x-ray and gamma ray,
we see the high-energy events

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:31.600
in the universe.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:33.940
The gamma rays sky looks
like that big image

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:36.430
on the upper right
there, except every once

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:40.600
in a while when there's a bright
flash called a gamma ray burst.

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.210
Those gamma ray
bursts were actually

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:44.970
first discovered by
military satellites

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:47.880
looking for Soviet
nuclear tests.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.346
But they pretty
quickly figured out

00:49:49.346 --> 00:49:50.970
that the gamma rays
they were measuring

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:53.160
were actually coming
from outer space.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.910
The origin of those gamma rays
is still pretty much a mystery,

00:49:56.910 --> 00:50:00.330
and it's a mystery LIGO
might help unravel.

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:03.570
But that's the
electromagnetic wave spectrum.

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:07.490
Gravitational waves
also have a spectrum.

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:10.200
And where are we in
observing this spectrum?

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.600
Well, we're just like
when Galileo first pointed

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.800
his telescope to the sky.

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.420
We've made one observation.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.910
It's tremendously exciting,
these merging black holes,

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:21.120
but it's one observation
at one tiny frequency

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.400
band in this whole spectrum.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.290
As LIGO becomes more
sensitive, we'll

00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:27.130
start to hear higher
frequency things--

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:29.880
maybe supernovae and
merging neutron stars.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.130
There are space-based
detectors in the works that

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:34.740
will measure the monsters of
the universe-- supermassive

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:38.100
black holes, black holes with
millions or billions of times

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.469
the mass of the Sun.

00:50:39.469 --> 00:50:41.010
There are other
detectors that get us

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:44.730
to even lower frequencies, where
we might hear cosmic strings--

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:47.760
or if we're very lucky,
gravitational waves

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.270
from the Big Bang itself.

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:57.200
Let me summarize.

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.730
I started the
evening telling you

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:01.630
about how a century
ago Einstein discovered

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:05.660
a deep new reality of
interconnected space, time,

00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.100
and gravity.

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:10.060
He discovered new
things about physics.

00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:13.750
Those consequences of Einstein's
equations were revolutionary,

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:15.580
and they are still
with us today.

00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:18.160
And 100 years later, one
of those consequences

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.470
has now been turned into a tool.

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:23.800
We are now using Einstein's
gravitational waves

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:27.990
to hear the universe in
a completely new way.

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:32.580
And in closing, I want to
leave you with two questions.

00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:35.250
What will we learn
in the next 100, 200

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:38.360
years with this new astronomy?

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:41.960
And what will be the next
revolution in space, time,

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.040
and gravity?

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:43.940
Thank you very much.

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:47.590
[APPLAUSE]
