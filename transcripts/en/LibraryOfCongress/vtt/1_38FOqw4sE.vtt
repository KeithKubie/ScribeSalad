collection just stay in your seat
it's not fair having to introduce a

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.530
great writer of memoir because she's
already done it so well as you know

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.470
Jeannette Walls was born in Phoenix and
she and her siblings had a difficult

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.989
childhood in a strange but intense
family that was constantly on the move

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.170
so bizarre was her upbringing and she
kept it a secret even while she tried to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.150
write about it for 20 years she tried to
write it as a novel at one point but

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.500
finally coaxed on by a close friend the
man she eventually married she wrote The

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.060
Glass Castle which has been a
best-seller for almost three years has

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.840
sold more than 2 million copies in this
country and has been translated into 24

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.140
languages but for most of her career she
spent as a journalist she worked at New

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.120
York Magazine Esquire USA Today and for
many years was a gossip columnist for

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.450
MSNBC her up

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.050
our upcoming book half broke horses is
an account of her life with her

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.490
grandmother on the American frontier you
can look for that in bookstores just

00:01:49.490 --> 00:02:02.750
next week please join me in welcoming
Jeannette Walls thank you thank you it

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.950
is it is such a great joy to be here
surrounded by so many wonderful readers

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.789
and so many big deal authors like I sort
of feel this is an honor I I don't

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.489
deserve I'm just a girl with a story but
the telling of that story has changed my

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.440
life and among other things it made me
see what a knucklehead I was for so many

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.700
years so with our time together what I
would like to do is share with you some

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.989
of the things that I have learned since
the publication of my book I am it it

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.670
gives me such great pleasure to share my
story and that's ironic because for so

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.140
long my story was a source of shame for
me as Ron mentioned I used to write

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.560
about celebrities for a living that's
not the source of shame perhaps it

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:54.860
should be but it's not um but the day
that I was heading to some fabulous

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.269
party and and saw a homeless woman
rooting through the garbage and realized

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.190
it was my mother and getting together
with her a couple of days later and

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.340
asking her what the heck am I supposed
to tell people when they ask me about

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.890
you and her telling me just tell the
truth is really what changed my life it

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.880
it seemed like such a simple challenge
but at the same time it seemed

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.049
impossible how could I ever explain to
people why my mother who's an

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.980
intelligent and resourceful woman would
be living on the streets but moreover

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.640
what kind of a monster of a daughter
would live on Park Avenue and write

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.870
about celebrities while my mother was
living on the streets at the same time I

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.829
felt it was something that I had to do I
felt like a fraud and a phony but there

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.030
was no dot there was no doubt in my mind
that once people knew the truth about me

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.900
that I was going to lose everything I
was completely convinced I would be

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.209
fired from my job that I would lose all
my friends and and lose whatever meager

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.940
little stain
not carved out for myself in this world

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.989
so I'm sitting there trying to rise to
mom's challenge and tell the truth and I

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.459
thought why am I doing this I've got
this great job I go on television I held

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.780
my own column I have a flush toilet what
more could anybody want in life you know

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.049
um and and I and I developed a fantasy
for my story now any author who tells

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.220
you they don't have a fantasy for their
book is lying to you because it is an

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.479
excruciating process sitting there
staring at the the word processor

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.620
typewriter whatever you use and and you
tell yourself stories oh when my book

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.970
comes out maybe such-and-such will
happen I never dreamed of the bestseller

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.250
list that was that was too too ambitious
I never dreamed of any prizes or awards

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:41.300
my fantasy became that if my story came
out that a rich kid would read it I was

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.180
hoping that a rich kid and by that I
mean somebody whose folks paid the bills

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.250
on time that a rich kid would read it
and would come to understand what it's

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.850
like to grow up on the other side of the
tracks what it's like to have this weird

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:59.270
combination of shame and pride about
your your parents and yourself and then

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.599
as I worked a little bit longer on it I
developed an even bolder and more

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:06.620
ambitious ambition and that was that
somebody who grew up like me would read

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.430
it and we'd get the same sense of hope
that I got from reading A Tree Grows in

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.430
Brooklyn and and so that's what got me
through telling my story and and facing

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.479
what I was certain would be shame and
humiliation well I have to say that

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.889
readers have been so much smarter and so
much more compassionate than I ever

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.520
dreamed possible
um I cannot tell you how many people

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.450
have come to me and and I have seen have
told me um have let me see myself

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.840
through their eyes and that's sort of
what allowed me to forgive myself for my

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.740
own past but I perhaps more shockingly
the number of people who've come up to

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.639
me and said you know the details of our
lives are very different but you and I

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.660
have a lot in common and sometimes they
start telling me their stories and

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.690
sometimes they're crying when they tell
me sometimes they have these rough

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.410
Scrabble backgrounds like I did but
sometimes they were raised in what seems

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.610
like great luxury but they had an
alcoholic father or a slightly loopy mom

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.620
and they tell me their stories and
they're these amazing

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.000
inspirational stories and I think why
would you be ashamed of that number oh

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.919
yeah I was ashamed too so so i i i i I
think that you know shame somebody who's

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.690
very wise when said to me that that um
secrets are like like vampires

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.800
they can survive only in the darkness
and they suck the life out of you but

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.639
once they're exposed to the light
there's a moment of horror then poof

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.740
they lose their power over you but um
that's oh no long after the publication

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.250
I got to get back to my ambitions about
my book not long after the publication

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:44.430
of my book a very pretty young um girl
approached me she said she read my story

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:50.820
while she was vacationing in the
Caribbean and um she said she's a

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.350
cheerleader and she said there's this
girl she said there's a girl in her

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.770
class she said she wears these nasty
ugly out-of-date clothes and hair's all

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.720
greasy and she said we all make fun of
her and she said and now I understand

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.919
and now I will never make fun of her
again and I thought the Lord can strike

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:12.660
me down with lightning right now I have
done my job on this planet I have made

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:19.440
thank you honey I have made that one
rich kid understand but then not long

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.860
after that not long after that a teacher
came to me she said she had one of her

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.639
students read my book she she teaches in
northern Alabama so too rough Scrabble

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:34.620
area and she said a young man who had
never read a book cover-to-cover started

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.919
toting my book around with him and she
said I thought you don't like reading he

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:41.340
said I don't she said I thought you
don't you don't like books at all he

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.990
said I hate books said well why do you
like that particular book and he thinks

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:53.539
for a second and he said this here's a
fine white trash story and um

00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:00.830
then the teacher added very quickly in a
little bit nervously I believe he meant

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:07.580
that as a compliment um but I I took it
as a compliment in fact in fact it is

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.890
perhaps the greatest compliment I have
ever received because if a young man

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:17.780
first of all who thinks he doesn't like
books but moreover who thinks of himself

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:23.030
as trash can hear my story and say hey
you know something

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:27.410
she's not that different from me and
that if a popular cheerleader can read

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:32.750
my story and say hey you know something
she's not that different from me that to

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:37.940
me is why we tell our stories it's you
know I think we memoirs get a little bit

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.930
of a bum rap that we're exhibitionist or
something like that and I I don't

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:45.530
believe that at all what you're doing
your night air in your dirty laundry

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:50.690
you're saying this is my story and maybe
you can learn something from it without

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:55.160
the nasty business of actually having to
have lived it and and what I have found

00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:00.830
from people is only compassion and
kindness and in a desire to connect and

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:05.690
to understand what it was like to have
this childhood what it was like and and

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.980
it elicits great conversations and as I
said a number of people coming up to me

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.370
and saying you know I know what you went
through I went through something like

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:19.400
that in thinking about what is the truth
you have to figure out you know somebody

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.750
who's much wiser than me once said the
truth is a liquid and not a solid and it

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:29.330
takes many shapes so when you're writing
even if it's a when you're writing

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:34.010
nonfiction even though it's it's true
you shape your truth by which stories

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:38.300
you choose to tell when I sat down to
write my story I was 40 years old so I

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:44.780
had a lot of anecdotes to choose from
and and the very favorite memory for my

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:49.790
entire childhood was when I was five
years old and um we had no money for

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.990
Christmas presents and my father took
each of his children out into the desert

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.940
night and he gave us as a Christmas
present

00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:00.350
whichever star in this guy we wanted
I've never been much of one for subtlety

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.250
so I chose the brightest one it was
being his dead dad had to explain to me

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.990
that Venus wouldn't a star at all
just to plan it I wanted it anyway dad

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:13.180
said what the heck it's Christmas you
want to plan it you gotta plan it and he

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:18.610
gave me Venus and it's my most treasured
gift in my most treasured story ever to

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:23.140
this day when I see Venus up in the sky
I think honey that is mine I own that

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:28.180
and um so when my father died I told
that story at his funeral after I

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.510
finished my sister Laurie
who's three years older than me and

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.890
always been a little smarter than me
always saw right through my dad's BS she

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:40.870
crossed her arms and said in that like
that sorry sob dad of ours to go give

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:46.120
away something that doesn't belong to
him in the first place and um I thought

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.490
about it Laurie was absolutely right
dads giving me Venus was a completely

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:57.100
meaningless gesture but I'm right - it
was a priceless treasure it is whatever

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.730
you choose to make of it and I think
that you could say the same of the glass

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:05.200
castle itself you know it was another
one of my father's drunk and dreams and

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:11.200
another one of his unfulfilled promises
or you can see it as as a hope and a

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.300
dream for the future and that's the way
I chose to see it believe that maybe all

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:20.050
of this moving around and digging food
out of garbage cans and sleeping in

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:24.490
cardboard boxes that that was temporary
that one of these days I would actually

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:29.770
have a nice place to live and I've come
to believe that that is a much more

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:37.810
valuable gift thank you I am I've been
fascinated by people's reactions to my

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:42.010
story you know some people think that my
parents were monsters who should have

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.800
had their children locked up and some
think that they were certainly flawed

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.000
characters but that they had gifts as
well and that they passed those gifts

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.230
along to their children sometimes
reading groups will approach me let's

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.490
say we had a big ol argument about your
book you know which of us is right and I

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.300
say that you're you're both why you're
all right it's it's all how you choose

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.800
to perceive it there's one more story
bear with me that I want to take about a

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.310
teach right I love teachers I think that
good teachers are Saints walk in this

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:15.680
planet and if I keep on I I just I I do
I think that

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:23.180
if you can if you can give a child the
gift of knowledge of learning a passion

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.810
for education you've given them a great
treasure that they will have their

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:30.980
entire lives so I just you know and some
people have asked me why I'm not bitter

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:35.960
or upset about my childhood you know I
got that from my parents and I got a

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.580
sense of self-esteem and I think that
the rest is all bonus ideally also get

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:46.040
food and clothing I'll admit that but
but um the sense of self-esteem is is

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.140
amazing
when we're in a story about a teacher

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:53.839
there was a teacher in a broth rust L
ruff ruff rust belt area and she had her

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:56.990
kids read the glass castle because she
was trying to get them to read stories

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:01.550
about poverty and um there's one if it
sounds like I'm bragging about my book

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:07.730
it's I am um um but I I'm not bragging
about my book I'm bragging about the

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:12.050
power of storytelling the power of
sharing your stories but anyway this

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.960
teacher was trying to get these kids to
read about poverty cuz there was one

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.700
student in particular she wanted to
reach and um she said this is a good

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.700
girl but she's had a couple of brushes
with the law and she just wanted to get

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:28.279
through to this young woman and um so uh
this young woman came into the class one

00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:32.209
day and she through the glass castle on
the table she said that is a very

00:13:32.209 --> 00:13:36.529
upsetting book to me and the teacher
said why is that she goes that there's

00:13:36.529 --> 00:13:40.279
an episode where the mother takes three
kids shoplifting and gets clothes for

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:45.020
one of the kids that was wrong and this
teacher is thinking oh this is great I

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.790
could have this conversation with this
young woman about breaking the law and

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:53.029
crime and punishment and the teacher
says what in particular bothered you

00:13:53.029 --> 00:13:57.260
about that scene this young woman says
if you go shoplifting for one of the

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.829
kids you got to get something for all of
them

00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:09.990
and um the teacher said it was quite the
eye-opener for her because she had

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:14.339
always thought of this young woman as a
rule-breaker and then she came to

00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:16.769
realize this woman isn't a real breaker
at all

00:14:16.769 --> 00:14:21.089
she was just taught a different set of
rules and and so I think that that's

00:14:21.089 --> 00:14:25.620
what memoirs and biographies that's what
they do is is they take you inside

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:30.480
somebody else's life and and and they
make you see this is what you would be

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:36.230
like if your circumstances were
different I think you know we we all

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:41.279
define other people in different ways we
stick labels on crazy homeless people or

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:46.740
shallow gossip calms thinking that we
know who and what they are but everybody

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.480
has a story everybody there's something
behind everybody and I'm on this

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:56.160
campaign right now to get everybody to
write their own story their own memoir

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.420
whether you want to show it to anybody
or not that's your choice I think if you

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:05.070
show it to somebody take it from me
people are kinder and wiser then we give

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.279
them credit for being there they're much
more trustworthy if you're not ready to

00:15:08.279 --> 00:15:13.410
do that that's okay too but I think
everybody should tell their story if not

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:17.970
to other people at least to yourself and
figures yourself out people have asked

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.640
me how could you forgive your parents
the only person I had to forgive was

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.690
myself because I think that those of us
who pulled ourselves up by the

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:29.910
bootstraps we can carry around a lot of
sort of survival guilt or mixed feelings

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:34.170
about doing better than your parents and
leaving your siblings behind it's it's

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:38.760
very complicated and coming clean we
destroy these neat patterns emerge and

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:43.260
like I said readers are so smart I was
at one events a reader asked me

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.540
something and she said why did your
mother do such-and-such

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.690
I said you know I don't know and I've
asked my mother and I can't get a

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.860
straight answer from her another woman
in the audience raises her hand she said

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.120
I know I said you do she said yeah my
book club discussed it I was like oh

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:03.670
okay
so um she had a good theory too so um

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:07.600
some people have asked me is it weird to
go around talking about your family and

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.260
having all these people discussing
members of your families they know it

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:16.360
and it's never been weird just because
people are so kind and so smart in fact

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.550
time and time again readers have been
smarter than I am as I said people have

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:26.829
very different reactions to my parents
and the questions I get most about I get

00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:31.810
the most questions about are my mother
people have really sort of wildly mixed

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:35.290
feelings about her some people have said
you know your father I understand I

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:39.790
understand alcoholism your mother's a
mystery to me and I would often discuss

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:44.889
my mother with them and usually their
faces would light up with illumination

00:16:44.889 --> 00:16:49.000
that sort of aha moment and usually they
would in the conversation by saying your

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.500
next book should be about your mother
like right on mom she's a crazy lay down

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.110
all right you know um but they just kept
on insisting

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.990
time and time again your next book
should be about your mother and I've

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.350
been sort of kicking around for somebody
to write about because I have no

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.919
imagination I can't make things up I
it's ironic to me that I mean this

00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:08.770
particular trip a temple let's not even
go there

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:16.569
but um um so eventually I proposed the
idea to mine my mother she no longer is

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:19.929
on the streets I'm happy to say that um
the abandoned building where she was

00:17:19.929 --> 00:17:24.610
living several years ago for for more
than 15 years without heat of running

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:29.080
water caught on fire and um I've been
trying to get my mother to come down

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.770
live with me in Virginia not with me in
my house because I'm not a saint but we

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:37.030
have a little place out back and she
kept on resisting she said Jen and I

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.610
lived the most exciting city in the
world I don't want to go down and live

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:45.040
him for jigna that's the sticks um I
said but mom you live on the street and

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.059
she said I'm not some sort of a moocher
I'm not a freeloader live with my

00:17:49.059 --> 00:17:52.809
daughter and son-in-law I said mom we're
thinking of getting horses him we could

00:17:52.809 --> 00:17:55.179
really use the help she said I'll be
right there

00:17:55.179 --> 00:18:00.490
and um it was a valuable lesson for me
in terms of um you know if we want to

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:04.240
help somebody if you can if you can give
them a sense of self-esteem and an idea

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.270
that they're helping themselves in
helping you as well that they're much

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:11.660
more inclined to accept your help and
they might even surprise you

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.890
by really being helpful and rise into
the occasion and mom has been fabulous

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:22.010
with the horses and she's been fabulous
with other things too um not long ago

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.760
she came in in this really good mood she
was very happy about something I said

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:30.140
mom what are you so happy about she said
the most wonderful thing happened to me

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:35.540
today I said what she said I fell off a
horse now my mother is the ultimate

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:39.230
optimist if she can put a positive spin
on anything but I was thinking how could

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:43.280
even mom think that falling off a horse
is a good thing so I asked her I said

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.120
your mom what what could be good about
that she said well Jeanette anybody can

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:53.180
ride but knowing how to fall takes great
talent and I thought there's a great

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.120
deal of wisdom in that you know
especially with the economy that we're

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:01.160
facing you know and when times are good
we can all just sail along so it's you

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.330
know no one had to land on your behind
and then pick yourself back up and get

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:09.200
them moving in and those of us who can
pick ourselves up are really the truly

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.060
lucky ones and the truly truly lucky
ones among us are the ones who can give

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:18.380
somebody else a hand and say can I help
you up and and inevitably in my

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.160
experience if somebody's willing to
accept that help that they can be a big

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:27.110
asset to you and so the ironic thing for
me is that this woman who for so long

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:30.950
was a source of shame for me who I sort
of wanted to disappear from the planet I

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:36.050
didn't want her to die but I just wanted
her to go away has actually become not

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:41.510
only a source of inspiration for me but
the source of my next book um because

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:45.890
eventually when I proposed the idea of
well you know do how about I write a

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:50.300
story about you she was all for it she
thought was a great idea and I

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.590
interviewed her every day for a year and
not one time did she say oh that's too

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:58.940
personal let's not go there you know
she's just very forthcoming my mother

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:04.880
cannot remember my phone number but
she's this amazing recall for the the

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:10.190
history of Arizona and the various
Indian tribes and which I related this I

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:13.700
was like I was stunned I was taking
notes Rock she couldn't you must be

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.030
wrong on all the sudden go back and
google it and she was dead-on on all of

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.610
it
so I said um mom what do you know all

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:22.490
this stuff and you don't even know your
own phone number she said my phone

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:29.369
number is not that interesting
um um so um she was great about it but

00:20:29.369 --> 00:20:32.519
while I was interviewing her she kept
saying this book should not be about me

00:20:32.519 --> 00:20:38.999
this should be about my mother and um at
first I resisted because my grandmother

00:20:38.999 --> 00:20:42.029
died when I was about 8 years old and I
couldn't interview and I don't think I

00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:45.509
have no imagination I can't I joined I
tried to fit on mentioned I tried to

00:20:45.509 --> 00:20:48.659
fictionalize a glass castle and I
couldn't think of fake names for us so I

00:20:48.659 --> 00:20:52.709
used all our middle names you know and
it just I I couldn't think how am I

00:20:52.709 --> 00:20:54.839
supposed to change this because
everybody did what they did because

00:20:54.839 --> 00:20:59.849
that's in character and you know am I
supposed to say that the FBI really was

00:20:59.849 --> 00:21:04.199
after my father so I don't I don't I
didn't know what to change but as I'm

00:21:04.199 --> 00:21:07.019
interviewing mom like I said she kept on
saying this next book should be about my

00:21:07.019 --> 00:21:10.259
mother
um and I resist it because I couldn't

00:21:10.259 --> 00:21:14.159
interview my my grandmother who died
when I was 8 years old but she was this

00:21:14.159 --> 00:21:20.039
amazing character she had um was born in
1901 in a dugout I don't mean on a

00:21:20.039 --> 00:21:24.059
baseball field I'm anali you know on a
riverbank a dugout in the and she

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:28.499
trained horses and she was a
schoolteacher by the time she was 15

00:21:28.499 --> 00:21:32.699
didn't have a high school degree herself
and I thought mom was right that she did

00:21:32.699 --> 00:21:38.849
have an amazing story so um so I wrote
the story from her perspective in first

00:21:38.849 --> 00:21:42.809
person with the intention of changing it
back to third person and qualifying the

00:21:42.809 --> 00:21:46.979
stuff I didn't know by saying you know
it is believed that or the evidence

00:21:46.979 --> 00:21:49.979
suggests but then I showed it to my
agent she said keep everything exactly

00:21:49.979 --> 00:21:54.419
as it is so we decided to slap the label
fiction on it we're calling it a true

00:21:54.419 --> 00:21:59.099
life novel which I it was a it was a
phrase that actually Norman Mailer used

00:21:59.099 --> 00:22:03.659
in the execution or song but it's
basically it's just a family story in it

00:22:03.659 --> 00:22:07.440
like we all have like you know that we
were told by our parents and our

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:11.729
grandparents and even though I think
that Lily my grandmother was an

00:22:11.729 --> 00:22:16.199
exceptional woman in so many ways just
tough broad she was just this this woman

00:22:16.199 --> 00:22:20.369
should whip out our choppers or whip out
her handgun equally quickly and she just

00:22:20.369 --> 00:22:26.399
you know she was a tough old lady and
did what had to be done so in some ways

00:22:26.399 --> 00:22:30.239
I think she was an extraordinary woman
another way she's extraordinarily common

00:22:30.239 --> 00:22:35.519
just there was I think a lot of people
will recognize themselves or maybe their

00:22:35.519 --> 00:22:39.490
grandparents
and her and and I that is my hope for

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:43.990
this book that it makes other people
think about their own stories their own

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:49.420
histories and and their ability you know
so many people have said to me in fact a

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.300
gentleman just said this to me earlier I
could have never survived what you did

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.170
and even though I'm very flattered by
that compliment of course you could of

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:59.500
course you could we're all tougher than
we think some of you have probably

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.920
survived much worse I was at some event
anybody was saying how could you be so

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.580
strong and this woman sort of meekly
raised her hand she said I'm from

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.040
Somalia she didn't have it so bad you
know

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:14.920
um I think there were all tough old
broads and tough old coots

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.550
and if you just look in your history
you'll realize we all come from this

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:23.650
really hearty stock whether you came
over the ancestors came over from the

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:29.770
potato famine or came over on slave
ships it's it's or it just came here to

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:34.390
get away from the Holocaust we all have
what it takes to survive and and give

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:39.970
yourself some credit and look at your
own stories and um you know my my hope

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:46.480
for for half broke horses is um folks
will read it and like that poor white

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.990
trash Caden like that popular kid will
just say hey you know something she's

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:56.520
not that different from me
thank you very much thank you thank you

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.360
thank you

00:24:02.809 --> 00:24:06.049
thank you

00:24:07.799 --> 00:24:13.830
ask anything if I don't know the answer
maybe somebody's book club discussed it

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:21.039
son had first read it had been
recommended it to him his friend in

00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:25.000
middle school recommended it to me and
then we passed it on through the family

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.700
anyhow my question to you is how's your
mother's read the book right yeah mm-hmm

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:34.270
and her reaction well you know I was
very I often showed to mom before

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:37.539
publication and she wasn't that
interested in reading it she was in the

00:24:37.539 --> 00:24:41.409
middle of a really zane grey a good zing
grade book so she passed on it and she

00:24:41.409 --> 00:24:46.090
didn't read it until it became a
best-seller if i really wrestled with

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:49.150
some of those scenes should I include
them in particular the chocolate scene

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:52.450
for those of you who haven't read the
book um there's an episode where we kids

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:56.080
were going hungry mom was eating
chocolate and I can't Tammy to reader

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.130
said your dad had me until the pool hall
scene your mom had me to the chocolate

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:02.890
scene so I really wrestled with whether
or not to include that because I could

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:06.159
have left it out and nobody would have
said hey there's a plot hole here

00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:09.940
um and I decided to go ahead include it
and if mom and read it before

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:13.419
publication and said please take this
out I could have said you know the

00:25:13.419 --> 00:25:18.850
public has the right to know mom um but
after she read it like I said it was

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:20.740
already out and she had no problem with
that

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.799
no problem so ever she was a little
upset by my description of her driving

00:25:23.799 --> 00:25:28.210
um other than that she doesn't seem to
have any real problem which she said a

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:32.950
couple of times I don't see things quite
the way you do but I understand that you

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:37.780
had to tell the truth as you saw it and
I think you know that's a pretty darn

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.360
fad with all the things I said about her
you got to hand it to mom

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.539
you can cues her a lot of things but
being a control freak is not one of them

00:25:43.539 --> 00:25:51.820
so yes thank you this is not a question
but a very quick one-minute story to add

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.870
to your teacher collection I'm the young
librarian at a public charter school

00:25:55.870 --> 00:26:00.100
here in Washington DC three years ago a
new English teacher came to our high

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.280
school and she came and she said to me
I've never taught high school before she

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.250
said what how do you think I should
start each day I said I think it's

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:09.880
really important even at the high school
level that the teachers read aloud

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.840
something to their class just for
pleasure and enjoyment she said well

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.230
what should I start with I said I don't
know I said I've always found at any

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:20.220
level but Charlotte's Web works very
well but I said I just

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.490
a book that I think would really work
very well well of course it was the

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:27.960
glass castle what I want to tell you
though is is that for the next three

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:33.179
years she had four classes each year she
read the glass castle to every one of

00:26:33.179 --> 00:26:37.530
her classes for three years that's 12
times that she read aloud but glass

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:43.919
castle she never censored a word she
read every word as written and the other

00:26:43.919 --> 00:26:56.520
thing she cried every time your father
died the last thing is she'd be here

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.880
today but I guess the stress was too
much for it after three years she

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:04.520
decided to take a year off she's riding
her bike down the continental trail

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:10.530
thank you so much thank you that's
amazing thank you Jeanette two quick

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:14.610
questions are your siblings especially
marine yeah number two I have a friend

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.789
who's an orthodontist she was very
concerned about your teeth did your

00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:23.010
homemade braces work your teeth are
absolutely beautiful did you have to go

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:28.530
to a real orthodontist you called me out
on that honey he called me out I these

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:32.340
are these very fine choppers that you
see are the result of professional dent

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.409
yeah
my very first paycheck I went and got

00:27:34.409 --> 00:27:37.860
braces and my orthodontist gave me a
really hard time for not getting braces

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.789
when I was a kid he said I had I had the
worst overbuy had ever seen and I did

00:27:41.789 --> 00:27:44.340
not tell him about my do yourself
efforts because I didn't think it'd be

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:49.919
impressed um but um yeah but an
orthodontist told me Mike technology

00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:54.179
actually was good and it would have
worked my siblings my older sister

00:27:54.179 --> 00:28:01.169
Laurie is still an artist she's still in
Manhattan um my kid sister Maureen is

00:28:01.169 --> 00:28:07.020
living in California in a clean safe
place uh you know she's not setting the

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.730
world on fire with her career but that's
okay she one of the many blessings that

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:15.090
come as a result of the glass castles
we're back in touch I'm trying to get

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:18.900
her to come live with me and my husband
in Virginia but she says she never wants

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:22.409
to live her it snows ever again I keep
telling her Marie Nicole's not so bad

00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:27.900
when you got a thermostat just move the
little old thing and I just but she you

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.690
know this has to be her decision and I'm
trying to sort of accept that but the

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:33.930
chapter on that is not necessarily
finished I'm still working on that

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:38.700
my brother has retired from the police
force he's no longer with the Gestapo he

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.000
is a ninth grade English teacher and I
could not be more proud of him whoa whoa

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.990
whoa go Brian and he's a great teacher
he really is thank you um hi Jeanette my

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:53.580
daughter is I'm junior at Barnard and
when she was first year you came and

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:58.140
spoke to her class which she loved and I
just wanted your excu

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:02.640
anything you say about being at Barnard
and how it helped you I you know I loved

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.090
being at Barnard and I loved going back
and speaking to that class one of my few

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:09.090
regrets about the glass castles I wish I
would have changed the name of the Barna

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:13.320
professor who called me out when when I
said you know she said what do you know

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.980
about homelessness and I said nothing
you know um and I never meant to

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:21.330
humiliate her I was not trying to get
even with anybody I think she's I think

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.480
Barnard is a wonderful place and this
was the woman who inspired me to become

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.780
a political science major so and I was
so impressed with those girls they were

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:36.150
so smart and as the best question so
good luck to her thank you hi thank you

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:41.820
loved your book passed it on to many
people and also loved it my question is

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:47.130
about your mother and it's similar to
what you've already said about people

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:53.429
not understanding her and while I was
fascinated by your non-judgmental take

00:29:53.429 --> 00:29:57.510
on it
did you ever try to explore or anybody

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:01.050
else help you explore it was she
mentally ill what the illness might have

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:06.630
been what was driving her really bizarre
behavior in regards to her children mom

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:10.230
has never been diagnosed with any mental
illness as far as I know she certainly

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:16.350
loopy she's loopy I mean I don't know if
that's a diagnosis but I keep on quoting

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:18.720
other people other readers because
they're smarter than I am and now I'm

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.960
going to quote a Rosie O'Donnell who was
a big fan of the glass castle I went on

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:26.400
the view it was the best interview I've
ever done because I couldn't get in a

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:32.400
word edgewise they were all fighting
about but Joy Behar hated my mother so I

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:36.059
that nut I can't believe you're letting
that nut live with you you know she is

00:30:36.059 --> 00:30:40.440
mentally ill you know that and Rosie
jumped in and she said there's a whole

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:45.900
spectrum of mental illness all the way
from seasonal affect disorder to

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:49.669
schizophrenia and she said
most creative people are somewhere in

00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:56.409
between as am i and I certainly mom has
disorders I recently read a fascinating

00:30:56.409 --> 00:31:02.869
biography called my stroke of insight in
which this woman lost use of the left

00:31:02.869 --> 00:31:06.220
side her brain became completely right
brained and it was like reading a

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:11.480
rosetta stone on my mom she's a total
right brain person now that she's living

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:17.119
with me I have a great relationship with
her um she's a hoot she's a lot of fun

00:31:17.119 --> 00:31:20.989
if you're not looking for to take care
of you my husband that handsome devil

00:31:20.989 --> 00:31:26.269
sitting right there gets um gets along
even better with it yeah

00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:29.749
gets along even better with her than I
do she's she just thinks differently I

00:31:29.749 --> 00:31:33.950
don't you know this the whole definition
of mental illness I don't know it's very

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:41.179
complicated and I hope I hope that half
broke horses will help explain a little

00:31:41.179 --> 00:31:49.119
bit more about if not what's going on
inside her head her journey thank you

00:31:49.119 --> 00:31:56.179
you were just mentioning the role that
you think that mental illness can play

00:31:56.179 --> 00:32:02.059
in what shapes a writer and earlier when
John Grisham was here he was talking

00:32:02.059 --> 00:32:06.320
about how Mark Twain was one of his
idols uh-huh and I think what a lot of

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:10.429
people don't know is that Mark Twain had
a daughter who was epileptic who drowned

00:32:10.429 --> 00:32:15.289
in a bathtub and I think that man was
never the same afterwards and I was just

00:32:15.289 --> 00:32:20.840
wondering your what your opinion is of
how emotional trauma or just a very

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:26.029
tough life how attempts life affects you
can I take you a letter writer I think

00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:30.139
that everything in life is both a
blessing and a curse I think everything

00:32:30.139 --> 00:32:34.609
is and that is entirely up to us which
one we choose to focus on one of the

00:32:34.609 --> 00:32:37.999
blessings from my childhood is that I'm
a scrapper and a fighter and one of the

00:32:37.999 --> 00:32:41.059
curses from my life is that I'm a
scrapper and a fighter and it took me a

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:44.059
long time to sort of understand that at
a certain point in life it's okay to

00:32:44.059 --> 00:32:50.119
stop fighting but I think I think that
these difficulties that we should that

00:32:50.119 --> 00:32:54.289
we all face no matter how horrible the
experience there's a very valuable

00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:59.059
blessing wrapped inside if you are
willing to receive that gift and but

00:32:59.059 --> 00:33:05.070
it's not always easy it's
I am I am overtime so I guess I got it

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:09.240
I'm getting the hook here so thank you
very much thank you and so II will talk

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:14.270
afterwards thank you thank you thank you

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:21.000
thank you so much thank you this has
been a presentation of the Library of
