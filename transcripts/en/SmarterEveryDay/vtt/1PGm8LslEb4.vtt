00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.130
- A couple of months ago
I made a Twitter thread

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.040
about some weird activity I saw online,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.710
and after I posted that
thread tons of engineers

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.940
from many different tech companies

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.720
reached out to me privately
to tell me their stories.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.160
My interest in all this started one day

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.930
when I was scrolling on YouTube,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.280
and the algorithm served up

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.060
a pretty weird video for me to watch.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.650
You know how the algorithm works, right?

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.040
It looks at your past activity

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.680
and tries to figure out what
you could watch in the future

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.930
that would keep you on
the platform the longest.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.370
It optimizes watch time.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.870
The algorithm suggested
I watch this video.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.530
Now, I'm not a super political guy,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.220
but I know those are important topics,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.650
and it had 138,000 views
and it was only one day old,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.000
so to me this looked like
it was a real news story.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.240
So when I clicked on the
video it got weird fast,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.010
strange music starts playing,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.540
and a robot voice comes on,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.923
and clearly starts reading me a script.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.980
- [Voiceover] After Trump
sends note to Ginsburg,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.129
he breaks silence on
plan for Supreme Court.

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.990
Democrats didn't think Donald would dare.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.160
Get ready, America.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.320
Ruth Bader Ginsburg hasn't been seen

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.500
in public in for 57 days.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.180
- There were red flags all over the place.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.940
The robot voice was reading typos.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.020
The name of the channel itself

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.920
was some generic fake news site.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.430
There's no way this is legitimate news.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.090
But the problem is it
had engagement levels

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.300
that were off the chart.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.130
94% like to dislike ratio.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.360
Look at all these comments.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.520
How can this be happening on
a video of such low quality?

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.720
I started diggin' a little bit deeper,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.210
so I searched YouTube
for the exact same title

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.330
to see what came up,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.610
and whoa, look at this,
all of these videos

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.920
are exactly the same title,
exactly the same script,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.100
but they're all just a
little bit different.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.220
If you play the videos
you get different graphics

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.910
scrolling across the scene.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.920
You might get a different robot voice.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.600
- [Voiceover] Breaking News Mencos,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.580
after Trump sends note to
Ginsburg he breaks silence on plan

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.895
for Supreme Court--

00:01:50.895 --> 00:01:51.860
(orchestral alert)

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.500
- [Voiceover] After Trump
sends message to RBG

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.410
he breaks silence on big
plans for Supreme Court.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.570
- [Voiceover] After Trump
sends note to Ginsburg

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.050
he breaks silence on
plan for Supreme Court.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.609
(loud alert)

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.160
- [Voiceover] After Trump
sends note to Ginsburg

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.860
he breaks silence on
plan for Supreme Court.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.080
- The content was essentially the same,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.270
it was just arranged in a different way.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.930
Different photos, different
B-roll, different title screens.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.040
I'm a YouTuber and I spend some time

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.260
thinking about content ID
systems and things like that,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.840
and it's clear to me that these
manipulations of the video

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.513
and even the audio are attempts
to get around YouTube's

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.540
automated recognition systems.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.810
Let me explain how this works.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.160
YouTube engineers look at the
individual pixels on a video

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.210
and then they use the
values of these pixels

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.390
to perform some type of
mathematical function,

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.560
which gives you a number called a hash.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.790
You then compare hashes to other videos

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.650
that have been uploaded
and try to figure out

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.010
if the same content has been

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.020
uploaded by someone else in the past.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.110
The challenging task
here is to make a system

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.670
that's fast enough to
find the exact copies

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.470
of specific frames of video across

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.130
the entire YouTube library

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.370
while at the same time making it

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.890
smart enough to not be tricked.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.260
How would you do that with math?

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.900
Instead of sampling every pixel,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.800
what if they sampled
specific spots on every video

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.980
and measured the color values
at those specific locations?

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.480
They could then compare those spots

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.930
with every other video
uploaded to YouTube.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.230
But think about what
happens if a sneaky person

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.910
resizes those images.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.160
The colors would change
at those locations.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.710
The same thing would happen
if you rotate the image

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.920
or flip it or even apply
a filter of some kind.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.470
Now I don't know how
YouTube samples these pixels

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.010
or the audio from the video or

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.500
what mathematical functions they use,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.000
but I know that's like a company secret

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.230
because that's how they
defend the platform.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.080
If the bad guys were to figure out

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.720
how these detection algorithms work

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.990
then they could get around them

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.770
and they could beat the defenses.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.150
If you look at these crazy
videos like a software engineer

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.930
you can start to see some
really interesting details.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.210
For example, why would there be

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.510
a globe spinning in this image?

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.660
Well if you think about it,
that's going to change the hash.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.030
What if the YouTube engineers
figured the globe trick out

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.230
and then they shut that technique down?

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.940
Well, in this video the globe is mirrored.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.300
That's going to change the
hash in a different way.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.040
This specific instance is a
counter-counter-countermeasure.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.190
Which is fascinating.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.630
This one is probably my favorite.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.690
Why on earth would they put virtual snow

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.740
falling over the top of a
video of the royal family?

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.630
If you think about it,

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.620
this changes the math
in a kind of random way,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.980
and therefore, YouTube's
ability to detect it.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.390
This is like a new form
of camouflage that's

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.120
using math instead of colors
on this new battlefield

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.750
where daily fights take
place by opposing forces

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.960
of software engineers.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.440
But instead of fighting
over hills or pieces of land

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.170
the winner of these individual skirmishes

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.710
gets a few moments of your time,

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.900
which in today's attention
economy is super valuable.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.430
Because of the original video I found,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.600
I assumed most of this
activity was on the right.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.870
But I found these videos
just two clicks away

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.156
from a mainstream channel on the left.

00:04:52.156 --> 00:04:53.210
(intense music)

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.080
- [Voiceover] Speaker of
the House, Nancy Pelosi

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.012
just keeps racking up
wins over Donald Trump.

00:04:58.012 --> 00:04:59.780
(intense alert)

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.670
- [Voiceover] Speaker of
the House, Nancy Pelosi,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.370
just keeps racking up
wins over Donald Trump.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.210
- It's the exact same stuff just

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.760
trying to manipulate things
in the other direction.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.440
If you look at this channel specifically,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.900
it was started over 10 years ago

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.960
by what appears to be an actual human.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.770
It uploaded a bunch of gaming content.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.460
And then at this moment right here

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.130
it started uploading
videos about politics.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.300
At this point it's clear to me

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.210
this is not just low quality content.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.810
This is a coordinated attack
against the YouTube algorithm,

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.240
complete with countermeasures.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.730
This is a serious, well-funded activity

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.780
done by people meant to do harm.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.090
If you're a teen or
20-something you probably think

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.590
these old people are getting
duped into voting for someone

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.740
that doesn't make sense.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.330
And if you've got a few
more miles on the tires,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.400
you might be looking at the
younger generation and thinking,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.570
man, how are all these manipulative people

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.860
able to whip them up
into a frenzy so easily?

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.520
So is the internet getting worse
because we're getting worse

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.040
and this is just a reflection of us,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.310
or is there actually someone
playing with the dials

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.930
and pitting us against each other?

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.910
Today's social discourse takes place

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.910
on the public forum of the internet.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.640
And front and center in that forum

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.680
are three primary platforms,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.120
YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.900
This video is the first
in a three-part series

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.660
on what exactly these
external forces are doing

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.900
to manipulate our social media platforms

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.260
and how they're doing it.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.170
Now a key to a good lie is to convince you

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.850
that there is no deception.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.410
When I started trying
to research this stuff,

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.500
there's all kinds of
information on the internet,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.460
but it's very difficult to
cut through all the falsehood.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.410
So my approach is pretty simple.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.390
I'm literally going to get on airplanes

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.140
and fly to the engineers who
are trying to beat this stuff

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.150
and have a straight-up
conversation with 'em.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.010
We're gonna get to Twitter
and Facebook later,

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.450
but for the purposes of this video

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.640
let's look at specific active attempts

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.700
to manipulate the YouTube algorithm.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.410
Okay, it's time to move
past the speculation stage

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.360
to the actual engineering data stage.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.870
So I'm here at this
building in California.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.900
The person I'm gonna talk to
does not wanna be on camera,

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.130
so we're gonna respect that,

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.060
but I'm gonna go find out
exactly what went down

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.620
with these specific
videos and report back.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.940
I was just gonna stand
in front of the sign

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:57.773
and tell you what happened,

00:06:57.773 --> 00:07:00.700
but I have to think about
how I'm gonna say this.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.006
This is complicated.

00:07:02.006 --> 00:07:04.610
I don't want to attribute
any words to YouTube here,

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.180
so let's just assume these are my words,

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.570
but there seems to be two types of attack

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.890
against the YouTube algorithm.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.870
Number one, there seems to
be a financial motivation.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.000
People are trying to create videos

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.590
to extract ad revenue from YouTube.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.090
And so this is legitimate content.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.980
There's nothing outside of
the terms of service here,

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.410
except maybe the fame engagement
policies that YouTube has.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.980
But for the most part, it's
legitimate content uploaded

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.550
and meant to extract money from YouTube.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.870
Number two are the ideological attacks.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.330
These are attacks meant
to sway public opinion

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.090
and make people think certain things

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.300
and perhaps even make people
fight with each other.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.270
To understand this
better I rented an office

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.960
in San Francisco to
interview Renee DiResta.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.090
She's an expert in
malicious propaganda online.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.530
Okay, this is Renee DiResta.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.840
She is super smart on, I guess you'd say

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.420
coordinated inauthentic behavior,

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.210
incentivized content on social media

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.510
and how to beat it, right?

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.380
- Yep, I look at how
different types of actors

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.880
manipulate the social
ecosystem across platforms.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.360
- Awesome, I loved your stuff on Rogan

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.397
and Sam Harris podcasts.
- Thank you.

00:08:04.397 --> 00:08:05.640
- You're just great.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.650
If you're paying attention,
you've seen what she does.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.290
I wanna talk about what's
going on on YouTube.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.403
- Okay.

00:08:11.403 --> 00:08:13.940
- Recently I found this
really weird video.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.780
It's clearly manufactured content.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:17.820
And from what I can tell there's

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.670
two reasons that there's
manufactured content.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.870
Number one is it's financially motivated.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.380
And the second thing is ideological.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.350
- Yes.
- Right?

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.183
Is that correct?

00:08:27.183 --> 00:08:28.970
Is there a third component I'm not seeing?

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:29.920
- No, that's correct.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.860
And there's actually a lot of,

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.070
there's actually some overlap there.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.930
Because if you're producing
really partisan content,

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.000
particularly sensational stuff,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.610
you're able to capture engagement

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:39.910
and get people paying attention.

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:42.370
Because particularly right
now in a highly partisan,

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.680
polarized country, people
are looking for that stuff.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.690
And they're not necessarily
paying a lot of attention

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:47.970
to who the source is.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.280
So if you make something
that looks interesting

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.703
you'll be able to
theoretically attract views,

00:08:52.703 --> 00:08:55.340
keep people there, and
then you can both monetize

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.780
and do something divisive.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.590
You're gonna use fake accounts
to social it with end groups

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:00.500
and then you're gonna try to get

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.340
a critical mass of real people

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.940
to come and amplify it.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.140
- In order to get these videos
in front of human eyeballs

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.670
you have to first trick a
robot algorithm type thing,

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.450
and the way you do that is
with artificial engagement.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.250
Artificial engagement
is done with fake logins

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.500
or compromised accounts.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.630
They sell them like wine
on the black market.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.330
A new one's gonna set
you back about a quarter.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.110
A 2014 is gonna set you
back about seven bucks.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.530
Renee showed me some footage
of what she calls a click farm.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:25.840
They use these devices to try

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.820
to artificially inflate engagement online.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.540
You can easily find these places online

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.980
that will sell these
services to you straight up.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.140
- You know, a lot of us,
we use the number of views,

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.690
number of likes, number of followers

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.420
as like a hero stick for quality,

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.450
and so there are hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.230
of these businesses that just
offer you things like views.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.653
So these are people who are just selling,

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:48.463
selling likes.

00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:50.250
Funny enough, based on the number of likes

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.680
on the ad for YouTube likes I would bet

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.101
that they're gaming their
Instagram (mumbles), too.

00:09:55.101 --> 00:09:56.210
(laughing)

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.020
The internet is fake.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.770
- I've been doing this wrong.
(laughing)

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.600
I've been trying to make
quality content this whole time.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.260
The strategy seems to be pretty simple.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.390
You make a bunch of videos
on one particular topic.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.420
You put 'em online and then

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.660
the metadata points to each other, right?

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.280
At this point the artificial
compromised accounts

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.210
are used to give them artificial lift,

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.150
and at some point, one of these videos

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.290
will creep up above the
noise in the algorithm

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.100
and it will start to get
shown to actual humans.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.580
It's really easy to get mad at
YouTube at this point, right?

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.510
Look at all this stuff that's
happening on the platform.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.360
But let's step back, think about it.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.460
If you were a software engineer,

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.710
how would you use math and algorithms

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.370
to detect this activity?

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.100
I would argue that this
is very, very clever,

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.770
and it's very hard to detect
this in an automated way.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.740
If you look at the
engagement on these videos,

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.360
the majority of these comments

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.380
are actual humans discussing the videos.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.620
These are real people
engaging with this content.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.020
From an engineering perspective,

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.420
this is extremely difficult to detect,

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.770
especially at any kind
of meaningful scale.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.490
So we understand the fake
engagement piece, right?

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.960
But think about the
content creation itself.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.090
For a video that I'm
proud of, for example,

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:02.850
it will take dozens of hours

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:04.070
for me to make this thing, right?

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.540
In this one particular
case we're talking about,

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.480
we saw dozens of videos
uploaded in the same day.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.470
So clearly computers are involved.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.670
But how are they doing it?

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.780
Believe it or not, there's already

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.730
an entire industry built
around this technology.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.100
It's a great way to get
these small stories out.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.040
Whatever website you
go to to get your news,

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.300
you've probably seen these things,

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.930
automatically generated videos.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.150
Several companies offer
these types of services.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:26.320
One is called Wochit.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.470
If you go to the Wochit website,

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.930
they boast over 1.5
million videos were created

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.040
on behalf of their customers last month.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.072
These are videos created for
businesses you recognize.

00:11:35.072 --> 00:11:37.760
On their website they
show how the system works.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.000
You type in the topic you
wanna make a video about.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.870
They ingest millions of
pieces of licensed content

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:43.830
from different sources.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.700
You slap in a script and yo
have a video within minutes.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.690
This is a very expensive
business to business service.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.410
But for these businesses trying to make it

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.700
in the attention economy,
it's totally worth it.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.260
Now let's think about YouTube.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.030
The Wochit News YouTube
channel has uploaded

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.167
over 3,000 videos in the last two months.

00:12:01.167 --> 00:12:04.690
Most of these use actual
voice actors reading a script.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.360
This is an incredible amount of content.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.010
Stop and think about what that could mean

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.380
for the future of YouTube.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.220
It works like this.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.860
You have all of this
content like B roll, photos,

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.920
audio, things of that nature.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.390
And it goes into this machine
and out pops these videos.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.300
Which is cool if you're a newsroom

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.190
and you're using a
service like Wochit to try

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.361
to create content for legit users online.

00:12:24.361 --> 00:12:27.290
But the problem is,
this is just technology.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:28.920
Think about what would happen if this

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.540
was developed by people of ill intent.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.520
If you're clever you
can change the content

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.690
that you're putting into the machine

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.390
and the machine can start creating videos,

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.440
each video with its own special flare

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.940
so it can get around the countermeasures

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.770
built into the YouTube
system and you simply

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.730
upload all these to
different YouTube channels

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.140
that you've created
with fake email accounts

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.210
and there you go.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.170
You're suddenly flooding YouTube

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:52.010
with automatically
created content that has

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:53.612
the incentives of making you money

00:12:53.612 --> 00:12:55.780
or changing the way people think.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.900
It's probably mostly
financially motivated.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.628
- I think it's mostly
financially motivated.

00:12:59.628 --> 00:13:03.718
I think Facebook has said the
same thing about propaganda.

00:13:03.718 --> 00:13:05.448
A lot of the stuff on their site,

00:13:05.448 --> 00:13:07.690
coordinated inauthentic activity,

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.240
mostly economically motivated.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.410
Even during 2016, now
the notion of fake news

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.370
is so tied to Russia but fake news

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:16.760
wasn't actually about Russia.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.350
If you remember, back in
2016 during the campaign

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:25.350
it was about people just creating
these hyper-partisan sites

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.280
that were literally fake
news, demonstratively fake,

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.480
Pope endorses Donald Trump
and this kind of stuff.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.560
And it was just pushing
people to the sites

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.340
to try to make money on the ads.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.580
And so that's what I think a
lot of the challenge here is.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.340
The really strong
actors, the nation-states

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.230
that are trying to do this kind of stuff,

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:48.060
will spend the years to build
up the audiences over time

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.500
and then you have these
more fly-by-night operations

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.180
where a blog spins up overnight,

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.200
they game their way into distribution,

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.130
and then they just make money on the ads.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:01.300
- Someone that's doing
this subversive activity,

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.150
if they're doing it we're not gonna know.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.160
- Right, for a long time, for a long time.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.098
Unless they make a mistake.
- So it's happening right now.

00:14:07.098 --> 00:14:08.149
- Yeah.

00:14:08.149 --> 00:14:10.070
- It's happening right now probably

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.475
in the sidebar of this video
people are watching right now,

00:14:12.475 --> 00:14:17.475
we just may not know it's
inauthentic behavior.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.060
- I think it's really
hard to find this stuff.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.640
It gets better and better.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.473
That's the other thing.

00:14:23.473 --> 00:14:27.850
I think people assume it's obviously fake

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:28.913
or obviously,

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.300
obviously incorrect English

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.673
or obviously sensationalist
memes or something like that.

00:14:34.673 --> 00:14:36.810
No, they actually just started repurposing

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.080
their content form our
own real, authentic,

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.910
hyper-partisan pages.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.580
- Can we just stop and be disturbed

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.890
that this is the kind of content

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.830
that's getting real eyeballs?

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:48.990
And I know what you might be thinking,

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.410
well it's clearly different.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.250
I could tell the difference in that.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.060
But think about who I am, right?

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.520
I'm an engineer who
understands countermeasures.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.950
I think through strategy.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.930
I spend hundreds of hours a month

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.960
thinking about the YouTube algorithm.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.320
I tailor my thumbnails, I
understand how titles work.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.690
All of this to say I still got tricked.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.090
And so it's a cat and mouse game.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:11.660
Well basically you have offensive content,

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.940
then you have a countermeasure,

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.000
and then you have a
counter-countermeasure,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.440
and then the YouTube engineers have to

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.740
develop a counter-counter-countermeasure,

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.100
and so this just continuously ratchets up

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.560
and I don't see a way to win,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.145
you're not gonna win this.

00:15:25.145 --> 00:15:25.978
- No you're never gonna win.

00:15:25.978 --> 00:15:27.145
There's no winning.

00:15:27.145 --> 00:15:27.990
It's managing.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.040
- All you have to do is increase the cost

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.950
for the adversary to influence society.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.558
Regardless of whether
this material is made

00:15:35.558 --> 00:15:36.770
in some far-off land to make a quick buck,

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.500
or if it's from a malicious nation

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.940
trying to influence a foreign election,

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.725
it's all taking advantage
of this flaw in your heart,

00:15:45.725 --> 00:15:48.700
the desire to fight with your neighbor.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.910
These people literally
make us hate each other

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.260
and then we turn around
and give them our money.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.020
If your first inclination is to be mad

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.230
at YouTube right now and
some kind of outrage,

00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:59.310
then you don't get it.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.190
Like you don't see what's happening here.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.380
I know these engineers.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.630
They're using all the
math at their disposal

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.630
to try to fix this as
desperately as they can,

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.070
but until our hearts change
towards political grace

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.240
these people are gonna keep
taking advantage of us.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.730
I don't think what kind of laws we make

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.110
to try to get around this,

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.010
they're going to make us fight
and we're gonna sit there

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:22.440
and do it and then close our
eyes and give them our money.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.320
We've got to be smarter than this.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.640
- I think a lot of the countering has

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.900
to be done in the real world, right?

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.570
It's the, I think you had said this

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.040
in a Twitter thread of yours I'd read

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.250
where you talked about the need

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.940
to actively practice--
- Love thy neighbor

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.050
kind of stuff.
- Right, right.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.870
I think that that's, unfortunately,

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:44.090
it is a, they're preying on human biases.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.923
This is the thing, we have a

00:16:44.923 --> 00:16:46.800
brand new information ecosystem, right?

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.640
We have democratized creation of content.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.140
We have no more gatekeepers.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.730
Anyone can say what they
want, do what they want,

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.970
maximized expression, algorithms
to help you find people,

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.470
but ultimately human nature,

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:01.160
like the people have not changed.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.150
So it's this fascinating new information

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.640
environment ecosystem but
with a very old set of biases

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.660
and ways of being that are just kind of

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:11.763
part of the human experience,

00:17:11.763 --> 00:17:13.290
and I don't think we're necessarily

00:17:14.203 --> 00:17:17.870
adept at recognizing what
social media has done to us

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.930
as individuals and as members of society.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.300
And that I think is one
of the key challenges

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.070
where no amount of
regulating of algorithms

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:29.750
or catching of bad guys changes that

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:30.930
kind of fundamental truth.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:35.660
Trying to use real community
to kind of return people

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.830
to that human connection is

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.220
the thing that we're missing right now

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.420
and that's because it's
much harder to do that,

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.380
to create the kind of active
unity that you're talking about

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.940
'cause like who's in charge of doing that.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.590
Normally that would have
been like your churches,

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.270
your neighborhood, your community.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:56.150
I think, I don't know what that looks like

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.790
ported online where everybody's
spending their time.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.410
- I'm not trying to scare you
by showing you all this stuff.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.350
Obviously there's a lot of
hard core engineering thought

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.170
that goes into everything
I just showed you,

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.090
but it's happening.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.340
There are bad actors trying
to manipulate people online

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.520
for financial gain and I don't
think it's YouTube's fault.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.670
When somebody wants to
do bad things to you,

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.300
they're gonna do whatever they can

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.300
to get your data and exploit it.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.550
When I realized this series

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.560
was gonna help educate
people I reached out

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.500
to a company that takes online
internet security seriously,

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.210
and that is ExpressVPN.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:29.043
They were all in.

00:18:29.043 --> 00:18:31.230
They decided to sponsor this video series

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.220
and help make it happen.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.360
If you're not using a VPN you
seriously need to consider it.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.410
Your internet connection
right now is broadcasting

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.540
your IP address, which is the
way people track you online.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.300
Check this out, when I go to this website,

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.880
it tests everything that my
internet connection is leaking.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.030
You can see my IP address,
which I've masked here

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:48.970
'cause I don't want you to see it,

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:50.890
but you can also see where I'm at.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.740
Your internet connection
is doing this right now.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.130
Here's how ExpressVPN works.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:56.740
It's a virtual private network.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.540
You just turn it on with one click.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.520
My internet traffic is now encrypted,

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.440
and going through one
of ExpressVPN's servers

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.690
located throughout the world

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.120
so people can no longer
figure out where I'm located.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.510
I protect myself online with ExpressVPN,

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:10.010
and if you want that same protection

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.510
you can get that by going
to expressvpn.com/smarter,

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.440
you can download ExpressVPN today.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.630
If you get 12 months you get

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.430
an additional three months for free.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.990
That brings the cost down to
less than seven bucks a month.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.670
If you're super smart and you understand

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.430
the technical stuff behind all this,

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:25.950
go do a DNS leak test.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:26.880
It's gonna pass.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.860
It's the fastest one I've ever tested.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.500
TechRadar said this is the number one VPN.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.110
There's a 30-day money back guarantee,

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.670
which I'm confident you're not gonna use

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.210
because I feel comforted knowing that

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.190
my personal information is
protected on the internet.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.700
Expressvpn.com/smarter,

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.480
you can protect your internet
connection right now.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.870
Next up, Twitter and Facebook.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:46.703
They were awesome.

00:19:46.703 --> 00:19:48.480
They let me set up
cameras in the building.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.110
They also let me talk
to some of the engineers

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.984
in charge of building
these countermeasures.

00:19:51.984 --> 00:19:54.260
It is a fascinating discussion.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.100
I hope you'll join me as we continue

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.430
this algorithm manipulation series.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.450
I think this is super important stuff.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.910
If there's someone that
you think could benefit

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.720
from knowing that this is how
the internet actually works,

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.850
please pass this video along to 'em.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.210
Also, consider subscribing if
you feel like this earned it.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.100
This is a ton of work and I hope it

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.880
brings value to your life.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.713
That's it.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:16.260
I'm Destin, you're
getting smarter every day.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.093
Have a good one.
