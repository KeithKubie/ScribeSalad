00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.970
I'm not going to lie, I lie all the time because
I know science and science says lies are GOOD

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.970
for you.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.970
What's true here?

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.460
Do you even know?

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.769
Me either.

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:12.769
Lies.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.389
Hey there liars, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.130
My mom always warned me about lying by telling
fables and stories and anecdotes… but as

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.800
I get older I began to learn that little lies
can be good too.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.800
So what's the truth?

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.170
Is lying bad or good?

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.230
A new study in the Proceedings of the Royal
Society B[a] looked at the effects of deception

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.480
in social networks, and according to their
research, white lies, specifically, smooth

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.910
the flow of interactions and facilitate a
larger, more integrated social group!

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.840
Basically, they're saying white lies are GOOD!

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.800
A study published in the Journal of Basic
and Applied Psychology found we lie 2.92 times

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.870
every 10 minutes!

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.070
That's a lot of fibbing.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.210
Kids learn to deceive by 2 or 3 years old
and start to manipulate their parents.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.640
4 years olds lie once every two hours, and
by six it's every 90 minutes!

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.080
We lie all the time!

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.170
A white lie, is a harmless or trivial falsification,
usually told to avoid hurting someone's feelings

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.720
-- the researchers call this a prosocial lie;
and they're the good kind.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.110
Lies told that are destructive or deceptive,
those are antisocial lies -- and they do the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.340
exact opposite - weakening the bonds between
individuals and breaking down the social structure.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.840
They write in their paper, "The balance between
prosocial and antisocial lies may set constraints

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.740
on the structure of social networks, and hence
the shape of society as a whole."

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.990
Lies can make or break us y'all.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.590
Using mathematical models, the researchers
revealed what most of us already know: when

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.680
an individual participates in antisocial lying
they slowly isolate themselves from their

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.799
social group -- while pro-social liers form
stronger bonds and become more integrated.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.430
This also extends to online social networks
as well.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.321
A study at California State University, Dominguez
Hills // Huh.

00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:53.321
I like that name…

00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:54.321
I wonder why…

00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:57.119
// Looked at lies told on facebook and found
that they are just as varied as lies spoken

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.119
aloud.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.479
How many times have you clicked "like" without
ACTUALLY liking it.

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.250
Maybe you just want to support them, even
if you dislike the post!

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.909
Rationalize away, that's white lie, sistah.

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:13.560
Or what if you post a pretty picture of your
cruise, but you're seasick and you omit that

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.569
from the post -- white lie, brah.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.950
Whether these are pro-social white lies, or
antisocial white lies depends on who they're

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.950
targeting.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.629
And the intent of the post…

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.689
The Journal of Consumer Research found that
even though they're beneficial to the whole,

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.069
white lies FEEL like lies to our brain.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.650
We KNOW we're being dishonest, so we try to
fix it, or make up for our dishonesty to escape

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.890
cognitive dissonance.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.669
Cognitive dissonance is when your brain thinks
one thing and you act differently.

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:47.390
Like if a bad server at a restaurant asks
how your meal was -- usually, we lie.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.560
We save the waiters feelings and keep things
on an even keel!

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.879
According to research into cognitive dissonance,
unless the service was REALLY bad, we will

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.180
often tip more because we want to make up
for our white lie!

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.799
It's silly, but it happens on a subconscious
level.

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.010
It's part of our evolution trying to keep
our social networks balanced.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.840
Are you going to think about your lies as
pro or anti social lies now?

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.569
What's the worst lie you've ever told?

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.220
Tell your lies down below in the comments.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.260
I'm not going to lie to you, I'm really excited
about this upcoming SpaceOut with NASA JPL.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.459
We're going to hangout and talk about what
MSL Curiosity has been doing on Mars for one

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.069
Martian Year (about two Earth years).

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.371
We've got one of the rover's actual drivers,
project scientists, and Bobak Ferdowsi -- the

00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:30.569
mohawk guy who helped get it to Mars in the
first place!

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.239
You should RSVP with the link in the description
to join us -- we're going live at 4pm Pacific

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.239
on July 30! COME!

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.239
You wouldn't want to miss it.

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:37.249
