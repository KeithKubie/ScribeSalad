00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.940
So I have a car here, and
let's say that in 3 hours,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:11.512
this car is able to
travel 150 kilometers.

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:13.470
So what I want to think
about in this video is,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.130
what are some reasonable
ways to express

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.055
the rate at which this car
traveled for those 3 hours?

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:22.680
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.280
and think about it for yourself.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.970
One, you could
calculate the rate.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.670
But also think about
different units

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.900
that you could use
to express that rate,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.012
and which ones would
be useful-- which ones

00:00:32.012 --> 00:00:33.470
what would be
reasonable, and which

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.040
ones would be unreasonable.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.820
So let's just remind
ourselves what rate even is.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.410
So you could think
about distance

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.270
as being equal to
rate times time.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.510
Or you could imagine if you
divide both sides by time,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.510
you could imagine that
distance divided by time

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.955
is equal to rate.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.750
So they've given us a distance,
they've given us a time.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.580
So we could just divide the
distance divided by the time

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.180
to figure out the rates.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.920
And I'm going to
keep the units here.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.670
Because it's really important
to recognize that the units,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.030
to some degree, they can also
be manipulated algebraically.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.500
Now they aren't variables, but
they follow the same rules,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.010
I guess I should say,
as a variable would.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.620
So for example, if
I said, look rate

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.320
is distance divided by time.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.180
So I could say that my
rate in this situation

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:44.025
is going to be 150 kilometers
divided by 3 hours.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.040
So if we just look at
the numeric part of this,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.270
what's 150 divided by 3?

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.250
Well that's going to be 50.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.630
So this is going
to be equal to 50.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.379
But we can keep
the units the way

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:02.670
that they are, right over here.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.960
This is 50 kilometers per hour.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.270
This is what I meant
by saying look,

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.250
we're dividing this quantity,
expressed in kilometers,

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.290
by this quantity,
expressed in hours.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.110
We can divide the numeric
part, 150 divided by 3.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.760
But then we could leave at
the units in that relationship

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.560
that they were before.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.847
So you can kind of algebraically
keep them that way.

00:02:30.847 --> 00:02:32.430
And you'll see in a
second we're going

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.660
to manipulate them
a lot more, using

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.330
what's often called the
dimensional analysis.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.010
But anyway, this is a reasonable
way to express a rate.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.610
50 kilometers per hour.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.650
I can imagine this.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.610
I can imagine that
in 1 hour, you're

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.390
going to go 50 kilometers.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.430
Let's think about other ways
that we could represent that.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.310
So 50 kilometers
per hour-- and this

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.880
is where we're really going to
do some dimensional analysis

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.130
with our units.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.990
So 50 kilometers per hour.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.980
Let's say we want to
express it in terms

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.970
of kilometers per second.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.660
So how could we write
50 kilometers per hour,

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.644
in terms of
kilometers per second?

00:03:16.644 --> 00:03:19.060
Well it's always good, actually,
as a first approximation,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.380
to just think about it.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.580
If you went this far in an hour,
then the number of kilometers

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.100
you go in a second, is that
going to be less, or more?

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.530
Well a second's a much,
much shorter period of time.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.200
There's 3,600
seconds in an hour.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.069
So you're going to go
1/3,600 of this distance.

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.860
But let's think about
how we would actually

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.740
work out with the units.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.390
Well, we want to get rid of
this hours in the denominator.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.460
And the plural,
obviously the grammar

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.880
doesn't hold up
with the algebra,

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.970
but this could be hour or hours.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.230
So we could think
about well, 1 hour--

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.980
I'll write an hour in
the numerator that's

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.730
going to cancel with this
hour in the denominator.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.660
But we want it in
terms of seconds.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.380
So 1 hour is equal
to how many seconds?

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.130
Well 1 hour is equal
to 3,600 seconds.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.610
This is what I meant
by saying that using

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.430
dimensional analysis, which
is what I'm doing right now,

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.920
we can essentially
manipulate these units,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.670
as we would traditionally
do with a variable.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.150
So we have hours
divided by hours.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.300
And so when we do
the multiplication,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.000
we can multiply
the numeric parts.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.450
So we have 50 times
1, divided by 3,600.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.670
Let me write that.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:42.210
50 times 1 over 3,600.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.230
And then our units left
are kilometers per second.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.450
Or I could say seconds.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.180
So we can play around with
the plural and singular

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.970
parts of it, but I'll just write
it as kilometers per second.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.610
And so this is 50/3,600.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.750
And this fits our intuition.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.410
In a second, you're going to go
1/3,600 as far as you would go

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.670
in an hour.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.880
But let's actually think
about what this is equal to.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.295
50/3,600-- so this is
going to be the same thing,

00:05:15.295 --> 00:05:18.250
as-- Let me just
simplify it over here.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:28.600
So 50/3,600 is the
same thing as 5/360,

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.954
which is the same thing as-- let
me write it this way-- 10/720.

00:05:34.954 --> 00:05:36.870
And I did that way because
that makes it clear

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.328
that that's the
same thing as 1/72.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.370
So you could write
this as, you're going,

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:55.500
this is equal to 1/72 of
a kilometer per second.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.810
Now I would claim
that this is not

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.000
so reasonable of units for
this example right over here.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.590
1/72 of a kilometer
every second?

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.840
That doesn't help me too much.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.810
I guess I'll know
that in 72 seconds

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.110
I will have gone a kilometer.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.410
But this is something that's
kind of strange for me

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.270
to conceptualize.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.490
If I wanted to get
my calculator out,

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:21.500
1/72, 1 divided by
72-- if someone said,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.850
hey, I'm going 0.0139
kilometers in a second,

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.310
that doesn't seem to make a
lot of conceptual sense to me.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.020
So I would say that
this, right over here,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.470
is a very reasonable
way to express our rate.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.680
This one seems like more
of an unreasonable way.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.500
But we could salvage this.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.970
Because we're going 1/72
of a kilometer per second.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.870
Now this is a small
number, but how could

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.429
we make it much larger?

00:06:50.429 --> 00:06:51.970
Well, what if we
thought in terms of,

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.010
not kilometers per
second, but if we

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.630
thought in terms of
meters per second.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.250
A kilometer's 1,000 meters.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.800
So if we think about this in
terms of meters per second,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.410
we're going to get a
larger number here,

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.460
in fact larger by
a factor of 1,000.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.870
So let's think about that.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.360
Let's try to convert this
kilometers to meters.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.410
So how would we do that?

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.520
Well, once again, if
we have kilometers

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.890
in the denominator
this kilometer

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.379
will cancel with that kilometer.

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:22.920
And we want a meter
in the numerator.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.044
So we want to think about
how many meters are there

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:25.950
per kilometer.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.730
Well there's 1,000
meters per kilometer.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:35.350
Kilometers cancel out, and we
are left with 1,000 times 1--

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:42.470
I'll just write that
as 1,000-- over 72.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.270
And now we're left
with in the numerator,

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.995
we're left with the
unit meters per second.

00:07:51.195 --> 00:07:53.320
And I know I keep writing
second in different ways.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.620
Oftentimes actually you'll see
people write second like that.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.161
So actually let me
just go with that.

00:07:57.161 --> 00:08:01.150
So s is second, is seconds,
is sec, just like that.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.020
So is this fairly reasonable?

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.765
Well actually, this
feels pretty good.

00:08:04.765 --> 00:08:07.140
Let's get our calculator out
and figure out what that is.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:13.940
So 1,000 divided by 72
gives us 13, if I round,

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.460
that's about 13.9.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:26.810
So this is approximately equal
to 13.9 meters per second.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:27.980
Which I can visualize.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.620
I can imagine how
far 13.9 meters

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.730
is, and of doing that
distance in one second.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.840
So this actually also
seems like a reasonable way

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.750
to express the rate.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.740
So I could say hey, this thing's
going 50 kilometers per hour.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:48.490
I can imagine it going roughly
13.9 meters per second.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.170
So this is reasonable as well.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:54.310
But to say it's going 1/72
of a kilometer per second

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.589
doesn't really
seem to make sense.

00:08:56.589 --> 00:08:58.880
And also, if I try to think
about it in terms of meters

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.580
per hour, that also
would be strange.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.329
Actually, I encourage
you to calculate it.

00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:06.030
Try to convert this right
over here to meters per hour.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.510
Then we would say well, we
could use the same thing here.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:15.110
That's going to be 1,000
meters for every 1 kilometer.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.750
Kilometers cancel out.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.420
And I'm going to be
left with 50 times

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:27.420
1,000 is 50,000 meters per hour.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.792
So I have trouble
imagining-- well,

00:09:29.792 --> 00:09:31.750
obviously if I convert
to kilometers in my head

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.430
I could imagine it-- but this
is kind of a crazy large number.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.500
50,000 meters per hour.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.380
So at least in my eyes,
using kilometers per hour

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.350
to describe this
rate seems useful.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.190
Describing this rate as meters
per second seems useful.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.280
But describing it as kilometers
per second, or meters per hour,

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.999
seem a little bit unusual.
