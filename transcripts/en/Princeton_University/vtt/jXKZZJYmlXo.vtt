00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.497
[MUSIC]

00:00:05.497 --> 00:00:09.044
ALEX WHEATLEY: We are at Littlebrook Elementary and we're Reading with the Tigers.

00:00:09.044 --> 00:00:11.654
So we're going in, we went in to
kindergarten, first-

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:13.357
and second-grade classes today.

00:00:13.357 --> 00:00:14.499
STUDENT READING: Take three,
face the wolf,

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.166
and bow deeply,
for ninjas are very polite.

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.378
MALLORY REMICK: I actually
read a book called "I'm Bored"

00:00:20.378 --> 00:00:24.514
about a potato who's bored, and
we read a book about a shark

00:00:24.514 --> 00:00:26.645
and a train, and a unicorn,
and they were --

00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:30.933
It was a really cool experience to see
how excited the kids were to read

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:35.499
the stories and hear what's going on,
and interact with the stories,

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:39.254
and tell us about their toys,
and what they would do if they

00:00:39.254 --> 00:00:40.367
had a potato.

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:41.941
ALEX WHEATLEY: I had
Ms. Federico's class.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:43.989
I read "Dylan the Villain."
It was great.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.510
I really enjoyed it.
I got some laughs so

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.518
I think it went well.

00:00:47.518 --> 00:00:50.755
STUDENT READING: She picked up the tiny thing to consider it more closely.

00:00:50.755 --> 00:00:53.140
"Are you a duck?," she asked.
"Quack!"

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:56.831
JAKE STRAIN: I was in a second-grade
classroom and actually read

00:00:56.831 --> 00:00:58.488
the Abbott and Costello bit
"Who's on First?"

00:00:58.488 --> 00:01:01.297
At first I was like, are they
gonna get this? I don't know.

00:01:01.297 --> 00:01:03.166
But the kids, they loved it, and
every time I got to a new page,

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.576
"Oh, I get it, Who is their name!
That's awesome!"

00:01:05.576 --> 00:01:07.668
BYRON SANBORN: I was in a
kindergarten classroom

00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:10.730
and I was reading a book called
"Shark vs. Train."

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.704
It was very exciting.
The kids were delighted.

00:01:13.704 --> 00:01:17.703
And I found out that a bunch
of them are avid swimmers,

00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:20.634
which was very exciting when they
found out that we were swimmers.

00:01:20.634 --> 00:01:24.375
They were all very stoked to tell us about
how great of a swimmer they all were.

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:26.256
ALEX WHEATLEY: They had all sorts
of questions, like,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.952
Who are you going to play?
What was the best game?

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:29.647
How does it feel to be an athlete
at Princeton?

00:01:29.647 --> 00:01:31.239
Which are good questions.

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:32.803
But it is fun, and it's --
You know that they come to games

00:01:32.803 --> 00:01:35.355
and some of them know me already,

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.881
because Ms. Federico's class
is also our pen pal class.

00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:43.353
STUDENT READING: June 15.
My school picture came out terrible.

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:46.950
Mom says next time I better have all
my eyes looking in the same direction.

00:01:46.953 --> 00:01:49.662
MALLORY REMICK: Princeton has
given athletes so much,

00:01:49.662 --> 00:01:52.509
and it's a great opportunity
for us to serve the community,

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.861
and give back, and take a little time
out of our day to just be here

00:01:56.861 --> 00:01:59.721
for everyone else in this community
that's really done so much for us.

00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:04.161
STUDENT READING: And finally,
Duck knew what it was to fly.

00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:07.971
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:09.756
ALEX WHEATLEY: I think
Reading with the Tigers

00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:12.837
is an amazing example of
"Achieve. Serve. Lead."

00:02:12.837 --> 00:02:16.524
It is a chance for us to
directly give back to the community

00:02:16.524 --> 00:02:18.646
in a way that we were them
15 years ago,

00:02:18.646 --> 00:02:20.400
and look where we are now --

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.792
Best school in the nation,
playing the sport we love.

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:27.067
So it's a direct way to give back
to the community and love doing it.
