but in the end when you look back they
 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.109
but in the end when you look back they

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890
technology can take us if we make the
 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.160

best use of it fortunately most people

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170

I think at bottom when it comes to
 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.560
I think at bottom when it comes to
newness and technological evolution most

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570
newness and technological evolution most
 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.300

which is one of my points but i think we

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990
which is one of my points but i think we
 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.529
which is one of my points but i think we
are ultimately on the right path and we

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539
are ultimately on the right path and we
 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:05.910
are ultimately on the right path and we
will get to a better place with these

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920
will get to a better place with these
 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.930
will get to a better place with these
gadgets
