Hi Michael.
&gt;&gt; Hi Charles, How's it going?

00:00:01.596 --> 00:00:03.600
&gt;&gt; It's going quite well,
how's it going with you?

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.380
&gt;&gt; Not too bad.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.670
What are we going to talk about today?

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.280
&gt;&gt; Well what does the screen say?

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.300
&gt;&gt; It looks like a wordle.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.530
&gt;&gt; Yes it's a wordle.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.150
It's generalizing generalizing and
the key words are.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.330
&gt;&gt; Abstraction, scale, search.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.870
&gt;&gt; What we're going to do is I'm
going to try to jump off from some of

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.940
the discussions that we had earlier
that you lead, about generalization.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.470
And try to sort of hop up a level above
that and talk about abstraction and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.040
scale and search and sort of the things
that make machine learning and

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.620
reinforcement learning,
in particular, hard.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.780
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, but it seems to me that I
talked about function approximation,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.410
and everything is
a function approximation.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.000
So, why is there more to say?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
&gt;&gt; Well, we'll find out.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.258
That's the whole point
of today's lesson.

00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:43.730
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.760
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, let's get going.
