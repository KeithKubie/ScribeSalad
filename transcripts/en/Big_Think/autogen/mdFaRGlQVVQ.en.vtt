different than they used to be and
that's still a change process that I

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140
that's still a change process that I
 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.350
that's still a change process that I

communication landscape is the shift
from the necessity of being able to

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920
communication now rather than either
 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.480
communication now rather than either
orthogonal or accidental or you know a

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490
orthogonal or accidental or you know a
 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.390
orthogonal or accidental or you know a
nice-to-have you know this is the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400
nice-to-have you know this is the
 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.220
nice-to-have you know this is the
fundamental nature of many of the

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230
fundamental nature of many of the
 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.020
fundamental nature of many of the
communication mechanisms we use are

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030
communication mechanisms we use are
 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.120
communication mechanisms we use are
bi-directional now and that means our

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130
bi-directional now and that means our
 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.130
bi-directional now and that means our
habits have to change yeah I mean I

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140
habits have to change yeah I mean I
 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.230
habits have to change yeah I mean I
think one of the one of the great

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240
think one of the one of the great
 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.000
think one of the one of the great
advantages of digital technologies is

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010
advantages of digital technologies is
 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.100
advantages of digital technologies is
the capacity to listen at scale but

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110
the capacity to listen at scale but
 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.410
the capacity to listen at scale but
something that wasn't possible before

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420
something that wasn't possible before
 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.100
something that wasn't possible before
digital tools right the ability to to

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110
digital tools right the ability to to
 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.490
digital tools right the ability to to
take to use data and to use sort of

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500
take to use data and to use sort of
 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.740
take to use data and to use sort of
smart sort of tools and listening to

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750
smart sort of tools and listening to
 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.479
smart sort of tools and listening to
listening tools you know things like

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489
listening tools you know things like
 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.880
listening tools you know things like
radian6 and Crimson hexagon and there

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890
radian6 and Crimson hexagon and there
 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.110
radian6 and Crimson hexagon and there
are a lot of these platforms out there

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120
are a lot of these platforms out there
 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.750
are a lot of these platforms out there
for those sort of you see them mostly in

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760
for those sort of you see them mostly in
 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.090
for those sort of you see them mostly in
sort of Enterprise marketing spaces but

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100
sort of Enterprise marketing spaces but
 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.680
sort of Enterprise marketing spaces but
work really well in politics and social

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690
work really well in politics and social
 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.969
work really well in politics and social
good and these other places to get a

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979
good and these other places to get a
 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.830
good and these other places to get a
sense for what people believe in think

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840
sense for what people believe in think
 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.260
sense for what people believe in think
in social conversations because so

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270
in social conversations because so
 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.909
in social conversations because so
this conversation is happening in public

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919
this conversation is happening in public
 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.719
this conversation is happening in public
and so the question about listening is

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729
and so the question about listening is
 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.469
and so the question about listening is
mostly a cultural one right the tools

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479
mostly a cultural one right the tools
 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.820
mostly a cultural one right the tools
these tools aren't perfect and they're

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830
these tools aren't perfect and they're
 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.499
these tools aren't perfect and they're
not all you know some of them are pretty

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509
not all you know some of them are pretty
 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:40.040
not all you know some of them are pretty
expensive

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050
expensive
 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.890
expensive
so not necessarily the easiest things to

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900
so not necessarily the easiest things to
 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.619
so not necessarily the easiest things to
implement and building skills and hiring

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629
implement and building skills and hiring
 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.510
implement and building skills and hiring
people and thinking about this as a

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520
people and thinking about this as a
 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.580
people and thinking about this as a
skill set that needs to be part of your

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590
skill set that needs to be part of your
 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.969
skill set that needs to be part of your
team as part of this process but before

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979
team as part of this process but before
 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.369
team as part of this process but before
any of that is a belief that listening

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:55.379
any of that is a belief that listening
 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:58.480
any of that is a belief that listening
is important but a belief and and

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490
is important but a belief and and
 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.170
is important but a belief and and
creating a culture where questioning

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180
creating a culture where questioning
 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.390
creating a culture where questioning
your own certainty and validating your

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400
your own certainty and validating your
 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.249
your own certainty and validating your
own certainty and putting the community

own certainty and putting the community
 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:12.050
own certainty and putting the community
first in terms of how how you want to be

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060
first in terms of how how you want to be
 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.719
first in terms of how how you want to be
able to reach and inspire the people

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729
able to reach and inspire the people
 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.029
able to reach and inspire the people
that you're trying to engage whether

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039
that you're trying to engage whether
 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.339
that you're trying to engage whether
that's selling a product or trying to

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349
that's selling a product or trying to
 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.969
that's selling a product or trying to
win an election right these things are

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979
win an election right these things are
 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.050
win an election right these things are
this is just a function of how the

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060
this is just a function of how the
 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.510
this is just a function of how the
landscape works this is not particularly

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520
landscape works this is not particularly
 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.800
landscape works this is not particularly

partisan it's not particularly about
 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.980
partisan it's not particularly about
politics but it requires a cultural

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990
politics but it requires a cultural
 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.589
politics but it requires a cultural
belief in the value of listening which

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599
belief in the value of listening which
 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.180
belief in the value of listening which
is not something that that all leaders

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190
is not something that that all leaders
 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.839
is not something that that all leaders
come by naturally and I think part of

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849
come by naturally and I think part of
 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.330
come by naturally and I think part of
part of this is a discussion about the

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340
part of this is a discussion about the
 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.570
part of this is a discussion about the
value of empathy right and of the value

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580
value of empathy right and of the value
 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.360
value of empathy right and of the value
of really the necessity of understanding

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370
of really the necessity of understanding
 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.149
of really the necessity of understanding
the values and beliefs and emotions

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:55.159
the values and beliefs and emotions
 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:58.360
the values and beliefs and emotions
behind what people value and believed as

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370
behind what people value and believed as
 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.219
behind what people value and believed as
part of building real relationships with

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229
part of building real relationships with
 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:04.100
part of building real relationships with
people and this is where again digital

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110
people and this is where again digital
 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.980
people and this is where again digital
tools make starting relationships with

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990
tools make starting relationships with
 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.920
tools make starting relationships with
more people easier but maintaining

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930
more people easier but maintaining
 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.559
more people easier but maintaining
relationships is still work right so

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:12.569
relationships is still work right so
 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:14.930
relationships is still work right so
this is one of the great challenges of

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940
this is one of the great challenges of
 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.390
this is one of the great challenges of
large-scale community organizing which

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400
large-scale community organizing which
 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.760
large-scale community organizing which
is the things that we were able to do

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770
is the things that we were able to do
 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.980
is the things that we were able to do
particularly back in 2008 with the first

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990
particularly back in 2008 with the first
 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.519
particularly back in 2008 with the first
Obama campaign when we were sort of

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:24.529
Obama campaign when we were sort of
 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.019
Obama campaign when we were sort of
shredding a lot of new ground just

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:27.029
shredding a lot of new ground just
 

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:28.850
shredding a lot of new ground just
because timing has a lot to do with the

because timing has a lot to do with the
 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.620
because timing has a lot to do with the
success of a rain dance the that there's

it created the ability for us to have

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639
it created the ability for us to have
 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:38.540
it created the ability for us to have
millions of volunteers which we could

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550
millions of volunteers which we could
 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.490
millions of volunteers which we could
never have recruited without these new

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500
never have recruited without these new
 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.240

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.219

we just couldn't have had that many

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:43.229
we just couldn't have had that many
 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:45.200
we just couldn't have had that many
meetings I just would have run out of

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210
meetings I just would have run out of
 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.760
meetings I just would have run out of
hours in the day and time in the

hours in the day and time in the
 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.529
hours in the day and time in the
campaign and and it allowed us to

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539
campaign and and it allowed us to
 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:50.689
campaign and and it allowed us to
accelerate the recruiting process and

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699
accelerate the recruiting process and
 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:53.270
accelerate the recruiting process and
the engagement process by creating more

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280
the engagement process by creating more
 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.100
the engagement process by creating more
doors and more ways into the campaign

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110
doors and more ways into the campaign
 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.770
doors and more ways into the campaign
for more people but me making sure all

for more people but me making sure all
 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.540
for more people but me making sure all
of those millions of people felt

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550
of those millions of people felt
 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.089
of those millions of people felt
valuable and heard and respected and

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:02.099
valuable and heard and respected and
 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:04.490
valuable and heard and respected and
part of the process and enabled to do

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500
part of the process and enabled to do
 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.529
part of the process and enabled to do
good work that had value that was on

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:06.539
good work that had value that was on
 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:08.899
good work that had value that was on
mission is an enormous commitment of

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:08.909
mission is an enormous commitment of
 

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:11.959
mission is an enormous commitment of
work and there are thousands of field

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:11.969
work and there are thousands of field
 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:14.420
work and there are thousands of field
organizers in the Obama community who

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430
organizers in the Obama community who
 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.369
organizers in the Obama community who
did the work of supporting those

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:16.379
did the work of supporting those
 

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:18.679
did the work of supporting those
relationships and I think this is one of

00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:18.689
relationships and I think this is one of
 

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:22.339
relationships and I think this is one of
the big shifts in thinking about from

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:22.349
the big shifts in thinking about from
 

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:24.830
the big shifts in thinking about from
audience to community right we're

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840
audience to community right we're
 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.769
audience to community right we're
speaking at someone and saying the right

00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:27.779
speaking at someone and saying the right
 

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:29.719
speaking at someone and saying the right
thing to you at the right time in the
