&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:22.600
[ Pause ]

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.900
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Welcome back.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.870
For those that do not know who
I am, my name's Nick Brown.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.700 position:56%
I'm one of the music specialists who
produces the concert series here.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.030
Thank you all for being wonderful
concertgoers this afternoon

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.430
and braving the cold

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.410
and the security lines
and all that business.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.750
It was such a pleasure
to have Anne-Marie

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.510
and Alban perform for
us this afternoon.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:51.130
[ Applause ]

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.870
And the goal was just to have
a brief, informal conversation

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.220
and then we'll let the
audience ask some questions

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.520
because I'm sure they'd
rather talk [inaudible].

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.160
The first question I have

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.310
for you both is what inspired
the program selections today?

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.050
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: Well, actually
the program was designed for Europe

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:18.470
because we American pianist
and German cellist could do

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.770
[ inaudible ]

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.070
program.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.820
So the original program
was actually instead

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.350
of the Britten it was the
Villa-Lobos sonata but actually

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.960
after looking, it looked very
good on paper, but when we started

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.300
or when I started looking
closer, I really didn't thought,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.110
think it fit as well
to the other pieces.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.410
So we kicked out the Villa-Lobos

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.900
since we had played the Britten
before, and we loved it so much,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.040 position:56%
I think it's one of the best pieces
of German music in the 20th century.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.900
So we threw it in, and
Britten spoke English.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:58.810
So at some point America was
England and whatever, so.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.210
But.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.990
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Well, no,
I was just going to add, you know,

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.590
it's always fun putting
programs together.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.400
You try and think of
thematic elements

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.910 position:56%
and connective tissue throughout the
program, but the other element of it

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.700
that I always like to pay attention
to is what really works musically.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.910
And so when Alban and I, we went
back and forth and back and forth

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.770
and back and forth with
these programs by email,

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.580
and, you know, just discussed what
actually works back and forth.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.310 position:56%
"Bernstein Meditations" was a bit of
a stretch off the beaten path, and,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.380
but I think in the
context of this program,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.220
it actually works really well
after intuition when, you know,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.340
everybody can kind
of just get absorbed

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.790
into Bernstein's world there.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.570
So it was, you know, it was
this combination, I think,

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.540
of trying to have a somewhat
thematic program and also wanting

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.230
to play repertoire that worked.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.910
OK.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.890
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: Well,
actually, we say it's fun

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.970
to put together programs, but
you're talking more as pianist.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.390
As a cellist, because
there is nothing, no fun.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.980
We had to sometimes
put things together,

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.080
which might look [like] not work
as well because there is just

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.040
so little repertoire
compared to pianists.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.240
I mean, with pianists, that's
sensational what you can do but -

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.540
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Yeah -

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.840
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: We have nothing.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: So perhaps as
a follow-up to that, how do the both

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.250
of you approach programming
for chamber settings

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.140
that you're performing in
versus programming for, say,

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.720
a festival that you
might be involved in?

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.160
I know you have artistic
directorships that you,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.400
how much of the programming
do you do for that,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.340
and what's the difference
between your approach

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.640
for when you're performing

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.040
versus when you're just
programming for someone else?

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.140
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: I
don't think it's different.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.270
You know, I just, whether it's
programming for recitals for Alban

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.900
and I have together or
programming for festival,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.230
the only difference might
be in the festival context,

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.770
you have to just make sure
there's enough rehearsal time,

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.720
and you have to make sure
you're inviting musicians

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.370
who feel there's enough rehearsal
time to put the program together.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.190
But, you know, it's all
about just presenting great,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.490
compelling music really
when it comes down to it.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.790
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: And
then at the end of the day,

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.090
it doesn't really matter.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.360
If it makes any sense, I always,
when I put programs together,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.010
I think of myself as the little
boy who loved to go to concerts

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.240
and hated to be bored
at the concert.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.260 position:56%
So I want to put program, I want to
put programs together where I could,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.540
which I could enjoy
myself as a listener,

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.980
and my worst experience ever
was listening to all Bach suites

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.270
from the teacher I had
worked with when I was 11

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.130
or so, and I listened to them.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.050
I hated, actually for the longest
time, I didn't like Bach afterwards

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.320
because he put me to sleep.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.780
It was awful, and that's.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:56.340
Don't ever play Bach suites
as boring as this time.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.640
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: On that note.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.560
One question that just came
to mind is have you ever

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.300
in your touring career
noticed an audience

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.850
in a certain city evolve at all?

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.150
Like -

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.450
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott:
Absolutely -

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.750
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
One decade to another -

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Absolutely,
and one, you know, I'm a New Yorker

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.780
through and through, and
I'll always be a New Yorker.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.580
So I'm blessed with a
great audience in New York.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.880
They're great.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.620
The Washington audience,
yes, they're great.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.120
Hey, these are my people,
and I love --

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.150
I mean, the New York audience is
a little noisy, but I love them.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.850
No, but they're, they
are passionate.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.440
They say what they think and,
in fact, I'll tell you a really,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.320
really quick little story
because this is just

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.740
so typical of a New York audience.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.290
A violinist and I were
recording, doing a live recording

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:52.200
of a Poulenc violin sonata, and
the last movement is more violent

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.180
so it's very feisty, and comes

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.350
to this crashing chord,
and then a fermata.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.170
So we're doing, we
tell the audience,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.720
live audience we're doing
a recording, and, yet,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.040
play the crashing chord,
silence, and the little lady

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.340
in the second row goes,
"Jesus Christ".

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.710
But, you know, I mean,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.950
the Washington audience is another
incredibly intelligent cultured

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.980
audience, and I mean that because
I played down here so many years,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.590
and I have a ton of
family down here.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.920
But, you know, I have a case
where I, I'm artistic director

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.770
at a festival in Provo --
I mean in Vail, Colorado.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.510
Tremendous festival, but people
weren't really loving the chamber

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.810
music as much as they needed

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.130
to love the chamber music,
and -- in my opinion.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.330
So, you know, and I've
been there six years,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.750
and I've seen a real evolution,
and one of the ways I found was

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.750
with just a couple of
key people, I would say,

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.330
it's the ones who would say, no.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.770 position:56%
I have no interest in chamber music.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.510
I'd say, you know what, just
come and sit in on rehearsal.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.810
Just be my guest.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.110
Just come, sit ten minutes.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.730
That's all, and one gentleman
in particular who came,

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.210
first day he sat ten minutes.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.930
The next day he sat for an hour.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.900
He started coming to
all the rehearsals,

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.040
and now he's a subscriber
[inaudible].

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.470
You know, so it's, I think,
sometimes it's our role to try

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.240
and -- help is the wrong word.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.870
Try and turn people on, I guess, to
what it is we're so in love with,

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.160
and see that audience can evolve.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.220
You know, I have a - Ida Kavafian,
a great, great colleague of mine.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.360
She runs a festival in
Angel Fire, New Mexico.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.140
So we always joke, it's the
musicians and the bears,

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.720
and she's been running this
thing for thirty years, I think.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.800
She has cultivated an incredible
audience who come from all

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.290
over the country and all
over the local region

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.640
because they trust
Ida, and, you know.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.340
So it's, I think it's possible,
like, to see audiences evolve.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.640
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Great.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.940
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: [multiple
speakers] I was really wrong.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.240
I'm sorry.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.340
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Do
you have an answer on that?

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.040
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: No?

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: The final
question that I have for you relates

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.530
to the manuscripts that I heard
you got to peek at earlier,

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.390
and this being a unique
venue where we get

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:14.580
to put forth archival materials
that are the originals for many

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.480
of the works that are performed
here, how did that impact you as a,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.780
as performers today, or did

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.090
that spark any new thoughts
for the performance?

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.390
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Fear.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.890
No.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.190
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: Well,
we didn't actually get

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.990
to see, we only saw the covers.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.020
So that didn't change anything,
but actually I wanted to,

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.260
I had some open questions
about the Barber.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.830
So I, we wanted to look at
some spots, but I'll be back

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.040
in May so then I'll visit.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.610
Because most of the 20th century

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.670
and 21st century editions,
they're edited.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.470
So with Mozart, Beethoven,
and Bach, we have urtexts now,

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.640
but 20th century, there's
often just, for me, a cellist,

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.200
Rostropovich putting his things
in there, and all over the place.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.090
You don't even know anymore
what the composer wanted.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.940 position:56%
With Barber there's some things that
I think [inaudible] really the thing

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.490
that he wants that some
cellists try to improve,

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.400
and then you should never
let cellists improve.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.920
I mean, only can get worse.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.220
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Do you
have any thoughts any that -

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.890
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott:
I, I, it's always amazing

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.880
to see a composer's hand and
how they wrote, you know,

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.310
because they vary so much.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.610
All I said when I looked

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.920
at the manuscripts was I'm
really happy I'm not performing

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.600
from manuscripts.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.900
Because they can, depending

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.620
on the composer there,
can be all over the map.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:40.570
It can be, I would have definitely
had classes on the [inaudible].

&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: I have another
question before we turn it over.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.370
How did you two start
working together?

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:51.260
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Should I
tell you or [do] you want to tell?

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.990
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: Actually, it's,

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.350
it's only our second concert
ever I think, and we --

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:58.650
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: No.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:09:59.950
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: Well.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:01.250
No. Our second recital ever.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.550

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.850
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: No.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.150
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott:
Oh, OK, fine, second -

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.690
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: We played
single pieces here and there -

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:08.990
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Oh, OK -

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.290
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt:
But we never play.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.590
So, and that's actually ages ago.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.320
I mean, the first recital
was in October last year,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.040
and now this number two,
but that we collaborated --

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.280
-- in festival, that
was '94, '95, '96.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.770
I lived in New York, and I was part
of this young concert artist thing,

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:31.530 position:56%
which you had visited earlier on,
and you're still involved with them.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.830
So that's how we met.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.670
We met at Spoleto Festival,
and we became friends.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.040
We lived five blocks away.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.480
I lived 114.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.010
You lived 108, no.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.480
Right across from Absolute Bagels.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.780
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Yes.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:45.470
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: And, and then
I didn't cross, we didn't meet

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:48.710
that often because you
were never there, but --

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:53.470
-- but, actually, we had
such great pizza parties,

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.430
and my first Jim Carrey
movie I watched with you is.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.500
I managed to get you out
of your unhealthy marriage.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.350
And you got a great husband also.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.050
I had to twist your arm.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.050
We were actually very close,
and then I moved away,

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.630
then we lost touch, actually.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:09.930
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Yeah.

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.740
Yeah. It's, you know, I just want
to add that it's, you know, the --

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.760
we met during very formative years

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.590
at Spoleto Festival
down in Charleston, and.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.120
[Inaudible] no, I was just
four or five, and, you know,

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.040
but you know what's
amazing is even when,

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.370
with some of greatest
colleagues back then,

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.950
we totally instantaneously clicked
when we were playing together, and,

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.140
in fact, we did the Britten
sonata way back then.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:37.010 position:56%
And then, you know, life happens,
and you go, and Alban, how dare him,

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.040
he left New York, and, you know.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.200 position:56%
So we both went on, and we've been
having our careers, and all of this,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.830
and then, you know, we reconnected,
and then we thought, you know what,

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:51.850
this is just too good a
partnership when we play together.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.760
Just so you know immediately
when you work with somebody,

00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:00.350
it's just very natural and very
inspiring for us to do this.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.420
So now it's our intention
we'll be doing more.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.690
We're doing a couple of concerts
in Europe end of next week.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.340
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt:
We're doing a couple

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.810
of concerts next week,
but not in America.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.110
That's good.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.100
We leave this country
with our garbage.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.190
I'd love to open it up
to the audience now.

hand, and my colleague, Solomon,

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.840

&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
You know, whatever.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.830
&gt;&gt; Well, what made
you, what made you,

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:49.810 position:56%
what inspired you to play the music?

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.330
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott:
Well, I -- how old are you?

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:54.630
&gt;&gt; Seven.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:55.930
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott:
You're seven.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.230
So when I was about five, my
mother took me to a concert.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.310
I don't remember who was
playing, but it was a concerto.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.860
So it was the piano soloist
in front of an orchestra,

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.290
and there was a big spotlight
on the piano and the soloist,

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.160
and that hugely impacted
me because I thought

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.440
that was the most glamorous,
powerful thing I'd ever seen.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.070
And so it challenged me, and
then I started, I just was hungry

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.830
to play the piano, and --

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:23.060
So that was really the first
key thing was just the sound

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.120
of the piano, and what incredible
sounds the piano can make.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.310
[Inaudible] I don't
even remember the piece.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.900
I just remember the
spotlight on the piano.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.510
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: So you care more
about the spotlight than the music.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:47.130
[ Laughter ]

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:51.140
Well, what my parents -- your
parents weren't musicians.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.440
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: No, no -

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.990
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: So I, but
my parents were musicians.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.300
I didn't know there's another
profession than musician.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.040
So it was quite boring.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.270
I listened to music all
my life, and I didn't know

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.570
or could do anything else,

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.950
and I was a bit nerdy, and I still
am, but I was even more nerdy than.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:09.250
I never left home.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:14.790
I just played generally the
piano, and with a, oh, what is it.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.360
These little things, these
blue things with white hands.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.940

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.350
Yeah. I [inaudible] Smurfs.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.650
Cello, piano, and Smurf.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.220
And I went to concerts a lot.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.780
So actually I love
going to concerts.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.390
I still do, but when I
was little, once my --

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.340
I got punished because I
hadn't done the homework,

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.140
and my parents punished me by not
taking me to a Bruckner symphony.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:45.510
I mean, normal kids get punished by
being taken to a Bruckner symphony.

you so much for that.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:07.590
It was beautiful.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:12.200
Does keeping the music down on
the piano help you see better?

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.500
Is that -

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.800
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Yeah.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.100
The reason I have the music flat
[inaudible] piano, I've done this

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.930
for years and years is I can hear
the sound of the piano better.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.760
The music rack locks sound,

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.530
and so I've gotten accustomed
to reading the music.

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.970
When I get up for music, I know
it very well, or I'd better.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.630
And so I actually, it's good for my
line of sight seeing it like that.

It's just kind of difficult on the
page turners, but I try and be nice,

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.070
but that's the whole reason.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.530
The page turner today
was phenomenal.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:45.250
She was incredible.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.490
She left.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:51.400
&gt;&gt; Can you tell us about your
cello, the history of your cello,

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.060
and what you appreciate about it?

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.360
What's challenging about it?

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.880
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: It's
a very bad history.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.000
One of my -- the cello I had before
was stolen, and then I was looking

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:13.290
for a year, and in 2005, I -- some
gallerist offered me this thing

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.810
or [inaudible] purchase
another from a dealer.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.050
Very complicated.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:22.320
So I played on it, and it didn't
sound great, but I played,

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.760
I think I played the Schumann
concerto on it and actually it did,

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.050
it was difficult to play,
but it did fill the halls.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:34.070
It was rather cheap,
and I bought it then.

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:38.770
It's Matteo Goffriller and my
-- everybody said don't buy it.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.070
It's in a horrible shape,

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:46.790
and [inaudible] is very
big, like, oversize thing.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.180
But my luthier, she
said - my violin maker,

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.270
she said she will do some work,
and it would only sound better.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.890
And actually since then,
they've improved it now.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.340
I'm very happy to have it.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.890
It supposedly belonged
once to Mussolini,

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.090
which is not a good
thing, obviously.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:07.220
So then he gave it to a friend,
his favorite poet, D'Annunzio,

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.530 position:56%
but then to make up for bad commerce
Jewish cellists in Hamburg played

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.490
on it, I don't know the
name, and then it was sitting

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.200
in some basement for twenty years.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:20.770
And the story is so bad
that probably it's true.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.910
So, I mean, that Mussolini
story's bad,

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.180
and the gallerist didn't
strike me as a fascist.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.040
So I guess, but I have
no proof of it.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.150
And actually the other
day I was looking

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:36.040
at Wikipedia said the cello
belonged to Mussolini.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.430
No, they cannot.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:42.510
Well, because I want to know
what crap is written there,

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:47.090
and actually fifty percent what
was written, there was just wrong.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:50.900
They had, so actually we cannot
trust wikipedia very interesting.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.500
Actually,

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.940
I always thought it was.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.390
OK. Anyway, so that's
the story of the cello,

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:03.720
and the maker is Matteo
Goffriller from Venice.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.850
So you want to say
something to the piano?

Oh, you know us pianists,

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.520

Prokofiev pieces?

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.190
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: Well,
actually you're the -

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:35.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: I'm rather
Prokofiev obsessed, and I, you know,

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.430
did, for, back several years,

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:39.950
I was touring with the whole
Prokofiev sonata cycle --

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:43.980
three recitals, all nine Prokofiev
sonatas, and then I recorded them.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:49.360
And I just have a real
relationship with Prokofiev.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.700
There's so much I'm
so challenged by,

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.740
but I think this particular
work, the march from "The Love

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.710
for Three Oranges", it was actually
written in this country in Chicago,

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.690 position:56%
I believe, and sponsored by Sunkist.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:04.320
And so that's true actually.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:09.970
And, but it is just a perfect
encore, and I can tell you really,

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.530
I don't know whether I would
ever put another cellist

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:16.020
on the planet who can play it.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.320
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: What?

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.020
It's not difficult, I
just screwed up, but -

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.800
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: But
the way he plays it, it's a,

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.050
it's the perfect, it really is
such a great encore, you know,

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:29.040
because after a long program it's
just, like, an exclamation point.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.500
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: Yeah, I was
just being polite handing you

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.800
the microphone.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:40.570
It was my question, though I
have no relation with Prokofiev.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:45.340
Actually, I think he is one
of my favorite Russian --

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.640
favorite Russian composer.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.940
I like him better than
Shostakovich --

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.040 position:56%
I think of it as more variety to it.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.730
Shostakovich is just always
depressed and Prokofiev --

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:57.560
I don't know -- it's very
childlike music, I mean,

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:02.290
for every child should listen to
as much Prokofiev as possible.

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:03.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah -

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.350
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: But, like,
I think I was 23 when I heard

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.870
for the first time "Cinderella" by
Prokofiev, and I couldn't believe

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:14.790
that it took so long because it's
such a fantastic work, or "Romeo

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.910
and Juliet", and, obviously,
I play the cello stuff

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.090
that we just did the sonata
and the cello symphony,

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.800
and there's the cello sonatina,
which I have never played.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.100
Is that a good piece, Bob?

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.400
You know, [inaudible].

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.700
It's good.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.000
So next time I'm playing.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.410 position:56%
But, no, I love Prokofiev very much.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:31.710
My -- I have a little boy.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:36.490
He's two and a half, and he
loves "Peter and the Wolf".

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:40.870
He can sing all the subjects
and it's pretty cute.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.290
Actually quite in tune.

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:43.920
It's amazing.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.960
I sometimes try to live
up to his intonation.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.920
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: One
second for the microphone.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:21:00.490
[ Background Sounds ]

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:02.680
&gt;&gt; Could you comment, could you --

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.980
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: It's on -

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: You're on -

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.790
&gt;&gt; Could you comment on
the Gershwin as a pianist,

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.450
and now I'm sure you've
played the preludes

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.120
in their original form,
and the arrangements.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.420
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Yeah.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:19.330 position:56%
The -- I love playing Gershwin, and,
you know, it makes me feel cool,

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.640
and I'm not cool, and it makes
me feel like I can play jazz,

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.450
and actually my, one of
my cousins is here today,

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:30.430
and he's a brilliant jazz pianist,
and I'm envious because I'm not.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.420 position:56%
But a Gershwin, because everything's
written out, makes you feel

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.790
like you have some of that.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.230
And so it's always
weird when you play,

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.320
I play [inaudible] for solo piano.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:45.580
It's always weird, then, when you
play a transcription of it and all,

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.090
so much fun stuff is taken out
and given to a string player.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:52.140
So, I mean, it's definitely
a little, I'm playing,

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.700
and I'm restraining myself.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.650
Like, darn, why does he have
that line, but, you know.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:01.120
I actually have never played
the three preludes with cello.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.400
Are you the only cellist on
the planet who does that?

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.700
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: Well,
I've never played either.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.030
That was the first time -

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.330
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: I
mean, that's an undertaking

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:10.310
to play those three preludes on
the cello, to tell you the truth.

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.610
Yeah.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:12.910
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: But you did
it with violin quite a lot -

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.480
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: I've
done it a lot with violin yeah.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.510
It's best, best really in
its pure form -- solo piano.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.010
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
I think we have time

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:28.420
for a couple more questions.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:33.880
Alban, I was wondering when you
first encountered the Britten,

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.470
you played it so spectacularly-how
you came to it?

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:42.010
Question was when Alban first
came to the Britten sonata.

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.780
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: Well,
actually I was going to use

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.770
that as a justification for
having written an ordinary program

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:51.110
because the first time I heard
it I think was in a master class

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:55.690
with Rostropovich in
Washington in 1993.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.620
I had. Well, I never
heard it live maybe

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.080
on CD, but I couldn't remember.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.990
In that master class, it
struck me as a great piece

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:05.070
for the first time
somehow, and I don't know

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.260
when I started learning
it, but I think it's one

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.770
of the greatest pieces
for piano and cello

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.040
in the 20th century
because it's so equal.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.260
Just such an incredible, you can
sense the partnership of Britten

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.880
and Rostropovich there
because they were equals,

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.050
and then both instruments are
completely on the same level.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:26.110
There's no accompaniment of
anything, and it's so much variety.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:29.140
You can almost use every single
of the movements as an encore.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.570
I've done actually, even
the slow movement I've used

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:32.870
as an encore once.

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:35.520
I mean, if the piece is
not the problem, obviously.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.200
But number two, four, five
work beautifully as encores.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.150
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Yup.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:43.450
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: So that's, yeah.

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:47.570 position:56%
Otherwise, I have, well, I've always
found it very difficult memory wise.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:53.070
I don't know why, but Britten
somehow, it's not very logical.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:58.140
Like, the suites, it took
me forever to remember them

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.570
because there's no
real pattern behind -

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:01.870
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Yeah -

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: It's almost
improvised, and the sonata has a lot

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:06.420
of improvisatory elements as well.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.050
So, but I love it.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:10.350
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Do you know the anecdote

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:15.400
about Britten humming the thing
to Rostropovich over dinner?

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.440
So, apparently, if you go
read some of the literature

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.420
about this piece coming together,
when Rostropovich got to Aldeburgh

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.170
to do the first performance,
and they were rehearsing,

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.830
there was some tension
going back and forth

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:29.690
because Rostropovich wasn't giving
Britten what he wanted in some

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.450
of the moments, and Britten
didn't want to anger him.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:34.310
So he wouldn't say
anything, but at dinner later,

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.190
Britten started humming this
thing how he wanted it played,

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.820
and Rostropovich got it,
and he played it that way,

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.120
and he didn't even say anything.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.610
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: But
as cute as that story is,

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:49.070
it's incredibly telling,
and it's exactly what I say.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:53.210
Because Rostropovich
did whatever he wanted.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:57.150
For me, it was Rostropovich-[he] is
the greatest cellist of all times,

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:00.510
but you should not listen, you
should not take his Britten

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.400
of playing as an example
of how it should be done.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.310
Because I'm sure Britten
didn't tell him anything.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.870
This little humming story,
that's cute, but he, and, like,

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:11.500
with the cello symphony,

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:17.050 position:56%
he's ignoring strongly what Britten
wrote, and actually it doesn't work.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.890
I mean, I don't, I, 95 percent of
the things Rostropovich recorded

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:24.110
and played, I love,
but his Britten -- eh.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:25.410
It's too Russian.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:30.070
He doesn't get the British
sense of humor that, yeah.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:34.170
I don't know, and so I can't
meet the part of the story

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:37.640
that Britten dared to tell
Rostropovich what, yes.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:42.050
But then later because Rostropovich
understood [inaudible] down here,

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:45.600
but, again, to take it as an
example would be quite bad

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.460
because just the fact
that Rostropovich worked

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.470
with just the [inaudible]
does not mean

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:53.040
that Rostropovich was doing
what Shostakovich wanted.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:58.750
Shostakovich was spineless
little paranoid person,

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.580
and he would not stand up and tell
this great charismatic person how

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:02.880
to play the piece.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.310
He was happy that such a fantastic
cellist was taking his stuff on.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:09.040
I mean, I played pieces
by composers.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:14.820
They hardly ever tell you what to
do unless you ask, but I never ask.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.940
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Great.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.870
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: But
there's a cute story, which -

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:25.410
is there a Rostropovich
museum here or something?

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:26.710
Or some -

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.010
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
I'm not aware of one.

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:29.310
Does anyone know?

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:30.610
No. Well, he had the connection
to the Kennedy Center -

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:31.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: I know, but it's.

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:37.310
I've been told in some place here
there's a little handkerchief.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.250
Britten wrote something on it.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.220
Britten and Rostropovich
were playing a program here.

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.950
Do you know the story?

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.080
And they played somewhere in
North England forever to stay

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:51.270
with a friend of Britten's, duke,

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.390
and Shostakovich was
completely excited

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:58.370
because we don't have
dukes in Russia anymore.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.970
So I need to practice
my bow for the duke.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:09.860
So at every little stop they took
to go to the bathroom or to eat,

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.100
Rostropovich was taking
a bow, and Britten was,

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.400
he told it for the first time.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.430
No, don't have to do anything.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:16.730
We're in England.

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.030
So, no, no, I have to.

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:19.330
You don't understand.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:20.730
Britten got more and
more embarrassed,

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.410
the bigger the bows became.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:26.100
At some point, Britten
said, OK, anything you want.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.320
Just don't bow, and
Rostropovich says OK.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.870
Write me something for cello.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:32.780
OK, OK. No, no, no.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:37.000
You have to write it now,
and then Britten wrote "Me,

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.560
Benjamin Britten...I confirmed
that I will write something

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.230
for Mstislav Rostropovich.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.770
And this thing where he
wrote it on the [inaudible]

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:48.140
but maybe now it's somewhere else.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:55.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Maybe it's,
if anyone knows some private dealers

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:56.570
around [multiple speakers].

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:57.870
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt:
You should go there -

00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:59.170
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
That's a great story -

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:00.470
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: No.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:01.770
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.070
Last question.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:04.370
You can just yell it out, and
I'll repeat it if you'd like.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.220
&gt;&gt; You just played so
well off each other,

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:11.570
and I'm wondering how much
you actually discuss the music

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:16.220
and how much is just the result of
your rehearsals and [inaudible].

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.480
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Question
was how much they discuss

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.450
about the music in
rehearsals, or does the,

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:23.970
do the things come
together organically.

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.340
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: I think,
you know, there are certain,

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:33.830
at least in my career and life,
there are certain colleagues

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:38.590
who I've met where words really
just don't matter as much

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:42.090
as just playing together, and,
you know, I feel when Alban

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:44.040
and I play together, we're as --

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:49.230
Of course, we rehearse, and we
discuss things, but when we get

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:51.360
on stage, we're really just

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.870
in this world right here having
a conversation truly, and it's,

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:59.420
there's a lot of trust that has to.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.920
You know, I think it
probably doesn't hurt

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.430
that we've known each
other for such a long time,

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:11.330
but it's also this musical trust of
where is he going to play the note

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:16.050
or timings of things because
we definitely veer off

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:18.040 position:56%
of what we discuss when we rehearse.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.690
And, I mean, for me, it's,
it really is all about,

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:22.990
the music is the language.

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:25.290
That's the language that we speak.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:28.960
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Imagine
rehearsals are like this.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.260
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: You're too PC.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.560
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott:
I'm too PC -

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.860
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: Come on -

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.160
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott:
Oh, my God -

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.460
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: We
didn't discuss anything.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.110
Like, if you take the
time of practicing.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:41.610
Like, when we did the Britten for
the first time, I remember I went

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.320
to your apartment,
and we had one hour.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.040
So we didn't have time to discuss.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.050
We played, and then we played
again then hardly played again,

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.350
and then the concert -

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:51.650
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Yeah -

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:52.950
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt:
So actually words,

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:54.250
probably two or three percent -

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:55.550
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Yup -

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:56.850
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: If at all -

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:58.150
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Yeah -

00:29:58.150 --> 00:29:59.450
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt:
The rehearsal time -

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:00.750
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Yup -

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.050
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: So it's playing

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.350
and then something
doesn't work, we said OK,

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.650
backup 20 bars, do it again,
and then it falls into place.

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:07.480
So we don't even have
to point so much out -

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.780
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Yeah -

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.080
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: And the --

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.380
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Yeah.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:12.680
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: And
sometimes when you have

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.980
to discuss, it doesn't work -

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.280
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Yup -

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.580
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: I
made the experience -

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:17.880
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott:
Oh, many times.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:22.670
I've. No, I found out many times
that you're in a rehearsal,

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:26.810
and everything needs to be
analyzed and overanalyzed.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:30.380
Everybody gets -- starts second
guessing what they're doing

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.220
and second guessing the
most important thing,

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.220
which is it's about
the music or the words,

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.010
and not to sound all
philosophical, but it's true.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:41.430
That music are, that's the
language that we speak,

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.650
and so that's what we're doing
is speaking that language

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:48.720
so problems will resolve in the
course of our playing together as -

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.860
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt:
There's too much agreement

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.330
on what to do with things -

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:53.630
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Yeah.

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:54.930
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: It becomes
not spontaneous anymore -

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:56.230
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Oh, yeah -

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:57.530
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: We say do
this here, and this there,

00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:58.830
and there, and here we go.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.130
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: Well,

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.650
I would say that we greatly
challenge each other in,

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:03.630
when we're playing together.

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:04.980
Alban's constantly surprising
me by doing something.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.490
Oh, oh, oh, OK, and then,
you know, I try and -

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:08.330
&gt;&gt; Alban Gerhardt: I
surprise myself and -

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:10.250
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie McDermott: You
surprise yourself, and, but I try

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.480
and return the favor, but, you
know, that's what you want.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.260
You know, that's the point of live
concerts as opposed to recording.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:21.010
It is live concerts, it's,
if we were in this space

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:25.320
with you all having a living
conversation with the music

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.430
in this moment of time at
2:00 on a Saturday afternoon.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:31.390
So when we play next week in
Manchester, it's not going

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:34.480
to be the same thing, and, or
Germany or whatever it is, right.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.780
OK.

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:39.330
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Wonderful.

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.630
Well, thank you, Anne-Marie
and Alban,

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:45.530
for spending time with
us this afternoon.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:46.830
We appreciate it.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:49.680

of the Library of Congress.
