00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.679
When I was in middle school I used to sleep
with my cellphone under my pillow so I could

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:05.050
text in the middle of the night.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.800
But then I started to worry what that could
be doing to my head?

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.809
I mean do cellphones cause brain tumors?

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.520
Hey Guys Julia here for DNews.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.160
According to the Pew Research Center 91% of
adults own a cellphone.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.900
That’s up 26% from ten years ago.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.590
And well, a 2011 World Health Organization
report classifies radiofrequency electromagnetic

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.250
fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans,
so are we all just giving ourselves brain

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.250
tumors?

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.870
Let’s take a look at what the science says.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.990
A large study published in the British Medical
Journal found no link between cell phone use

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.730
and brain tumors.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.170
Researchers tracked nearly 360-thousand cell
phone users over nearly two decades and found

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.350
no increase in brain tumor risk.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.350
So what’s going on?

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.400
Whats at the crux of this issue are electromagnetic
waves.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.930
Which are well, all around us all the time.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.899
This can come in different forms, like light
or radio waves.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.540
All electromagnetic waves across the spectrum
are forms of radiant energy.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.390
But some are on the higher energy side of
the spectrum and are ionizing, like cosmic

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.850
rays, x-rays and some are on the lower energy
end of the spectrum and are non-ionizing,

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.110
like radio waves.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.610
Some forms of ionizing radiation do raise
the risk of cancer.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.390
Like sunlight, which can trigger certain forms
of skin cancer.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.030
Or Like x-rays for instance.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.570
If you wanna learn more how those can be harmful,
check out this DNews video (there’s a link

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.210
in the description as well).

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.729
Sometimes too much exposure to these forms
of energy can damage the DNA.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.600
So as your DNA makes more copies of itself,
it copies an error, and sometimes this error

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.060
leads to uncontrollable growth, which is a
what a tumor is.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.560
Cellphones use electromagnetic radiation in
the microwave frequency range, which is in

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.500
the low energy end of the spectrum.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.130
Just like other wireless stuff in your house
like wifi.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.759
And stuff at this lower end of the spectrum
aren’t known to damage DNA.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.390
And groups like the World Health Organization,
the American Cancer Society, and the National

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.700
Institutes of Health, all say no to the link
between brain tumors and cell phones.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.200
On a related note though, some studies show
that cell phones can make your sperm suck.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200
Seriously.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.939
One study published in the journal Environment
International reviewed the findings from ten

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.700
studies, including around 15-hundred samples.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.480
The researchers concluded that exposure to
cell phones might reduce the motility of the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.990
sperm, or its ability to move, by up to 8%.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.470
But curiously, on the other hand, one study
showed that maybe the electromagnetic energy

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.010
is a good thing.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.060
One study found that it might even protect
against Alzheimer’s.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.120
The researchers exposed mice to cell phone
radiation for two 1-hour periods each day

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.790
for seven to nine months.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.140
Some mice were genetically designed to be
predisposed to Alzheimer’s while others

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.480
were just a control.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.650
At the end of the study, the researchers found
that the predisposed mice’s memory and cognition

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.819
was protected by the cell phone signal.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.069
And performed just as well on tests measuring
memory and thinking skills as the non Alzheimer’s

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.069
mice.

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.550
Which is totally weird and I really hope they
do more research.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.800
But anyways back to the point, so scientists
are pretty certain that cell phones don’t

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.800
cause brain tumors.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.670
So go, call you mom for an hour.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.340
She probably needs it and it won’t give
you cancer.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.120
But it might make you kind of lazy.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:32.950
