00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.380
Now you've applied the six principles from this

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.440
course to create a new UI. Together, your

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.070
sketches are what Don calls the system image.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.520
That's the stuff a person experiences in order to

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.150
use that interface. Now, finish your project by

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.170
putting it together in a five page document.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.870
You'll find instructions explained in the project brief.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.700
And when you're done, share it in the forums.
