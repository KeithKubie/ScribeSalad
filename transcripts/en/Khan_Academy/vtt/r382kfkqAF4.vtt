00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.610
We've already seen several
videos where we, one, learned

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.710
what the Pythagorean theorem is
and how it can be applied

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.470
to find the sides of right
triangles, and even to find

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.230
the distances between points
on the Cartesian plane, so

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.290
this is the Pythagorean
theorem.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.700
And just as a bit of review, it
tells us that if I have a

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:29.430
right triangle, and if c is the
side opposite the right

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.270
angle, right?

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.400
That's my right angle.
c is that side.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.950
It's the longest side.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.200
We call that the hypotenuse.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.300
Then the square of the other
sides, the sum of the squares

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.700
of the other sides, will
be equal to c squared.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.580
So if this side is a and this
side is b, the Pythagorean

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.100
theorem tells us that a squared
plus b squared is

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.790
going to be equal
to c squared.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.400
And we did several problems
where we used this to solve

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.479
different triangles.

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.710
But what I want to show you
in this video is really a

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.680
visual-- you can view it as
a visual proof of the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.890
Pythagorean theorem to see why
this actually makes sense.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.460
And to understand that, I'm
going to draw a little bit of

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.880
a diagram here.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.910
So let me draw a little
right triangle here.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.570
So let's say that that
is my right triangle.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.340
And let's say that this
is a, this is b,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.020
that is my right angle.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.560
Then that right there, this
right here, that length right

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.320
there is c.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.760
Now, what I'm going to do is
draw this exact same triangle,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.750
but I'm going to rotate
it a little bit.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.110
You're going to see what
I'm talking about.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.960
This right here is the exact
same triangle that I just

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.250
drew, except I rotated it.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.970
So this is a, this is b,
and now this is c.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.030
This is the exact-- you could
do this, you know.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.650
You could take a ruler out
and actually do it.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.040
Pick an a, b, and c, and you
can actually rotate this

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.950
triangle around to the
right like this.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.370
You could just rotate it like
that, and you would get this

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.740
triangle, just like that.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.089
Now, I'm going to
rotate it again.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.780
And I'm just going to imagine
copy and pasting it.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.730
And then I'll get this triangle,
just like that.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.460
And once again, this is a,
this is b, and this is c.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.260
These triangles are all the
exact same triangle, the exact

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.480
same measure.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.510
Now let me rotate this again,
and I'll get this triangle.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.970
I will get this triangle
right here.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.970
And once again, this is a.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.500
This length right here is a.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.430
This length right here is b.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.670
And this is the hypotenuse of
this right angle, this is c.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.780
Now what do we have here?

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.100
We have all of these right
angles, and inside, I have

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.510
this other square that
is inscribed

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.900
into this right angle.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.960
And I can prove to you, if you
like, that these are also

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.090
right angles.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.150
And you know, why don't
I just show it to you.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.900
You may or may not already be
familiar that the angles in a

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.990
triangle add up to 180.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.550
So if you call this angle x, you
call this angle y, we know

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.990
that x plus y plus 90 degrees
have to be equal to 180.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.300
So x plus y plus 90 have
to be equal to 180.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.830
Or you could say that if you
subtract 90 from both sides of

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.680
this equation, x plus y are
going to be equal to 90.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.520
I just subtracted 90
from both sides.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.260
This disappears.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.060
180 minus 90 is 90.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.420
And this x and y, they're
all over.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.726
If this angle is x right here,
so is this angle because this

00:03:55.726 --> 00:03:56.750
is the exact same triangle.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.100
So is this angle.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.850
So is this angle.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.720
If this angle is y, so is that
angle, so is that angle, and

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.120
so is that angle.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.250
Now, you may or may not already
know that if you have

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.269
three angles that form a line--
so let me draw it.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.450
If you have three angles that
form a line like this, so

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.650
let's say we have angle a,
angle b-- let me draw b a

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.850
little bit different-- and angle
c, just like that, and

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.600
together they kind of form you
could imagine a semi-circle or

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.900
they go from one line all the
way back, that a, b plus c are

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.180
going to be equal to 180.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.890
a plus b plus c is going to
be equal to 180 degrees.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.080
They complete a 180-degree
arc.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.750
Now, if you look at, let's say,
this point right here on

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.560
our diagram, you can see that
angle x plus this angle right

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:07.490
here, which I'll call angle z, x
plus z plus y is going to be

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.050
equal to 180 degrees.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.880
They form a line.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.900
So x plus z plus y, or maybe I
should write it as x plus y

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.540
plus z is equal to 180.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.750
Now, we already know x plus y
is equal to 90, so this is

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.440
equal to 90.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.770
So 90 plus z is equal to 180.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.200
z minus-- well, both sides
of this equation minus 90

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.740
degrees, you get 180 minus 90.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.960
I just subtract 90 from
both sides, so z

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.370
is equal to 90 degrees.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.620
So these are all 90-degree
angles.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.020
Their sides are all the same
length of c, so this is a

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.000
square in the middle
of this diagram.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.850
Now, let's think a little
bit about what the area

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:57.610
of the square is.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.110
And there's two ways we
can come up with the

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.995
area of that square.

00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:03.330
So let me draw something here.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.200
So the first easy way to think
of the area of the square,

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.280
well, it's a square.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.900
This length is c, that
length is c.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.710
To figure out the area, I
just multiply one side

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.470
by the other side.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.490
It's c times c, or c squared.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.750
So if I want the area of that
right there, it is c

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.260
squared, c times c.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.120
Area is equal to c squared.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.230
But how else could we figure
out that area?

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.400
Well, we could say that would
be the area of this larger

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:43.680
square, of this whole square
over here minus the area of

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.400
these triangles.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.310
That also would give us the area
of that inside square.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.830
So what is the area of this
outside, bigger square?

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.570
Well, each of its sides
are a plus b.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.140
And so you take a plus b.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.670
If you want the area, you could
say, a plus b times a

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.800
plus b, or a plus b
squared, right?

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.920
That's the area of the outer
square, but we still have to

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.130
get the area of our
inner square.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.565
Area of small square.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.700
We still have to subtract out
the area of these triangles.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.790
And what are the areas
of these triangles?

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.020
Well, we have to subtract out.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.420
The area of each of them is 1/2
times base times height,

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.120
or base times height,
ab, 1/2 ab.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.160
That's the area of each
of these triangles.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.750
Now we have 1, 2, 3, 4
of these triangles.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.190
So it's 4 times 1/2 ab.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:50.280
This is another way of getting
the area of this inside

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.900
smaller square.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.740
Now let's just do a little bit
of algebra-- we're pretty

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.150
familiar with this-- to
essentially simplify the

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.900
right-hand side of this
equation right here.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.690
So a plus b times times a plus
b, a times a is a squared,

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:08.120
plus 2 ab, plus b squared.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.900
And then we have minus-- what
do we have right here?

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.320
Minus 2ab, right?

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.560
4 times 1/2 is 2,
so minus 2 ab.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.540
Well, these cancel out.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.530
2ab minus 2ab, we're just left
with a squared and b squared.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.620
So the area of this inside
circle, which is c squared,

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.950
it's also equal to a squared
plus b squared.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.299
And I've just to shown you
a visual proof for the

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:38.400
Pythagorean theorem, because
remember, a and b were the

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.330
smaller sides of a right
triangle having c as its

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:42.940
hypotenuse.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.700
And from there, we constructed
this bigger diagram.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.080
Hopefully, you found that fun.
