00:00:00.608 --> 00:00:04.304
- We are asked to figure out
what is 1/7 divided by four,

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:06.551
and they help us out with this diagram.

00:00:06.551 --> 00:00:09.893
We have a whole divided
into seven equal sections.

00:00:09.893 --> 00:00:11.485
Each of those is a seventh,

00:00:11.485 --> 00:00:13.806
and we have one of those
sevenths filled in,

00:00:13.806 --> 00:00:17.065
so this is 1/7 right over here,

00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:20.034
and then they divide it
into four equal sections.

00:00:20.034 --> 00:00:22.762
In fact, they divide
all of the sevenths into

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:25.731
four equal sections, and so 1/7,

00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:28.957
which is this whole green
bar divided by four,

00:00:28.957 --> 00:00:32.833
well what would be this
fraction of the whole

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.461
that is in a question mark.

00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:37.110
Can you pause this video
and figure out what fraction

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.093
of the whole is this question mark?

00:00:40.093 --> 00:00:43.439
When we divided the first
seventh into four equal

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:45.846
sections, we also divided
all of the sevenths into

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:47.315
four equal sections,

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:51.314
and so now the entire
whole is 28 equal sections

00:00:51.314 --> 00:00:54.893
because you have a four by seven grid.

00:00:54.893 --> 00:00:57.372
You have one, two, three, four rows

00:00:57.372 --> 00:00:58.918
and you still have your seven columns,

00:00:58.918 --> 00:01:02.418
and you can count them, seven, 14, 21, 28,

00:01:03.726 --> 00:01:07.227
and so 1/7 divided by four is going to be

00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:09.310
one of these 28 sections.

00:01:10.608 --> 00:01:13.608
This right over here is one over 28.

00:01:15.968 --> 00:01:18.743
This is 1/28.

00:01:18.743 --> 00:01:20.826
Let's do another example.

00:01:21.888 --> 00:01:25.265
We're told use the number
line below to help visualize

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:28.432
1/5 being divided by three.

00:01:29.981 --> 00:01:32.627
As we go from zero to
one on the number line,

00:01:32.627 --> 00:01:34.709
you can divide it into five
equal sections where that's

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:39.147
1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5,

00:01:39.147 --> 00:01:42.112
and of course 5/5 is equal to one,

00:01:42.112 --> 00:01:44.997
but we want 1/5 divided by three,

00:01:44.997 --> 00:01:48.170
so we took the section from zero to 1/5

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.613
and we divided it into
three equal sections,

00:01:50.613 --> 00:01:52.286
and so the first of those sections,

00:01:52.286 --> 00:01:53.595
this one right over here,

00:01:53.595 --> 00:01:56.537
that would be 1/5 divided by three.

00:01:56.537 --> 00:01:58.982
What is this going to be equal to?

00:01:58.982 --> 00:02:02.157
Pause this video again and see
if you can figure that out.

00:02:02.157 --> 00:02:06.311
The key realization is when
we divided each of the fifths

00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:08.557
into three more equal sections,

00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:12.173
we can now think of each of
these steps as a fifteenth

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:15.189
because now we have one,
two, three, four, five,

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:19.356
six, seven, eight, nine,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 equal

00:02:20.247 --> 00:02:23.178
sections between zero and one,

00:02:23.178 --> 00:02:24.755
and where did that 15 come from?

00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:27.319
We had five equal
sections and then we split

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.325
each of those five into
three more equal sections

00:02:30.325 --> 00:02:32.477
so five times three is 15.

00:02:32.477 --> 00:02:35.249
This right over here is 1/15,

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:37.492
this is 2/15,

00:02:37.492 --> 00:02:40.670
this is 3/15, which is equivalent to 1/5

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.828
and we can keep going on and on and on,

00:02:42.828 --> 00:02:46.039
but the key realization
here is if I take that first

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:49.741
1/5 and if I divide it
into three equal sections

00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:52.594
and I go only as far as that
first of the three equal

00:02:52.594 --> 00:02:56.761
sections, that is going to be
1/15, 1/15 and we are done.
