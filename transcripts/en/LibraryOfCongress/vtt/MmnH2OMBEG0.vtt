00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:20.530
[ Silence ]

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, good morning and
welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.810
I'm John Cole.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.670
I'm the Director of the
Library's Center for the Book,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.250
which is the reading and literacy
promotion arm of the library.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.620
We are pleased that you can join us

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.580
for a special presentation
today about a brand-new book.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.170
Since we are book and
reading promoters,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.590
it gives us special pleasure
to honor the product of some

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.000
of the research that has
been done around the country.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.370 position:56%
Especially if it's pertinent to what
we do, which is promoting books,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.900
reading, literacy, and libraries.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.680
The Center for the Book was
created by Daniel Boorstin

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.390
when he was librarian in
1977, as a way to reach

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.120
out to the general public to
promote books and reading.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.550
And to encourage the scholarly
study of books and reading.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.480
Literacy really wasn't a hot
topic when we were created.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.740
It came along, we of course
added literacy promotion to this,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.180
and as a librarian I've also as
the founding director managed

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.160
to get library promotion
into the equation.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.130
And we have had a very
fruitful, more than 35 years now

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.600
of a public-private
partnership that promotes books,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.320
reading, literacy, and libraries.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.430
We operate largely through a
state center affiliates program.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.930
Each state now has a
designated Center for the Book.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.220 position:56%
And it's important for us to be with
those states at the ground level,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.800
especially through our involvement
with the National Book Festival,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.890
which was brought to the Library
of Congress by Laura Bush in 2001.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.750
And now we've just
celebrated the 15th year.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.010
But an important part
of that is the Pavilion,

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.970
the so-called Pavilion
of the States.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.730
We've now moved off the Mall into
the Washington Convention Center,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.640
where we had record crowds
on Labor Day Saturday.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.510
But the states are all represented.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.330
And it's the state involvement

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.420
that helps make the National Book
Festival really truly national.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.040
This Books and Beyond
Program today is part

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.970
of our noontime author series.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.160
These programs are all filmed
and are available later

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.060
on the Library of Congress website.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.430
So I do ask you to turn
off all things electronic.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.460
We will have a question and
answer session with our author.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.710
And also a book signing, which
becomes part of this experience

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.050
of our promoting books and reading.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.180
We have a special guest
today, however,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.470
who is going to introduce
our speaker.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.030
It's Dr. William Adams,
who is the tenth Chair

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.090
of the National Endowment
for the Humanities,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.020
which has had a special
role as he will explain

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.760
in promoting this particular book.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.530
And under his leadership has
really moved the Humanities Council

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.450
into some new, exciting
projects that involve books

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.010
and reading and the general public.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.430
And he will mention a
little bit about those.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:58.020
He's a former President of
Bucknell and also of Colby College.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.950
I also would like to thank the
library associations of Maryland

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.260
and Virginia, and the
University of Maryland College

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.910
of Information Studies for their
sponsorship in helping us get

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.130
out such a wonderful crowd.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.930
Wayne is really on a
bit of a tour here.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.980
He'll make appearances at Maryland,
and he is doing a good deal

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.430
to help libraries through
this promotion of his book,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.540
and through -- I think you
will find his fascinating view

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.030
of libraries from the ground up.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.580
To introduce him, though,
it's my pleasure

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.520
to introduce Dr. William Adams

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.510
from the National Endowment
for the Humanities.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:57.050
[ Applause ]

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.350
&gt;&gt; William Adams: Thank you, John.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.160
And good afternoon everyone
-- I think it's after noon?

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.320
Are we almost to afternoon?

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.620
It's great to see you.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.920
It's great to be here.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.220
I wanted to come over and do this.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.980
It's really just a couple of
blocks away as some of you know.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.410
In part because of the long
and deep relationship we've had

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.400
with the Library of Congress,

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.330
which is currently manifest
in a couple of ways.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.090
We are partners with the Library

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.280
in the grand national
digital newspaper project,

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.980
which as some of you probably
know is a project we undertook

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.480 position:56%
with the Library about ten years ago

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.120 position:56%
to digitize every American newspaper
published in the United States

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:44.880 position:56%
between 1830 -- I'm looking for Jane
-- 1830, 1840 and 1920-something,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.720
depending upon where
that march of time is

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.170
with respect to the public domain.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.450
We also are partners with
the Kluge Center here

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.770
at the Library of Congress.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.030 position:56%
And we are partners in spirit, I
would say, in almost every other way

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:06.260
that matters of this great national
institution is of course very close

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.000
to our mission and our work, which
includes always prominently books

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.450 position:56%
and libraries and the public and
information with and for the public.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.820
Libraries are a particular
interest of us.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.920
As some of you know, we're about
to celebrate our 50th anniversary.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.730
We were founded by the stroke

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:34.620
of Lyndon Johnson's pen
on September 29th, 1965.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.580
Created along with the
National Endowment for the Arts

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.580
by the National Foundation on
the Arts and Humanities Act.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.700
Which brought us both into being
twins at birth, separate at birth.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.380
But nonetheless creatures
of that extraordinary moment

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.410
in American history when
so much was going on.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.200
I'm sure you've been tracking, as
I have, all of the anniversaries

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.120
that have been announced
in the last year or so.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.500 position:56%
An extraordinarily creative period
for the Congress, for the President.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.380
And we are a part of
that wonderful moment.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.080
We were founded very much in the
image of the early expression

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.350
of NSF, the National
Science Foundation.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.120
Which was then devoted
principally as we were to research.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.460
And research is a wonderful thing.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.760
And we are still deeply
committed to research,

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.380
it is one of our six major
grant-making programs.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.290
But since then, I'm very proud
that the agency has evolved

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:42.020
into a much more ambitious,
robust public-facing agency.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.990
And one of the expressions of that,
one of the earliest expressions

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.740
of that was our commitment
to libraries.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.880 position:56%
And we have since almost the very
beginning been funding libraries all

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.430
over the United States.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.200
Public ones, private
ones, research libraries,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.540
municipal libraries,
school libraries.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.500
And it has become a huge part
of our public program funding.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.830
Many millions of dollars
now over these five decades.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.410
And many thousands of grants.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.820
I just checked with
Wayne before I came up;

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.970
it is true to say there
are now 120,000 libraries

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.270
in the United States.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.530
Many of those are school libraries,
but still, that's a big number.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:29.280
Additionally, in 2012 the American
Library Association reports

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.580 position:56%
over 92 million people attended the
nearly four million programs offered

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.940
by public libraries.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.790
Extraordinary scope of the work
of this cultural sector that's

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:45.170
so important to the Endowment,
so important to the country.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:50.190
So it's with special pleasure that
I introduce Wayne Wiegand today

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.550
to talk about his wonderful
book, "Part of our Lives:

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.020
A People's History of the
American Public Library."

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.770
This is also particularly
interesting to us and important

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.710
to us because we gave
Wayne the fellowship

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.410
that permitted him
to write this book.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:09.150
And it's always a great pleasure
for us as we fund fellowships

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:15.150
to see a book actually come out
of the recesses of the library,

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:21.300
probably, or the study after years
of labor and intensive research.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.270
And here we have a wonderful
example of the productivity

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:29.770
of NEH's terrific research program.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:36.830
I'll read to you just briefly from
the application, which was in 2007.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.570
"For generations, American public
libraries have done three things

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:45.640
very well -- made information
accessible, provided cultural space

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.090
for the construction of community,

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.840
and furnished billions
of reading materials.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.410
Yet for all those years, people

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.080
in the library field have
concentrated mostly on the first.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.070
I intend to write a
comprehensive history

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:03.390
of the American public library
since 1850 that will take a library

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.210 position:56%
in the life of the user perspective.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.760
The study will harness
numerous humanities scholarship

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.630
on the public sphere, and
the social nature of reading.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.760
To demonstrate multiple roles these
ubiquitous institutions have played

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.850
and continue to play in
their host communities.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:27.570
And he made good on this
promise and this proposal.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.450
So I'm especially delighted to
be here to introduce him today

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:35.840
and to say that additionally this
is very near and dear to my heart

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.290
as an expression of the kind
of leading edge research

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:45.130
that the NEH is trying to
advance and encourage now.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:49.270
Which is research that is
accessible to the public

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:53.170
and about public dimensions
of our lives.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:57.750
This book fits every particular
of that new emphasis in NEH.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.520
So it's a great honor to
introduce Wayne Wiegand to talk

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.130
about "Part of our Lives."

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.930
Wayne?

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:14.360
[ Applause ]

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.660
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: Oh, dear.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.960
My talk is gone.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:26.670
&gt;&gt; Uh-oh. [Laughter] I'll tell you
a little story about that later.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.970
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: Of
course I'm going

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.520
to thank the National
Endowment for the Humanities

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.750
for the fellowship they
gave me in 2008-2009.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.920
It did enable me to
complete this book.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.870
But it wasn't 15 minutes
after I got the notice

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.940
that I got the NEH fellowship that
I walked into my Dean's office,

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.910
Larry Dennis, Florida State
University College of Communication

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.960
and I said, "Will you match this?"

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.910
And he said, "Yes, you may
have the entire year off."

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.310
So Larry, please stand up.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:59.070
I want to thank you
formally for that.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.630
[Applause] And in the
course of my remarks,

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.400
you're going to see three trailers

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.250
from a forthcoming documentary
entitled "Free For All."

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.830
That two San Francisco
filmmakers are putting together.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.890
It should be ready
by February of 2017.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:19.900
But those trailers and that
documentary have also received

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.170
funding for the National
Endowment for the Humanities.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:23.890
So I want to thank
the National Endowment

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.250
for the Humanities for that.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.690
I've been privileged to serve

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.910
as historical consultant
for that documentary.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:34.120
And when it comes out, I encourage
all of you not only to see it,

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.930
but also to encourage
your public libraries

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.770
and library communities to view it.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:43.640
I have a huge goal here today.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.250 position:56%
To persuade you to broaden your
thinking about libraries in general,

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.670
and public libraries in particular.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:53.010
I'm motivated in large part
because of conclusions that emerged

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.500
from research on a book
I've recently published,

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.680
"Part of Our Lives:
A People's History

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.650
of the American Public Library."

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.300
My goal in that book was to find

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:07.350 position:56%
out historically why people love
these ubiquitous civic institutions.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.410
And love them they do.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:14.160
A 2013 report by the Pew
Research Center's Internet

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.280
and American Life Project noted

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.940
that in the previous decade
every other major institution --

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.840
government, churches,
banks, corporations --

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.880
had fallen in public esteem.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.230
Except libraries, the
military, and first responders.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.450
The study also found that
91% of those surveyed

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:35.460
over 16 years old said
libraries are "very"

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.030
or "somewhat" important
to their communities.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.570
And 98% identified their
public library experiences

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.330
as "very" or "mostly" positive.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.660
Another Pew study found 94%

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.090
of parents believe libraries are
important for their children,

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:55.480
84% said because libraries develop
a love of reading and books.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.350
In my historical narrative, I
didn't take the conventional

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.850
user-in-the-life-of-a-library
approach.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.400
Rather, I took a
library-in-the-life-of-the-user

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.700
perspective.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.710
Because I wanted to trace the
history of the public library not

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:13.960
so much by analyzing the words
of its founders and managers,

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.380
but mostly by listening to the
voices of people who used them

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.650
since the middle of
the 19th Century.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.120
Thus, instead of a top-down view,

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.060
"Part of our Lives" adopts
a bottom-up perspective

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:29.720 position:56%
that features the voices of
generations of public library users.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.110
Largely because of recent
technologies, uncovering many

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.420
of these voices was not difficult.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.030
Time consuming, yes.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.500
But not difficult.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.230
Some are published in
memoirs, autobiographies

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.200
and biographies of the famous.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.800
Some in manuscript collections

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.800
in public library archives
across the country.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.290
The vast majority, however,
are fixed in thousands

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.080
of U.S. newspapers and
periodicals digitized

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.250
since the 1990's into
huge databases.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:01.280
Thank you again, National
Endowment for the Humanities.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.620
By using public libraries as a
search term, I found thousands

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.710
of voices in letters to the
editor, thousands more quoted

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.480
in stories reporters wrote
about local libraries.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.030
And almost all of those
newspapers I read here

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.610
in the Library of Congress.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.750
Some of you watched me
look at those databases.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.360
And I would get so excited
I'd have to stand up and walk

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.980
out of the room just to
walk off some of the energy.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.220
That's why I was moving
around a lot.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.070
As I analyzed this
data, I was surprised

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.770
at how quickly it organized
into three main categories.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.370
In no particular order, people
have loved their public libraries

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.730
for the useful information
they made accessible,

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:45.820 position:56%
for the public spaces they provided,
and for the transformative potential

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.400
of commonplace stories
they circulated

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.640
that helped users make
sense of their world.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:56.400
First, a few historical examples
that comfortably fit the category

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:01.480
of information as we currently
define it in librarianship.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.750
While sitting at a Cincinnati
public library desk in 1867,

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:09.420
Thomas Edison would get excused
from duty under the pretense

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.240
of being too sick to work.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.990
And invariably strike a
bee-line for the library,

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:17.030
where he'd spend the entire day
and evening reading such works

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:21.090
on electricity as were to
be had, a friend recalled.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:26.600
In 1899, Wilbur and Orville Wright
came upon an ornithology book

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.730
in the Dayton Public Library
that rekindled their interest

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:33.220
in human flight, one of
their biographers writes.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:37.410
"By the time I was 12 or
14," Harry Truman recalled,

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.270
"I had read every book in the
Independence Public Library,

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.740
including the encyclopedias.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.280
These books had a great
influence on me."

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.710
In a Detroit public library
reading room in the 1950's,

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.610
a teenaged female pored over
comedians' printed monologue.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.740
She appeared in short
monodramas written by herself

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.520
without makeup, and
hardly any props.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.870
Lily Tomlin's biographer
later noted,

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.120
"conjuring up not only
the personality

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.650
of the characters she portrayed,
but also that of unseen people

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.090
with whom she was talking."

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:12.830
About the same time in
Hot Springs, Arkansas,

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:16.590
10-year-old William Jefferson
Clinton discovered the Garland

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:18.010
County Public Library.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:21.240
"I'd go there for hours,
browsing among the books.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.930
Especially those on
Native Americans."

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:30.340
In 1971, 10-year-old Barak Obama
returned to Honolulu from Jakarta.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:34.160
"First place I wanted to be was
a library," he later recalled.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.910
Often he had a specific
information need.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.490
"One Saturday with the help of
a raspy-voiced old librarian

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:44.600
who appreciated my seriousness,
I found a book on East Africa."

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.730
Obama wanted information
about Kenya,

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:51.180
birthplace of his father,
a Luo tribe member.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.380
The Luo raised cattle and lived in
mud huts and ate cornmeal and yams

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.480
and something called
millet, the book said.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:03.020
Their traditional costume was a
leather thong across the crotch.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:07.250
Shocked by what he read, Obama
left the book open-faced on a table

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:11.130
and walked out without
thanking the librarian.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:14.480
All these people had information
needs an American public

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.780
library met.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.000
And the anecdotes I've read nicely
fit the traditional discourse

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.600
of librarianship that focuses
primarily on information.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.320
In many respects, the
professional discourse functions

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.760
like a big intellectual sandbox.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.900
Plenty of room to play with ideas,
but one nonetheless with limits.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.450
A social boundary, if you will,

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:38.180
in which the profession's leaders
employ a formal way of thinking

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.980
to educate and enlighten members
who then implement what they learn.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.550
To improve professional service
for the public's greater benefit.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.570
For librarians, that translates

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.370
into services they
institute and maintain.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:54.290
And collections, spaces, and
resources they make accessible.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:55.960
For most of its history,

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.570
librarianship's discourse
has focused on what

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.930
in the 18th Century was
called useful knowledge.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.300
In the 19th and 20th Century
was called "best reading" --

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.600
that's a phrase that's still

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.810
in the American Library
Association's official motto.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.940
And in the late 20th, has
morphed into information.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.970
This focused term gives
particular meaning to the phrase,

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:23.060
"access to information" that to
this day dominates the profession's

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.620
thinking and automatically
imposes boundaries

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.850
on its intellectual sandboxes.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:33.080
But the American public library
is a unique civic institution.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.870
Because unlike other civic
institutions like courts

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.890
and schools, people
don't have to use it.

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:44.560
As a result, over the generations
users have heavily influenced the

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.160
process of shaping library
collections and services.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.020
Librarianship's discourse,
however, does not address

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.160
in any direct way this
kind of bottom-up pressure.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.200
And for me was not
comprehensive enough

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.200
to explain what I was discovering
about the library as a place.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.780
And the transformative power
of stories, users withdrew

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.970 position:56%
from libraries over the generations.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.440
So to explain my findings,
my challenge became how

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.110
to expand beyond the
professional discourse,

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.030
how to see outside the boundaries

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:17.500
of librarianship's
limited sandbox of ideas.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.030
How to craft a framework
that accommodated

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:24.220
and explained the voices of
library users I was uncovering

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.970
in my research.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.600
To illustrate the importance
of library in place,

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.830
let me introduce you to Rickie.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.500
This is one of the trailers.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:38.380
&gt;&gt; I live in San Francisco, and
I've been here for about a decade.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.640
And I'm current unemployed
but I do go to school.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.940
My apartment is about this big.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.670
And I don't have any
room for a desk.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:53.730
And so I come to the
library to do my homework.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.650 position:56%
But it's also just a great resource.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:02.880
I like to come to the gallery and
see what shows they have going on.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.980
I come to lectures, I come
to see films that they do.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.480
Mayoral debates, I've been here
for a couple of those as well.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.310
I mean, the reason that I'm here is
because I think it's just important

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.110
for people to understand.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:15.550
[ Silence ]

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:24.810
So when I first moved to San
Francisco, I told you I was broke.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.100
And I was literally starving.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:40.710
And I had a place to live,
but the library kept me warm.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:47.670
And it didn't -- I'll get it
together here in a second --

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.950
There was a truck that
came outside once a week

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:57.840
and we could go and get food there.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:03.340
And like I said, they had computers
so that I could work on my resume

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.180
and I could apply for jobs.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.800
And did I mention that
it was warm here?

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:14.910
So it's been there for
me when I needed it.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.010
It's a valuable resource.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:21.520
And oftentimes I think that people
see the library as some place

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.900
for kids or some place
for homeless people.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.790
And there are just
normal people like me

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.360
that might need it as a resource.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.730
So I'm grateful that it's here.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.030
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: And
from my narrative,

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.690
I quote a few more anecdotes.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:43.280 position:56%
During the summer of 1939 at Atlanta
Public Library's African-American

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:49.980
Branch, one of the few places in
the city where Blacks felt safe

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.050
and welcomed, 10-year-old
Martin Luther King Jr. came

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:56.440
to the library many
times during the week,

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.810
Director Annie Waters
later recalled.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:05.300
"He would walk up to the desk
and look me straight in the eye."

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.920
"Hello, Martin Luther," she
would respond, always calling him

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.470
by his first and middle names.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:12.120
"What's on your mind?"

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.360
"Oh, nothing particularly."

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:19.030
For Waters, that was a cue that
King had learned a big new word.

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:23.820
And then they initiated
a conversation

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.790
in which King used
the word repeatedly.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.620
Another game involved poetry.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.300
Again, King would stand
by the desk waiting.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.820
"What's on your mind,
Martin Luther?"

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.120
Waters would ask.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.460
"For I dipped into the future far

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.610
as the human eye could
see," he responded.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.680
Waters immediately recognized
the poem and finished the verse,

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.970
"Saw a vision of the world and
all the wonder that would be."

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:54.160
When the Cincinnati Public Library
opened a piano room in 1955,

00:23:54.160 --> 00:24:01.360
among its first visitors was
12-year-old Jimmy Levine,

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.820
as he wrote his name in pencil
on the room sign-up sheet.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.640
Eight visits later, he changed
his signature to J. Levine.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.510
And finally James Levine.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:19.290
When he gave a concert for 150
children in the children's room

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:27.160
in 1957, he'd already performed
as a Cincinnati symphony soloist.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:32.730
Today he's the New York
Mets' artistic director.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:42.250
In 1969, the Gary, Indiana Public
Library sponsored a local talent

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:45.580
contest at which a group soon to be
known as the Jackson Five competed.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.990
Although they didn't win, little
Michael was an audience favorite.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:54.270
Okay, I'm going to bring it home
to the District of Columbia.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:58.750
In fiscal year 1914-1915,

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:04.540 position:56%
the District of Columbia Public
Library reported auditorium meetings

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:09.570
of the Housekeeper's Alliance
on Parcel Post, attendance 3307.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:14.570
Women's Single Tax League, six
meetings, average attendance 164.

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:17.420
The Washington Readers
Club, 381 attending.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.890
Intercollegiate Socialist Society,

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:24.250
two meetings, average
attendance 188.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:29.790
German Readers Club, two
meetings, average attendance 312.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:33.610
The Wanderlusters, 413 attended
a lecture on Our Common Birds.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:41.960
And the Washington Theosophical
Federation, 348 attendees.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.350
Groups using its study rooms
included the American Racing Pigeon

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:52.160
Association, the Capitol
Poultry and Pigeon Association,

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:58.030
the National Catholic Women's
Art Circle, the Painters

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:01.810
and Decorators Union, a variety
of suffrage organizations,

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.020
and three different
chapters of the Daughters

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.480
of the American Revolution.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.320
Ten years later, Chevy
Chase branch of the District

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.860
of Columbia Public Library.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.070
The Woodbine Circle of the Chevy
Chase Methodist-Episcopal Church

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:18.620
hosted a fashion review of
the latest women's wear,

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.900
from sport costumes and
afternoon dresses to hosiery

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.910
and lingerie, 225 attended.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:28.600
Readings, chorals, and orchestra
music supplement the review.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.500
No report on whether men
were allowed to attend.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:37.380
In World War II at the District
of Columbia Public Library,

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.820
the Petworth Branch became
a site for Government Girls.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:46.640 position:56%
These were women who came to D.C.
for wartime work, to gather in front

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:52.840
of burning logs in the fireplace
and listening to Victrola concerts.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.780
Much of the edge of the loneliness

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.860
of the first Washington
Sunday afternoon

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:02.770
for the Government Girl has
been taken off by attendance

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:06.040
at these concerts, and much
pleasure has been afforded her

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.490
on succeeding Sunday afternoons,
the Washington Post reported.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:14.570
Instead of an austere
resort of the literati,

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:20.590
the District of Columbia Public
Library reported in 1842,

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:26.700
listen carefully, "The libraries
are now becoming community centers

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.050
through their use as a meeting
place for air raid workers,

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:29.350
Red Cross workers, and
other civil defense workers.

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:31.620 position:56%
In 2005, the Washington Post carried
an article by Eric Wee that focused

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.060
on the District of Columbia
branch library in one

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.360
of Washington's poorest
neighborhoods.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.660
In it we reported that

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:36.960
"Every Tuesday night a homeless
man named Conrad Cheek entered the

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.260
library and set up
his chest board on one

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.560
of the tables in the
children's room.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.860
We immediately noticed the
transformation taking place.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.160
No more ignored pleas for this
homeless man, no averted glances.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.460
During the next hour, people
will look him in the eye.

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.760
They'll listen to his words.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.060
In this down-at-the-heels
library, he's the teacher.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.360
Among his students was
9-year-old Ali Osmond [assumed].

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.660
As we watched this interaction,
Ali's mother explained

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:49.960
that her son's confidence had
soared after playing with Conrad.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.260
That he was now bragging to
friends about being a chess player.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.560
We owe it all to Mr.
Conrad, his mother said.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.860
We love him.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.160
Inside the library, we reported,
they call him Mr. Conrad."

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.460
Notice all these very
meaningful experiences occurred

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.760
in a place we call library.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.060
But to categorize them as
information gathering fails

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.360 position:56%
to capture their significance in the
lives of each of these individuals.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.660
My analysis of library
as place grows

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.960
out of a scholarly literature
often labeled "public sphere,"

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.260
a rich repository of ideas that
can deepen our understanding

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.560
of the multiple reasons why
people love their public libraries

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.860
as community places.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.160
Now let me turn to the
transformative potential

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.460
of commonplace stories public
libraries have circulated

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.760
by the billions for generations.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.920
&gt;&gt; My birthday was yesterday,
and I am 95 years old.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.820
I started to use the library,
I would consider, well,

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:28.810
at 13 years old, you know?

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:32.910
I was born in [inaudible] Russia.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:37.420 position:56%
We left and we started from scratch.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.640
And my English was zero.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.940
But the area library was
a couple of blocks away.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:48.930
And that's how it started.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.460
That library was everything to me.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.310
We couldn't afford to buy books.

00:28:56.310 --> 00:29:01.870
Books were always expensive, and
there were so many other needs,

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:06.410
it was library, library,
library all the time.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.020
And it didn't cost anything.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:16.640
But the library fills a
certain place in my life

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.490
to satisfy certain needs.

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:21.210
[Inaudible].

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:25.620
And you just can't live
all the time with bad.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.610
You have to balance it.

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:34.990
And my balance was mostly
to see something beautiful.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:40.710
And so I would go to the library
and spend a couple of hours.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:48.320
But when I come out on the street,
I'm a completely different person.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:53.010
It gave me such a relief,
as the French would say,

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.510
[speaking French], you know?

00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:00.090
[ Silence ]

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.510
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: And more
anecdotes from my narrative.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:07.990
In a 2008 interview, 88-year-old
Pete Seeger recalled an early life

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:09.290
reading experience.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:13.380
"At age 7, a librarian recommended
me a book about a teenager

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.900
who runs away from his
stepfather who's beating him.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.880
And is adopted by a middle-aged
Indian whose tribe was massacred

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.670
and whose wife was sold into
slavery, and is living alone."

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:26.270
That he remembered this
so vividly 80 years

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:29.770
after reading it is testimony
to the power of stories.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:33.890
And in Seeger's case, a New York
Times editor noted upon his recent

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:39.110 position:56%
death, "Fitting for someone who went
on to engage issues of conscience."

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:43.270
In 1984, President Ronald
Reagan wrote the daughter-in-law

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:48.200
of Harold Bell Wright, whose
bestselling 1920's religious novel,

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.850
"That Printer of Udell's"
Reagan read

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:53.690 position:56%
as an adolescent in Dixon, Illinois.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:57.140
Wright was no favorite of
contemporary literary critics.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:01.990 position:56%
H.L. Mencken called him "a liberated
yokel from the cow and hog states."

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:04.170
Another critic was equally harsh.

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:06.880
"Harold Bell Wright
supplies more negative data

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.930 position:56%
on the literary quality of the taste

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:12.890
of the fiction-reading public
than any other author."

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:15.270
No matter to young Reagan, however.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:18.550
Shortly after reading the
book he declared himself saved

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:20.470
and was baptized.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:22.000
The novel's protagonist,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.140
Reagan writes daughter-in-law 60
years later, served as a role model

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.700
that shaped his life ever since.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:34.720 position:56%
It's highly likely the copy of "That
Printer of Udell's" Reagan read came

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.820
from the Dixon Public Library,
which he visited twice a week

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:41.590
in the early 1920's, mostly
to check out Frank Merriwell

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:46.680
and Sherlock Holmes stories, Tarzan
novels, and books by Horatio Alger,

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.400
Zane Grey, and Mark Twain.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:52.070
Many of which he read on
the library's front steps.

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:55.440
"I'm a sucker for hero
worship," he later admitted.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:00.740 position:56%
For Oprah Winfrey,"Reading
commonplace stories was an open door

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.440
for freedom in my life,
and allowed me to see

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.330
that there was a world beyond
my grandmother's front porch

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:07.630
in Mississippi.

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:09.230
That everybody didn't
have an outhouse.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:11.820
That everybody wasn't
surrounded by poverty.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:16.190
That there was a hopeful world out
there, and it could belong to me."

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:20.690
To Winfrey, the stories became "her
comfort, her solace to commune with

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:22.370
and learn something about myself.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.330
To learn something
about other people.

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:27.050 position:56%
To learn something about the world."

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:31.210
In a small Milwaukee apartment
as a 9-year-old in 1963,

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:35.040
she read a public library copy
of "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,"

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.660
her first all-night book.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:40.100
The story of Francine Nolan, whose
life was full of humiliation.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:44.400 position:56%
And whose only friends were in books
lining the public library shelves.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:49.660
"I felt like my life
was hers," she said.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:52.510
After her father died in 1963,

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:55.790
9-year-old Sonia Sotomayor
buried herself in reading

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:58.730
at her Bronx library and
the apartment she shared

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:00.740
with her mother and brother.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:05.410
"Nancy Drew had a powerful hold on
my imagination," she remembered.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:09.280 position:56%
"Every night when I finished reading
and got into bed and closed my eyes,

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.520
I would continue the story
with me in Nancy's shoes.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.250
Until I fell asleep."

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:18.360
Her mind, she noted, worked in
ways very similar to Nancy's.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.190 position:56%
"I was a keen observer and listener.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:23.850
I picked up on clues, I
figured things out logically.

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:25.710
And I enjoyed puzzles.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:29.910
I loved the clear, focused feeling
that came when I concentrated

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:33.620
on solving a problem, and
everything else faded out."

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.810
Her reading that summer,
she admitted, was her solace

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:41.010
and only distraction that got
her through this time of trouble.

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:47.380 position:56%
All these anecdotes point to the
power of printed commonplace stories

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.920
to change people's lives.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:53.210
But stories reside in
all cultural media.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:56.800
"If you watch television, go to
the movies, read popular magazines

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.310
and look at advertisements,"
argues Richard Keller Simon,

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:03.490
"you're exposed to many of the
same kinds of stories as someone

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:06.830
who studies the great books
of Western civilization.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:10.230
You have simply been encouraged
to look at them differently."

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:12.640
"Stories," Richard Nash argues,

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:16.250
"constitute recipes
for the imagination."

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.520
Media scholar Henry Jenkins adds,

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.110
"Stories are basic to
all human cultures.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:25.200
A primary means by which we
structure, share, and make sense

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.300
of our common experiences."

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.600
Meet Danny.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.760
&gt;&gt; One of the things I'd say
the library offered me was

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.520
that it was a place where I could
actually [inaudible] American

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.820
pop culture.

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.500
I grew up in an immigrant
household, so I was --

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:42.000
the library for me was always the
place where I could get free media.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.090
When I was a teenager,
I was really big

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:49.060
into punk rock culture
and the music scene.

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:53.210
And I couldn't afford records, so
I was always going to the library.

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:56.920
Whereas my friends were able
to either buy their records

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.220
with their parents' money.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.620
Or, worse yet, steal it.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.320
I'd always go to the
library and check them out.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:09.190
When I was a teenager -- I think I
might have been like 15 years old,

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:13.810
I had heard about a film
called "A Beautiful Thing."

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:15.760
Which is based on a play.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.120
And it's a gay film.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:21.490
I remember going to the library
and looking up in the catalog

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:23.590
and making sure nobody saw me.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:27.390
And I went to the stacks
and found it,

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:31.030
I kind of hid it underneath a
stack of books, like sandwiched

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:32.760
between a stack of books.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.480
And I checked it out.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:40.570
I took this video home, had
to hide it from my parents.

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:43.870
And I remember watching this film
and it was so powerful to me.

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:54.560
It was a love story between
two young British teenagers.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:59.870
And for me it dropped a
certain anchor down where

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:05.020
on an emotional level I didn't feel
like I was floundering, somehow.

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.850
So that felt really good.

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:13.520 position:56%
And I remember playing that cassette
tape, that VHS tape over and over

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:18.340
and over again late at night
when everyone else was sleeping,

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:22.090
I'd sneak out to the living
room and I'd play this video

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:28.970
that I had borrowed from the
library, like at least once a night

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:32.000
for three weeks in a row.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.060
Sometimes repeating certain
scenes over and over again.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:42.090
Just because for me,
they really spoke to me.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:43.970
And then I would renew it.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:45.270
[Laughter].

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:46.570
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: That public
libraries have always played a

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:48.380
primary role in making
stories accessible

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.800
to millions of users is obvious.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.980
Ever since the Boston Public
Library opened in 1854, fiction,

00:36:54.980 --> 00:37:00.470
a particular form of story,
consistently averaged 66 to 75%

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:02.980
of public library circulation.

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:06.090
By force of demand,
then, every generation

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:10.300 position:56%
of public library users has insisted
on a set of stories acceptable

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.800
to a majority of community members

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:17.400
that contained messages they
wanted to hear, read, and view.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.630
The latest public library
circulation statistics I'll detail

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:23.540 position:56%
in a minute show that they still do.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.730
Reading scholars have clearly
demonstrated the capacity

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:30.800
of commonplace stories to
stimulate reader imagination,

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.420
construct community
through shared meaning,

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.500
and demonstrate moral achievement.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:40.260 position:56%
In the free-will act of reading,
they note, readers move into and out

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:44.920 position:56%
of the text and thus appropriate
meaning relevant to their own lives.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.960
Because readers can control it,

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:51.870
the act of reading stories becomes
dependably pleasurable, empowering,

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:54.910
intellectually stimulating,
and socially bonding.

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:57.500
And it's in the act of
reading stories that social

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.970
and cultural acts of
defiance can take place.

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:03.680
If cultural authorities
-- like H.L. Mencken --

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.390
lack the power to check
voluntary reading

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:10.380
for interpretations
legitimatized by dominant cultures,

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.080
ordinary readers construct
their own meanings.

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:17.790
Sometimes as groups,
sometimes as individuals.

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:22.390
Most often, public libraries do a
good job of supplying information

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:24.930
and stories, as is
evident from Seeger's,

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:27.350
Reagan's, and Winfrey's remarks.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.640
Sometimes they don't, however.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:35.870
Let's see -- In October of 1912,

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:39.970
the District of Columbia Public
Library banned Horatio Alger,

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:43.970
Oliver Optic, Nenthy and the
Elsie-Pansy [phonetic], Old Sleuth,

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:46.310
Nick Carter, College Sports,
Jack Ranger, Boy Hunter,

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:49.110 position:56%
Motor Girl, and Dorothy Dale series.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:52.240
For "tending to institute
false ideas

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.120
in the minds of growing youth."

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.170
The Christian Science
Monitor was confused.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:00.530
"It is impossible to
see where and why

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:03.960
and how the censors have
drawn the line," it argued.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.770
But that kind of sentiment
existed well into the 20th Century.

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:13.460
Although in 1963 most American
public libraries had Nancy Drew

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:16.950
on their shelves, the New
York Public Library did not.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:20.650
Their librarians considered
series fiction trash.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:24.210
Instead, Sonia Sotomayor
got her copies of Nancy Drew

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:26.870
from her mother for good behavior.

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:29.070
The New York Public
Library did not drop the ban

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:32.310
on series fiction until 1976.

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:37.410
In 1960, most public libraries
in the south were segregated.

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:42.910
This is a photo of two beefy
white policemen carrying a thing

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:47.240
African-American teenager out of
the Albany Georgia Public Library

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.410
in the summer of 1962.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:53.300
She had gone into the library, sat
down, and began reading a book.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:57.590
And she wasn't welcome there.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:01.860
Pulp paperback titles from the
1950's and '60s that many gays

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.850
and lesbians read voraciously

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:08.650
and considered survival literature
were never reviewed in book lists,

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:12.810
listed in fiction catalog, or
acquired by public libraries.

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:17.690
What public libraries often gave
them instead was misinformation.

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:19.900
"Because, she believed,
libraries are the place

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.260
where we can be most
anonymous and delve deeply

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.110
into areas we wish to
uncover in secret."

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:30.730
One 15-year-old later recalled, "It
was to the library I turned in 1969

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:33.220
to uncover the meaning
of my lesbianism.

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:36.630
And what I found was not
echoic of my experience.

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:39.330
Rather, those books
frightened me and convinced me

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:45.470
that this was not lesbianism I was
experiencing, but something else."

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:49.840
Let me just -- don't focus on
this now, because I'm going

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.140
to a different subject, alright?

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:55.430
I don't have a blackout capacity
here that I have on some.

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:59.400
Okay, remember back in the
1980's when many evangelists

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.140
of information technology predicted
the demise of public libraries

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.220
by the turn of the century?

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:06.520
They were wrong.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.820
Dead wrong.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:12.490
In 2012, which is the last year for
which we have national statistics,

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:15.630
the United States had more
public libraries than ever --

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:20.880
17,219, including branches
and bookmobiles.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.680
And over 3,000 more than the number

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:28.090
of McDonald's restaurants
in the country.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:34.190
While the number of visits
declined slightly in 2012 from 1.52

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.370
to 1.5 billion -- bear in mind,

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:41.140
though the recession forced
libraries to reduce hours by 2%,

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:43.940
and more patrons were
downloading library e-books

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:45.670
from their home computers,

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:49.470
the decade nonetheless
showed a 21% increase.

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:53.770 position:56%
That same year, 93 million Americans
attended a public library program.

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:59.380
A one-year increase of 4%, and
an eight-year increase of 38%.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.880
Sixty-five million
attendees were children,

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.770
a nearly 4% increase
from the previous year.

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:08.210
And a 24%increase from
the previous decade.

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:14.290 position:56%
In 2012, public libraries circulated
2.2 billion items, including audio

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:19.530
and video materials and 3-books,
a 28% increase from 2003.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:24.650
Circulation per capita showed
a ten-year increase of 17%.

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:27.480
Public libraries also
provided users with access

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:31.050 position:56%
to 250,000 internet-ready computers,

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:35.550
100% more per capita
than a decade earlier.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:38.930
For generations now, library and
government officials have argued

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:42.550
that the public library's most
important role is to provide access

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:46.260
to useful information that
develops intelligent consumers,

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:49.820
creative entrepreneurs,
and informed citizens.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:53.880 position:56%
The kind of information Thomas
Edison pursued in his public library

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:57.740
that many argued people can now
retrieve on their computers.

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.730
At home. Public library
users, however,

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:03.180
show a different set of priorities.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:07.140
For them, the tens of thousands
of spaces public libraries provide

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.230
for many purposes, and the billions

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:12.450
of commonplace stories
they circulate in a variety

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:15.920
of textual forms, are at
least as important as --

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:20.260
perhaps even more important
than -- access to information.

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:23.120
And for a variety of reasons.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.400
In her book, "The Village Effect:

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:31.920 position:56%
How Face-to-Face Contact Can Make
Us Healthier, Happier, and Smarter,"

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.230
Susan Pinker harnesses research
in the fast-developing field

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:38.140
of social neuroscience
to demonstrate

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.780
that substantial benefits
accrue to those

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:44.390
who experience high levels
of face-to-face contact.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:48.700
Including improved vocabularies,
an increased ability to empathize,

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:50.140
a deeper sense of belonging.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:54.770
And perhaps most important,
a longer life span.

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:57.940
Neuroscientific research
that focuses specifically

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:01.300
on the social nature of
commonplace reading comes

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.930
to similar conclusions.

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:06.230
"Fiction," notes research
psychologist Keith Oatley,

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:08.880
"is a particularly
useful simulation.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:13.930 position:56%
Because negotiating the social world
effectively is extremely tricky,

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:18.170
requiring us to weigh up
myriad interacting instances

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:19.870
of cause and effect.

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:22.900
Just as computer simulations
can help us get to grips

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:27.450
with complex scientific
problems, so novels, stories,

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:32.070
and dramas can help us understand
the complexities of social life."

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:36.910 position:56%
As I pondered these conclusions from
the field of social neuroscience,

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:40.870
I wondered if the face-to-face
contact American public libraries

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:45.540
make possible in so many ways
enables users to live longer,

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:49.670
happier, and healthier
lives than non-users.

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:52.540
This is a researchable question.

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.220
And if they do, why?

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:58.830
Answering that question
requires librarianship

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:04.010 position:56%
to expand way beyond its traditional
focus on information access in order

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:07.400
to explore the community
building and personal benefits

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:12.680
that public libraries place in
the sociability that reading,

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.220
viewing, and listening fosters.

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:19.870
For generations now, adolescent
series fiction and adult westerns,

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:23.710
romances, horror, and science
fiction novels have driven public

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:25.130
library circulation.

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:26.430
And they still do.

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:29.880
Through commonplace stories
like these that they circulate

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.860
by the billions, American public
libraries have helped empower,

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.100
inform, intellectually stimulate,

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.760
and inspire their readers,
viewers and listeners.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.590
Just like they did for
Pete Seeger, Ronald Reagan,

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:44.230
Oprah Winfrey, and Sonia Sotomayor.

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:48.350
Tens of thousands of spaces they
make available to their patrons,

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:52.360
they have helped construct
community in multiple positive ways

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.660 position:56%
through the billions of face-to-face
encounters they nurture.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:46:00.520
Just like they did for Martin
Luther King Jr. and Conrad Cheek.

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.800
In my lifetime of research
into American library history,

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.220
I've read thousands
of statements like,

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:10.450
"Public libraries are not just
warehouses of books anymore."

00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:14.700
If "Part of Our Lives" accurately
represents public library history,

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.700
they never were.

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:20.520
Yet for effect and contrast,
journalists often parroted

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.990
and reinforced this myth by
drawing on these stereotypes

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.870
and on their own limited
public library experiences.

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:30.930
If I had a dollar for every time I
came across a statement like this

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:33.430
in my research, I'd
probably make more money

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:36.610
than the royalties this
book will generate.

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:40.530
I've also read hundreds of sweeping
predictions concerning the future

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.860
of these ubiquitous institutions.

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:45.840
Of those grounded largely
on a particular definition

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:50.290
of useful knowledge in the 18th
and 19th Century, on best reading

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:55.300 position:56%
in the 19th and 20th Centuries, and
on information in the 20th and 21st,

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.860
of those that ignored the power
of library-supplied stories,

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:03.150
millions now read, view, and
listen to daily, and the library

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:08.050
as place billions now visit
annually, none proved true.

00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:12.060
I urge you all to keep that in mind
as you ponder today's predictions

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:16.750
about and plans for
tomorrow's public library.

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:20.160
Access to information,
library as place,

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:24.460
and the transformative potential
of reading commonplace stories.

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.140
I hope conclusions I've drawn

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:29.200
from my historical
research have persuaded you

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.270
to broaden your thinking
about libraries in general.

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:35.120
And public libraries in particular.

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:36.970
The naysayers largely ignorant

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.540
of this library history
are still with us.

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:42.530
It's all on the internet,
hype many evangelists

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:44.760
of information technology.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:49.260
Libraries are dinosaurs, grouse
officials looking to cut budgets.

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:51.790
I argue here that to combat
this limited thinking,

00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:56.150
we have to extend our scope beyond
information access to include,

00:47:56.150 --> 00:48:01.220
from a user's perspective, deeper
analysis of the library as place.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.840
And here I want to
show you the lobby

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.550
of the Toledo Lucas County
Public Library the night

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:10.930
that a Harry Potter
novel was released.

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:14.510
And take a look at the
diversity of that audience.

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:22.200
[ Silence ]

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:27.280 position:56%
The complex dynamics that are taking
place in that room are something

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:32.590
about which we still know very
little in our library profession.

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:34.320
Or this one.

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:38.790
That's my son, Andy, reading
to my grandson, Teague.

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:42.750
Unfortunately, I don't have
a copy of me reading to Andy

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:45.770
from 30 or 40 years earlier.

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:48.890
But Teague picked that
book out of the library.

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:51.400
He is fully capable of reading it.

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.480
But he wanted his dad
to read it to him.

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:58.130
It's about sports, and it's
a subject on which they bond.

00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:03.510
We do not have longitudinal studies
to help us explain the dynamics

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:08.320
of that particular act
of reading over time.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:13.200
And what role the public
library has played

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:16.810
in whatever benefits
accrue as a result of that.

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:20.860
I'm going to leave
that on there for --

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:25.820
So I argue here that to
combat this limited thinking,

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:29.300
we have to extend our scope beyond
information access to include

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:33.440
from a user's perspective deeper
analysis of library as place.

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.490 position:56%
And the role of commonplace stories.

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:39.570
By doing so, my historical research
demonstrates we can document

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:43.560
hundreds, if not thousands,
more ways these incubators

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:47.990
of personal happiness and
informal self-education contribute

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:51.120
to the daily lives of our
patrons as individuals

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.190
and as members of their community.

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:56.770
And we can show much more clearly
how they function as active

00:49:56.770 --> 00:50:00.900 position:56%
and effective agents in the
construction of that very community.

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:02.700
Thank you.

[ Silence ]

00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:23.470
Yes?

&gt;&gt; When you emphasize that
libraries and librarians really need

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:41.710 position:56%
to do more anecdotal evidence,
Eileen Cooke -- you remember Eileen?

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:44.670
-- as the Washington
ALA Office Director,

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:50.880
she always told us anecdotes
for what improves your budget.

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:59.140
And I think a lot of librarians
did in fact follow that advice.

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:04.930
So it's not -- I guess
I'm arguing with you.

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:08.270
It's not really such
a silly statement.

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:09.570
&gt;&gt; Could you repeat the question?

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:12.480
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: I'll
try, I'll try.

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:17.530
Eileen Cooke, ALA's Washington
Director, told people,

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:21.240
"Use anecdotes in arguing
for better budgets."

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:24.830
And I'm not disputing that.

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:32.060
If you look at contemporary calls
for evidence of productivity,

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:34.390
the word "outcome" explodes.

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:42.690
And the anecdotes don't necessarily
address how people want the answers

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:45.030
to outcome questions framed.

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:47.610
I argue that's a wrong
way of thinking.

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:51.060 position:56%
And in part there are certain things

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:54.960
that we can't attribute
numbers to very easily.

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:58.610
Ask me how much I love my son?

00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:02.140
On a scale of 1 to 10, 1
being lowest, 10 the highest.

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.900
What do you think I'm going to say?

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:07.990
Okay, now the only way I
can describe that love is

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:10.180
in metaphors and similes.

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:13.700
And, you know, perhaps
a poem you and I share.

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:18.630
Which gives me the vocabulary
to express that emotion, okay?

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:21.060
And that's what's happening
with the reading

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:23.130
and with the library as place.

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:27.770
We can't -- libraries traditionally
have cited circulation statistics

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:29.750
as a measure of their value.

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:31.050
Doesn't go deep enough.

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:37.190
So I hope that someone, some folks
develop research methodologies

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:42.900
that allow us to do that, to answer
those outcome kinds of questions.

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.220
Which are very much
framed by social science --

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:48.030
statistics and social
science methodologies.

00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:49.920
I'm not disparaging that, mind you.

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:59.170
But honing in just on those,
you lose that and that.

00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:03.300
So I'm not disagreeing with you.

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:08.280
And history, by the way, what is
history other than an accumulation

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:13.950
of anecdotes that one human
being assembles into a story.

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:16.230
And then tries to persuade others.

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:18.410
Which is exactly what
I've tried to do here.

00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:23.200
The difference in that particular
book is that I have been selective

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.290
in particular kinds of anecdotes.

00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:28.360
I've looked for anecdotes on
libraries' place, and I've looked

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.920
for anecdotes on commonplace
reading.

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.740
And that's the stuff
that came back to me.

00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:34.040
It just hit me.

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:35.340
Yes, sir?

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:39.210
&gt;&gt; I was struck by the sign
in front of the library

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:44.160
where the young Black woman
was getting escorted out.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.590
It said "Carnegie."

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:48.300
Having spent many summers
in Carnegie [inaudible],

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:53.240
I was wondering if research showed
anything interesting with regard

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:58.130
to external funding other
than just public tax funding,

00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:07.610
more global money to fund
and operate public libraries?

00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:09.170
Is there any difference,
from your perspective?

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:12.520
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: No, I -- bring
that question back to me again?

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:16.690
Because I didn't quite
catch what you're asking.

00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:19.170
&gt;&gt; Apparently Andrew Carnegie
gave away a lot of money

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:21.460
to fund public libraries.

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:23.290
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: He gave
money to put buildings up,

00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:25.620
that was the money he gave.

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:28.030
Right, so a community would
apply for a Carnegie grant.

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:30.470
His minions would evaluate
population, etcetera.

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:33.070
And then he'd give them a
grant to build a library.

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:38.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; My question is, does that
external stimulus make a difference?

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:40.350
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: Oh,
yeah, now I got you.

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:43.280
Okay. Absolutely.

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:49.030
Without Andrew Carnegie, we
would not have 17,000 public

00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:51.050
libraries today.

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:55.060
He gave 1600 public
library buildings --

00:54:55.060 --> 00:55:00.350
in this country, stimulated other
philanthropists to do the same.

00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:04.960
Enoch Pratt in Baltimore,
for example.

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:08.010
And it expanded the
number of public libraries.

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:10.120
And then it became --

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:13.250
if your community didn't
have a public library,

00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:16.270
it was somehow culturally backward.

00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:20.060
So absolutely, Andrew
Carnegie had a huge influence

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.940
on the public library movement.

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:25.890
But then so did the Great Society
programs have a huge influence

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:28.030
on the public library
movement in the 1960's.

00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:29.330
Yes, ma'am?

00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:33.230
&gt;&gt; So as much as I hate to say
this, I think it's really good

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:38.150
that you have Ronald Reagan
as one of your examples.

00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:41.020
Because he is such
a conservative icon.

00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:44.530
And when I went through the list
of all the other ones you have,

00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:48.800
there aren't that many people who
grew up to be conservatives or,

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.780
you know, be the poster
boy the way Reagan is.

00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:55.580
And I'm just wondering if it might
be a good idea to balance that?

00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:57.240
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: You're
asking for balance?

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:01.630
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: Yeah, and I
could put more conservatives in.

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:04.360
Newt Gingrich is a
lover of libraries.

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:07.090
And I think while he was
Speaker of the House,

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:10.110
was a Friend of the
Library of Congress, right?

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:12.070
Yes, sure, I can do that.

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:14.910
Only got so much time, though.

00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:18.400
And there are certain stories
that just tug at my heart.

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:23.280
You know, how could I not put the
Martin Luther King story in there?

00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:28.890
&gt;&gt; Other questions?

00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:30.190
We have time.

00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:31.490
Please.

00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:35.770
&gt;&gt; What did you see
as the difference

00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:39.320
between archives and libraries?

00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:53.430 position:56%
And why perhaps have archives not
had as much of a personal connection

00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:57.370 position:56%
with those communities as libraries?

00:56:57.370 --> 00:57:00.700
Certainly in the last 20
years, archives are trying

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:05.110
to expand their reach and
their interest in the public.

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:08.450
But it always gives much
different situation.

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:09.750
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: Yes.

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:12.360
And I don't know that I've
got a good answer for that.

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:15.080
I am a user of archives,
I reek of archives dust.

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:17.310
But, you know, I'll
say that I'm unique.

00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:20.010
Unique -- I mean, how
many people are like me

00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:21.660
that do archival research?

00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:22.960
Now, I make a lot of noise.

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:28.710 position:56%
When they tried to deal with the New
York Public Library on 42nd Street

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:31.530
in a different way, the people
like me came out of the woodwork

00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:32.830
and said, you can't do this.

00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:35.560
And the voices are powerful
enough to attract media attention.

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.160
And it backed the library
administration

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:39.600
down on New York Public Library.

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:42.810
But unless there's
a compelling reason

00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:47.470
to command media attention
among archivists,

00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:51.560
I'm not so sure it's going to --

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:57.030
Boston tries to reduce its
public libraries' budget.

00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:59.940
Philadelphia tries to reduce
its public library budget.

00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:03.050
New York Public Library tried to
reduce its public library budget,

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:04.350
and the people come
out of the woodwork.

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:05.960 position:56%
And I would say the reason they come

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:09.410
out of the woodwork is exactly
what you see in this picture.

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:11.690
They've had a set of experiences

00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:13.710
which they can't necessarily
articulate.

00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:17.790
When would you command an
audience like that for archives?

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:19.090
&gt;&gt; Do you mean [inaudible]?

00:58:19.090 --> 00:58:20.520
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: Absolutely.

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:24.760
And for the longest time,
genealogists were disparaged

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:27.740
as some kind of a low-class
researcher.

00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:29.540
Not a good idea.

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:31.060
It's like commonplace reading.

00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:32.360
Yes, Skip?

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:35.330
&gt;&gt; How much of your book is --

00:58:35.330 --> 00:58:37.680
I see it's going to be
available on Kindle.

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:41.030
But how much of the reference
material is available

00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:42.330
from the Kindle?

00:58:42.330 --> 00:58:45.050
Like in other words, you've
got obviously thousands

00:58:45.050 --> 00:58:46.350
of things you've researched.

00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:50.470
I'm wondering just whether
you can go to the Kindle

00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:53.310
and then get hot links to other --

00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:55.440
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: I
think the entire book is

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:57.920
on the Kindle edition,
on the e-copy.

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:01.590
But it's pretty cumbersome
to get from text to footnote.

00:59:01.590 --> 00:59:04.290
And I'd feel sorry for
readers who have to do that.

00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:07.940
I wanted the footnotes to be
at the bottom of the page.

00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:13.460
But I was not given that privilege.

00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:21.270
So the original -- when a
historian writes the first draft,

00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:26.370
it's what I call "the
mind dump draft."

00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:28.660
You've spent years
gathering this material.

00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:30.500
And you sit down in the
quiet of your study.

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:33.960
And you process this stuff, and you
select from all this massive amount

00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:37.160
of information the stuff you
think will fit into a story.

00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.380
That first draft was 500,000 words.

00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:43.170
That would have been three volumes
over there, had I not been --

00:59:43.170 --> 00:59:49.050
So I sent it to Oxford
University Press at 240,000 words.

00:59:49.050 --> 00:59:51.550
They said, well, we
really like this subject.

00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:53.280
And we like the story, but we want

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:56.230
to make it a trade book
rather than an academic book.

00:59:56.230 --> 01:00:00.300
Which means you've got to
pare it to 135,000 words.

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:03.600
So I've got 365,000 words out there

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.520
that have never been
used in this story.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:12.220
So there are a lot of anecdotes to
certainly convince me that place

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:14.820
and reading is a big deal
in public library history.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.850
And it looks to be like
it is a big deal now.

01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:23.460 position:56%
so I wish -- if you have any
question about anything in that book

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:26.090
for which you want a
citation, email me.

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:29.530
And I'll be happy to go to those
500,000 words and find them.

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:30.830
[ Applause ]

01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:32.520
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Let's
give Wayne a hand.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:36.560
Stay here for a second.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.860
Wayne, that was great.

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:40.800
I knew it was a wonderful
area that you've elected.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:45.430
Not to be your concluding
area of study at all,

01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:48.130
but the telling of
stories is amazing.

01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:52.210
And I have one -- something to say
about Wayne and all the material

01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:53.510
that he's worked on
through the years,

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:55.460
and all of the stories he has.

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.820
This last year, the
Center for the Book decided

01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.960
to host the very first Library

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:03.160
of Congress symposium
on romance fiction.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.240
And part of the reason was
the lack of our ability

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:11.980
to really use romance fiction,
or to draw romance publishers

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.890
to the National Book Festival.

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:19.140
And Wayne, from the very beginning
kept hounding me and others

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.540
that I was working with --
which was one of our partners,

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:26.260
the Romance Society of America
and a couple of others --

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:31.300
with stories from the 19th Century
about how romance fiction was

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:38.480
such a popular mainstay of
storytelling and of reading.

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.540
And to this day, Wayne and I
now have a stack of stories

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:45.990
that we were not able
to use in the symposium.

01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:50.480
But we were able to move
romance fiction as a genre

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.770
into the National Book Festival,

01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:55.720
where it was extremely
popular and it will stay.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:00.390
So I look forward to using
some of Wayne's unused stories

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:04.990
for a good cause for
many years to come.

01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:07.320
We're going to end
with a book signing.

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:11.330
And there are books available at
the Library of Congress discount.

01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:13.970
Wayne will stick around
to sign them.

01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:16.920
We also have some free giveaways.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.870
We put together a new
Library of Congress issue

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:24.420
of our magazine called "LCM" just
in time for the book festival.

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:26.690
And it's all about
the joy of reading.

01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:31.730
And has a good description of
a lot of activities that are

01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:33.780
in the Center for the Book's ken.

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:37.970
And I also brought out a stack
to give away of a history

01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:42.020
of the D.C. Public Library
that I write a dozen years ago.

01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:45.030
And I was glad to see some
of those disappearing now

01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:48.610
that Wayne has hit the
D.C. Public Library plug.

01:02:48.610 --> 01:02:51.180
So there will be some of
those that you can take.

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:52.900
But you're going to
have to buy Wayne's book

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:55.010
at the discount to
get his signature.

01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:58.400
Let's conclude with another
round of applause for Wayne.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.850
[Applause]

01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:05.490
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
