00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:07.200
We spend a lot of our lives lying to someone very close to home: ourselves.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.880
We lie because so many of the things we feel

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.000
are humiliating, challenging, strange and unflattering.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We don't just forget to aknowledge our feelings

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
One part of the mind actively shields the other from uncomfortable truths,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but the cost of our denial is high

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
because emotions that have not been properly confronted

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.640
lead to a psychological impoverishment, brittleness, rage and deceit.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.040
it is deeply uncomfortable to want something that one can't have.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.260
So, a standard form of denial is to reinvent how much one ever really wanted the elusive element

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
in the first place.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.980
We reevaluate what a thing means to us,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.700
it might be a job, a holiday or a person.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.700
When it becomes clear it can never be ours

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.820
it takes exceptional maturity

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.660
to hold onto the idea that something might be at once precious

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.280
and yet forever, and maddeningly, out of reach.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.680
Perhaps you were 14 and entering a new class,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.380
when you noticed an extraordinary new student,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.380
taller than you, with grey green eyes,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.900
thick auburn hair and an intelligent wry smile.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.620
They were one of the most charming people you'd ever encountered

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.020
and also utterly beyond you.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.340
You were pimply and immature, you couldn't do sports,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.340
you weren't great at languages.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.980
Of course, you might have tried to become their friend,

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.300
you might have shed jokes and chitchat,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.000
but this kind of compromise would have hurt too much.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.880
So, to reduce the pain, you became nasty,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.940
you started to hate the person you liked,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.140
you sought to spoil because you could not have,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.520
you became mean where you would, at one level, have wanted to worship.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.740
You called the a stuck-up idiot, and worse.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.740
You organized a group to torment them,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.740
one time you stole their scarf.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.340
You escaped your feeling through a denigration that hid, not hatred,

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.820
but at base, a passionate secret love.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.840
Sometimes our meanness takes drier, more intellectual forms.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.720
Perhaps at the office, you recently sent a random memo headed:

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.180
"Recruitment Policies for Q4 Sales Team".

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.600
In it you argued in sober prose with numbered paragraphs

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.400
that the company shouldn't, in the future, seek to recruit any more recent university graduates,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.260
on the grounds that they tended not to meet the expectations of clients.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.320
The need for this kind of high-flown self deception

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.520
began the day you first laid eyes on the new recruit,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.120
who seemed astonishingly young, enthusiastic, endearing and desirable.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.120
The emotions you felt were a piece of madness

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.120
for a married, middle-aged person.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.480
The target of your desire was 23 with coltish energy and innocent friendliness.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.960
On the second week they tried to ask what you'd done on the weekend,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.740
and mentioned that they'd tried wind surfing for the first time.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.780
You responded by being rather stern,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.880
with collegues you judged their performance in a critical way that seemed just about fair,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.080
at the commettee meeting you damned them with faint praise

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.520
and at the earliest opportunity you made sure their contract was not renewed.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.680
Of course, being honest about our real feelings

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.140
doesn't mean we should always act on them.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.900
It's not a good idea to make every feeling known to those it concerns.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.140
The choice we face isn't between denial and inaction,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.900
or honesty followed by a brusk move on the people around us.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.220
We can accept many of our desires without needing to think we should do anything about them.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.200
The best way to overcome denial of some of our more impossible desires for people

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.480
is to accept who we are, what we want and then sometimes just sit with our hands firmly tied,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.700
reflecting sadly on the deep strangeness and unsatisfactoriness of the human condition,

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.700
but that will be a lot better than self deception and meanness.
