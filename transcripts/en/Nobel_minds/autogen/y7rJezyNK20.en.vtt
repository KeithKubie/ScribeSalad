that was cited in the award so I'm going

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780
that was cited in the award so I'm going
 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.660
that was cited in the award so I'm going
to talk about behavior a welfare and

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670
to talk about behavior a welfare and
 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.530
to talk about behavior a welfare and
poverty there are some themes that I

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540
poverty there are some themes that I
 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.570
poverty there are some themes that I
want to highlight from the beginning one

that gains that has guided a tremendous

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580
that gains that has guided a tremendous
 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.289
that gains that has guided a tremendous
amount of my work over the years which

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299
amount of my work over the years which
 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.050
amount of my work over the years which
is inquiring into policy that makes

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060
is inquiring into policy that makes
 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.440
is inquiring into policy that makes
people people better off that can

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450
people people better off that can
 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.100
people people better off that can
improve well-being if you think about

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110
improve well-being if you think about
 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.930
improve well-being if you think about
this in the context of global poverty

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940
this in the context of global poverty
 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.539
this in the context of global poverty
for example the problem here I think is

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549
for example the problem here I think is
 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.610
for example the problem here I think is
not that there's any lack of tools and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
not that there's any lack of tools and
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.440
not that there's any lack of tools and
policies there are many many policies

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450
policies there are many many policies
 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.140
policies there are many many policies
out there for whom advocates believe

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150
out there for whom advocates believe
 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.670
out there for whom advocates believe
that they can make the world a better

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680
that they can make the world a better
 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.470
that they can make the world a better
place but the key thing here is using

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480
place but the key thing here is using
 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.949
place but the key thing here is using
measurement as honest scorekeeping to

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959
measurement as honest scorekeeping to
 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.539
measurement as honest scorekeeping to
find out whether something is actually

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549
find out whether something is actually
 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.819
find out whether something is actually
working or whether it's not working at

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829
working or whether it's not working at
 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.160
working or whether it's not working at
all and one of the themes I'll emphasize

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170
all and one of the themes I'll emphasize
 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.920
all and one of the themes I'll emphasize
throughout is the enormous importance of

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930
throughout is the enormous importance of
 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.860
throughout is the enormous importance of
measurement almost by itself we're

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870
measurement almost by itself we're
 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.120
measurement almost by itself we're
always told there's no measurement

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130
always told there's no measurement
 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.819
always told there's no measurement
without theory and while that's true

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829
without theory and while that's true
 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.199
without theory and while that's true
it's more true just to say that

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209
it's more true just to say that
 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.120
it's more true just to say that
measurement is incredibly important and

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130
measurement is incredibly important and
 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.150
measurement is incredibly important and
it's often forgotten in economics just

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160
it's often forgotten in economics just
 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.460
it's often forgotten in economics just
how important measurement is the other

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470
how important measurement is the other
 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.990
how important measurement is the other
theme I'm going to talk about throughout

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000
theme I'm going to talk about throughout
 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.500
theme I'm going to talk about throughout
is individuals versus aggregates or

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510
is individuals versus aggregates or
 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.099
is individuals versus aggregates or
averages in a world in which you work

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109
averages in a world in which you work
 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.050
averages in a world in which you work
entirely on averages if you look at the

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060
entirely on averages if you look at the
 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.379
entirely on averages if you look at the
macro economy things like inequality and

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389
macro economy things like inequality and
 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.849
macro economy things like inequality and
poverty are simply not legible without

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859
poverty are simply not legible without
 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.729
poverty are simply not legible without
disaggregation without the details of

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739
disaggregation without the details of
 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.460
disaggregation without the details of
individuals the other thing is even if

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470
individuals the other thing is even if
 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.170
individuals the other thing is even if
you're only interested in the aggregate

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180
you're only interested in the aggregate
 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.430
you're only interested in the aggregate
economy

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440

distribution clearly matters for

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900
distribution clearly matters for
 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.600
distribution clearly matters for
aggregate economic activity and

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610
aggregate economic activity and
 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.449
aggregate economic activity and
certainly for any serious analysis of

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459
certainly for any serious analysis of
 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.140
certainly for any serious analysis of
well-being finally we know that behavior

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150
well-being finally we know that behavior
 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.699
well-being finally we know that behavior
and well-being are linked for

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709
and well-being are linked for
 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.530
and well-being are linked for
individuals they're not linked for

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540
individuals they're not linked for
 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.270
individuals they're not linked for
aggregates so what you see from the

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280
aggregates so what you see from the
 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.309
aggregates so what you see from the
macroeconomy doesn't necessarily tell

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319
macroeconomy doesn't necessarily tell
 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.650
macroeconomy doesn't necessarily tell
you by itself whether people are doing

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660
you by itself whether people are doing
 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.550
you by itself whether people are doing
better or doing worse there's a theme

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560
better or doing worse there's a theme
 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.440
better or doing worse there's a theme
which runs through a lot of my work in

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450
which runs through a lot of my work in
 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.690
which runs through a lot of my work in
which is being challenged and I'm

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700
which is being challenged and I'm
 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.060
which is being challenged and I'm
sympathetic to that challenge which is

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070
sympathetic to that challenge which is
 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.370
sympathetic to that challenge which is
that if people by and large behave in

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380
that if people by and large behave in
 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.770
that if people by and large behave in
their own interests than by looking at

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780
their own interests than by looking at
 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.810
their own interests than by looking at
their behavior we can infer quite a lot

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820
their behavior we can infer quite a lot
 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.700
their behavior we can infer quite a lot
about how they are doing

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710
about how they are doing
 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.500
about how they are doing
it's what economists called revealed

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510
it's what economists called revealed
 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.080
it's what economists called revealed
preference analysis and it's always been

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090
preference analysis and it's always been
 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.430
preference analysis and it's always been
long been this standard in economics I'm

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440
long been this standard in economics I'm
 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.530
long been this standard in economics I'm
going to start at the very oldest stuff

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540
going to start at the very oldest stuff
 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.120
going to start at the very oldest stuff
and come up to stuff I've been doing

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130
and come up to stuff I've been doing
 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.460
and come up to stuff I've been doing
relatively recently and then move back

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470
relatively recently and then move back
 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.820

00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:33.779
know with surveys is you want to know
 

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:35.690
know with surveys is you want to know
how people respond to prices and I'm

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:35.700
how people respond to prices and I'm
 

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.180
how people respond to prices and I'm
going to talk about that quite a bit

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:38.190
going to talk about that quite a bit
 

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.920
going to talk about that quite a bit
normally you can't do that from site

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:39.930
normally you can't do that from site
 

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.320
normally you can't do that from site
surveys but some surveys collect data on

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:42.330
surveys but some surveys collect data on
 

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.510
surveys but some surveys collect data on
quantities as well as expenditures so

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:44.520
quantities as well as expenditures so
 

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.250
quantities as well as expenditures so
you know for a household that they

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:46.260
you know for a household that they
 

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.199
you know for a household that they
bought three kilos of rice and paid so

00:08:48.199 --> 00:08:48.209
bought three kilos of rice and paid so
 

00:08:48.209 --> 00:08:50.300
bought three kilos of rice and paid so
much for it over the last week so you

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:50.310
much for it over the last week so you
 

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.550
much for it over the last week so you
can get some idea of how much they paid

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560
can get some idea of how much they paid
 

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.860
can get some idea of how much they paid
for each kilo and you can use that to

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:54.870
for each kilo and you can use that to
 

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.980
for each kilo and you can use that to
analyze responses to prices across

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:57.990
analyze responses to prices across
 

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.740
analyze responses to prices across
different space one of the interesting

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:00.750
different space one of the interesting
 

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.300
different space one of the interesting
things about that work is it tends to

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:02.310
things about that work is it tends to
 

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.250
things about that work is it tends to
show these spatial price responses tend

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:04.260
show these spatial price responses tend
 

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.130
show these spatial price responses tend
to be quite large suggesting that

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:07.140
to be quite large suggesting that
 

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.230
to be quite large suggesting that
long-run responses which is what you're

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240
long-run responses which is what you're
 

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.139
long-run responses which is what you're
perhaps picking up across space are

00:09:12.139 --> 00:09:12.149
perhaps picking up across space are
 

00:09:12.149 --> 00:09:14.780
perhaps picking up across space are
larger than short-run responses this is

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:14.790
larger than short-run responses this is
 

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.120
larger than short-run responses this is
important because it suggests that the

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.130
important because it suggests that the
 

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.190

greatly underestimate the distortions

room for a week and I was determined

that I would not come out of the room

until I'd really understood what that
paper was about and I came out at the

paper was about and I came out at the
 

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.550
paper was about and I came out at the
end of the week and I knew absolutely no

at the beginning of the week but slowly
there began to be a little bit of

relatively few people of which Gorman

relatively few people of which Gorman

relatively few people of which Gorman
and McFadden were the most notable who

00:15:03.139 --> 00:15:03.149
and McFadden were the most notable who
 

00:15:03.149 --> 00:15:04.549
and McFadden were the most notable who
had understood that this dual

had understood that this dual
 

00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:06.949
had understood that this dual
representation was really the way to

representation was really the way to
 

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:09.589

macroeconomics today and the modeling of
the stochastic process of earnings is a

00:30:51.369 --> 00:30:51.379
the stochastic process of earnings is a
 

00:30:51.379 --> 00:30:54.399
the stochastic process of earnings is a
very central area to now and the brief I

00:30:54.399 --> 00:30:54.409
very central area to now and the brief I
 

00:30:54.409 --> 00:30:56.440
very central area to now and the brief I
was given I was told to talk about my

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:56.450
was given I was told to talk about my
 

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:58.570
was given I was told to talk about my
discoveries I think they probably send

00:30:58.570 --> 00:30:58.580
discoveries I think they probably send
 

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.879
discoveries I think they probably send
this text to everybody and it's not

00:31:00.879 --> 00:31:00.889
this text to everybody and it's not
 

00:31:00.889 --> 00:31:02.769
this text to everybody and it's not
entirely clear whether economists are

00:31:02.769 --> 00:31:02.779
entirely clear whether economists are
 

00:31:02.779 --> 00:31:05.740
entirely clear whether economists are
supposed to have discoveries and I think

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:05.750
supposed to have discoveries and I think
 

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.629
supposed to have discoveries and I think
of discoveries as sort of apples falling

00:31:07.629 --> 00:31:07.639
of discoveries as sort of apples falling
 

00:31:07.639 --> 00:31:09.129
of discoveries as sort of apples falling
on your head

00:31:09.129 --> 00:31:09.139
on your head
 

00:31:09.139 --> 00:31:11.799
on your head
but those apples only set off good ideas

00:31:11.799 --> 00:31:11.809
but those apples only set off good ideas
 

00:31:11.809 --> 00:31:14.680
but those apples only set off good ideas
if someone has prepared your head before

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:14.690
if someone has prepared your head before
 

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:16.799
if someone has prepared your head before
and so it's a very collaborative

00:31:16.799 --> 00:31:16.809
and so it's a very collaborative
 

00:31:16.809 --> 00:31:19.330
and so it's a very collaborative
activity so I wrote down some of the

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:19.340
activity so I wrote down some of the
 

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.190
activity so I wrote down some of the
things I'm most proud of and one is

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200
things I'm most proud of and one is
 

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.539
things I'm most proud of and one is
something I haven't talked about which

00:31:22.539 --> 00:31:22.549
something I haven't talked about which
 

00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:25.899
something I haven't talked about which
is early in my career when Ted Heath was

00:31:25.899 --> 00:31:25.909
is early in my career when Ted Heath was

is early in my career when Ted Heath was
Prime Minister of Britain and the

Prime Minister of Britain and the
government lost control of inflation and

00:31:29.409 --> 00:31:29.419
government lost control of inflation and
 

00:31:29.419 --> 00:31:31.299
government lost control of inflation and
I was young father and I would go to the

00:31:31.299 --> 00:31:31.309
I was young father and I would go to the
 

00:31:31.309 --> 00:31:34.060
I was young father and I would go to the
store and I thought all individual

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:34.070

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.039

relative prices were going up because

00:31:36.039 --> 00:31:36.049
relative prices were going up because
 

00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:39.009
relative prices were going up because
the result is unanticipated inflation so

00:31:39.009 --> 00:31:39.019
the result is unanticipated inflation so
 

00:31:39.019 --> 00:31:40.799
the result is unanticipated inflation so
I predicted that this unanticipated

00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:40.809
I predicted that this unanticipated
 

00:31:40.809 --> 00:31:42.639
I predicted that this unanticipated
inflation would actually increase

00:31:42.639 --> 00:31:42.649
inflation would actually increase
 

00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:44.529
inflation would actually increase
savings without people wanting to

00:31:44.529 --> 00:31:44.539
savings without people wanting to
 

00:31:44.539 --> 00:31:46.600
savings without people wanting to
increase savings and I thought that was

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:46.610
increase savings and I thought that was
 

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:49.149
increase savings and I thought that was
a ridiculous prediction and so did

00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:49.159
a ridiculous prediction and so did
 

00:31:49.159 --> 00:31:50.710
a ridiculous prediction and so did
everyone in the common room at Cambridge

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720
everyone in the common room at Cambridge
 

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.470
everyone in the common room at Cambridge
and I was widely laughed at until it

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:53.480
and I was widely laughed at until it
 

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.499
and I was widely laughed at until it
became true and the data of course then

00:31:56.499 --> 00:31:56.509
became true and the data of course then

I came up with a prediction that seemed
 

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.899
I came up with a prediction that seemed
ridiculous and turned out to be borne

00:32:07.899 --> 00:32:07.909
ridiculous and turned out to be borne
 

00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:10.720
