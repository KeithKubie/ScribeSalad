00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.270
All right.

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:02.860
We're on problem 26.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.250
For the quadrilateral shown
below, a quadrilateral has

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.120
four sides, measure of angle A
plus the measure of angle C is

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.310
equal to what?

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.770
And here, you should know that
the sum of all the angles in a

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.890
quadrilateral are equal
to 360 degrees.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.410
And you might say, OK, I'll add
that to my memory bank of

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.290
things to memorize.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.340
Like the angles in a triangle
are equal to 180.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.110
And I'll show you no, you don't
have to memorize that.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.010
Because if you imagine any
quadrilateral, let me draw a

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.960
quadrilateral for you.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.970
And this is true
of any polygon.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.770
So let's say this is
some quadrilateral.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.660
You don't have to memorize that
the sum of the angles is

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.270
equal to 360.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.880
Although it might be useful
for a quadrilateral.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.040
But I'll show you how to always

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.630
prove it for any polygon.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.160
You just break it up
into triangles.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.770
Then you only have to
memorize one thing.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.660
If you break it up into
triangles, this angle plus

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.080
that angle plus that angle
has to be equal to 180.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.480
And this angle plus that angle
plus that angle have to be

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.710
equal to 180.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.630
So the angles in the
quadrilateral itself are this

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.970
angle and this angle.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.550
And then this angle
and this angle.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.680
Well this one is just the sum
of those two, and this one's

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.180
just the sum of those two.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.340
So if these three
added up to 180.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.150
And these three added
up to 180.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.870
This plus this plus this, plus
this will add up to 360.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.150
And you can do that with an
arbitrarily shaped polygon.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.760
Let's do five sides, let's
do a pentagon.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.290
So one, two, three,
four, five sides.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.230
Wow, how many angles are
there in a pentagon.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.180
Just break it up
into triangles.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.760
How many triangles can
you fit in it?

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.000
Let's see.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.060
One, two.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.670
Each of these triangles, their
angles, they add up to 180.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.970
So if you want to know that,
that, that, plus that, that,

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.560
that, plus that,
that, and that.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.490
That would just be 180 times
3, which is 540.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.080
And that also would be the angle
measures of the polygon.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.440
Because these three angles
add up to that angle.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.150
That's that.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.940
Those angles add
up to that one.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.300
Those angles add up to that one,
and those angles add up

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.960
to that one.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.670
So now hopefully, if I gave you
a 20 sided polygon, you

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.030
can figure out how many times
can I fit triangles into it.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.670
And you'll know how many
angles there are.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.910
And the sum of all of them.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.980
But anyway, back to
the quadrilateral.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.610
A quadrilateral, the sum
of the angles are

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.530
going to be 360 degrees.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.540
So, if we say, measure of angle
A, plus measure of angle

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.530
C, plus these two angles.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.130
Let me write it down.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.940
Plus 95 plus 32 is going
to be equal to 360.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.620
So I'll just write A plus C,
just a quick notation.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.060
Let's see, 95 plus 32 is 127.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.020
Plus 127 is equal to 360.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.062
A plus C is equal to
360 minus 127.

00:03:05.062 --> 00:03:06.070
And what is that?

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.680
That is 233.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.190
Right, and that's the choice.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.520
Fair enough.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.370
Question 27.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.330
If ABCD is a parallelogram,
that's the sides are parallel,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.810
what is the length
of segment BD?

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.960
So they want from
here to here.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.730
And this is just another
interesting thing, I'm not

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.320
going to prove it right now,
but this is a good thing to

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.350
know, especially if you
become a mathlete.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.010
Because it shows up in
math competitions

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.340
every now and then.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.020
If you have a parallelogram,
the opposite sides are

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.070
parallel, then their diagonals
are actually

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.640
bisecting each other.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.950
Which means that they split
the other diagonal in two.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.160
So this diagonal splits
this diagonal in two.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.180
So if this is 6, this is
also going to be 6.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.570
And this diagonal splits
BD in two.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.010
So if this is 5, then
this is also 5.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.390
So BE is 5, ED is 5, then
BD has to be 10.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.640
Choice A.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:15.950
Let me copy and paste
28 in here.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.110
A right circular cone
has radius 5 inches

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.089
and height 8 inches.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.620
Fair enough, they've
drawn it for us.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.160
What is the lateral
area of the cone?

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.370
Good, they gave us
a definition.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.720
Lateral area of a cone is equal
to pi times r times l,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.730
where l is the slant height.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.500
So we know what r is, they
give us r. r is 5.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.780
So we just have to figure
out what the slant

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.330
height is, this l.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.430
Well this looks like a
Pythagorean theorem problem.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.280
This is a right angle, I know
it's all weird because it's

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.040
three dimensions.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.170
But this forms a
right triangle.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.360
We're just kind of picking one
slice of the cone that

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.630
includes the pointy part.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:09.500
We say 5 squared, plus 8 squared
is equal to l squared.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.960
This is a right angle,
l is the hypotenuse.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.610
So we get 25 plus 64 is
equal to l squared.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:26.820
So that's 89 is equal
to l squared.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.760
And so, l is equal to the
square root of 89.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.140
Unless, I've made a
mistake someplace.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.160
Square root of 89.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.170
Oh good, I see a square root
of 89 there already.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.130
So we probably are on
the right track.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.430
So l is equal to the
square root of 89.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.650
And they give us the formula
for the lateral area of a

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.530
cone as pi r l.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:53.120
So pi r l is equal to pi times
r, the radius of the base,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.760
which is 5.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:01.255
Times this slant height, which
is the square root of 89.

00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:04.730
This equals 5 pi times the
square root of 89.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.690
Which is, I just peeked
and saw, choice D.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.510
Whenever you see a number like
89, you begin to get worried.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.070
But it's good that that was
one of the choices.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.150
Problem 29.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.285
OK.

00:06:19.285 --> 00:06:20.870
Let me copy and paste it.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.710
Clear this image.

00:06:28.885 --> 00:06:30.760
It's early on a Saturday
morning, my

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.310
wife is still sleeping.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.370
We're expecting our first
child in a month.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.560
So I figure the sleep
is good for her.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.140
Gives me more time to
record math videos.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.480
OK, I don't know why I go
onto those tangents.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.140
OK, figure ABCD is a kite.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.440
And it looks like a kite.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.350
What is the area of figure ABCD
in square centimeters.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.540
Well everything they're giving
us is in centimeters.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.030
So if we just stay
in centimeters we

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.590
won't have a problem.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.520
So what's the area of this?

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.730
So we just figure out the area
of each of these triangles.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.170
And what's the area
of a triangle?

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.860
The area of a triangle
is equal to

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.540
1/2 base times height.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.880
So what's the area
of this triangle?

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.380
Well, actually, this
is symmetric.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.310
If we know the area of this
triangle, we know the area of

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:20.970
this triangle.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.550
Because this is 6 and
8, this is 6 and 8.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.570
So the area of this one
is 6 times 8 is 48.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:32.450
48 times 1/2 is 24.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.950
This one is also going to be
24 by the same argument.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.580
So when you add them together,
you get 48.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.150
Those two combined are
going to be 48.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.330
Now, this triangle, 8
times 15 times 1/2.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.120
That's 4 times 15, which
is equal to 60.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.120
And this is going
to have the same

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.960
area by the same argument.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.460
60.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.410
We don't even have to multiply
by 1/2, because we're going to

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.070
multiply by 2 eventually.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.090
Or add it to each other again.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.840
So anyway, we have 60 plus 60
plus 24 plus 24, that's 120

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.470
plus 48, so 168.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.660
Choice C.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.030
Next problem.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.750
Problem 31.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.500
I like these problems. Now that
we're out of the whole

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.490
part that they were
getting into

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.606
congruencies and similars.

00:08:20.606 --> 00:08:21.830
And I thought they
made a couple of

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.920
mistakes on some of those.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.210
Anyway, if a cylindrical barrel
measures 22 inches in

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:32.390
diameter, how many inches will
it roll in 8 revolutions along

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.320
a smooth surface?

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.679
So we could imagine a wheel.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.740
It's a tire of some kind.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.309
So let me draw a circle.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:43.440
So if we look at the cylindrical
barrel from the

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.440
side, because I think that's
all we care about.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.390
That's its side.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.190
They say, a cylindrical
barrel measures

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.700
22 inches in diameter.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.090
So this distance right here.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:02.260
That distance right
there is 22.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.450
And what they say is, this
thing is going to roll 8

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:06.670
revolutions on a
smooth surface.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.980
It's going to go
around 8 times.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.220
It's going to roll and
move to the right.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.090
So how long will it roll?

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.070
So if you think about it,
it's going to cover its

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:18.080
circumference 8 times.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.460
If this point is starting
touching the ground, after it

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.610
moves a circumference of
distance, that point will be

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.040
touching the ground again.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.590
An easy way to think about it
is, as this thing moves to the

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:35.240
right, as it rolls, when it
moves 1 foot, 1 foot along of

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.880
circumference will then be
touching the ground.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.770
Or 1 cm, or 2 inches
or whatever.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.080
Then 2 inches along its
circumference will be touching

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.470
the ground.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.860
So it's going to go 8
circumferences in 8

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.070
revolutions.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.370
So what's the circumference
of this?

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.700
Circumference is equal to
pi times the diameter.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.410
The diameter they already
gave us is 22.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.360
So the circumference
is equal to 22 pi.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.630
So it's going to move 8
circumferences in 8

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.830
revolutions.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:12.970
So 22 pi times 8 is 176 pi.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.570
And that's choice C.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.450
