00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.030
the speed of light is basically

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.449
is fast as you ever get

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.789
What is it in American units, something like one hundred and eighty six 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:17.699
thousand miles a second

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.459
but on our account we can slow them down to 38 miles per hour- that's what 

00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:23.509
we did in our first experiment

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.329
and then we actually slowed them down all
the way to to one mile an hour and

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:28.580
then you can actually

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.039
you can basically crawl faster than light

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.059
what we do is we a bunch of atoms, and we use what I call sodium atoms, exactly what 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.930
you have in table salt

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.820
and then we cross-manipulate these atoms in very special ways with

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.780
laserbeams and then we can cool these atoms down to a few billionths of a degree above absolute

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.230
So, of course, that's really cold.
It's actually the coldest place in the universe.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.080
And then once we create a cloud 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.660
of such really cold atoms we illuminate that cloud with one laser beam  

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.690
and then we send a light pulse

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.610
into the cloud from the other side and we can now slow that light pulse down to the 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.440
speed of a bicycle and it sort of chuffs along. 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.570
And then, if we feel like it, we can actually completely stop that light pulse inside our atom

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.689
cloud

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.090
and then leave it there for a while, park it there, and then when we feel like it,

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.280
 cloud send the light pulse back on its way, revive it, regenerate it, and out it comes.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.750
what we are seeing here       

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.330
is actually the atom pool, really, because as I mentioned, we create these really cold atoms

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.120
and we need laser beams to do that.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.230
And eventually these laser beams are really running around,  

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.079
criss cross on the optics table.  

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.550
And then they converge on the vacuum chamber where all the action is happening.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.670
And then up here, behind, we have a very special atom source-  

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.040
 that's where the sodium

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.620
atoms are coming from. And they are hot to start- 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.190
we actually have to heat them to create a gas of sodium atoms... And at the time when we    
0:02:00.190,0:02:02.299
started to go after cold atoms

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.299
I did not have a clue that some years later I would start to look at slow light forces. And that's really

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.680
an example of,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.789
if you get your hands on an exciting new
system,

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.010
you start to poke it

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.739
and see what comes out

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.779
And what you hope is that something totally unexpected, totally exciting 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:22.510
will come out and and i think that's
what happened in this case.
