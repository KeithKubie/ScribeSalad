00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:04.509
The crapper.

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:05.509
John.

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:06.509
Dunny.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.509
Latrine.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:08.509
Loo.

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:09.509
Porcelain throne.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:10.509
Potty.

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.549
There are more than one hundred words for
toilet, but did you know that more people

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:19.420
have cellphones than a place to go poo?

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.580
Hey there science fans!

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.090
Dr. Kiki from This Week in Science here for
DNews.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.119
A study in the Public Library of Science journal
PLoS One this week investigated the sanitation

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.439
habits of Lasius niger, otherwise called black
garden ants.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.249
On observing colonies of the ants in the laboratory,
the researchers noticed what looked like dark

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:38.829
patches in the corners.

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.760
To see whether the patches were indoor lavatories,
they fed the ants colored food.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.399
The result is hard to deny… the ants dedicate
special areas within their homes for defecation.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.030
But, why would ants use a toilet when the
whole world could be their bathroom?

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.850
Humans and other animals tend to separate
the places where they eat and socialize from

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.309
the places where they defecate.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.530
The reason for this is thought to be mainly
for sanitation.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.910
Excrement, feces, what you might call poop,
has the potential to harbor pathogenic bacteria

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.350
and parasites.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.190
Human feces is known to contain E. coli, which
causes disease.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.670
Highly populated areas with poor or no sanitation
often suffer from devastating water-borne

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.930
diseases because people live too close to
waterways, and excrement gets into the drinking

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.930
water supply.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.210
So, good health and survival depend on the
drive to not poop where you eat.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.650
Social insects, like ants, have been observed
in many studies removing waste materials from

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.650
their nests.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.280
And, like humans, it’s thought to keep things
clean, and provide for the health of the colony.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.720
Honey bees take their defecation outside,
and like to poop as they fly.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.400
Bee larvae don’t actually poop until they
take their first flight, letting the waste

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.470
build up inside of them until they become
adult bees and are old enough to venture outside

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.470
alone.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.690
Adult cockroaches collect poop from their
nests and dump it outside.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.740
But, there are wood-boring beetles who just
fill old, unused tunnels with their bodily

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.740
refuse.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.430
In this study the ants continued to remove
other solid waste to the outside, adding strength

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.709
to the conclusion that these patches were
actually toilets.

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.069
However, the ants did not seem to avoid the
toilet area, so the researchers wondered whether

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.629
the indoor toilets might serve some additional
beneficial purpose, like providing healthful

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.700
bacteria to young ants.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.080
Leaf-cutter ants fertilize their gardens with
their poop.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.719
Termites use their fecal matter to build their
homes.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:41.709
And, some ants use poo to not only mark their
territories, but also identify themselves

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.790
as part of the group by wiping it on walls
and themselves.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.700
Then there are insects like the dung beetle
who need the poop from herbivorous and omnivorous

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.249
animals to survive.

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:57.150
They are attracted to and collect the poop
from large creatures for use as food and a

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.819
place to raise their young.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.939
Although, at least one species lays its eggs
on the mother’s own poop.

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:09.859
If you are wondering after all this talk about
poop, whether insects like ants pee, the answer

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:14.129
is that they do a little of both every time
they defecate.

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:19.870
What we think of as pee, is our body’s way
to get rid of excess water, salts, and urea,

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.999
which is liquid nitrogen waste.

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:25.939
Insects don’t have a lot of excess water
remaining from their metabolic functions to

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:31.719
excrete, and tend to produce an insoluble
solid called uric acid that gets mixed into

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:37.370
the digestive waste via the Malphigian tubules
and pooped out the anus as a substance called

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.370
frass.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.629
It’s not really known whether by not making
liquid pee insects are conserving water, or

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.389
if turning it into a solid helps with weight
regulation since a water containing bladder

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.959
would be big and heavy to carry around.

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.099
And, if you want to know about the weirdest
not pee out there, woodlice, which are not

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.560
insects but crustaceans, get rid of excess
nitrogen in a puff of ammonia gas through

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.939
their exoskeleton.

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:19.750
Anything else you wanna know about insect
bathroom habits?
