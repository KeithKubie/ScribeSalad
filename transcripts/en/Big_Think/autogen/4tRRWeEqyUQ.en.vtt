years old my question is how did you

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520
years old my question is how did you

come up with the idea for the light sail

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649
come up with the idea for the light sail
 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.240

I love you that's a great question so

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250
I love you that's a great question so

when you look at it it looks very much

which is a big problem you know and

which is a big problem you know and
 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.580
which is a big problem you know and
anything is how much it costs that is a

anything is how much it costs that is a
 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.380

great question show I hope you follow

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390
great question show I hope you follow

I talk and in the next few weeks after

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180
I talk and in the next few weeks after

I talk and in the next few weeks after
we spread out from other

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
we spread out from other
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.040
we spread out from other
spacecraft other spacecraft we will

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050

deploy our sails extend our shiny sails

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780
deploy our sails extend our shiny sails
 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.270
deploy our sails extend our shiny sails
and see if it works by the way if the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280
and see if it works by the way if the
 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.350
and see if it works by the way if the
sails were black the light would hit it

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360
sails were black the light would hit it
 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.850
sails were black the light would hit it
and give it a push but because they're

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860
and give it a push but because they're
 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.390
and give it a push but because they're
shiny the light hits it and bounces off

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400
shiny the light hits it and bounces off
 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.150
shiny the light hits it and bounces off
and that's mathematically exactly twice

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160
and that's mathematically exactly twice
 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.250
and that's mathematically exactly twice
the push so Shia that's math and I want

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260
the push so Shia that's math and I want
 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.330
the push so Shia that's math and I want
you to get good at it

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340
you to get good at it
 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.599
you to get good at it
thanks for the question
