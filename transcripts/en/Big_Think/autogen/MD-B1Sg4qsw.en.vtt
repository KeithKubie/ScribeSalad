it's clear that in terms of optimistic

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029
it's clear that in terms of optimistic
 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.390
it's clear that in terms of optimistic
positivity is predictor of mortality it

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400
positivity is predictor of mortality it
 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.730
positivity is predictor of mortality it
does predict mortality and predicts

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740
does predict mortality and predicts
 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.789
does predict mortality and predicts
mortality when you control for lots of

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799
mortality when you control for lots of
 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.439
mortality when you control for lots of
different self-reported health problems

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449
different self-reported health problems

depression scales that have been

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580
depression scales that have been
 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.120
depression scales that have been
validated self-reported health if you're

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130
validated self-reported health if you're
 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.910
validated self-reported health if you're
interested in predicting things from

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
interested in predicting things from
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.960
interested in predicting things from
optimism often optimistic positivity you

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970
optimism often optimistic positivity you
 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.759
optimism often optimistic positivity you
want to look at what predicts it and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769
want to look at what predicts it and
 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.770
want to look at what predicts it and
that's what I was focusing on that first

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
that's what I was focusing on that first
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.690
that's what I was focusing on that first
paper so we have three papers already

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700
paper so we have three papers already
 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.880
paper so we have three papers already
started basically we're looking at

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890
started basically we're looking at
 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.670
started basically we're looking at
explicit measures of optimism as well as

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680
explicit measures of optimism as well as
 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.270
explicit measures of optimism as well as
these we're using wording effects to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
these we're using wording effects to
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.889
these we're using wording effects to
measure what we're calling an implicit

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899
measure what we're calling an implicit
 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.639
measure what we're calling an implicit
measures of close to perceptual optimism

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649
measures of close to perceptual optimism
 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.430
measures of close to perceptual optimism
and pessimism that positive wording bias

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440
and pessimism that positive wording bias
 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.610
and pessimism that positive wording bias
is a form of optimism but if you're

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
is a form of optimism but if you're
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.959
is a form of optimism but if you're
looking at the world in more positive

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969
looking at the world in more positive
 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.599
looking at the world in more positive
ways you're taking information in and

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609
ways you're taking information in and
 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.729
ways you're taking information in and
you're framing it in positive ways and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739
you're framing it in positive ways and
 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.230
you're framing it in positive ways and
you're seeing it so you're reacting to

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240
you're seeing it so you're reacting to
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.700
you're seeing it so you're reacting to
it in positive ways sometimes in a way

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710
it in positive ways sometimes in a way
 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.990
it in positive ways sometimes in a way
that you you don't even know that you're

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000
that you you don't even know that you're
 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.880
that you you don't even know that you're
doing right so subtle it's like a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890
doing right so subtle it's like a
 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.140
doing right so subtle it's like a
wording effect that you couldn't say to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150
wording effect that you couldn't say to
 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.940
wording effect that you couldn't say to
you you know it's not like I'm asking

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950
you you know it's not like I'm asking
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.160
you you know it's not like I'm asking
you are you responding this way to these

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
you are you responding this way to these
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.359
you are you responding this way to these
words of that those ways in that words

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369
words of that those ways in that words
 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.280
words of that those ways in that words
we can detect it statistically over

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290
we can detect it statistically over
 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.190
we can detect it statistically over
people so we're asking people to say

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
people so we're asking people to say
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.380
people so we're asking people to say
things about themselves on a survey for

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390
things about themselves on a survey for
 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.719
things about themselves on a survey for
example you're asking them you know are

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729
example you're asking them you know are
 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.620
example you're asking them you know are
you a good person

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
you a good person
 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.190
you a good person
are you a competent person there's a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
are you a competent person there's a
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.359
are you a competent person there's a
whole series of questions you can ask

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369
whole series of questions you can ask
 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.520
whole series of questions you can ask
them some of them will abridge

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
them some of them will abridge
 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.899
them some of them will abridge
positively some of them are negatively

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909
positively some of them are negatively
 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.800
positively some of them are negatively
and usually those wording those survey

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810
and usually those wording those survey
 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.109
and usually those wording those survey
questions are used to to create scales

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
questions are used to to create scales
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.780
questions are used to to create scales
of things like self-esteem self-efficacy

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790
of things like self-esteem self-efficacy
 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.389
of things like self-esteem self-efficacy
mastery is a latent variable the idea is

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
mastery is a latent variable the idea is
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.499
mastery is a latent variable the idea is
that there's something out there it's

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509
that there's something out there it's
 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.980
that there's something out there it's
latent and it explains some variants in

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
latent and it explains some variants in
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.560
latent and it explains some variants in
how people answer these questions we're

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
how people answer these questions we're
 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.780
how people answer these questions we're
putting that together with some measures

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790
putting that together with some measures
 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.090
putting that together with some measures
that axpy as people thought how

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100
that axpy as people thought how
 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.389
that axpy as people thought how
optimistic they are using language

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399
optimistic they are using language
 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.889
optimistic they are using language
explicitly and saying that together

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899
explicitly and saying that together
 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.170
explicitly and saying that together
those things create this phenomena

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180
those things create this phenomena
 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.030
those things create this phenomena
and we're saying that the phenomenon

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040
and we're saying that the phenomenon
 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.740
and we're saying that the phenomenon
goes deep to the level of perception is

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
goes deep to the level of perception is
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.020
goes deep to the level of perception is
it itself a form of stratification if is

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030
it itself a form of stratification if is
 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.190
it itself a form of stratification if is
there something about optimism that's

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200
there something about optimism that's
 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.599
there something about optimism that's
that's a resource that we can't stand as

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609
that's a resource that we can't stand as
 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.640
that's a resource that we can't stand as
a psychological good like happiness

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650
a psychological good like happiness
 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.390
a psychological good like happiness
right and so if it's stratified in the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400
right and so if it's stratified in the
 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.160
right and so if it's stratified in the
population how is it associated with

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170
population how is it associated with
 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.349
population how is it associated with
other kinds of stratification income and

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359
other kinds of stratification income and
 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.140
other kinds of stratification income and
so forth education and so you know

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150
so forth education and so you know
 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.390
so forth education and so you know
you're saying well class the real

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400
you're saying well class the real
 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.160
you're saying well class the real
interesting one is class right everybody

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170
interesting one is class right everybody
 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.789
interesting one is class right everybody
wants to know you know pull yourself up

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799
wants to know you know pull yourself up
 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.440
wants to know you know pull yourself up
by your bootstraps you know think

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450
by your bootstraps you know think
 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.119
by your bootstraps you know think
positively you'll be successful if

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129
positively you'll be successful if
 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.530
positively you'll be successful if
you're optimistic you'll be successful

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540
you're optimistic you'll be successful
 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.490
you're optimistic you'll be successful
right but of course if you're successful

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500
right but of course if you're successful
 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.619
right but of course if you're successful
you going to be optimistic so there's

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629
you going to be optimistic so there's
 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.330
you going to be optimistic so there's
the reverse causality thing and so

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340
the reverse causality thing and so
 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.729
the reverse causality thing and so
partial taking a class and looking at

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739
partial taking a class and looking at
 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.619
partial taking a class and looking at
class is really really interesting part

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629
class is really really interesting part
 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.110
class is really really interesting part
of that I want to get to right and I

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120
of that I want to get to right and I
 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.160
of that I want to get to right and I
think that's an interesting question

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170
think that's an interesting question
 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.349
think that's an interesting question
because there's a lot of theory around

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359
because there's a lot of theory around
 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.089
because there's a lot of theory around
sociology and emotions around the idea

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099
sociology and emotions around the idea
 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.729
sociology and emotions around the idea
that expectations are created the

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739
that expectations are created the
 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.819
that expectations are created the
ability to meet expectations generates

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829
ability to meet expectations generates
 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.129
ability to meet expectations generates
energy that energy is what allows people

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139
energy that energy is what allows people
 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.580
energy that energy is what allows people
to do things is something that emotional

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590
to do things is something that emotional
 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.550
to do things is something that emotional
energy and then it replicates itself

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560
energy and then it replicates itself
 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.819
energy and then it replicates itself
so people are convinced to be optimistic

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829
so people are convinced to be optimistic
 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.390
so people are convinced to be optimistic
especially the middle classes and if

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400
especially the middle classes and if
 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.710
especially the middle classes and if
they're not able to achieve those

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720
they're not able to achieve those
 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.089
they're not able to achieve those
expectations then that entire energy

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099
expectations then that entire energy
 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.039
expectations then that entire energy
goes down and they become too satisfied

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049
goes down and they become too satisfied
 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.229
goes down and they become too satisfied
there's some difference with cohorts and

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239
there's some difference with cohorts and
 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.119
there's some difference with cohorts and
oh I see with race difference I see

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129
oh I see with race difference I see
 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.580
oh I see with race difference I see
cohort differences when you were born

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590
cohort differences when you were born
 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.789
cohort differences when you were born
and that makes sense in terms of things

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799
and that makes sense in terms of things
 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.890
and that makes sense in terms of things
like civil rights movements and what you

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900
like civil rights movements and what you
 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.039
like civil rights movements and what you
experienced in your life right and and

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049
experienced in your life right and and

you hopes and dreams and and so forth so
 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.280
you hopes and dreams and and so forth so
the question I'm looking at now first of

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290
the question I'm looking at now first of
 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.949
the question I'm looking at now first of
course is well you can't change you have

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959
course is well you can't change you have
 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.319
course is well you can't change you have
not many not much way that your optimism

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329
not many not much way that your optimism
 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.399
not many not much way that your optimism
your custom is going to change your

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409
your custom is going to change your
 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:15.869
your custom is going to change your
gender and a statistically significant

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879
gender and a statistically significant
 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.899
gender and a statistically significant
way you know might change people can

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:18.909
way you know might change people can
 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:20.520
way you know might change people can
change their gender but it's not gonna

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530
change their gender but it's not gonna
 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.810
change their gender but it's not gonna
change your age it's not gonna change a

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820
change your age it's not gonna change a
 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.629
change your age it's not gonna change a
birth cohort and you know race very

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639
birth cohort and you know race very
 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.490
birth cohort and you know race very
small effects so I'm looking at those

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500
small effects so I'm looking at those
 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.030
small effects so I'm looking at those
things

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040
things
 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.850
things
that influence think that can be

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860
that influence think that can be
 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.040
that influence think that can be
understood as causes of and they can't

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050
understood as causes of and they can't
 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.260
understood as causes of and they can't
be reverse causality first so that's

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270
be reverse causality first so that's
 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.510
be reverse causality first so that's
what I've been doing and we ran these

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520
what I've been doing and we ran these
 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.680
what I've been doing and we ran these
models and what do we see well we did we

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690
models and what do we see well we did we
 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.270
models and what do we see well we did we
saw that when you look at all these

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280
saw that when you look at all these
 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.730
saw that when you look at all these
things raised birth cohort age and

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740
things raised birth cohort age and
 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.610
things raised birth cohort age and
gender together that these curves and

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620
gender together that these curves and
 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.800
gender together that these curves and
the curves are interesting they start

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810
the curves are interesting they start
 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.210
the curves are interesting they start
off with men being more optimistic than

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220
off with men being more optimistic than
 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.880
off with men being more optimistic than
women there's a convergence in midlife

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890
women there's a convergence in midlife
 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.250
women there's a convergence in midlife
and then a divergence again momentum

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260
and then a divergence again momentum
 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.110
and then a divergence again momentum
more optimistic optimistic positivity

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120

right we see erase trends and and those

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520
right we see erase trends and and those
 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.120

pessimistic negativity across cohorts so
we can look at those things and say you

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700
we can look at those things and say you
 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.610
we can look at those things and say you
know people who got more schooling past

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620
know people who got more schooling past
 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.400
know people who got more schooling past
high school you know they were

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410
high school you know they were
 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.100
high school you know they were
optimistic when we first measured them

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110
optimistic when we first measured them
 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.840
optimistic when we first measured them
and and they were more likely to get

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850
and and they were more likely to get
 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.190
and and they were more likely to get
some schooling and we can try to control

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200
some schooling and we can try to control
 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.960
some schooling and we can try to control
for other things and say it's it's

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970
for other things and say it's it's
 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.550
for other things and say it's it's
really the optimism that's influencing

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560
really the optimism that's influencing
 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.680
really the optimism that's influencing
the schooling we could also try to say

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690
the schooling we could also try to say
 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.020
the schooling we could also try to say
you know they're their class background

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030
you know they're their class background
 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.260
you know they're their class background
is influencing their optimism investment

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270
is influencing their optimism investment
 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.500
is influencing their optimism investment
and I think that's we have a better

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510
and I think that's we have a better
 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.960
and I think that's we have a better
position to say something about that we

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970
position to say something about that we
 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.180
position to say something about that we
can look at over 25 years we don't have

now I'm a professor right so I was
 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:22.650
now I'm a professor right so I was
thinking about my career in the con and

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:22.660
thinking about my career in the con and
 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.820

in terms of this project and the

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:26.830
in terms of this project and the
 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.529
in terms of this project and the
opportunities I've had and I mean I am a

opportunities I've had and I mean I am a
 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:32.939
opportunities I've had and I mean I am a
pessimistic person but I took advantage

pessimistic person but I took advantage
 

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:35.270
pessimistic person but I took advantage
of the opportunities because I saw that

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280
of the opportunities because I saw that
 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.680
of the opportunities because I saw that
there were doors the way society is

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:37.690
there were doors the way society is
 

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.969
there were doors the way society is
structured is if there's doors and if

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:38.979
structured is if there's doors and if
 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:40.290

you can jump through them it doesn't

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:40.300
you can jump through them it doesn't
 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.990

my nose to the grindstone and not to
 

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.249

think too much about it because the

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:02.259
think too much about it because the
 

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:04.230
think too much about it because the
resources were there right I made the

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240
resources were there right I made the
 

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.839
resources were there right I made the
decision yeah I mean it but really the

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:06.849

decision yeah I mean it but really the
point I wanted to make was these

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560
point I wanted to make was these
 

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.379
point I wanted to make was these
policies these programs kids don't have

00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:10.389
policies these programs kids don't have
 

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:16.610
policies these programs kids don't have
them anymore like now I teach and and

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:16.620
them anymore like now I teach and and
 

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.170
them anymore like now I teach and and
the kids see that the middle is getting

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:19.180
the kids see that the middle is getting
 

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.249

mental health problems in university
 

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.180
mental health problems in university
have gone through the roof right and

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:29.190
have gone through the roof right and
 

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.870

universities don't know how to deal with
 

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.620
universities don't know how to deal with
it so and I can see why they have

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:34.630
it so and I can see why they have
 

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.810
it so and I can see why they have
because the opportunities aren't there

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:36.820
because the opportunities aren't there
 

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.100
because the opportunities aren't there
and the kids realized that there's a

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:38.110
and the kids realized that there's a
 

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.959
and the kids realized that there's a
bifurcation right does it make it or

00:08:39.959 --> 00:08:39.969
bifurcation right does it make it or
 

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:41.750
bifurcation right does it make it or
break it

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760
break it
 

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.420
break it

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:47.430
so I look at myself I look at my own
 

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.370
so I look at myself I look at my own
history and I say I was the end tail-end

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:50.380
history and I say I was the end tail-end
 

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.639
history and I say I was the end tail-end
of the baby boom and
