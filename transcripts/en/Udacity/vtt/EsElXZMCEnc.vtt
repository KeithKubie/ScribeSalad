00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This question uses the Banco di Sicilia in Syracuse, Italy.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now, this building has a height of 18 m.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When we measured the length of the shadow, we found that it is equal to 10 m.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now, I want to know, how high is the sun?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What I mean by that is if we look at the right triangle

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
formed by the edge of the building, the edge of the shadow,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and the imaginary line here, what is this angle?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm going to call this angle β, because we've been using α too much.

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Enter your answer here in degrees, and you can answer to 1 decimal place.
