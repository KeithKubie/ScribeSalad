today we're going to be talking about
 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.020
today we're going to be talking about
how to make Android apps beautiful and

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030
how to make Android apps beautiful and
 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.030
how to make Android apps beautiful and
we're going to start off by looking at

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040
we're going to start off by looking at
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.350
we're going to start off by looking at
an app that hasn't had much love this is

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
an app that hasn't had much love this is
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.180
an app that hasn't had much love this is
actually the first in a multi-part

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190
actually the first in a multi-part
 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.779
actually the first in a multi-part
series of devbytes and today's episode

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789
series of devbytes and today's episode
 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.710
series of devbytes and today's episode
is going to focus on modernizing just

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720
is going to focus on modernizing just
 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.929
is going to focus on modernizing just
very doing some very basic modernization

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939
very doing some very basic modernization
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.859
very doing some very basic modernization
techniques with your app so let's switch

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869
techniques with your app so let's switch
 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.370
techniques with your app so let's switch
to the phone and let's look at our our

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380
to the phone and let's look at our our
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.700
to the phone and let's look at our our
app now the first thing I want to

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710
app now the first thing I want to
 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.560
app now the first thing I want to
actually point out is the app icon the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
actually point out is the app icon the
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.750
actually point out is the app icon the
app icon is the identity of your app is

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760
app icon is the identity of your app is
 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.000
app icon is the identity of your app is
the identity of your app not only on the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010
the identity of your app not only on the
 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.430
the identity of your app not only on the
user's device but also on the Play Store

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440
user's device but also on the Play Store
 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.650
user's device but also on the Play Store
so making this this piece of identity

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660
so making this this piece of identity
 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.110
so making this this piece of identity
standout and look polished is really

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
standout and look polished is really
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.340
standout and look polished is really
important this app does not qualify of

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350
important this app does not qualify of
 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.830
important this app does not qualify of
having done a good job so we've now

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
having done a good job so we've now
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.180
having done a good job so we've now
launched the app and you'll see it's a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190
launched the app and you'll see it's a
 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.579
launched the app and you'll see it's a
very basic and a common pattern that we

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
very basic and a common pattern that we
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.330
very basic and a common pattern that we
normally see it's a ListView we have

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340
normally see it's a ListView we have
 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.800
normally see it's a ListView we have
some thumbnails on the left hand side

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810
some thumbnails on the left hand side
 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.630
some thumbnails on the left hand side
and some some text on the right and

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640
and some some text on the right and
 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.090
and some some text on the right and
straightaway we see that this app is

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
straightaway we see that this app is
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.520
straightaway we see that this app is
actually an old-style app it uses a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530
actually an old-style app it uses a
 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.429
actually an old-style app it uses a
title bar at the top it has a legacy

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439
title bar at the top it has a legacy
 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.429
title bar at the top it has a legacy
menu button at the bottom which

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439
menu button at the bottom which
 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.480
menu button at the bottom which
shouldn't be there on a device with

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
shouldn't be there on a device with
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.940
shouldn't be there on a device with
virtual navigation buttons the images

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950
virtual navigation buttons the images
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.819
virtual navigation buttons the images
are all inconsistently sized from from

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829
are all inconsistently sized from from
 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.670
are all inconsistently sized from from
each list item to list item and when we

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680
each list item to list item and when we
 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.069
each list item to list item and when we
go to the details we again we've got a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079
go to the details we again we've got a
 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.380
go to the details we again we've got a
bad title bar but all the text is is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
bad title bar but all the text is is
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.230
bad title bar but all the text is is
jutted up all the way to the edges so

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
jutted up all the way to the edges so
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.399
jutted up all the way to the edges so
let's look at what we do to fix this as

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409
let's look at what we do to fix this as
 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.789
let's look at what we do to fix this as
a first step what we're going to do

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
a first step what we're going to do
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.190
a first step what we're going to do
before we switch to code let's have a

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
before we switch to code let's have a
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.840
before we switch to code let's have a
look at what what the target is going to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
look at what what the target is going to
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.389
look at what what the target is going to
be this is our first stage that we're

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
be this is our first stage that we're
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.219
be this is our first stage that we're
going to get to which is an action bar

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
going to get to which is an action bar
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.789
going to get to which is an action bar
we've got action items we've we've got

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
we've got action items we've we've got
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.520
we've got action items we've we've got
an overflow menu as well and we're doing

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530
an overflow menu as well and we're doing
 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.550
an overflow menu as well and we're doing
some notifications so getting back to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
some notifications so getting back to
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.310
some notifications so getting back to
that let's now look at what we started

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
that let's now look at what we started
 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.040
that let's now look at what we started
with let's look at some code and what we

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
with let's look at some code and what we
 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.400
with let's look at some code and what we
have here is actually the manifest file

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
have here is actually the manifest file
 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.580
have here is actually the manifest file
we've got a minimum SDK version set to

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590
we've got a minimum SDK version set to
 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.530
we've got a minimum SDK version set to
ten which is great we're targeting all

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540
ten which is great we're targeting all
 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.100
ten which is great we're targeting all
users from Gingerbread and up but our

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110
users from Gingerbread and up but our
 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.440
users from Gingerbread and up but our
target SDK version is also set to API

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450
target SDK version is also set to API
 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.840
target SDK version is also set to API
level 10 this should always be set to

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850
level 10 this should always be set to
 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.330
level 10 this should always be set to
the most recent version of the the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340
the most recent version of the the
 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.680
the most recent version of the the
Android SDK which in this case is API 17

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690
Android SDK which in this case is API 17
 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.720
Android SDK which in this case is API 17
so the first change we'll make is to

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730
so the first change we'll make is to
 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.960
so the first change we'll make is to
make that 17 this will automatically get

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970
make that 17 this will automatically get
 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.210
make that 17 this will automatically get
rid of the menu button on devices that

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220
rid of the menu button on devices that
 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.780
rid of the menu button on devices that
have virtual navigation buttons the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790
have virtual navigation buttons the
 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.980
have virtual navigation buttons the
other thing we want to do is actually

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990
other thing we want to do is actually
 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.990
other thing we want to do is actually
change the style we're using the fiend

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000
change the style we're using the fiend
 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.720
change the style we're using the fiend
Lite style so what we're going to do

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
Lite style so what we're going to do
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.990
Lite style so what we're going to do
instead is use our own style that is

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000
instead is use our own style that is
 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.300
instead is use our own style that is
also backwards compatible so our

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310
also backwards compatible so our
 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.950
also backwards compatible so our
manifest file is actually going to

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960
manifest file is actually going to
 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.890
manifest file is actually going to
change into something like this where

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900
change into something like this where
 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.200
change into something like this where
we've got API 17 here and we've got our

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210
we've got API 17 here and we've got our
 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.210
we've got API 17 here and we've got our
an app theme the way we're going to

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220
an app theme the way we're going to
 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.130
an app theme the way we're going to
define this app theme is by having a

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140
define this app theme is by having a
 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.260
define this app theme is by having a
Styles dot XML in our values directory

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270
Styles dot XML in our values directory
 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.820
Styles dot XML in our values directory
which just extends themed Lite this is

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830
which just extends themed Lite this is
 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.430
which just extends themed Lite this is
our base theme what we're then going to

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440
our base theme what we're then going to
 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.440
our base theme what we're then going to
do is we're going to have a Styles or

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450
do is we're going to have a Styles or
 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.490
do is we're going to have a Styles or
XML for v11 API 11 to 13 we'll get a

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500
XML for v11 API 11 to 13 we'll get a
 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.180
XML for v11 API 11 to 13 we'll get a
theme holo light and API 14 and upwards

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190
theme holo light and API 14 and upwards
 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.010
theme holo light and API 14 and upwards
we'll get the holo light with a dark

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020
we'll get the holo light with a dark
 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.340
we'll get the holo light with a dark
action bar so once we've done this we're

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350
action bar so once we've done this we're
 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.800
action bar so once we've done this we're
going to get a nice styled action bar

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810
going to get a nice styled action bar
 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.260
going to get a nice styled action bar
there I'm going to get rid of the menu

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270
there I'm going to get rid of the menu
 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.750
there I'm going to get rid of the menu
button but what we might also want to do

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760
button but what we might also want to do
 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.300
button but what we might also want to do
is brand our action bar to be more

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310
is brand our action bar to be more
 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.220
is brand our action bar to be more
consistent with the stylings of our

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230
consistent with the stylings of our
 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.020
consistent with the stylings of our
organization or service that we provide

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030
organization or service that we provide
 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.150
organization or service that we provide
switching to the slides now what we

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160
switching to the slides now what we
 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.420
switching to the slides now what we
actually want to do is take our action

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430
actually want to do is take our action
 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.800
actually want to do is take our action
by the way it is now and make it orange

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810
by the way it is now and make it orange
 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.720
by the way it is now and make it orange
basically and change the icon as well

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730
basically and change the icon as well
 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.090
basically and change the icon as well
again to be consistent without with our

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100
again to be consistent without with our
 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.280
again to be consistent without with our
brand the way we're actually going to do

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290
brand the way we're actually going to do
