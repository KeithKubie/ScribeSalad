00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.360
In the last video we saw
that if a function takes

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:14.160
on a minimum or maximum value,
min max value for our function

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.170
at x equals a, then a
is a critical point.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.220
But then we saw that
the other way around

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.420
isn't necessarily true. x equal
a being a critical point does

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.340
not necessarily mean
that the function takes

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.379
on a minimum or maximum
value at that point.

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.170
So what we're going to
try to do this video

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.030
is try to come up
with some criteria,

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.210
especially involving the
derivative of the function

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.050
around x equals a,
to figure out if it

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.650
is a minimum or a maximum point.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.450
So let's look at what we
saw in the last video.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.080
We saw that this
point right over here

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.710
is where the function
takes on a maximum value.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.250
So this critical point in
particular was x naught.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.030
What made it a critical point
was that the derivative is 0.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.290
You have a critical point where
either the derivative is 0

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.490
or the derivative is undefined.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.110
So this is a critical point.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.890
And let's explore
what the derivative is

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.959
doing as we approach that point.

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:13.750
So in order for this
to be a maximum point,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.112
the function is increasing
as we approach it.

00:01:17.112 --> 00:01:18.820
The function is
increasing is another way

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.680
of saying that the
slope is positive.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.830
The slope is changing
but it stays positive

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.440
the whole time which means that
the function is increasing.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.231
And the slope being
positive is another way

00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:31.940
of saying that the
derivative is greater than 0

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.660
as we approach that point.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.380
Now what happens as
we pass that point?

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.250
Right at that point
the slope is 0.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.750
But then as we past
that point, what

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.190
has to happen in order for
that to be a maximum point?

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.260
Well the value of the
function has to go down.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.051
If the value of the
function is going down,

00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:46.980
that means the
slope is negative.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.530
And that's so
another way of saying

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.730
that the derivative is negative.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.750
So that seems like a
pretty good criteria

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.610
for identifying whether
a critical point is

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.060
a maximum point.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.950
So let's say that we
have critical point a.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.120
We are at a maximum
point if f prime

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:29.460
of x switches signs from
positive to negative as we

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.780
cross x equals a.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.440
That's exactly what
happened right over here.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.150
Let's make sure it happened at
our other maximum point right

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.350
over here.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.690
So right over here, as
we approach that point

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.630
the function is increasing.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.030
The function increasing means
that the slope is positive.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.330
It's a different positive slope.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.829
The slope is changing,
it's actually

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.640
getting more, and
more, and more steep.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.280
Or more, and more,
and more positive.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.700
But is definitely positive.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.850
So it's positive
going into that point.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.590
And then it becomes negative
after we cross that point.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.670
The slope was undefined
right at the point.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.320
But it did switch signs
from positive to negative

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.700
as we crossed that
critical point.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.480
So these both meet our criteria
for being a maximum point.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.700
So, so far our criteria
seems pretty good.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.840
Now let's make sure that somehow
this point right over here,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.650
which we identified in the
last video as a critical point,

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.670
let's make-- and I think we
called this x0, this was x1,

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.170
this was x2.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.882
So this is x3.

00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:38.590
Let's make sure that
this doesn't somehow

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.310
meet the criteria
because we see visually

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.270
that this is not
a maximum point.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.290
So as we approach this,
our slope is negative.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.550
And then as we cross it,
our slope is still negative,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.610
we're still decreasing.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.580
So we haven't switched signs.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.960
So this does not meet our
criteria, which is good.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.700
Now let's come up with the
criteria for a minimum point.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.520
And I think you could see
where this is likely to go.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.129
Well we identified in the last
video that this right over here

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.920
is a minimum point.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.790
We can see that.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.390
It's a local minimum
just by looking at it.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.770
And what's the slope of
doing as we approach it?

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.070
So the function is
decreasing, the slope

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.060
is negative as we approach it.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.734
f prime of x is less than 0
as we approach that point.

00:04:22.734 --> 00:04:24.150
And then right
after we cross it--

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.750
this wouldn't be a minimum
point if the function

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.540
were to keep decreasing somehow.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.430
The function needs
to increase now.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.020
So let me do that same green.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.460
So right after
that, the function

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.190
starts increasing again.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.550
f prime of x is greater than 0.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.630
So this seems like pretty good
criteria for a minimum point.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:54.190
f prime of x switches signs
from negative to positive as we

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.890
cross a.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.940
If we have some
critical point a,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.020
the function takes
on a minimum value

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.520
at a if the derivative of
our function switches signs

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.320
from negative to
positive as we cross

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.300
a, from negative to positive.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.200
Now once again, this
point right over here,

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.110
this critical point x sub 3
does not meet that criteria.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.080
We go from negative
to 0 right at that

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.990
point then go to negative again.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.000
So this is not a minimum
or a maximum point.
