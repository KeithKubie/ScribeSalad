00:27:33.139 --> 00:27:33.149
graduate school wasn't terribly abrupt
 

00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:35.779
graduate school wasn't terribly abrupt

do our work I will say it was a

00:28:21.019 --> 00:28:21.029
do our work I will say it was a
 

00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:24.789
do our work I will say it was a
transition though from it was a it was a

00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799
transition though from it was a it was a
 

00:28:24.799 --> 00:28:27.200
transition though from it was a it was a
significant transition to move from the

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:27.210
significant transition to move from the
 

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.240
significant transition to move from the
lab I remember the day I sort of shut

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:29.250
lab I remember the day I sort of shut
 

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:33.139
lab I remember the day I sort of shut
down my lab and you know they they said

00:28:33.139 --> 00:28:33.149
down my lab and you know they they said
 

00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:34.820
down my lab and you know they they said
I could go back which means I couldn't

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:34.830
I could go back which means I couldn't
 

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:38.389
I could go back which means I couldn't
go back and I knew it was sort of a

00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399
go back and I knew it was sort of a
 

00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:40.580
go back and I knew it was sort of a
point of no return but in those early

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:40.590
point of no return but in those early
 

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:43.610
point of no return but in those early
days of being sort of leading groups in

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:43.620
days of being sort of leading groups in
 

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.310
days of being sort of leading groups in
our bully research labs my first several

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320
our bully research labs my first several
 

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.440
our bully research labs my first several
management jobs I sort of live

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:48.450
management jobs I sort of live
 

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.570
management jobs I sort of live
vicariously through the scientists I

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:50.580
vicariously through the scientists I
 

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.340
vicariously through the scientists I
found I enjoyed it because I could go on

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:52.350
found I enjoyed it because I could go on
 

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.659
found I enjoyed it because I could go on
their labs they tell me what they're

00:28:53.659 --> 00:28:53.669
their labs they tell me what they're
 

00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:56.840
their labs they tell me what they're
doing and so I understood it are you

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:56.850
doing and so I understood it are you
 

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.519
doing and so I understood it are you
know to a point today they think I

00:28:58.519 --> 00:28:58.529
know to a point today they think I
 

00:28:58.529 --> 00:28:59.779
know to a point today they think I
understand a lot more than I

00:28:59.779 --> 00:28:59.789
understand a lot more than I
 

00:28:59.789 --> 00:29:04.129
understand a lot more than I
okay but I I found that it was fun to be

00:29:04.129 --> 00:29:04.139
okay but I I found that it was fun to be
 

00:29:04.139 --> 00:29:05.899
okay but I I found that it was fun to be
in a position where you could help the

00:29:05.899 --> 00:29:05.909
in a position where you could help the
 

00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:08.599
in a position where you could help the
scientists get what they get done what

00:29:08.599 --> 00:29:08.609
scientists get what they get done what
 

00:29:08.609 --> 00:29:11.029
scientists get what they get done what
they wanted to get done so it that that

00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039
they wanted to get done so it that that
 

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:13.039
they wanted to get done so it that that
that really ease that that that

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:13.049
that really ease that that that
 

00:29:13.049 --> 00:29:15.769
that really ease that that that
transition and you know we have many

00:29:15.769 --> 00:29:15.779
transition and you know we have many
 

00:29:15.779 --> 00:29:17.359
transition and you know we have many
many people in management within our

00:29:17.359 --> 00:29:17.369
many people in management within our
 

00:29:17.369 --> 00:29:20.509
many people in management within our
company who started out as a scientist

00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:20.519
company who started out as a scientist

as I did not not everyone chooses that

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320
as I did not not everyone chooses that
 

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.409
as I did not not everyone chooses that
path and we don't force everyone on that

00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:24.419
path and we don't force everyone on that
 

00:29:24.419 --> 00:29:28.159
path and we don't force everyone on that
on that path but there there there ways

00:29:28.159 --> 00:29:28.169
on that path but there there there ways
 

00:29:28.169 --> 00:29:29.690
on that path but there there there ways
that I think we've learned to sort of

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:29.700
that I think we've learned to sort of
 

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.909
that I think we've learned to sort of
better help and manage that that

00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919
better help and manage that that
 

00:29:31.919 --> 00:29:35.180
better help and manage that that

questions that people often ask about
why is drug development so hard so

00:29:42.499 --> 00:29:42.509
why is drug development so hard so
 

00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:44.419
why is drug development so hard so
expensive what does it take so long I

00:29:44.419 --> 00:29:44.429
expensive what does it take so long I
 

00:29:44.429 --> 00:29:46.219
expensive what does it take so long I
mean some of it is just it just does

right i mean there's a there's it but
 

00:29:48.059 --> 00:29:49.580
right i mean there's a there's it but
there is another sort of debate that

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:49.590
there is another sort of debate that
 

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:52.070
there is another sort of debate that
I've heard and I wondered if if you

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080
I've heard and I wondered if if you
 

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.729
I've heard and I wondered if if you
could speak to this about how

00:29:55.729 --> 00:29:55.739
could speak to this about how
 

00:29:55.739 --> 00:29:58.669
could speak to this about how
disciplined is the rd versus how much

00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679
disciplined is the rd versus how much
 

00:29:58.679 --> 00:30:01.129
disciplined is the rd versus how much
creativity and you have a lot of very

00:30:01.129 --> 00:30:01.139
creativity and you have a lot of very
 

00:30:01.139 --> 00:30:04.099
creativity and you have a lot of very
smart people who probably wouldn't be

00:30:04.099 --> 00:30:04.109
smart people who probably wouldn't be
 

00:30:04.109 --> 00:30:05.719
smart people who probably wouldn't be
that happy if every morning they shut up

00:30:05.719 --> 00:30:05.729
that happy if every morning they shut up
 

00:30:05.729 --> 00:30:08.359
that happy if every morning they shut up
and we're told exactly what to do right

00:30:08.359 --> 00:30:08.369
and we're told exactly what to do right
 

00:30:08.369 --> 00:30:11.389
and we're told exactly what to do right
that we'd have a rebellion part of what

00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399
that we'd have a rebellion part of what
 

00:30:11.399 --> 00:30:12.769
that we'd have a rebellion part of what
makes them excited to go is that they

00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:12.779
makes them excited to go is that they
 

00:30:12.779 --> 00:30:14.149
makes them excited to go is that they
have a bunch of their own ideas and they

00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159
have a bunch of their own ideas and they
 

00:30:14.159 --> 00:30:15.889
have a bunch of their own ideas and they
get to play with those ideas and you

00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:15.899
get to play with those ideas and you
 

00:30:15.899 --> 00:30:17.960
get to play with those ideas and you
want to foster that yeah but you also

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:17.970
want to foster that yeah but you also
 

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:19.909
want to foster that yeah but you also
want to foster a certain amount of

00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919
want to foster a certain amount of
 

00:30:19.919 --> 00:30:22.009
want to foster a certain amount of
discipline in y'all focus yeah and that

00:30:22.009 --> 00:30:22.019
discipline in y'all focus yeah and that
 

00:30:22.019 --> 00:30:24.229
discipline in y'all focus yeah and that
seems to me to be a tension and people

00:30:24.229 --> 00:30:24.239
seems to me to be a tension and people
 

00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:27.169
seems to me to be a tension and people
have wondered aloud whether if the

00:30:27.169 --> 00:30:27.179
have wondered aloud whether if the
 

00:30:27.179 --> 00:30:29.149
have wondered aloud whether if the
industry shifted on that in one

00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159
industry shifted on that in one
 

00:30:29.159 --> 00:30:30.409
industry shifted on that in one
direction or another whether it would be

00:30:30.409 --> 00:30:30.419
direction or another whether it would be
 

00:30:30.419 --> 00:30:32.930
direction or another whether it would be
more effective or less effective I

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:32.940
more effective or less effective I
 

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:34.729
more effective or less effective I
wonder if you could talk about that I I

00:30:34.729 --> 00:30:34.739
wonder if you could talk about that I I
 

00:30:34.739 --> 00:30:36.739
wonder if you could talk about that I I
think we have a pretty open environment

00:30:36.739 --> 00:30:36.749
think we have a pretty open environment
 

00:30:36.749 --> 00:30:39.229
think we have a pretty open environment
I mean I think that we really leave it

00:30:39.229 --> 00:30:39.239
I mean I think that we really leave it
 

00:30:39.239 --> 00:30:42.139
I mean I think that we really leave it

define the scope of what we're we're
working on and we've recently sort of

working on and we've recently sort of
 

00:31:41.309 --> 00:31:43.789
working on and we've recently sort of
realigned parts of our research and

with that and then you can say well

00:31:46.999 --> 00:31:47.009
with that and then you can say well
 

00:31:47.009 --> 00:31:49.070

involved in in managing that we really

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:11.340
involved in in managing that we really
 

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.149
involved in in managing that we really
do have to enable our scientists to have

do have to enable our scientists to have
that maintain that balance with the

little bit sometimes off the track and

little bit sometimes off the track and
and and yet we have as a corporation

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:23.100
and and yet we have as a corporation
 

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.070
and and yet we have as a corporation
have to have a certain discipline to

have to have a certain discipline to

have to have a certain discipline to

00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039
of the day recently I've been more Adam
 

00:32:35.039 --> 00:32:38.720
of the day recently I've been more Adam
and I guess is the word about sort of

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:38.730
and I guess is the word about sort of
 

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:40.879
and I guess is the word about sort of
making sure that we're competitive

00:32:40.879 --> 00:32:40.889
making sure that we're competitive
 

00:32:40.889 --> 00:32:43.220
making sure that we're competitive
within these spaces how do I say this

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:43.230
within these spaces how do I say this
 

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:46.070
within these spaces how do I say this
ten or twenty years ago I don't think

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080

there was as much at stake in being

category and sometimes you know you

00:32:54.169 --> 00:32:54.179
category and sometimes you know you
 

00:32:54.179 --> 00:32:55.850
category and sometimes you know you
could be years behind the leader and

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:55.860
could be years behind the leader and
 

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.799
could be years behind the leader and
still come up with a product that had

00:32:57.799 --> 00:32:57.809
still come up with a product that had
 

00:32:57.809 --> 00:32:59.840
still come up with a product that had
its own value and you get reimbursed for

00:32:59.840 --> 00:32:59.850
its own value and you get reimbursed for
 

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:02.560
its own value and you get reimbursed for
that and all that I'm trying to

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:02.570
that and all that I'm trying to
 

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:05.509
that and all that I'm trying to
encourage our scientists at all levels

00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519
encourage our scientists at all levels
 

00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:08.419
encourage our scientists at all levels
to stay much more abreast of what the

00:33:08.419 --> 00:33:08.429
to stay much more abreast of what the
 

00:33:08.429 --> 00:33:11.090

competition it's science anywhere in a
 

00:33:13.649 --> 00:33:15.830
competition it's science anywhere in a
particular category to make sure that if

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840
particular category to make sure that if
 

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.090
particular category to make sure that if
we're going to invest there we have a

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.100
we're going to invest there we have a
 

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.700
we're going to invest there we have a
reasonable chance of being competitive

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:19.710
reasonable chance of being competitive
 

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:23.720
reasonable chance of being competitive
with with others I think that's in terms

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:23.730
with with others I think that's in terms
 

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:26.029
with with others I think that's in terms
of getting a drug to market and being

00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039
of getting a drug to market and being
 

00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:27.110
of getting a drug to market and being
safe first second

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120
safe first second
 

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.090

you're correct we essentially ran into a

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:42.900
you're correct we essentially ran into a
 

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.630
you're correct we essentially ran into a
brick wall in the in the area of

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640
brick wall in the in the area of

we moved our research over to

we moved our research over to
 

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:50.780
we moved our research over to
neuroscience and other areas but we we

still maintain that that that effort and

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:53.190
still maintain that that that effort and
 

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:54.710
still maintain that that that effort and
I think if you look at sanofi you look

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720
I think if you look at sanofi you look
 

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.810
I think if you look at sanofi you look
at Pfizer you look at a lot of the other

more and more attention as being as

more and more attention as being as
 

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.040
more and more attention as being as
being paid to this I think the question

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:04.050
being paid to this I think the question
 

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:06.320
being paid to this I think the question
becomes how do you sustain that how do

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:06.330

you incentivize it you know how do you
essentially reward the risk takers for

essentially reward the risk takers for
 

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.350
essentially reward the risk takers for
