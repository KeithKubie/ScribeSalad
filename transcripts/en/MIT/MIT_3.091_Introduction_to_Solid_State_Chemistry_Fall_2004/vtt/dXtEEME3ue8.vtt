00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.880
The weekend is over.
It's time to get back to business.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.760
So, a couple of announcements:
tomorrow we'll have quiz four based

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.640
on homework four.
I'll be available from 2:15-3:15

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.520
under normal office hours.
If you can't get it to see me at

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.410
that time, then just send a note and
we'll arrange to meet at some other

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.290
time. And actually Lori has made a
sign-up sheet,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.170
sort of five-minute blocks so that
if you do want to come by to look at

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.050
re-grades, you don't have to hang
around waiting for a

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.070
long period of time.
And, if you can't get them during

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.210
that time, there's no expiry.
You can get the grade change at

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.350
some later date.
And, we'll make sure we fix things

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.490
up. So, last day we were talking
about covalent bonding,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.640
looking at linear combinations of
atomic orbitals into molecular

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.780
orbitals. And,
we saw that there's two types of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.920
molecular orbitals involving s and
p-block elements that

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.650
are germane to us.
We are not going to go into d-block

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.950
in any detail here.
At the level of 3.091,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.250
I think that s and p-block teaches
you the rudiments.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.550
And to go beyond that really
requires some intensive quantum

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.850
mechanics. So,
we're going to stay with s and

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.150
p-block. And we saw that if we had
two atomic s-orbitals,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.450
when they blended to form the
molecular orbital,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.750
it took on this sort of the
ellipsoidal shape.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.050
We called that a sigma orbital.
And, the characteristic of the

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.350
sigma orbital is that you have
continuous electron density from one

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:13.033
nucleus to the other.
We said no holidays; constant

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
electronic density.
We could then combine an s orbital

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and a p orbital,
as for example in the case of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
hydrogen fluoride.
In the case of s plus p,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
will end up with an orbital that
looks something like this.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And, it is also termed a sigma
orbital because,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
again, if you look from one nucleus
to the other, there is continuous

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
electron density, no holidays.
This sigma orbital is a little bit

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
in shape from that sigma orbital,
but they're both sigmas. And then,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
we saw what could happen with p
orbitals. There's two options here.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The first is shown when the two p
orbitals meet axially,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
on end. When they meet axially on
end, these two lobes smear to give

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
us the lobes shown in this cartoon:
again, continuous electron density

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
from one nucleus to the other.
That fits the definition of the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:53.070
sigma orbital.
And then, something only the p's can

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.210
do: when they smear laterally,
these lobes smear to give a

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.350
molecular lobe.
These lobes smear to give you a

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.490
molecular lobe.
These two lobes collectively

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.640
comprise one molecular orbital.
And, the characteristic here is,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.780
in contrast to zero holidays, here
you have zero density.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.920
We have a nodal plane normal to the
board. There is no

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.730
electron density.
You can go clear line of sight from

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.210
one nucleus to the other with zero
electron density.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.690
And this is called a pi orbital.
And, then we went on. We looked at

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.170
a couple of things like nitrogen,
oxygen, and fluorine. But in the

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.650
case of nitrogen and oxygen we saw
that in order to get the triple and

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.120
double bond, we needed a mix.
We needed a mix of sigma orbital

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.600
and pi orbital.
And, that's the template.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.080
If you're going to make a single
bond, you may be able to get away

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.560
with a sigma. If you're going to
make a multiple bond,

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.040
the double bond or a triple bond,
you're going to have to have a next

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.520
of sigma and pi.
And I think that's the way we ended

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:16.640
the lecture last day,
looking at energy level diagrams.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:04:04.880
And let's see what else we have.
Yeah, so we saw this. Here's the

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.770
end on end. This is a sigma orbital
coming from two p atomic orbitals,

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.660
and remember the convention: the z
axis is conventionally the axis

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.550
along which the two atoms bond?
And then, this is the lateral

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.070
smearing to give us the pi orbital.
And I think I showed you that if you

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.220
cut this, it looks this way.
We went into this, and this,

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.380
and we just had a great time. So
now what I want to do is I want to

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.530
show that you can extend this
business of multiple bonds to

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.690
hybridized systems.
Now, I know Professor Ballinger

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.840
last week talked about methane.
And the way to rationalize methane

00:04:44.840 --> 00:05:04.880
was to mix s and p atomic orbitals
to make a hybridized orbital.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:56.750
And a hybridized orbital that was
constructed was the sp3 hybrid.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:13.333
So, in order to get the CH4, CH4
was explained in terms of the sp3

00:04:44.500 --> 00:05:12.250
hybrid orbital.
As you recall, carbon in its

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:29.033
valence shell has six electrons in
total, but four valence electrons.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:25.090
And, the four valence electrons are
depicted two in the s orbital,

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.180
and two in the p orbitals. And
clearly that configuration doesn't

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.270
have the capacity to form four bonds.
Somehow we've got to generate four

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.360
unpaired electrons.
And, the sp3 was shown to take one

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.450
of the s orbitals.
This is not a 1s. Let's say it's

00:05:45.450 --> 00:06:05.033
one s orbital, and three p orbitals.
Hence we get the term sp3.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And, these are equivalent.
And so, now, by the Hund rule,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I've got four unpaired electrons
ready to bond.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And since there's four of them,
and they are equivalent in energy,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
we disposed them equivalently in
space. So, if I want to take a

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
central point and put four struts
off that central point symmetrically

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
disposed in space,
this will form the struts that go

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
from the center to the vertices of a
tetrahedron. And this gives us the

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:22.210
109ยก bond angle.
And there's a whole host of

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.640
compounds that are explained by this
binding configuration.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.070
But now, let's look at another one.
But now let's look at another one.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.490
How about this molecule: C2H4?
It's known as ethylene, precursor

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.920
to polyethylene.
And, let's first of all start with

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.350
the Lewis structure,
two carbons here, and we've got

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.780
hydrogens. So,
remember, I'm looking for octet

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.610
around the carbon.
So: one, two, three,

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.830
four, for electrons around the left
carbon. Let's bring in an electron

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.050
from hydrogen.
That way, the hydrogen is

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.270
isoelectronic with helium.
We'll bring an electron from the

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.490
other hydrogen.
So, this is isoelectronic with

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.720
helium. And now,
carbon has two, four,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.940
six, and if it could pick up two
electrons from the right carbon,

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.160
it's in business. And, the
right-handed carbon mimics the

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.380
left-handed carbon.
So, hydrogen each donates an

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.860
electron. And now, let's check.
The left carbon has two,

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.590
four, six, eight. So, its octet's
stable. The right carbon: two,

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.330
four, six, eight, its octet's stable.
And, the way to explain this is

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.060
there is some kind of a double bond
here. So, let's draw the double

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.790
bond. And for now we'll put the
hydrogens. Later on,

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.530
we'll get to the point where when we
see carbon, the strut will assume

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.260
that the default setting is if I
don't write anything at the end of

00:07:44.260 --> 00:08:04.120
the strut, assume that it means that
there is hydrogen.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:52.280
And, here's something to always look
for: when you see a carbon,

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.570
check to see there is four struts
off the carbon.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.850
Start looking. There's probably
something missing.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:05.140
So now, how are we going to explain
this? We've got a double bond.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.420
We already know: double bond,
there's a tip off there.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.710
That means we need a Sigma and a pi.
But with four struts 109ยก apart,

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:34.153
there's no way you can form a double
bond. So, this isn't going to work.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:21.880
The sp3 hybridization will not work.
But maybe there's something else we

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.770
can do if we want to make a double
bond. If we want to make a double

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.660
bond, what we could do,
perhaps, is to start with that same

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.550
box structure.
And, what's the gambit here?

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:37.440
What I want to do is I want to save
an un-hybridized p orbital because

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.330
the p orbital is your friend because
only with the p orbital do you have

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.220
the capacity to smear laterally.
And, if you don't have the capacity

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.110
to smear laterally,
you can't make a pi bond.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:09:09.220
So, let's do something here,
but not burn all the p orbitals.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:56.680
So, how about doing this: instead of
making four, what if we made three

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.360
and save one of the p's?
So, this is p. It's un-hybridized,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.050
and these are hybridized. So, I'm
going to take one of an s,

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.730
the only s I've got, and I'm only
going to take two of the p's.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.420
So, I'll call this sp2 hybridized.
So, I've got sp2 and p. Now, let's

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.100
go through the geometric rules.
If I have three struts

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.780
symmetrically disposed,
because these are equivalent

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.470
energies, if they are symmetrically
disposed in space,

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.150
they are going to describe,
first they're going to lie in a

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.110
plane.
And they're going to be 120ยก apart

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:34.330
lying in a plane.
That's what this tells me.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.550
But I've got a fourth one out here.
Where's the fourth one going to be?

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:42.770
It can be normal to the plane.
So, I've got three sp2's lying in a

00:09:42.770 --> 00:10:01.206
plane, and I've got an
un-hybridized p --

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:52.750
-- out of the plane.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:56.250
Hey, this is starting to look good
because what I could do is start

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.750
bringing these together,
and maybe make something work.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.250
So, here's another sketch of what
this looks like.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:06.750
You can see the three sp2 orbitals
lying in a plane,

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.250
and then above and below this rather
bloated dumbbell shape,

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:13.750
p orbital. And, there's the top
view, all right?

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.250
Now, here's two of them opposing
one another. They are

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.210
opposing one another.
So, if these are the carbons,

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:25.640
I could take these two sp2 orbitals,
blend them, and I could make a sigma

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.070
orbital. And,
now what? I've still got these

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:34.490
unhybridized p orbitals.
I can bring those in, and they'll

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.920
smear top and bottom.
And now I've got a pi orbital of

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.350
sigma, and a pi gives me my double
bond. So, by hybridizing sp2,

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.780
I can give rise to the setting that
will allow the formation

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:52.570
of the double bond.
So, there it is.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:57.710
There is the sigma is in the center
here, sp2 plus sp2,

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:02.850
and then the pi's give me the double
bond. And, remember,

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:07.990
the two lobes together constitute a
single pi bond.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:13.140
So, that's great.
So we're just going to bring these

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:18.280
two in. So, we'll take sp2 plus sp2
axially, axially will give a sigma

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.420
bond. And then p plus p laterally
will give the pi bond,

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:43.740
and together this is the double bond.
And then, the other sp2's are

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.500
hanging off the end,
and they each pick up a hydrogen.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.500
So, I can draw this molecule
instead of this format that I've

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.500
drawn here. I could really draw it
in the following manner.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.500
Here's carbon-carbon, and then show
these as sort of,

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.500
I'm trying to give the idea that
this is 120ยก angle.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.500
And, I'm going to leave the
hydrogens off because you're a

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.500
sophisticated audience.
I've told you once; I don't have to

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:52.460
tell you again.
So, there it is.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:57.380
There's ethylene.
And, just for grins and chuckles,

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:02.300
you might want to see how to do one
more form of hybridization.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:07.220
If you want to do a really good job
of welding, you need a very,

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:12.150
very energy intensive fuel; use
acetylene. Acetylene is C2H2.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:17.070
It's known as acetylene. And,
if you go through the Lewis

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:36.406
structure, you will conclude that
you've got a triple bond there.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:26.660
And, we already saw last day,
the triple bond in nitrogen was

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:31.330
almost 1 megajoule per mole.
So, there's a lot of energy in here.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.990
So, you've got your acetylene torch
and your oxygen feed,

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:40.660
I said you need four struts.
So what's that? There's a hydrogen,

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:45.330
hydrogen, and a triple bond in the
center. How are you going to make a

00:12:45.330 --> 00:13:04.193
triple bond? Well,
let's leave two unmixed p orbitals.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:54.280
So instead of having one just up and
down, I could have one up and down,

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.570
and one in and out of the board.
And, I can form a double bond.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.850
And, what's left over, you can go
through and rationalize that this

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:07.140
would require sp hybridization,
sp plus unmixed p orbitals. This p

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.420
smears with its neighbor to give a
pi, this p smears with its neighbor

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.710
to give a pi, and this smears
axially to give a sigma.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:34.153
So, one sigma plus two pi's -
triple bond.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:23.700
That's the whole story.
Cool. So, what are we learning

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.390
here? There is a paradigm here,
and that is that covalent bonds, a

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.090
couple of characteristics that I
want you to note.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.790
First of all, they are saturated.
Remember that I said that ionic

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:38.490
bonds are unsaturated.
And you said, OK, well,

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.190
don't tell me what they aren't,
tell me what they are. Well, what

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.890
they aren't is in contrast to what
these are. So,

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:49.590
now I can finish the story.
What does it mean that they are

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.290
saturated? Once you put an electron
from the hydrogen and an electron

00:13:53.290 --> 00:14:13.646
from the carbon into the orbital,
that's the end of the story.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:14:00.280
We've taken care of business here.
There is no revisiting the

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.570
situation, unlike in the case of the
ionic compounds where the positive

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.850
attracts the negative,
but it has the capacity to track yet

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.140
another negative,
yet another negative,

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.420
and the feed is felt attenuating of
course, but it is palpable out to

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.710
infinity. So,
we say that the ionic bonds are

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:36.420
unsaturated. The covalent
bonds are saturated.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:24.400
Once you've got two electrons in the
orbital, move on.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.800
The second thing is,
what you're seeing here is that they

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:47.733
are directional.
That is to say, in the case of sp3

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.600
they are 109ยก apart off the central
carbon, that's the only hook on

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.000
which you can hang another atom.
So, if you make methane, if you

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:46.400
make carbon tetrachloride,
if you make freon, they are all

00:14:46.400 --> 00:15:06.800
going to be the same shape molecule:
tetrahedral, because the struts come

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.800
off the central carbon.
Look at this. Anything that gives

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:58.390
me sp2 hybridization is going to be
what? What's the shape of that

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:01.990
molecule? It lies in a plane.
It's planar. That's what it means

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.590
to lie in a plane,
doesn't it? And, look at the shape.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:09.190
There are always 120ยก apart. So,
this means that there is a

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.790
relationship between the
directionality of the bond and the

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:16.390
shape of the molecule.
And, why are the bonds directional

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:36.180
in the first place?
Because of electronic structure.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:23.520
This is the theme of 3.
91. It's going to be echoed over

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.050
and over again.
The electronic structure dictates

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.580
everything. It's just dominoes
after this, once you understand

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:34.110
electronic structure.
We did all of this for one reason,

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:37.640
to achieve octet stability. If I
peel away the board,

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.170
and I look in behind here,
there's two words: octet stability.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.700
That's the only thing that's going
on here. This system will do

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.230
anything to achieve octet stability.
It's savage; it just does

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.760
anything.
All right, so now what I want to do

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.290
is I want to make the proposal that
the electronic structure will

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:58.820
dictate the shape of all molecules.
So, let's put up a grand system.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.350
And, that's what I want to do.
I want to put that up and work

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.880
through it. Oh,
here's some more cartoons.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.410
This is taken from another book.
So, you see the pi bond here. And

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.930
here's the sigma bond from the two
sp2's. And that the remaining sp2's,

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.460
and this is supposed to indicate
that this is coming out at you.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:37.186
But this does not give me the sense
of 120ยก. This is crummy art.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:24.880
But really, this is really crummy.
I'm taking that down. It's

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.770
horrible. Now,
this is what I've put up.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:34.660
This is the rules for determining
molecular shape.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.550
And, in our text,
it's known as electron domain theory.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:44.440
If your classmates down the hall in
5.111 and 5.112,

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:49.330
instead of electron domain,
it's the same idea. But, they use a

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:54.220
different term.
Instead of electron domain theory,

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:59.110
they call it VSEPR, which is called
vesper so that they can pronounce it,

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:18.286
vesper which stands for Valence
Shell Electron Pair Repulsion.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:17:07.270
And, all of this will become clear
in the next 15 minutes.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.540
It'll start all making sense.
So, here's a set of rules. I

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.810
generated these.
This isn't in the book.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.080
And, all of this will be posted by
mid afternoon.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:20.360
So, you can take it down if you
want, or you can just take it off

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:25.080
the web in a little bit.
All right, so I want to go through

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:31.240
and illustrate how this is used.
And, so what I want to do is I want

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:37.410
to use this in order to deduce,
to infer, the molecular architecture

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:43.580
of three molecules.
So, let's start with this series,

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:49.740
SF6, BrF5, and IF4 minus. So, these
are three molecules.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:55.910
I would say, OK, tell me what the
shapes of these molecules,

00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:01.090
what will it be?
So, let's start with SF6.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:05.290
SF6 is interesting. We're going to
have some of that in the class later

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:09.490
on. I'm going to teach diffusion.
SF6 is a very large molecule, very

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:13.690
heavy. It's molecular weight is
about 150 grams per mole.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:17.890
Its density is five times that of
air. But, its main claim to fame is

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.700
that it's chemically rather inert.
And so, it's used extensively in the

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.110
metal casting industry.
If you look under the hood of the

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:28.520
car, you see aluminum castings,
magnesium castings for things like

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.930
water pump housing and so on,
those castings were made under the

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:35.350
protection of a blanket of sulfur
hexafluoride because as we already

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.760
know, aluminum and magnesium are
really good metals.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.170
And they will react violently with
oxygen in the air.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.580
So, when you're pouring molten
aluminum, you've got to keep the

00:18:45.580 --> 00:19:05.360
oxygen in the air away from
it. And they use SF6.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:52.860
You could say,
well, we could use a liquid flux,

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.730
but what if some of the liquid flux
gets entrained in the casting?

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:00.590
And the casting becomes weak, the
wheel cracks, there is a collision,

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:04.460
maybe people lose their lives,
people are sued; so it's better to

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.330
use a gas phase shield.
OK, but the bad news is that the SF

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:12.190
bond, which you can calculate the
energy for, right now using the

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:16.060
Pauling formula,
it sits smack dab in the middle of,

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.820
just off visible.
And so, this is a fantastic infrared

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.460
absorber. And this stuff goes up
into the upper atmosphere,

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.110
and has greenhouse gas coefficient
that is phenomenal.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:30.760
And so, the industry is under
pressure to get rid of this.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.400
So, if somebody it here wants to do
something good for the environment

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.050
and allow us to continue to make
castings of aluminum,

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:41.700
magnesium, and reduce the mass of
the vehicles, but do so in a way

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:45.350
that doesn't damage the upper
atmosphere, this is the trade-off.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:20:05.900
Somebody in this room is liable to
be sitting in policy someday.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:52.300
And, what's a simple solution?
If I tell you that the greenhouse

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.600
gas coefficient of SF6 is 12,
00 times that of CO2, what would you

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.910
do? Say, well,
let's just ban it.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.210
All right, well that's dumb.
OK, that's really dumb because now

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.520
we don't have aluminum and magnesium
castings. And so,

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.820
now the mass of the automobiles go
up. So, what was an MIT person

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:12.120
doing? An MIT person would say,
well, let's figure out, what's the

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.430
tailpipe emission trade-off to
cleaning the atmosphere by not

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.730
allowing SF6 to go into the
atmosphere? See,

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:22.040
you've got to know some chemistry.
Otherwise you just make dumb

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.340
decisions. All right,
that having been said, I wonder what

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:46.146
the structure of this molecule is.
OK, so first thing we do is Lewis

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
structure. Let's write the Lewis
structure. So,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
I'm going to put sulfur in here,
and sulfur's got six valence

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
electrons. It's got six valence
electrons, right?

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Sulfur is 2s2, 2p4.
And, so let's bring up a fluorine.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Fluorine's got seven valence
electrons. So,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
there is one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:57.150
So now, fluorine by sharing one
electron with sulfur becomes octet

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:01.300
stable. And, we can keep doing this.
I'm not going to put all of these

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:05.460
down. I'm just going to put a
single electron from each fluorine.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.610
You will know that there's more
like this. And here's another

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:13.760
fluorine. Here's another fluorine.
Here's another fluorine. And

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.920
here's another fluorine.
So, this is great. All the

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:22.330
fluorines are octet stable.
Now, let's see what's going on with

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:26.990
sulfur. It's got two,
four, six, eight, ten, 12: it's got

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:31.660
12 electrons. That's some octet
with 12, isn't it?

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:36.330
OK, well, let me tell you something.
With some of the very

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:40.990
electronegative elements that have
very, very high average valence

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:45.660
electron energies,
they can form. And the ones that

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:50.330
are in the dark blue are elements
that, on occasion,

00:21:50.330 --> 00:22:09.526
can form expanded octets.
These are called expanded octets.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:22:00.630
And, the expanded octet is an
attempt. If octet stability is good,

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:06.270
and I have a huge appetite for
electrons, I just might try to pull

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:11.900
in a few more.
So, what happens?

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:17.540
And, let's look at the energy level
diagram of that.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:23.180
If I've got, here's my 2s,
and here's my 2p, so this is one,

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:27.850
two, three, four, five, six.
There's my six valence electrons,

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:31.570
right? But, here, what do I have?
I need to be able to form six pairs

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:35.280
of bonds. So,
I need to hybridize.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.990
The best I can do is hybridize sp3.
That will give me four. I need to

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:42.710
get more. You know where I'm going
to go? I'm going to go to the

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:46.420
orbital store.
And, where's the orbital store?

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:50.140
It's over here: d. You say, well,
wait a minute, we've got to bring

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:54.300
down the d's, OK?
We'll bring down the d's,

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.920
and here's how we do it. There's
one, two, three,

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:03.530
if I grab two of these d's,
and I mix s's, p's, and these two

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:08.150
d's, that can give me this
configuration: sp3,

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:12.760
and I'm taking two of the d's,
sp3 2d, and then I've got three d's

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:17.380
left here unmixed.
So, now, Hund rule,

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:35.893
six electrons: one, two,
three, four, five, six.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:27.630
So, this is how one can hybridize in
order to allow for expanded octet,

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:33.270
right? And, also account for the
bonds that we are forming here.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:38.900
So, this is called electron domain
theory. Each one of these orbitals

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:44.540
here, each one of these orbitals
that has electron occupancy around

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:50.180
the center atom,
each one of these is termed an

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:54.920
electron domain.
And, there's two types of electron

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.780
domains, those that involve bonds,
and those that do not involve bonds.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:02.640
So, the six that I've circled are
bonding domains.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.490
So, these are all bonding domains.
And, for example, this one here,

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:10.350
which I'll put a square around its
off to the side.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:14.210
It's a nonbonding domain.
It doesn't get involved in bonding.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:18.070
But it's not even part of the
central atom. So, we'll

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:22.180
see that in a second.
All right, so I've got six electron

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:26.560
domains, and now I want to put up
the skeletal structure.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.930
So, if I have my central sulfur
here, how can I put six domains

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:35.300
symmetrically in space.
The way I do that is I make

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.680
essentially this triple cross that
constitutes the coordinate system,

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:44.050
x, y, and z. This gives me six
domains in symmetric disposition

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:48.430
around a central atom.
And, in this case, so,

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:52.810
six electron domains implies
octahedral skeleton.

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:57.300
Skeleton of what?
It's the skeleton of the molecule.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:01.920
It's where the electrons can reside.
And, why is this called octahedral?

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.530
You look at this, if you were to
link these up in the plane,

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:11.150
so you link up four in the plane and
then build a pyramid to the top,

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:15.760
can you see that the pyramid has
four faces to it?

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.380
So, four faces on the up,
four faces on the down; four plus

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:38.493
four is eight, so octahedral,
eight-faced.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:28.830
But, I look at that and I see the
six struts. And I do this cognitive

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:32.660
discordance. What I'm saying: it's
octahedral but I'm seeing six.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.490
You just get used to it. So, this
is octahedral.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:40.330
And clearly we can put the
fluorines at the ends of the struts.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:44.160
So, there's SF6. That's the shape
of the molecule.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:26:04.853
That's the shape of the molecule
because we have six bonding domains.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:52.570
All the domains are engaged in
bonding. So, they're all the same.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:57.140
There's no distinction between them.
We have an octahedral skeleton,

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:01.710
and in this case, we have an
octahedral molecule.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:06.280
Let's see, what else can we say
about it? Polar or nonpolar?

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.850
What do you think? As soon as you
see fluorine, it's just like in the

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:15.420
Manchurian Candidate.
When someone says fluorine,

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:34.573
you go, ah, electronegative, most
electronegative, right?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:25.070
So, bingo, this is really super
electronegative.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:30.150
So, we know this is a very polar
bond. But, as I showed you last day,

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:35.220
there is six symmetrically disposed
polar bonds. So,

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:40.300
it's a nonpolar molecule.
Terrific. All right, let's go on.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:45.380
This is fun. Let's do the next one.
Let's do bromine pentafluoride.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:50.460
OK, let's look at BrF5. So,
according to this,

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:55.070
let's go back to our rules here.
Write the Lewis structure.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:59.230
And that will give us electron
distribution. So,

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:03.380
here's bromine. And it's got one,
two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:07.530
And, each fluorine is going to come
up, same as last time.

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.690
Each fluorine will share one
electron with bromine.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:15.840
So, that will give fluorine its
octet. It's two,

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:35.080
four, six, eight, and then I'm going
to do the same.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
There is the fluorine,
one, two, three, another fluorine,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
another fluorine, another fluorine,
so, I've got one, two, three, four,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
five. And then,
I've got a pair of electrons that

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
are hanging around.
So, bromine has shared one each of

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
five of its electrons with the
fluorine. And then,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
there is a pair here that is
unshared.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
OK, so first of all,
let's count the number of electron

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
domains around the central bromine.
So, I've got one, two, three, four,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
five, six electron domains. But,
we're not panicking now,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
because we know that expanded octets
exist, and it's OK.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
All right, but there's a difference
here. There's a difference.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
So first of all, six electron
domains, so that means,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
again, octahedral skeleton.
So, the electrons and the bonds are

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
going to be in this kind of a
formation again with the

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:27.550
bromine at the center.
But, there's one little distinction

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:34.660
here. And, that is that they are
not all bonding domains.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:41.770
You see, this pair over here is not
involved in any bonding.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:48.880
So, I've got five bonding domains,
and one nonbonding domain. OK, so

00:28:48.880 --> 00:29:05.826
the five are in an oval,
and the one is in the rectangle here.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:59.460
All right, and sometimes if you look
in some old chemistry books,

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.930
nonbonding is one of these strange,
it's clear it's a late comer to the

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.390
language. Sometimes people call
these lone pairs.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:09.860
They're lone pairs.
Both electrons come from the

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.330
central atom. And,
they haven't gotten picked up for

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:16.790
any kind of duty.
So, they are alone.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:20.260
They are lone pairs.
All right, so now let's take a look

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.890
at the shape of the molecule.
The shape of the molecule,

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:27.680
it turns out that it doesn't really
matter. There is a symmetry here,

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.470
right? It doesn't matter if I have
the five fluorines in the plane and

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:35.260
above, or the five fluorines
underneath, and the lone pair up

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:39.050
here. Those are symmetric.
One's just upside-down from the

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:42.830
other. There's nothing
distinguishable.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:46.620
So, just to get this thing over
with, I'm going to put the fluorines

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:50.410
in the plane. OK,
so this is the xy plane.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:54.200
And then, the z direction is up
here, and then this is the

00:29:54.200 --> 00:30:13.000
nonbonding pair is off
to one side here.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
So, you don't see the electrons.
If you try to detect to the shape

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
of this molecule,
you simply see the atoms.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
So, you'll see bromine in the
center, and you'll see five

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
fluorines about it.
And, what's going to be the shape

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
of this thing?
Well, four of the fluorines lie in

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
a plane. And then,
the fifth fluorine lies above the

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
plane dead center over the bromine.
So, I can pitch a tent here.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
And, what am I going to have?
I'm going to have something that's

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
square based and a pyramid.
So, the molecule is square

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
pyramidal molecule.
The structure is still octahedral

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
for the electrons.
But the molecule: square pyramidal

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
molecule. What else can we say
about this? Oh,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
how about, is this polar or nonpolar?
It's polar. You can see there's

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
asymmetry here.
There's extra electrons down on the

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:51.130
bottom the way I've drawn it.
So that means that I could model is

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:55.390
as a dipole with the bottom part of
it negative and the top part of it

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:59.660
positive, net neutral,
or we could draw it this way.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:03.930
I think we were going to put an
arrow pointing in the direction of

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:08.190
the negative end of the dipole.
So, that's good. Wow, we are

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:12.460
clicking. There's a piece of paper
down here, it's got more information

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.730
on it. Let's get this one.
So, let's do one more. It's so

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:35.260
much fun. That's do IF4,
tetrafluoroiodate.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:25.830
It's a complex ion.
All right, so we're going to do the

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:30.660
same thing. We'll write the Lewis
structure, and iodine one,

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:35.490
two, three, four, five, six,
seven. OK, so here's fluorine one,

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:40.330
two, three, four, five, six, seven.
So, by sharing one electron with

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:45.160
iodine, fluorine becomes octet
stable. So, this one will do that

00:31:45.160 --> 00:32:03.253
as well. You know, I've
got enough room here.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
I think I'm going to go for the gold.
I'm going to put all the electrons

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
here. So, there's fluorine over
here. Here's fluorine.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
So, there's eight there.
And, let's put another fluorine up

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
here. I'm going to move this just a
little bit, raise this,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
put this off to the side,
IF4 minus, I'll put a fluorine here.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:24.110
So, there's the four fluorines.
And now, let's look at the

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:28.230
electrons around iodine.
I gave one, two, three, four,

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:32.350
five, six, seven. But, you see,
this thing's net negative. Where

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:36.460
did the net negative come from?
How does something become net

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:40.580
negative? It acquires an electron
through electron transfer.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.700
This is really cool, because this
is covalent bonding within something

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:48.820
that is engaged in electron transfer.
So, to make this thing,

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:52.940
this complex ion net negative means
that I had to throw one more

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.930
electron in here into the mix.
And, where is it going to go?

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.790
Where do electrons live? They live
in orbitals. And,

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:04.660
there is one orbital that's just
waiting for it right here.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:08.530
So, I'm going to put this in
electron in here.

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:12.390
So now, what do I have?
I've got one, two, three,

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:16.260
four bonding orbitals, four orbitals
where I have one electron from the

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:20.130
iodine, and one electron from the
fluorine. So let's write that down.

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:40.793
Four bonding domains, and I'm still
talking about the central iodine.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:29.190
Here's two of its electrons that had
no place to go.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:34.390
So that's one lone pair.
Here's the seventh electron,

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:39.590
no place to go. And then, the net
negative charge is an electron.

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:44.790
And, it's sitting in this. So,
there's two nonbonding domains, for

00:33:44.790 --> 00:34:02.980
a total of six.
So, this means six electron domains.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:54.400
So that means octahedral skeleton
again. Now, question.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:34:14.200
Where do I put the fluorines?
Well, you say, put them at the end

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:43.200
somewhere. So,
there's two possibilities now unlike

00:33:43.200 --> 00:34:07.600
the other case.
See, I've got this possibility.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:27.000
This is door number one. I put the
fluorines in the plane.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:16.400
OK, door number two is the same
electron structure.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.790
I'll put the fluorines above and
below, and then I'll put the

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:25.070
electron pairs next to one another.
These are distinguishable,

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:29.230
agreed? So, what's it tell you?
It says number three is maximized

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:33.380
separation between domains.
Number four: give more space to

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:37.530
nonbonding domains.
Let's think about the physics

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:41.690
behind that. Why?
Electrons that are in nonbonding

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:45.840
domains are sitting there with no
interaction with a nucleus,

00:34:45.840 --> 00:35:06.146
whereas the ones that are in bonding
domains, they are on this axis.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:53.330
See, I've got two electrons sitting
in here. But,

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.660
they are scrunched in,
in between nuclei, whereas these two

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.990
are just hanging out there,
just brandishing this negative

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:03.320
charge, you see?
And here's another negative charge.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.660
So, what is it going to try to do?
It's going to try to get as far

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.990
apart as possible.
So, that's why that rule is there.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:13.330
Number four: so which of these two
configurations keeps these farther

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:16.660
apart from one another,
door number one or door number two?

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:36.253
Number one. One's up here, and
one's up here.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:24.390
These two are too close together.
So, this is not what happens. And

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:28.790
in fact, this is the structure of
tetrafluoroiodate.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:33.190
So, what do we see?
All we see is the atoms,

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:37.590
the iodine, the four fluorines; they
lie in a plane.

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:41.990
And, what's the top view of this
thing? It's just a simple,

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:46.390
regular cross. So, you have
fluorines at four corners of a

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:50.790
square, iodine in the center.
This is called square planar.

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:54.800
This is a square planar molecule.
Polar or nonpolar?

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.400
It's nonpolar. This is cool.
Look, it's net negative, but it's

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:18.066
nonpolar. So,
that means that even though it has a

00:35:42.000 --> 00:36:05.600
net negative charge,
if I get really far away,

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:09.200
how do I model that thing?
How do I model it? When I get

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.800
really far away,
this is what it looks like: point

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.400
charge negative,
see, way out here.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:36.200
I don't care what the internal
structure looks like.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:24.280
I don't care about the electrons.
This is all symmetric anyways.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:28.570
It's very, very good.
All right, so let's look at one

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:32.850
more. This is too much fun.
All right, so what's the punch line

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:37.140
of this one here?
You see, we had three,

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:41.420
SF6, BrF5, IF4 minus. They all had
octahedral skeletons,

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:45.710
but the molecular architecture was
different because of the relative

00:36:45.710 --> 00:37:04.086
number of bonding and
nonbonding domains.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:54.520
But, they all started with
octahedral skeleton.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:59.050
Now I'm going to do something else.
Now, I'm going to compare this

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:03.570
series that have the same formula.
So, let's do three tetrafluorides:

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:08.100
CF4, SF4, and tetrafluoroiodate.
See, they all have, it's F4. And,

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:12.630
I'm going to show you three
different things.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:17.150
Well, what's this one?
You know this one in your head.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:21.680
This is tetrahedral, right, this
one here? Just write it by

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:26.200
inspection, boom,
boom, boom, boom, that's done.

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:30.730
Finished, polar, nonpolar, fluorine,
strongly electronegative,

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:51.193
but symmetric bonds, nonpolar.
And this one, we just did.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
So, if your memory is good,
you know that this one's square

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:23.000
planar.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:48.520
OK, now, so let's do SF4.
What's SF4 look like? What does it

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:54.050
look like? It looks something like
this. We start with the Lewis

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:59.580
structure. That's what it says up
there. So, sulfur: one,

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:05.110
two, three, four, five, six.
And fluorines: I'm going to put F,

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:10.640
F, and F. Actually, I know what's
coming. I'm going to put the F over

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:16.170
here. So, there is seven fluorine
electrons from fluorine,

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:21.700
and then one from the sulfur makes
eight. So, we have a bonding domain

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:27.230
here, octet stability,
and likewise, the same will happen

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:32.220
here, here, and here.
So, what do we have?

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:36.660
Two, four, six, eight,
and two of the electrons from the

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:41.110
sulfur are not involved in bonding.
So, they constitute a nonbonding

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:45.550
pair. So, I've got two,
four, six, eight, ten. I've got ten

00:38:45.550 --> 00:39:04.166
electrons, or let's say,
five electron domains.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:54.610
There's five electron domains here.
That's different. See, here,

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:59.220
there's four electron domains.
Here, there's six electron domains,

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:03.840
four ED, and they're all bonding,
and four bonding.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.460
Here is six ED, and four bonding.
And, this is five ED, five electron

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:13.070
domains, four bonding.
Gee, they're all tetrafluoride,

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:17.690
and I've just proved that if you
have four fluorines, you've

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:22.140
got four bonds.
This is really consistent.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:26.420
It's not terribly deep, but anyways,
OK, so here we are.

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:30.710
Here we are. No, it's important
that at the end of the day,

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:34.990
these things rationalize. OK,
so we've got four bonding, and one

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:39.280
nonbonding: one nonbonding.
So, if I have a central atom here,

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:43.570
how do I put five struts off it
equally spaced?

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:47.850
So, that's going to mean one,
two, three in the plane, one above,

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:52.330
and one below. That's five, OK?
So, this is called,

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:56.990
the five struts, trigonal bipyramid.
And, how do they get that? If you

00:39:56.990 --> 00:40:01.660
look at the plane,
you can join the three in the plane.

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:06.330
This is 120ยก, agreed, if I'm
looking down on this plane?

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:10.990
And now, what I can do is make a
pyramid here. But,

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:15.660
this is a pyramid that has three
faces. So, I've got,

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:20.330
this is called a trigonal pyramid.
This is a trigonal pyramid, but

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:39.793
this would have above and below.
So, it's a trigonal bipyramid.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
That's a fancy name for something
that's got five struts sticking out

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
of a simple atom,
OK, trigonal bipyramid.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
So, now, what are we going to do?
We're going to, now, put the

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
fluorines. So,
we've got two choices,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
again. We've got sulfur in the
center, one, two,

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
three, four, five.
So, here's one possibility is to

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
put the nonbonding electrons in the
plane with the other fluorines.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:41:04.180
This is called the equatorial
position. If you think of this as

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:08.360
the globe, there's North Pole,
South Pole, and these three lie at

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:12.540
the equator, so this is called the
equatorial position.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:16.720
This is equatorial. So,
that's one possibility. The other

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.900
possibility is to put the lone pair
either at the North Pole

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:25.230
or the South Pole.
And, if we use the same idea as

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:29.700
before, in other words,
we try to minimize the interaction

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:34.170
between the unpaired electrons,
excuse me, the nonbonding electrons,

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:38.640
and other atoms, which one is going
to give this less contact with its

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:43.110
neighbors, door number one or door
number two? See,

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:47.580
this one has actually your book even
shows a little cartoon for this.

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:52.050
See, if you put it at equatorial
position, it's got two nearest

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:56.520
fluorines, OK,
whereas if you put it at a polar

00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:14.840
location, it's got three
nearest fluorines.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000
So, if we use that,
this is called polar.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
By that analysis, door number one
should be minimal interaction.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000
And in fact that was one of the
things that we were told to do.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000
See, place nonbonding domains, this
is rule number five,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
nonbonding domains at equatorial
positions in a trigonal bipyramid.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:26.230
That's what you say if someone asks
you to say something into a

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:31.460
microphone. Just say that.
And, so, that means the molecule is

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:36.690
going to look like this.
And this molecule is called see-saw,

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:41.920
or teeter-totter because you don't
see the nonbonding pair here.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:47.150
Your characterization apparatus
would find fluorine,

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:52.380
sulfur, fluorine, and then these two
are underneath like

00:42:52.380 --> 00:43:10.160
a sawhorse at 120ยก.
And, is this polar or nonpolar?

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.000
This is polar because I've got
electrons over here.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.000
So, I can model this as a dipole,
or in this fashion. OK, so, this

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.000
has been really good.
What else do we have here?

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000
So, so far I've been doing this
with heteronuclear molecules.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:26.330
But, we can do this with homonuclear
molecules. So,

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:30.660
I want to show you two conditions.
Look at sp3, and we'll look at sp2.

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:34.990
All right, and I'm going to work
with carbon alone,

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:39.320
no hydrogen. So, sp3,
I start with a central carbon,

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:43.660
sp3 hybridized, and carbon goes
everywhere. So,

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:47.990
each carbon has four nearest
neighbors, and they're all at 109ยก,

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:52.330
and they all have the same strut
length, the same bond length,

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:56.660
one, two, three, four, and so on,
carbon here, carbon up here, and

00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:14.920
these are going in and
out of the board.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000
But, I think you can see that one
thing is certain.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:53.000
There will be regular arrays in
three dimensions,

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.000
regular arrays, regular 3D array.
And, if you look at this from a

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:05.000
distance, what you will find is this
is forming the diamond cubic

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:30.190
crystal structure.
In this instance,

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:34.590
carbon is hybridized sp3.
And, the consequence of that is

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:38.990
diamond cubic.
Now, if carbon,

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:43.390
instead, hybridizes as sp2,
we know that we have three bonds

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:47.790
identical lying in the plane.
So, let's do that one. So, here's

00:44:47.790 --> 00:45:07.446
carbon; carbon, carbon, carbon.
And then, this one has one,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
two, and three over to here.
OK, and what are we seeing here?

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
We are seeing a hexagonal pattern,
aren't we? This is just three of

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
the bonds. But I said,
look, remember, you've got to keep

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
me honest here.
Look at this carbon.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
How many sticks off of the carbon?
One, two, three. I told you, we'd

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
better have four.
And, I've only got three.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
So, what happened? Where's the
last stick?

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:23.660
Well, I've taken this configuration
over here, s and p,

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:27.330
and I've mixed them to get sp2.
That means there must be some p

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:30.990
orbital here somewhere.
And, where is it? Well,

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:34.660
it's sitting right here. There's a
p orbital here,

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:38.330
and there's a p orbital here.
And, there's a p orbital here,

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:41.990
and there's a p orbital here, and a
p orbital here,

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:45.660
and p orbital here,
and so on, and so on,

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.330
and so on. And, it turns out that
the bond length is such that these p

00:45:49.330 --> 00:46:08.526
orbitals are able to bond
cooperatively, OK?

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:57.900
And so, they form p bonds,
are cooperative. And, they're so

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:02.810
cooperative that the electrons are
not associated with any particular

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:07.720
bond. We say that the electrons are
delocalized. And,

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:12.630
we'll see a little bit more of that
later, but we might as well learn it

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:17.540
now. They are delocalized.
This is the structure of graphite.

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:21.900
This is the structure of graphite.
And, what do we have here?

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:25.700
We have strong covalent bonds in
the plane, and then we have these

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:29.490
weak, delocalized bonds normal to
the plane so that the planes can

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:33.290
slide over one another,
which is what gives graphite its

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:37.090
lubricity. That's why you squirt
graphite powder into a lock in the

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:40.890
wintertime to give it some
lubrication. So,

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:44.690
these glide over one another,
and furthermore, it's not only

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:48.490
lubricity. You get electronic
conduction. And,

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:52.290
graphite has a mildly decent
electronic conductivity,

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:56.090
unlike diamond where all of the
electrons are tightly bound,

00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:59.690
very tightly bound.
And by the way,

00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:03.070
these bonds are very,
very strong. The planes,

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:06.460
the bonds in the plane of graphite
are extremely strong.

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:09.840
But, plane to plane, they glide.
OK, so you can think of these

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.220
almost diamond-like rafts in terms
of the bond strength.

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:16.610
But, these are flat, and these are
three-dimensional.

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:37.686
The other thing that happens is,
we have really, really tight bonds.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:24.750
What's these optical properties here?
This one is transparent to visible

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:43.400
light. Why? Because the electrons
are tightly bound.

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:34.250
So, you've got this really weak
photon, visible light,

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:53.966
two electron volt photon comes in,
and it can't excite anything. But

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:43.750
the bonds are so strong that it's
refracted. So,

00:47:43.750 --> 00:48:03.000
one of the properties: this has a
very high refractive index,

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:53.250
whereas here, electronic conduction
means it's got very,

00:47:53.250 --> 00:48:12.166
very low excitation, and hence,
graphite is an absorber.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:48:03.090
It appears black because any light
that shines on it is absorbed.

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:08.180
See, everything comes from the
electronic properties.

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:13.270
You can explain that its lubricity,
and you can explain its electronic

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:18.360
conduction. And,
you can explain its absorption of

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:23.450
photons. Now,
I mentioned electronics here,

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:27.660
and the impact on photonics, you see?
High index of refraction,

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.990
this is socially a very dangerous
quantity because what happens is

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:34.330
this is what makes diamonds so
precious. It's not just that it's

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:37.660
rare. It's how it functions in
society. It takes a small amount of

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:40.990
diamond. You're just sitting;
you're just minding your own

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:44.330
business. You just went out,
you just want to have a drink,

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:47.660
you're sitting there, there's some
gal sitting over in the corner,

00:48:47.660 --> 00:49:07.586
this dimly lit cafรฉ, she's got a
diamond stud on.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:55.550
That diamond stud takes a tiny,
tiny amount of lumens, and thanks to

00:48:55.550 --> 00:49:00.100
this insidious property,
concentrates them and it shoots them

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:04.660
across, catches your eye,
and then the trouble starts.

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:09.210
So, this sp3 hybridized carbon is
very dangerous owing to this

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:13.770
property. Now,
I draw your attention to the

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:18.330
periodic table.
You know, it may happen that some

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:22.880
of you are going to feel compelled
to make a long term commitment to

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:27.440
another person,
and initiate that commitment with

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:47.013
the presentation of a stone,
a stone typically made of diamond.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Well, I draw your attention to the
fact that at room temperature,

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
the stable form of carbon is
graphite. Now,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000
I want you to think about this.
If you want to present a ring that

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
contains the stone that's symbolic
of eternal love,

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
doesn't it make sense to present the
stable form, not the

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:56.250
metastable form?
I mean, I was just thinking about

00:49:56.250 --> 00:50:00.750
this. So, my point is that this is
the stable form.

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:05.250
I've done my part to explain it in
terms of sp2 hybridization.

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:09.750
I leave it up to you to explain it
to your sweetheart.

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:11.083
OK, have a nice day.
