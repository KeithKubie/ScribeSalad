00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.662
We often refer to the relationship between two variables as the correlation. If

00:00:05.662 --> 00:00:10.200
two variables have a strong relationship, then they have a high correlation. We

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.873
can also say strong correlation. But you're going to start getting used to the

00:00:14.873 --> 00:00:18.947
word correlation. Now, match each of these plots with the appropriate

00:00:18.947 --> 00:00:24.350
description. Which of these has a strong positive correlation? Or strong in

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.012
negative which shows a weak and positive correlation and finally which is a

00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:35.501
weak but negative correlation. Put the appropriate letter in the boxes here on

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:36.760
the left.
