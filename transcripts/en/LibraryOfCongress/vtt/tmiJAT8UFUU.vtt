&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:06.826
&gt;&gt; My name is Philip Kennicott,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.826
I am the culture critic
of the Washington Post.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.990
Since the very beginning of
the National Book Festival,

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.523
the Washington Post has been
a sponsor and will remain so

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.380
and I can tell you that one of the
great benefits of that is we get

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.220
to come down here and see that
there are in fact still people

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.766
who are passionate about books.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.520
I have the pleasure today of
introducing author Bruce Feiler.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.180
He has written books that take
both the author and the reader

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.186
on some extraordinary journeys,
whether that is Under The Big Top

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.233
to a year spent his life of a clown
or in one of his most renowned

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.986
and popular books, Walking the
Bible, where he explored one

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.893
of the most beautiful and
[inaudible] and inspiring

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.083
and conflicted landscapes
in the world.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.280
He is also a journalist.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.013
He writes the Family Matters column

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.653
for another newspaper called
The New York Times that appears

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.786
in the Sunday Style section.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.900
Some of you, if you read the
Washing Post remember that he wrote

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.830
about a year ago for us on one of
the subjects that he has returned to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.320
and that is the way in which Old
Testament figures play a recurring

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.313
role in our life.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.730
He in that story he made
the case to why he believes

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.073
that Moses is the Patron
Saint of Washington.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.846
His most recent book however is
very different and very personal.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.953
It is a powerful book and it
is called, The Council of Dads:

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.236
My Daughters, My Illness and the Men
Who Could Be Me, and so I am going

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.963
to leave Bruce to talk
about that book,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.496
please give him a warm welcome.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:38.930
[ Applause ]

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.726
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.926
Thank you Philip and friends out--

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.966
who have been my classmate
in college.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.353
It is great to be here.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.953
I was here four years-- who was
here, I was here four years ago

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.286
and it is just amazing to see how
this festival has doubled in size,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.710
how the rain has finally left.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.110
I understand there's been
rain basically every year.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.976
I am delighted to be here for the
many reasons you might imagine.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.263
And in fact, I began my writing
life living not that far from here

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.676
in DuPont Circle almost 20
years ago, back in the day

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.330
where there was no Internet, no
cable, just me and Diane Rehm

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.866
in my-- yes, God bless Diane Rehm.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.266
And I have to say it was one of the
great moments in my life when I was

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.566
on The Diane Rehm Show
for Walking the Bible

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.300
and to know how much she has
honored writers and words and to be

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.866
on that show and I have since
been on a couple of times.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.293
It has been a highlight
of my professional life.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.240
I grew up in Savannah, Georgia
and when I was four years old,

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.803
my parents moved to
a new neighborhood.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.286
And this was actually in the sixties
and still today all the streets

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.553
in this neighborhood were named
after confederate war generals.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.660
We lived on Robert E. Lee Boulevard.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.376
And for my fifth birthday my parents
gave me an orange Schwinn Stingray

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.676
bicycle, okay, it had one of
those swooping banana seats

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.996
and those ape hanger handlebars

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.080
because it made the rider
look like an orangutan.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.873
And I bet I will get a bigger--
who had, anybody remember the--

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.946
it turns out that two thirds of
Americans, I didn't know this,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.626
had a Schwinn Stingray bicycle.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.000
And one day I was exploring
our neighborhood and I decided

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.550
to take a kind of quick turnaround
in this major thoroughfare

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.893
that bisects our neighborhood,
when, wham!

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.833
I was hit by a passing Sedan.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.136
My mangled bike flew in one
direction, my mangled body flew

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.303
in another, and I was lying across
the yellow line on the pavement

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.016
and one of our neighbors went
running over and she said, Andy,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.783
Andy, how are you doing, using
the name of my older brother.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.373
I am Bruce I said and
promptly passed out.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.986
I broke my left femur that day.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.823
It is the largest bone in your body
and spent the next two weeks in--

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.106
excuse me, in the next two
months in a wheelchair.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.250
Actually, I was in a body cast first
that went from my chin to my knee

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.003
and then a steel bar went from
my right knee to my left leg.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.010
So, I was in a wheelchair and
then I went on and live my life

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.256
and basically for most of my
life I never really thought

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.043
about my illness.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.410
In fact, as you well know and as you
heard I made a living by walking,

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.416
by travelling around the world,

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.390
entering different cultures,
and writing about them.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.346
Walking the Bible became a book
that touched people around the world

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.006
and ultimately became a television
series, and I was the walking guy

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.490
and as I said never
thought about my accident.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.130
Until one day, two years ago, I
went to get a routine blood test

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.523
and an enzyme called the alkaline
phosphatase number was a little bit

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.463
high and my doctor
suggested I go get a scan,

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.553
which suggested there was some
sort of vague tumor in my left leg.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.893
That scan led to another,
to an MRI, to an x-ray

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.983
and then one day I got
a call from my doctor,

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.146
"the tumor in your leg is not
consistent with a benign tumor."

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.206
I stopped walking and it took a
second from my mind to convert

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.460
that double negative into a
much more horrifying negative.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.550
I had cancer and to think that
the tumor was in the same leg,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.386
in the same bone, in the same
place in my body it seemed

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.706
like too much of a coincidence.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.640
So, that afternoon I went home

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.700
and my then three-year-old identical
twin daughters came running

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.620
to meet me.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.753
They had just turned three
as I said and they were in,

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.080
at this time of their life, they
were into all things, kind of pink

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.160
and purple, tutus and ballerinas
and mermaids and make up.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.340
In fact, we called them
Pinkelicious and Purplelicious.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.676
Although, I have to say
our favorite nickname came

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.343
from when they were born at
6:14 and 6:46 on April 15, 2005,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.960
our otherwise grim doctor looked
at his watch and he was like, hum,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.773
April 15th, tax day, early
filer and late filer.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.006
So, okay, on this day Pinkelicious
and Purplelicious, they came running

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.313
in to meet me and they were doing
this dance they had just made

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.323
up when they turned three and
they went go faster and faster

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.560
and then they tumbled to the ground.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.820
And I looked at them and I crumbled.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.540
I kept imagining all the walks
I might not take with them,

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.160
the ballet recitals I might not see,
the boyfriends I might not scowl at,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.760
the aisles I might not walk down.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.256
Would they wonder who I was,
I thought, would they yearn

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.863
for my approval, my love, my voice.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.500
Three days later I woke with an idea
of how I might give them that voice.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.950
I would reach out to six men from
all parts of my life and ask them

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.930
to be present in the
lives of my daughters.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.950
And I said to myself that
I would call this group

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.550
of men the Council of Dads.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.873
Now, as soon as I had this
idea I decided I was not going

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.726
to tell my wife.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.326
Okay, she is a very upbeat person,
she is got a big smile, and big eyes

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.996
and big hair, although, she
told me recently I can't say

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.276
that she has big hair because people
will think that she is from Texas.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.136
So, apparently like it is okay
to marry a boy from Georgia,

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.383
but not to have hair from Texas.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.066
In fact, if she were here which
she can't be today because she is

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.416
in Boston, if she were here
she would tell that story

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.826
that when we got married and
how seven years ago, we in,

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.010
and we got married in Savannah,
my hometown and we went

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.580
to get the license, you know the
marriage certificate, whatever,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.826
the marriage license that
is what it is called,

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.190
and there were three
questions on the questionnaire,

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.330
the third of which
was, are you related.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.396
So, she was horrified by this, but
I was like, you know if you say yes,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.866
you get to skip the one
month waiting period

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
because you already get there
and you already know each other

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.306
and you can jump to the
front of the line, anyway.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.073
Okay so, I decided I wasn't going to
tell her about the Council of Dads,

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.180
right, we should happy our
way, this is America, right,

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.446
we are just happy our
way through a problem,

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.033
but the next day I couldn't
control myself, I told her

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.193
and she loved the idea,

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.763
but she instantly started
rejecting my nominees.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.423
So, she said, well, I
would love him, but,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.513
you know I would never
ask him for advice.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.486
So, it turned out that
starting a Council

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:56.420
of Dads was a very
efficient way to find

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.820
out what my wife really
thought of my friends.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:07:59.860
So, we decided that we needed a
set of rules and so we made or came

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.846
up with a group of rules.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:06.913
The first one was no
family, only friends.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:08.966
We figured our family
would already be there

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.020
and then the second was only
men because we were trying

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.306
to fill the Dads space, and then
the third was basically a Dad

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.960
for every side.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.293
We kind of went through different
parts of my personality and kind

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.120
of pick a Dad that
represented each one.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.936
And then, I actually had
written a letter to these Dads,

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:26.273
but rather than mail it
I decided to sit down

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.720
and read it to them in person.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.066
I mean, Linda joked that it was

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.340
like having six different
marriage proposals, right,

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:34.276
I sort of friend-married
each of these guys.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.310
So, the first of these
was Jeff Shumlin.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:39.796
Now, Jeff grew up in Vermont and
he runs a student travel company

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:42.516
and he led this tour, he kind
of taught me how to travel

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:45.196
when I graduated from high school.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.263
And on that first day, we were in
Holland in a youth hostel behind

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.650
and built in an old castle.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:55.253
And I sneaked out and then
Jeff came and sat beside me

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.410
and there was this, there was a
moat, a fence, and a field of cows.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:00.343
And Jeff leaned over and he said,
so, have you ever been cow-tipping.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.690
I was like, cow-tipping?

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.090
He said, yes, cows sleep standing
up, so if you approach them

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.253
from behind you can push them
over and they go thud in the mud.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.530
So, before I had the chance to
figure out whether this was true,

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:14.856
we had jumped the moat,
we had scaled the fence

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:16.256
and we were tiptoeing
through the dung

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.190
and approaching some
poor dozing cow.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.336
So, Jeff went back to Vermont and
this kind of trip taught me how

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.596
to travel and he went
back to Vermont,

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:28.813
took over this travel company that
his parents started and spent part

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.970
of everyday writing around on
a tractor and shoveling manure,

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.596
and part you know, leading
students on trips around the world.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.483
And this is really what Linda and
I wired him to convey to our girls,

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:40.880
what it means to come from
a place, but also to be open

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.286
to the rest of the world.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:44.890
Jeff would teach them how to travel.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.236
So, a few weeks after my
diagnosis, we popped in my car,

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:49.233
we drove the kids to up to Vermont.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.476
Jeff and I went and sat in an apple
orchard and I read him this letter,

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.910
will you help me their Dad.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:57.960
And I got to the end, he
was crying and I was crying

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:00.560
and he looked at me
and he said, yes.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.226
I was like, yes?

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.993
I had kind of forgotten there
was this question at the heart

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.346
of the letter and it-- first,
it never occurred to me

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.773
that anybody would turn me down,
although, I keep getting asked

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.306
that question repeatedly.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.783
So then, I asked Jeff a question,
I said, so what is the one piece

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.230
of advice you would
give to my girls?

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:18.640
And his answer was so mind
blowing and I ended up asking this

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:20.900
of all the Dads in time and
it is really what compelled me

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.980
to write this book, The Council
of Dads, which was to gather all

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.873
of this life advice into one place.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.013
And so, in Jeff's case,
his advice was,

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.833
he wanted to teach my
girls how to travel.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.273
He said I want to teach them
to be a traveler not a tourist.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:40.370
So, get off the beaten
path, get off that bus,

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.623
seek out what is different,
approach the cow.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.790


00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:46.926
So, it's ten years from
now, I said in our--

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:48.926
my girls are about to
take their first trip,

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:50.193
what advice would you give them?

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.593
He said, I would tell your
girls to approach this trip

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.063
as a young child might
approach a mud puddle.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.660
You can bend over and look at
your reflection on the water

00:10:59.120 --> 00:10:59.783
and maybe make a small ripple or
you can jump in and thrash around

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.923
and see what it feels
like, what it smells like.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:06.960
As he was talking he had
that glint in his eye

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:08.573
that I first saw behind
that youth hostel.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:10.733
The glint that says,
let's go cow-tipping,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.840
even though we didn't tip the cow,
even though no one tips the cow,

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.476
even though cows don't
sleep standing up.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.700
And just that I want to see
you back here girls at the end

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.826
of this experience covered in mud.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:30.180
Two weeks after my
diagnosis of biopsy-confirmed,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.200
I have a 7-inch osteosarcoma
in my left femur,

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:41.230
600 Americans get an osteosarcoma
every year, 85-percent are under 21,

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.470
only 100 adults a year
get this disease.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.630
Twenty years ago, doctors would
have cut off my leg and hoped

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.200
and there was a 15-percent
survival rate, but they determined

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:52.903
that one cocktail of
chemo could be effective

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.830
and I went and got that cocktail.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:57.463
And I got what doctors
call a chemo sandwich,

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.280
which I don't recommend you get
from the-- up the pavilion here,

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:03.483
which was four months of chemo
followed by a 15-hour surgery

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:07.363
in which my surgeon Dr. John
Healey removed my left femur

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.950
and replaced it with titanium,
took my fibula from my calf

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.283
and relocated it to
my thigh and then took

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.270
out a third of my quadriceps muscle.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.380
A surgery so rare, only two
people have survived it before me

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:23.663
and my reward for surviving
it was to go back

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.030
for four more months of chemo.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.303
It was as we called it around
our house, the lost year

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.766
and we were worried
from the beginning

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.333
about how our girls might react.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.780
And I have to say there were--

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.046
in the beginning there was some
nightmares, one of them would get

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.556
up in the middle of the night and
there was some awkward moments.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.070
One night, I had a nightmare that
I was walking through my house

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:46.420
and I sat at my desk and saw photos
of someone else's children sitting

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.120
on my desk, but by
the end I came to see

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:53.573
that maybe perhaps it made
our daughters an ounce more

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.020
compassionate and a
dose more caring.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:59.496
They would run to embrace the
girl with an amputated leg

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:01.640
at the playground, they would
notice the girl with the rabbit

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:05.690
with the crunches in the back of
a children's book illustration.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:10.373
And my daughter Tybee had a one,
great line one day, she said, Daddy,

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.623
I think she began to realize how
valuable her parents were, she said,

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:15.610
Daddy, I have so much
love in my body for you,

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:18.610
I can't stop giving
you hugs and kisses.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.410
And when I have no more
love left, I just drink milk

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.186
because that is where
love comes from.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.346
And one night, my daughter Eden came
to my side of the bed and as I got

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.946
up and went to put her back to
sleep, she reached for my crutches

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.480
and if I could cling to one memory
from my lost year it would be me

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.773
and my daughter walking down
the darkened hallway at four

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.473
in the morning with five little
fingers grasping the spongy handle

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.126
underneath my hand.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.236
I didn't need the crutch anymore
at that time, I was walking on air.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.283
One interesting thing about
The Council of Dads was

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:55.316
that it forced me to sit
down with my closest friends

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:58.236
and tell them what they
meant to me and I began

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:00.806
to realize how rare
that is in this culture.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.503
If you think about it we all have
our work and we have our family,

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.920
but somehow friends get pushed
aside because it is almost something

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.660
that conspires against
friendship in our life today.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.280
And one thing the Council of Dads

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.970
and as I have seen our people
making this around the country,

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.453
around the world, the Council of
Moms that is emerging out of this is

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.393
that this has proven to be a
bridge that invites our friends

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.406
into the heart of our lives.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.856
And the other thing I
learned is how much the role

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.523
of men has changed over time.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:32.843
I mean, if I think about my
father and my grandfather,

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.963
both of them I write about in my
book, there was something about them

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.710
that they were not so communicative.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.703
The men in my council, we talk
about our friends, our feelings,

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.850
our fears, even our weight.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.773
Linda kept saying in these
conversations with these Dads,

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:47.993
she is like, it is
exactly what the Moms talk

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.393
about at school drop off every day.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:51.630
And to me, no one embodies
this modern malehood more

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.023
than David Black.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.453
David, I first met David, he is
my literary agent, I first met him

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.213
in his office in Manhattan and I
should say, he is five foot three

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:08.436
and a half on a good day
standing erect in cowboy boots,

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.123
and he took one look at my
six foot two body and said,

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.256
if I were your height,
I'd be in the NBA.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.413
Self delusion is a wonderful thing,
it is even better in an agent.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.686
So, David, he embodies kind
of modern manhood, you know,

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.313
on the man front, he kind of say
this on the, for the posterity

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:33.020
of the Library of Congress, he
answers the phone, yo, motherfucker.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:39.350
He gives obscure speeches on
bottles of wines nobody cares about

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:39.763
and on his 50th birthday, he bought
himself a convertible sports car.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:43.703
But actually, like a lot of men,

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.236
he is impatient he
bought it on his 49th.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.636
But on the modern man
front, he hugs, he bakes,

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:51.546
he leaves work early
to coach little league.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.926
Someone asked me if David cried when
I invited him to be in the council

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.240
of Dads, I was like, David cries
when you invite him for a walk.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.733
So, David is a literary agent which
means he is a broker of dreams

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:04.476
in a world where most dreams don't
come true, but he is very good

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:08.400
at handling both the
aspirations and the setbacks

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.700
and this is what we wanted him
to teach our girls, how to dream.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.326
So, I said to him, so, what is the
most valuable thing you can teach

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.300
a dreamer?

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.366
He said a belief in themselves.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.956
I said, okay, that is fine, but when
I met you, I might have had belief

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.376
in myself, but I was in a wall.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:30.643
I had no path after writing three
books to some degree of success.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.753
He said, well, I don't see the
wall and I am telling you the same.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.796
Of course you may encounter a wall
from time to time, but I am going

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.853
to show you how to get over it
around it, under it, or through it,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.966
but whatever you do, don't succumb
to it, don't give in to the wall.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.696
So, it is 15 years from now, I
said one of my daughters pops down

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.790
and she says, I have a dream, I want
to write a book or open a restaurant

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.470
or run a marathon,
what do you tell her?

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:57.536
He said, I will tell her let's
make the awesome mundane,

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.356
to make an outline for the book, or
a business plan for the restaurant,

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.943
a route to the top of the mountain.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:05.496
And if that dream should fail
I said, then I will tell her,

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.770
let's find a dream that can work.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.256
It may not be the first
dream or the second dream,

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.243
it is a dream nonetheless.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:15.770
Because anybody can dream
an impossible dream,

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.296
but only a few find a
dream that is possible

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.346
and those are the ones
that are happy.

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:26.220
My house is not far from the
Brooklyn Bridge and during the year

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:29.360
and a half that I was on crutches
it became a sort of symbol to me.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.716
And one day, I said to my girls,
come on, let's take a walk

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.510
across the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.016
So, we set out, the girls
were-- Linda was beside me,

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.183
I was on crutches, my
girls were doing this kind

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:43.050
of rock star poses they
had learned when they,

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:46.516
that may have looked
like Mick Jagger.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.963
And walking, because walking is one
of the first things I lost during

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:51.326
that year I spent a lot
of time thinking about it.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.370
And if you do think about it,
walking is really the one thing

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.990
that most distinguishes
us from our ancestors,

00:17:59.050 --> 00:17:59.780
and yet for the 4 million years
that humans have walked upright,

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.720
the act is essentially unchanged.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.590
It is really, the act
is very simple,

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:08.176
but very hard because every step as
my physical therapist likes to say,

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.936
is a tragedy waiting to happen.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.870
You almost tumble with one leg

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:15.260
and then you catch
yourself with the other.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:17.710
But the cheap act of going
slow is that you begin

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.450
to develop a community
along the way.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:27.696
So, you hurry, you get where you
are going, but you get there alone.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:28.226
You go slow, you get there, but
you get there with this community

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:32.096
that you have developed
along the way.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:34.810
At the risk of admission,
I was never nicer

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.876
than when I was on crutches.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.153
Two hundred years ago in Paris, a
new type of pedestrian appeared.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.833
He was called a Flaneur, one who
ambles the arcades and for these men

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:52.140
of leisure they showed off that they
were men of status by taking turtles

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.156
for walks and letting
the reptile set the pace.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:57.443
And I love this ode to slow-moving.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:18:59.940
It's become a piece of advice for
my girls, take a walk with a turtle.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.373
Behold the world in pause.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.246
And that sense of slowing down,

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.373
of pausing may be the single
biggest lesson I learned.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:13.350
The Liberty Bell has a quote
from Moses on its side,

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:16.070
"Proclaim liberty throughout
the land

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.070
and to all the inhabitants thereof."

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.553
And that comes from a passage in
Leviticus in which we are told

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.370
that every seven years, the
land is supposed to lay fallow

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.133
and every seven sets of seven years,
the land gets an extra year of rest

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:33.800
and that 50th year is
called the jubilee year.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:36.420
It is actually the origin
of the term jubilee.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.580
And during that year, we
are supposed to be reunited

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.780
with the ones we love and
though I am still short of 50

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:45.106
that perfectly captures
my experience.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.600
My lost year was my jubilee year.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.900
By laying fallow, I was
surrounded with the ones I love

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:54.286
and I planted the seeds
for a healthier future.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.500
On the one year diagnosis of my
cancer, I went to see my doctor,

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:02.806
Dr. John Healey, and by the way,
Healey, great name for a doctor.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.173
He is the president of
the International Society

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.250
of Limb Salvage, which is like
the least euphemistic name I have

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:13.950
ever heard.

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:16.216
And he also pauses.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:17.350
He speaks like three words a minute;

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:19.683
those of you who may
have seen the special

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:21.283
that Sanjay Gupta did on my family.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.283
I mean, he spoke faster and not
that I have never heard him speak.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.283
So, I said to him, I said, doctor,
if my girls come to you one day

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:28.416
and say, what should we
learn from our Daddy's story,

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.616
what would you tell them.

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:31.740
And he paused about as long as
ever anyone pause and he said,

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:34.533
I would tell my daughters
what I have learned

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.120
and that is everybody dies,
but not everybody lives.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.626
I want you to live.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.560
I wrote a letter to my daughters.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.216
It appears at the end
of the Council of Dads

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:52.110
and I listed all the
wisdom I heard from my Dads.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:54.706
You have heard a couple here
today, there are many more,

00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.406
approach the cow, live the
questions, pack your flip-flops,

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.670
don't see the wall,
live the questions--

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:06.856
did I say that one,
harvest the miracles.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.300
And when I looked at this
I realized, you know what,

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:10.203
this is sort of a psalm book of
living for my girls and that is

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:14.443
when I realized, it was intended
for them, but maybe, we are the ones

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:17.850
who need them, and
that is the secret

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:19.960
at the heart of the Council of Dads.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.606
Linda and I did it for our
girls, but it changed us and so,

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.230
I stand here today as you have
seen recovered from my journey

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:31.090
and walking without crutches or a
cane for the first time in two years

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:33.790
and I leave you with
this message-- thank you.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:37.510
[ Applause ]

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.160
&gt;&gt; May you find a wall to
get over, around, or through.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.680
May you find a mud puddle to jump
in one day and one of these days,

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.546
grab a friend, grab a turtle,
and take a long slow walk.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:55.803
Thank you very much.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.510
[ Applause ]

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:02.966
&gt;&gt; Labeled Water at the
National Mall, okay.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:05.526
So, I would be happy to answer.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:08.993
We have two microphones, I
am sure you know the drill.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.126
I would be happy to answer whatever
questions you might have about this

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.393
or Walking the Bible,
or the-- anything else?

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.040


00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.366
Okay, someone is going to come
to me-- here we go, here we go,

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.653
excellent, somebody, run, I
can't run, so you run for me.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.680
Yeah?

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.680
&gt;&gt; I just, I just wondered
if you ever thought

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.546
about doing something
like The Last Lecture.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.170
&gt;&gt; The-- I do do a lot of lecturing.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.116
I'm not sure what you mean by
something like The Last lecture,

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:37.383
you mean, like a-- there
is actually if you go to--

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.416
&gt;&gt; It is a book that--

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:42.083
&gt;&gt; I know the book, yeah, David
Black, I'm sure represented it.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:42.550
You know, in fact David
Black, my agent,

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:45.620
oddly represented both Tuesdays
with Morrie and The Last Lecture

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.346
and now the Council of Dads,
and I do, do a lot of talking.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:50.620
In fact, if you go to
councilofdads.com you can see,

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:54.220
you can get or download
a starter kit

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.086
for people who are starting these.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.753
And so, I do do a fair bit of
talking about this at medical groups

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.666
and synagogues and
universities and places like that.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.363
Let's see over here.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.030
Yes, ma'am?

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:12.230
&gt;&gt; Hi, what is your next project?

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:14.896
&gt;&gt; The question is,
what is my next project.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.686
There is-- I have a number of
things that are in the works.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:18.773
As you heard, Philip
mentioned earlier,

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:20.503
I now write a column
called Family Matters

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:23.480
in the Sunday New York Times,
the Sunday Style section.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.686
So, as you are on your way
to the wedding announcements,

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.326
that is what you are after,
we all know, you know,

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.403
the sports section for women.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.670
I hope to stop you for a
few minutes on page two.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:42.816
I am doing a-- I'm actually
beginning to write a book

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.763
about family life in America today.

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.026
I am actually working on another
television series in the wake

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.266
of Walking the Bible with
PBS about pilgrimage.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:55.060
And I will also say, I am
not exactly involved in this,

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:02.046
but I am somewhat involved and
that is the Council of Dads is now

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.953
or has been bought by Fox
Broadcasting and it is

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.286
in development with a guy
named called Peter Tolan

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.246
who did Larry Sanders and Rescue
Me and Murphy Brown to turn--

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.860
I'm not making this up,
to turn into a sitcom.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:20.543
And I have to say in his version,
I have actually never said this,

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:23.450
I don't know how this will
go over, but in his version,

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:24.723
he is actually doing it in
the original conception.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.553
So, there is actually a dead dad
as I call it, there is a widow

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.733
and there is a Council of
Dads because everybody wants

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.073
to know what happened
to the council, and so,

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:34.643
my book doesn't go
there unfortunately.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.943
So, he is going there,
he is going to--

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:39.956
so, as I said, the
sitcom about my death.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.493
Anyway, so that is-- they
have asked me to con--

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.473
you know they pay me with
this consulting deals,

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.396
so I don't know what exactly
I was supposed to offer,

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.550
but that is another
thing that is going on.

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:53.970
Yes sir?

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:56.770
&gt;&gt; In Walking the Bible, you
met some incredible scholars.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:57.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:01.436
&gt;&gt; And wise people and I wonder if
you are keeping in touch with any

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:01.236
of them and if you have any advice

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.570
for the diplomats in
the city right now.

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:06.460
&gt;&gt; The question was about
Walking the Bible and yes,

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.446
I met a lot of great people.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.656
Avner Goren who is the archeologist,
who I travel with both in the book

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:15.933
and the television, so we are
still very close, actually he was

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.673
at our home earlier this summer.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:20.536
Father, to those of you
who have read the book,

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.403
Father Justin who is
the Texas monk who lives

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.590
at St. Catherine has now
become the chief librarian.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.850
And I actually list his
email address in the book

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:31.656
because there is a Burning
Bush there in St. Catherine's

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:35.206
and there is a very memorable scene
in the book when I first arrived

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:38.413
at St. Catherine which
is in the Sinai,

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.546
which is where the monk say
the original Mount Sinai was

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.933
and there is a bush.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.133
It is actually a rare
raspberry bramble

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.276
that the monk say is
the actual Burning Bush

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:50.416
where Moses saw the Face of
God and right next to this bush

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:56.496
which is kind of is a big
kind of weeping willow kind

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.413
of thing is a fire extinguisher.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:00.020
And the first time I saw it,
I thought is this an eye sore

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:03.660
and then I realized the unintended--

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.933
is this in case the Burning Bush
catches on fire and if it does catch

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:12.320
on fire, do I look for the Face
of God or do I put the fire out.

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:14.500
And years later when we
went to make the TV show,

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:15.920
we filmed a little sequence with
me and the fire extinguisher

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.100
and we sent it back to L.A. to
be edited and the editors took

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.193
out the fire extinguisher.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.193
And when the draft came out,
I was like, why did you take

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.060
out the fire extinguisher,
they said, you made that up.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.793
That's just a really bad
joke and you made that up.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.860
I was like no, no, no, I
didn't make that up at all.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:32.563
So, I am still in touch with Father
Justin and a lot of those people.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:38.163
And that journey does continue
in the book, Where God Was Born,

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:41.143
which was what I talked about
the last time I was here

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.106
and I was just actually in for those
of you who have come in designing,

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.446
we actually have tons of copies
of Abraham, Walking the Bible,

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:47.833
Where God Was Born,
America's Prophets,

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.300
they have all that stuff here.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.300
Yes sir.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.033
&gt;&gt; I am just curious
if the travel program

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:56.783
from Vermont was the experiment
in International Living and if so,

00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:59.223
do you have a brief commercial for
it or describe the actual program.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:02.810
&gt;&gt; The experiment for
International Living is one

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.476
out of Brattleboro, Vermont.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.010
Actually, I will be in
Brattleboro a week from today

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:08.010
at the Brattleboro
Literary Festival.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:10.010
This has come out-- is one of Putney

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:12.410
in Vermont is called
Putney Student Travel.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:14.253
So, it is a smaller family
run operation that has been

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.260
in the same family for 50
years and it is fantastic.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.740
Go Putney.com I would
give it an ad too,

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:22.686
but it is the same
spirit as the experiment.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.643
Yes sir, we got-- they are
giving me a minute here.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:26.933
&gt;&gt; Sure, any suggestion for
somebody with some similar ideas

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:29.773
to start writing their own book.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.543
&gt;&gt; Well, I am a big believer in,
you know, for aspiring writers

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:35.703
that the most important
thing is to write.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:38.366
I find in talking to people that
there are a lot of aspiring writers

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.990
who are a lot better at aspiring
than they are at writing.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:47.556
When I was in college I went to
see William Baldwin speak at Yale

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:49.270
and he said, you want to be a
writer kid, you know, get a chair,

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:52.433
get a table, get a piece of paper
and get a pen and start writing.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:54.503
I actually think that, you know,
when I went to Japan 20 years ago

00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.386
and started writing letters
home on crankily airmail paper,

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:02.960
I think that the barriers to entry
were actually a lot higher then,

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:05.866
so I think we have to be seen
now with blogging, with, I mean,

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.373
there's any newspapers,

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.566
The Washington Post not least among
them having written three pieces

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.780
free for them in the last
month, that they will--

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.113
a lot of people will
take free content.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.556
And so, I think that the most
important thing is to get published

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:24.536
and it can be a church newsletter,
it can be a blog, it can be a letter

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.286
that gets circulated to
friends because I think

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.133
that the most important thing is to
get into the active communication

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.566
and so, that you start
showing your writing.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:33.936
I think journaling is fine and has
had a lot of value to me and lots

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:37.913
of people over the years, but
ultimately, I think writing is

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.933
about communication and I was

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.933
in the media earlier saying
what does it mean to you to come

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.566
to the National Book Festival
and I said, it means to me

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:45.886
to be reminded ultimately that
this is about communication,

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:48.870
to have writers in touch with
readers, having feedback,

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:52.756
that is what it is about.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.276
So, I am delighted to be here to
share the story with all of you.
