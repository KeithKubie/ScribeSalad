00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.930
A lot of people seem to think that
web apps can never compete with

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.890
native mobile apps for reliability,
speed and user engagement.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.580
And itâ€™s hard to build
a business case for them.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.660
You know what?

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.840
They used to be right.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.460
But two things have changed.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.530
First, it turns out that most people

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.940
buy most of their apps when they
get their phone or shortly after.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.770
Worse, most people install a few
common apps and call it a day.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.010
That makes it harder for
developers to compete.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.080
But people still keep using the web.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.950
And a few new technologies let you
offer key features customers want,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.590
from native apps.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.990
We call these progressive web apps.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.412
Progressive web apps are web apps
that took all the right vitamins.

00:00:52.412 --> 00:00:57.421
They are experiences that combined the
best of the web and the best of apps.

00:00:57.421 --> 00:01:01.848
They give users the kind of reliable,
fast, and engaging experience that

00:01:01.848 --> 00:01:06.220
they've come to expect from native
apps that delivered through the web.
