vulgarity and so on and I think he
 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.380
vulgarity and so on and I think he
probably would see that and he would

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390
probably would see that and he would

depending on where he would he would
travel of course and I think he probably

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450
travel of course and I think he probably
 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.510
travel of course and I think he probably
would be rather shocked by the tone of
