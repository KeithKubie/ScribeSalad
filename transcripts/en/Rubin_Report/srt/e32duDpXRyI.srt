1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,250
All right people.

2
00:00:02,251 --> 00:00:07,251
We are live on the youtube
and the Facebook and I am
with a bestselling author,

3
00:00:07,301 --> 00:00:08,280
a radio host,

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,410
and a man who wants beat me senseless
in front of millions of people.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,790
Larry elder, who I'll come back to
the Ruben report to this as well.

6
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:22,320
This will be around three. How are you?
This is, so we're at to rocky through C,

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,450
but if it was rocky, no, no, it's
like Muhammad Ali and Frazier Ali.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,730
You lost the first one. Frazier. Ali
lost the first one. One the second one,

9
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:30,360
and then they had the,

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,210
had the big third one thrown in the
middle of this is Thrilla in Manila? Yes.

11
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:34,390
Thrilla in Manila.
See,

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,130
I wish this was more like rocky
because in the original rocky they,

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,190
it was to a standstill rocky
one, right? Nobody wins.

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,490
Rocky two rocky finally wins.
And then three,

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,500
well that at that point you're retired.
I think Ruben,

16
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:49,440
the only question is which one of us has
Ali? Which one? It is this appraiser.

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,750
We shall find out my friend. All
right. So, uh, you just sat down here,

18
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:56,220
but we've already talked
about comic books,

19
00:00:56,221 --> 00:01:00,360
about basketball and we
black panther about racism,

20
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:05,130
about a Trump. Uh, I think we
covered everything by. All right,

21
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,710
well let's do a little bit of
in for the people. So I first,

22
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:11,340
I just want to jump back to that original
moment because I said it to you last

23
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:14,100
time you were here,
which was about a year ago and when that,

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,060
that moment where you really beat
me senseless about systemic racism,

25
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:21,540
that was about two years ago already,
if, if not more at this point.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,830
And so many people,

27
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:26,340
I was just in London two days ago and I
did a Q and a and people were asking me

28
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:30,660
about it. I mean that thing really has,
there are many versions of it on Youtube.

29
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:34,140
It's just caught fire. And as I
said to you last time, it was Sorta,

30
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,360
I view it as my best moment
as, and my worst. It was my
worst because I came to a,

31
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:44,361
an intellectual fight without the proper
equipment and it was my best because we

32
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,950
left it in. And let it be. And
it was a learning moment for me.

33
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:48,150
And then for everyone else,
well,

34
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,480
you had a lot of class for leading it
and a lot of people would've would've

35
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,400
taken it out and no one would have
known it happened. And secondly,

36
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:54,360
the older one gets,

37
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:56,850
the more difficult it is for one
to kind of change one's beliefs.

38
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,960
And for you to do it at
your age to rethink your
assumptions. I takes a lot of,

39
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:02,580
a lot of guts.
A lot of people don't want to do that.

40
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,630
And I appreciate pretty depressing
thing, don't you think? I agree with you.

41
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:08,100
Most people don't want to do it.

42
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:12,120
I think we've fostered here something
that is allowing people to do it,

43
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,730
but most people don't want to do
that. You know? And it's funny,

44
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:16,890
we're in an atmosphere
where just a moment ago,

45
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,150
I'm driving in listening to talk radio
and I think it's CNN or MSNBC and they're

46
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:26,700
going on and on about how Trump has now
made lying, uh, the currency of the day.

47
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:29,010
And no one tells the truth anymore.
Facts don't matter.

48
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,100
And they're talking about the
kinds of lying that Trump does,

49
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:35,100
where he talks about the crowd size and
how much money he has and stuff like

50
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:39,060
that. The lies of the left are huge
lines and the damage the country,

51
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,760
the lie that racism remains a major
problem in America. It's a lie,

52
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,180
the lie that women make 77 cents on the
dollar for doing the same thing that men

53
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,360
do it, it's a lie, the lie that rich
get richer, the poor get poorer.

54
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,110
These are lies and these are big lies
that drive the left and drive votes.

55
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,490
These are the kinds of things that matter.

56
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,980
So when you sit across from a guy like me,

57
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:59,040
and the first time we did it when I
really still felt I was part of the,

58
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,830
I was trying to reform the
left. Realistically, I'm not
part of the left anymore,

59
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,440
you know,
and again,

60
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,400
the left right thing is we talk about
all the time doesn't even have that much

61
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:10,630
meaning anymore. It's
really about Authoritarians,
Libertarians and all that. Um,

62
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,630
but for all the years
that you've been doing,

63
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,410
staking out conservative positions for
how many years publicly and want to drive

64
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,860
25 years, was there a more
sensible left at the time?

65
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,520
Was there a guy you could sit across from
that you disagreed with intellectually,

66
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:27,610
but felt that it was, it was
forthright, it was honest.

67
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:31,330
You just disagreed with the
methodology and the results. Sure.

68
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:33,790
There were lots of people
that I felt that way with.

69
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,730
And William Buckley had a
very good friend, uh, uh,

70
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,760
John Kenneth Galbraith who
was a left wing economist.

71
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,880
They disagreed about everything. They
were good friends. I believe it or not,

72
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:45,880
Antonin Scalia, his best friend on the
Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

73
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,841
What it requires,

74
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:50,170
if somebody to recognize that if I have
a position that's different from yours,

75
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,840
it doesn't mean that I'm a bad guy.
It doesn't mean that I'm evil.

76
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,280
It means that I see the world differently.

77
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,250
It takes a certain kind of
maturity to do that. Unfortunately,

78
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:00,400
we've gotten to the place now where if
you don't believe that racism is a major

79
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:03,580
problem in America, uh, if you're black,
you're a sellout. If you're white,

80
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:06,610
you're a racist. If you say something
negative about the Black Panther,

81
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:11,140
which I just did, I got hammered,
got some guy told me that, well,

82
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,440
it's because as a black person and a
black director and a black hero and

83
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:19,300
therefore you don't like it. I mean, the,
the star is guy named Chadwick Bozeman.

84
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,720
And I was fortunate enough to be
invited to see the premiere of 42.

85
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,170
He was brilliant. I saw the movie three
or four times. I like him so much.

86
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,430
I saw him in, um, uh, a movie
about Thurgood Marshall,
which was a very good movie,

87
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:34,420
probably not commercially, uh, uh,
successful, but it was a very good movie.

88
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,650
And I saw him play in the movie with the,
we play James Brown. He was very good.

89
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:41,440
The movie wasn't that good, but he was
good. Yeah. So he's an intriguing actor.

90
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:45,570
Again, I don't go to see a movie to,
to not be happy to waste my time. Yeah.

91
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,790
And you're a comic book guy. I mean
we were talking about comic books is,

92
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,040
cause I've got a whole bunch in the
green room here and you were immediately

93
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,420
going on.
I've got all this stuff you love.

94
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,820
So it's not like you're walking
into that thing to hate it. Right.

95
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:58,360
And so the criticism is just bizarre.
I mean, what do you think I am?

96
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:00,610
What do you think I do?
I get from the morning hate myself,

97
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,810
Dow to my eyeballs out quite a claw, my
skin color off. I mean that's just, and,

98
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:07,900
and, and, and they, I feel
sorry for people like that.
People have often asked me,

99
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,080
does it make you mad? It
doesn't. I feel sorry for you.

100
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,270
If you are so trained,

101
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,270
so indoctrinated to be that's rabid
against somebody who just has a different

102
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:20,110
point of view. There's a problem
with you, not with me, you know?

103
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,620
Well on that note,
I owe you a public thanks.

104
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:25,720
Not just because you beat me
senseless and helped me get here.

105
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,140
But also because everyone knows about
the interview I did with Thomas Soul and

106
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,020
we had been working on it for about
three years. You sent him a note,

107
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:34,030
I don't know if that was what
pushed him over the edge,

108
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,730
but I think it was one of the really,

109
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,240
one of the big things that I've been
able to do here to bring some of those

110
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:43,810
ideas back. And that's what you've
been doing for a long time. He's like,

111
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,870
he's like JD Salinger. It's hard. It's
hard. It's hard. It's hard to get him.

112
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,690
We have to get 'em out once you
get him. He's, he's amazing. Yeah.

113
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,560
And I met him because I
was on cspan at the time.

114
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:58,100
I had a four hour live radio show and
cspan broadcast of the entire show and I

115
00:05:58,101 --> 00:05:59,480
get a letter from Thomas Soul.

116
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,860
It was like getting a letter
from Elvis and it said, um,

117
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,630
my wife and I watched your entire show.
Your, you were great. Uh, you, you, uh,

118
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,640
you laid out all the arguments,
very well done.

119
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,000
And I wrote him back and we got
together several times since then.

120
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:11,220
We've become very good friends.
Yeah.

121
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,010
So I sense a massive shift
happening in politics right now.

122
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,230
And clearly the center of it right at
the moment is with the black community.

123
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,500
I don't even like using phrases like
that because I don't like that collective

124
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:24,711
thing.

125
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:28,460
But sometimes you gotta you gotta talk
about things in a way that allow most

126
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:30,770
people to understand
them. So, uh, you know,

127
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:33,950
what is it about two and a half weeks
ago or so? Kanye west seven words.

128
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:37,130
I love the way Candace
Owens thinks. Wow. Yeah.

129
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,330
Now do you think that is as big of a game?
Yeah,

130
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,700
I think it is a game changer. Yeah. Um,

131
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,140
in the sense that Kanye West has
28 million Twitter followers,

132
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,030
I don't know how many Instagram,

133
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:51,620
I don't know how many Facebook
would you add them all together?

134
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:52,760
It's a boatload of people.

135
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,740
He has more influence on the
way black people think. Uh,

136
00:06:57,741 --> 00:07:01,910
then Clarence Thomas, uh,
Thomas Soul, Walter Williams,

137
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:04,410
Larry elder put together unfortunately.
Uh,

138
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,440
and for him to say that and to begin
the process of making it okay for black

139
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:13,550
people to rethink their assumption, they
can okay to say, I'm not a democrat.

140
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,630
That's a huge thing.

141
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,730
95% of black voters voted for Obama.

142
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,450
Uh, Trump did a little bit better,
but not a whole lot better.

143
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,950
If the Democrats lose 10,
15, 20% of that black vote,

144
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,600
they are toast at the national level,

145
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:34,510
which is why people like me have to be
vilified. People like Candace Collins are,

146
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,180
are now direct threats to the
domination of the Democratic Party.

147
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,960
People like Kanye West, they've got to
be put down. They've got to be demeaned.

148
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,850
You can't just say he's got
a different point of view.

149
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:46,250
You've got to say something
that's fundamentally,
fundamentally wrong with them.

150
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,140
Otherwise, how are you get 95% of people
to vote and see the world one way?

151
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,050
And you have to show them, prove to
them, uh, convinced them that they,

152
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:56,090
that these guys are against you, that, uh,

153
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:58,340
that you're evicted crat
and these are victimizers.

154
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:00,110
And that's what the left
has done so successfully.

155
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:04,730
And so when you saw the reaction to him,
now again, I, we briefly discussed this,

156
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:07,480
but I don't think either one of us know
what his political beliefs are. Reviewed.

157
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,010
Even if he has, he knows
what they are, but just,

158
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,740
just not to a hate republicans.

159
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:16,910
Not to hate Trump for that is a
big deal. Thank you know, we're,

160
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:21,250
we're in Hollywood. You and
I are, is there an a list
our doing it here. I have no,

161
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,950
is there an alias actor or an alias
actress in his or her twenties or thirties

162
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:28,670
who've come out and said, I love Trump.
None. Nobody. You get some older ones.

163
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,560
Maybe they've already established,
you've said a few things,

164
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,750
but is there somebody right now who's hot,
uh,

165
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,350
on the brink of stardom
or just just in stardom,

166
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:40,190
who's come out in favor of Trump? No,
Trump just say basic conservative. Yeah,

167
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,720
because it would be
damaging to their career.

168
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,870
It's not possible to 100% of them
think the same way. I don't think so.

169
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,240
There's gotta be a few, but when they
come out and say something, of course not.

170
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,770
[inaudible] how'd you get to walk of fame?
A star?

171
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,680
[inaudible] you pay off for that. Then
when someone asked me that report is that,

172
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:56,640
how did that happen?
I said,

173
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:59,470
well this is what happens when you make
a substantial donation to the Clinton

174
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,680
Foundation. Um, I have no idea.

175
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,610
I know that I'm nominated all the time
because I would get some sort of inquiry

176
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,430
from people telling me that you've been
nominated and nothing ever happened.

177
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:12,120
So I didn't think anything would
happen. Low and behold, who know? Yeah.

178
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:15,330
When you think of the odd
levels of racism in this town,

179
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,860
like just the way they do things,

180
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:20,820
like just a couple of weeks ago
when they boot Cosby out of the, uh,

181
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,420
whatever it is, the television
and Kevin Arts along along that,

182
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,830
so then they do Roman
plants in the same day,

183
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:29,370
but it was so obvious that it was like,
oh, we got to take care of Cosby now,

184
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:31,680
but we don't want to make it seem
like we're just booting the black guy.

185
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,960
So where is the white guy we
can get rid of? And you know,

186
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,150
I don't think anything to
do with black or white.

187
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:38,700
I think they realize the hypocrisy.
I think they realized if we're,

188
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,630
if we're kicking out bill costs because
of allegations of rape and here's a guy

189
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:46,860
who pled guilty to rape a teenager.
Yeah.

190
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,040
And we're celebrating him.
We have a problem here.

191
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:54,830
So costly caused them to have to be
consistent. If nothing to do with,

192
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:57,840
with plants. He's race or Carthy is
race. He had to deal with, with the,

193
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,640
with the bizarre concept of somebody
being booted out because he was accused of

194
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:07,110
rape and somebody who was charged with
it and pled guilty to it. He's okay.

195
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,750
I think in their own
warped worldview though,

196
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,870
if Cosby had been white and they
felt they had to get rid of him,

197
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:16,240
they wouldn't have felt that they needed
to get rid of another white guy made.

198
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,770
Maybe I get it. I believe it's possible,
but they've caused us to think this way.

199
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:22,290
Right. That's what I'm saying. I'm
just trying to get in their minds.

200
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,260
I'm not trying to get in and
get in our minds. Um, but okay.

201
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:29,100
I want to get back to what you just said
about the reaction to Kanye because the

202
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:32,550
reaction to me, it seemed, it
wasn't just that people were like,

203
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,520
he's wrong cause he likes
Trump because you know,

204
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,120
lists for things that are
sensible. It was, you know,

205
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:42,330
Candice is far right.
Kanye is on opioids.

206
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,560
10 other smear pieces on both
of them, et Cetera, et cetera.

207
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,070
And I think you're probably
very aware of why that is.

208
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:53,430
And you kind of hinted at it, but can
you explain why it's always so overboard?

209
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,590
Well, again, anybody who threatens
their 95% monolithic black vote,

210
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,950
uh, is an enemy. Uh, they've gotta be
dealt with. They've got to be put down.

211
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,810
And black people have been indoctrinated
to believe that racism is this massive,

212
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:09,720
massive problem in the world,
when in fact it isn't a massive,

213
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:11,610
massive problem in America,
when in fact it isn't. Yeah,

214
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,300
I was on CNN the last time I was
on the sh the dot lemon show.

215
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,540
I reminded them of a 1997 pole that
CNM and Time magazine did wear black

216
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:24,330
teenagers and white teenagers were asked,
is, is racism major problem in America?

217
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:27,750
I think you and I might've talked
about this. Yeah. And more, more um,

218
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,720
white teams and black teams said racing.
It was a major problem in America.

219
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,840
And then when the poll ask,
is racism a big problem,

220
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,330
a small problem or no problem,
and your own daily lives,

221
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,320
90% of the black teens set a small problem
or no problem. In my own daily lives.

222
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,610
That was in 1997. Now, that was before
Obama and before Obama got reelected.

223
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:46,770
You're telling me now things are
worse now than they were back then.

224
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,070
Yet our so called black leadership,
people like Keith Ellison,

225
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,040
people like Louis Farrakhan, people like
Jesse Jackson, people like Sharpton, the,

226
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:58,360
the, uh, the, the, the, the
neighbors over on MSNBC and CNN.

227
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,370
If you contracted on those guys,

228
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,350
you'd be afraid to leave
your house if you were black.

229
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,950
So what do you think is actually
going on in the minds of these guys?

230
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:07,960
I know you're not a mind reader,
but like is it,

231
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,020
is it truly bad intentions
or is it moral confusion,

232
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:15,370
political confused hard.
It's hard. It's hard to say.

233
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:20,230
I think some of it is cynical. Some of it
is, uh, is bs. Uh, recently for example,

234
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:25,231
I just saw that a chapter had of an in
and AACP chapter in South Carolina wrote

235
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:30,700
a big Facebook post about being pulled
over and the officer asked him about

236
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:35,650
drugs and asking him about, um, uh,
why are you having such a fancy car?

237
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,160
And he wanted a big pace Facebook
posts about it. Unfortunately,

238
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,840
the officer recorded everything and it
turned out everything the Guy Dad was

239
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:48,160
alive. This is the chapter head of the
Naacp in that town in South Carolina.

240
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,840
Now if racism so bad that you
have to make up stuff, man, man,

241
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,430
that shows you the,
the,

242
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,990
the call that victim hood has right now
for whatever. Remember the young lady,

243
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:03,850
the actors from the movie Django here
in Santa Monica. Uh, and she was, um,

244
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,090
apparently having sex with
her boyfriend in her car.

245
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,000
Somebody called nine one one and she
choose the officer's of, of, of a,

246
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:13,720
of asking all sorts of things
about her, uh, about her race.

247
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,490
And she didn't realize she
had been recorded. Turns
out she with wrong. And uh,

248
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,200
a judge made her write a letter
of apology. I mean really it,

249
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,560
so what do you do?
What do you do?

250
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:26,950
I was at University of New Hampshire
two weeks ago and they were a bunch of

251
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:30,070
protesters there. Black lives
matter, sent a bunch of people.

252
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:32,170
And I kept saying that I'm
for everyone having, you know,

253
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:35,630
equal respect under the law and you
can't say all lives matter. That's races.

254
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,960
Racist even said black lives matter.
Cause I was,

255
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,650
I did everything I could to make it
clear that I want us all to be treated

256
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:43,510
equally with dignity, with, I mean you,

257
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:45,700
but you know what it's like when
you get some of these protesters,

258
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,110
the ones that are not,
not a,

259
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,140
not an average protester who may
want to listen a little bit and then,

260
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:52,930
and then ask a question, right? When
you get the ones that are just there to,

261
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,880
to borate and scream and the rest. So
one of the, one of the protesters are,

262
00:13:57,881 --> 00:14:00,230
there were a couple at one point
who were saying, uh, you know,

263
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,550
somebody like we could be shot when we
get out of here, all this hate speech,

264
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,870
all of this stuff.
And I realized,

265
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,740
even though I kept saying what I believe
to be true and what I believe to be

266
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:12,160
right, there was almost
nothing I could do. Right.

267
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,590
So what do you do for those people?

268
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:17,230
Because I think the masses
are shifting a little bit,

269
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,080
but what do you do for that?
You're not going to win every argument.

270
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:20,770
You really can't.

271
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,520
And if somebody is invested with the
idea that the man is holding me back,

272
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:27,880
that officers pulled me
over because of my race.

273
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,120
There's not a whole lot you can do about
it. You can point to studies. I mean,

274
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:35,260
it's been studied. They're not big on
studies. And under Obama in 20 2013,

275
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:38,020
I think it was the uh,
national institutes of justice,

276
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:40,030
which is the research arm of the DOJ,

277
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:41,980
did a study on it called
race and traffic stops.

278
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,680
Turned out 75% of the black
motorist who were stopped, said,

279
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:46,060
I got stopped for legitimate reasons.

280
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:50,290
It turned out that you named
a traffic offense. Speeding,
driving went out, uh, uh,

281
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,000
your, your lights on driving
without a seatbelt on, uh,

282
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,160
driving without proper registration.
You name the offense,

283
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,620
a black motorist with work with
more likely to come to commit it.

284
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,770
And the Nij report said,
yes,

285
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:03,920
blacks are stopped more often than whites
are with the reasons have to do with

286
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,390
differences in offending.
End of quote came out under Obama quietly,

287
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,260
nobody talked about it.

288
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,770
How much of this then is just a failure
of what the Republicans have done?

289
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:17,750
I get you on all of the things that the
Democrats and the left had sold that are

290
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,760
lies.
I get the way they,

291
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,400
they manipulate all these
different minority communities,

292
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,910
but it seems to me because there
is a resurgence now, right?

293
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:27,770
Like the first thing I said
to Thomas Soul are, yeah,

294
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,410
are you excited that you know
you're having this resurgence?

295
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,580
He kind of looked at me like, well, you
know, I've been doing this for 50 years.

296
00:15:33,581 --> 00:15:34,280
Can sort of,

297
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,170
or that people now share the clip of us
endlessly and Candice and Connie and all

298
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,320
of this. Um, it, this
does seem to become a Mac,

299
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:46,310
but some of this has to be on
the Republicans too, right?
That, that it got so bad.

300
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,720
Well, yeah, I mean the Republicans
have done a bad job in um,

301
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,640
and marketing their brand. And most
people don't even know that, uh,

302
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,170
the Democrats oppose the 13th, 14th,
15th Amendment sometimes. Unanimously.

303
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,570
Most people don't know that
as a percentage of the party,

304
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:02,240
more Republicans voted for the passage
of the Civil Rights Act and the Senate

305
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:06,080
and in the house then did Democrats.
And there's this myth that, um, uh,

306
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:09,920
what happened is it was this big switch
in the 60s when all the racists, uh, uh,

307
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,650
from the south left the Democratic Party
and joined a public and party when in

308
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:13,190
fact,

309
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,160
if you look at all of the Democrats who
voted against the civil rights act in

310
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:19,390
the house, and the Democrats have
all of them only to switched parties,

311
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:22,340
it became Republicans. Um, the first, uh,

312
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:26,810
Republican senator from Tennessee since
reconstruction was a guy named Howard

313
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,580
Baker, who was a guy who was in
favor of integration. So it's,

314
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:34,310
it's a big lie and Republicans have done
a poor job, uh, in and telling the truth.

315
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,170
The other thing is Republicans,
uh,

316
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,900
are gentle when they're called racists.

317
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,220
They often just don't say anything or
ignore it and hope the moment goes away.

318
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,200
Recently, Mike Kelly from Pennsylvania,
a Republican member of the house,

319
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,790
squared off with Maxine waters.

320
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:57,680
It was his bogus report that purported
to show that a auto dealers, uh,

321
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,190
Jack over black people by charging
them more interest rates to get loans,

322
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,280
when in fact, all of these
things are done by algorithms.

323
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,640
There's no nothing to do with race at all.

324
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,750
And my Kelly happened to be
in the car business. Well,

325
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,050
he knew it wasn't true and he challenged
her and he said something to the effect

326
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:16,340
of we Republicans have an obligation to
when we are confronted with nonsense to

327
00:17:16,341 --> 00:17:19,640
call it and we just need, we need to
start calling it. And that's the problem.

328
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,820
People often say to me, Larry, you
can say stuff we can't say. Yeah,

329
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:28,700
really you are incapable of, of
articulating the words. I just,

330
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:31,270
your brain cannot put out the
conversation. I just did. Yeah.

331
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,270
And that's the problem when white
people are called racist, um,

332
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,320
why don't you defend yourself? Um, you
know who you are. You know how you feel,

333
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:40,101
you know what you've done,

334
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,980
you know what your thoughts
are and someone calls you
racist and you'd let it go.

335
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,810
I mean, it's a problem. Yeah. Are you
feeling this glow right now? I mean,

336
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:51,420
you must be feeling pretty good about
this. Like something has shifted here.

337
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,650
It's gotta. It's gotta feel good. Right,
right. I can, I can sense that. Well,

338
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,500
you saw a poll and it showed a, you
know, I'm big on facts not on feeling.

339
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:01,540
I'll be right back.
So I was letting you have a feeling you,

340
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,780
the polls show that the support
for Trump doubled among black men.

341
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,840
Incredible rates from 11 to 22% and
less than a week and about a week and it

342
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:15,270
shows you there was a dyke and
once the dyke broke, it broke.

343
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,810
And the support for blacks in general
has increased, uh, about 50%, uh,

344
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,550
uh,
for Trump over the last few weeks.

345
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,580
All it because Kanye West's Candice Owen
have made it okay for people all around

346
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:29,941
the country.

347
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:32,700
They have conversations like you and I
are having right now and these kinds of

348
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:35,220
conversations are taking place and
Blakley who were saying, wait a second,

349
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,120
Donald Trump wants to build a wall and
do something about illegal immigration in

350
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:44,121
part because studies have shown there's
a economist named George Boerhaaves,

351
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:47,400
he'd probably done more work on
the impact of illegal immigration.

352
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:51,330
Any other economists, there's no question.
He writes that illegal immigration,

353
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,720
unskilled especially, um, post is
competition for jobs for people.

354
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,750
In the inner city and puts downward
pressure on their wages to Donald Trump

355
00:18:57,751 --> 00:18:59,700
wants to,
wants to do something about that.

356
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:05,070
And studies have shown that when parents
have vouchers, the results are better.

357
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,370
The kids graduate at a higher rate,
their test scores are better.

358
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,650
And the parental satisfaction
is through the roof.

359
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,190
And Donald Trump wants to provide inner
city parents with vouchers and the polls

360
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:16,800
show that inner city parents want them.
And the Teacher's Union,

361
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:19,350
which is right in the pocket of the
Democratic Party and vice versa,

362
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,290
does not want you to have those.
But Donald Trump is a bigot.

363
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,240
So people all around the country having
this conversation and the economy has

364
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:32,130
done well. And under Obama, the
black labor force participation rate,

365
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:36,570
the percentage of black men looking for
jobs or working a hadn't been that low

366
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:39,030
since they were keeping stats.
And under Donald Trump,

367
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,140
black unemployment isn't at all time
low in part because he's lower taxes and

368
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:46,290
stopped turning back. Some of these stupid
regulations that strangle businesses,

369
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,390
uh,
and when business doesn't do well,

370
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:50,520
the people that suffer the most
are the people at the bottom.

371
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:53,550
The ones that need a job and don't
have a job and Donald Trump is doing

372
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:55,080
something about that.
But he's a racist.

373
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,660
Well that's kind of a
difficult argument to make.

374
00:19:57,661 --> 00:19:59,160
His daughter was a converted Jew.

375
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,700
One member of his cabinet is the
formerly respected Ben Carson,

376
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,900
but Donald Trump's a bigot.
Don't forget our are openly gay.

377
00:20:07,901 --> 00:20:11,280
Uh, now ambassador to Germany, right
at Grinnell, right. And a series of,

378
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:14,280
and don't forget all the mini Haley
and all and all the material you see of

379
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:18,120
Donald Trump hanging out
with Jesse Jackson and Al
Sharpton back in the day when,

380
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:21,150
uh, when they thought that
he could benefit them and
now all of a sudden he's a

381
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:22,230
bigger,
it's outrageous.

382
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,710
And that conversation is being taken
place all over the country. Also, rappers,

383
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:29,430
as you well know, used to rap about
Trump all the time. No one syllable word,

384
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:31,800
his word word is named
Ryan did a lot of stuff.

385
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,280
So they used it and they often talked
about aspiring to be like Trump.

386
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,390
Then he ran for president. He became an
sob. How did that happen? Do you think?

387
00:20:39,391 --> 00:20:43,080
He was just the guy that was the only
guy that could have done it, basically.

388
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:47,890
I think so Hilary was the best funded,
uh, best back candidate ever seen.

389
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,030
Um,

390
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:54,030
and it took somebody to take on the
media and to cut through CNN and MSNBC

391
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:58,150
through social media. Also,
Trump snuck up on people.

392
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,480
The media is really angry at
themselves for letting it happen.

393
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,670
I read that he got about $2 billion in
free advertising now. A lot of it was bad.

394
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,620
Yeah.
But the numbers went up whenever they,

395
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,960
whenever they showed him
the numbers went up and,

396
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,390
and as began knocking off
people and knocking all people,

397
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,840
they realized that he was being taken
seriously and then it was too late. Yeah.

398
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,730
You know, it's interesting
you mentioned that, that poll,

399
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:22,570
that 11 to 22% amongst black male pole,
that thing came out.

400
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:26,110
I quickly saw it on Twitter and then
I kind of looked around. I was like,

401
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:29,460
wait a minute. This seems massive. Like
why we shouldn't understate this. Right.

402
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,180
A doubling of support right now. If at
any point it had doubled under Obama,

403
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:36,120
although it was, you're saying it was
high enough to the point that it probably,

404
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:38,500
it couldn't have doubled but under right.

405
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,960
Any other situation
with any other minority,

406
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,010
the media would have been going on bananas
and it wasn't, I think as I recall,

407
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,150
respected poll to wasn't Reuters.
Uh, I'm not totally sure,

408
00:21:48,151 --> 00:21:51,730
but by every estimation he was
a legit legit pole. Yeah. Yeah.

409
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,250
So that just shows you where
the media is at with this.

410
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:58,930
They can't talk about it to talk about
it also then Lynn's energy to it and when

411
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:00,610
courage more and more people
to rethink their assumptions.

412
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,880
So let's just ignore it. Yeah.
I once asked Thomas Soul,

413
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:06,030
when you write a column like this,
I forget what column it was.

414
00:22:06,031 --> 00:22:09,160
There was some column I think challenge
challenging the assumption of race based

415
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,430
preferences. And he challenged
some big study and I said,

416
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,570
when you write something like this
and you effectively refute some study,

417
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,040
what happens? He said, usually nothing.

418
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,470
He said they went and they move
on to something else. Yeah,

419
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,640
man, there's the long game here.
It's a long, long game for sure. Um,

420
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,330
so when I've had you on one of
the push backs that I get after,

421
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:37,510
people always say, well, all right,
well I'll grant him a little stuff.

422
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,060
Like if they're willing to give you a
little something, they'll go, all right,

423
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:43,420
he made me write, we don't have
laws that are against black people.

424
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:46,480
So it's not systemic if that's
what you're defining systemic as.

425
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,930
And people seem to have a couple different
definitions of systemic, but they'll,

426
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,130
they'll talk about the history of
inequality and why that needs to be

427
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:57,790
compensated for now. Now I
suspect you might say, well,

428
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:00,160
most of those policies that have created
that inequality or because of the

429
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:03,550
Democrats, but that's the last word
I'm going to put in your mouth. Well,

430
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,410
how do you acknowledge that
argument? Well, all a state can be,

431
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:13,060
it's just in its own time.
Um, my father wasn't a slave.

432
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,460
Um, my father never met his father, but
uh, I'm sure he wasn't a slave either.

433
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:22,810
And so the people right now on the face
of the earth have had nothing to do with

434
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,310
historical injustices to black people.
Uh,

435
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,770
and you could take a wand and wave it
over America and remove every Smidgen of

436
00:23:29,771 --> 00:23:31,390
racism from the hearts of White America.

437
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,630
How will that solve the social problem
with that are really facing the black

438
00:23:34,631 --> 00:23:37,330
community?
Primarily the large number of black kids,

439
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:42,080
they were raised without fathers in
the home. 73% right now, 73% right now,

440
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,690
black kids are raised without fathers.

441
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,290
25% of inner city black kids have a
criminal record, either arrested in jail,

442
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,610
on parole,
or on probation.

443
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,340
50% of the inner city kids are
dropping out of high school.

444
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:55,850
And those that do graduate often cannot
read, write, and compute at grade level.

445
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,840
What does any of that had to do with
racism? And many of these cities, uh,

446
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:03,740
and school boards have been
run by Democrats and run by
black people for decades.

447
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,570
So, okay. So if we remove the racism part
of it, but acknowledge those numbers,

448
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,710
your answer would be that we have to,
what then changed the education system?

449
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:17,500
I mean for me it's the, you got to start.
It all starts in the home recently. Uh,

450
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,930
I was pleased to watch Denzel Washington
being interviewed about his movie. Uh,

451
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,560
Roman j Israel.
Yeah.

452
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,380
Which was about a criminal defense lawyer
and someone put a mic in his face, uh,

453
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,850
and ask Denzel Washington,
what about the large number of,

454
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,800
of blacks who were being warehoused
by the criminal justice system.

455
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,690
And I just knew he was going
to say something about, yeah,

456
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:38,960
we need to do something about the systemic
racism, blah, blah, blah. He didn't,

457
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,880
he said,
it all starts in the home.

458
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,710
I saw it in my generation and
every generation thereafter. Uh,

459
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,280
if you're raised by the streets,
uh,

460
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:48,950
then the streets become your father and
the course become your home and the GL

461
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:52,880
becomes your, your residence as what he
said. Something to that effect. And it was

462
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:59,420
spot on. I didn't expect
it. Uh, and again,

463
00:24:59,421 --> 00:25:02,330
I think things like that when you add
them all up will cause people to start

464
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:03,860
rethinking their assumptions.
Yeah.

465
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,010
Are you feeling it like when you're doing
your radio show on you're taking calls

466
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:10,170
now or it's hard. It's hard to
say because you know, this is a,

467
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,540
I'm often preaching to
the crowd. Yeah. Um,

468
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,830
I like to think that the reason my numbers
are so big is that I'm getting people

469
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:20,450
that don't normally listen
to a conservative slash
libertarian, a talk show host.

470
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,670
But it's hard to say because the
people call in are motivated,

471
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,960
they're driven to call in. They
don't necessarily represent
the, uh, the entire, um,

472
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,640
population base.
So it's hard to say.

473
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:35,360
Plus you t you choose calls
because they're entertaining
because the person has

474
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:38,600
a good point of view, has a good speaking
voice. Uh, it gets to the point quickly.

475
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,450
So there are all sorts of factors that
go into it. So it's not scientific. Yeah,

476
00:25:41,451 --> 00:25:44,570
I like that you just describe yourself
as a conservative slash libertarian cause

477
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:47,720
I think on the, on the libertarian side of
stuff, I think we're, we're pretty much,

478
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,060
yeah,
as close to lock step as you can get.

479
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,180
What do you see as the differences
between those two positions?

480
00:25:53,181 --> 00:25:54,440
Does it even matter to you?
Well,

481
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:57,080
the reason I use that is because
people often call me a conservative.

482
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,510
I don't consider myself that I
consider myself to be a libertarian,

483
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:01,610
a smaller libertarian who
they're registered Republican.

484
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,710
I don't run from the term conservative.
Um, and most of my views are conservative,

485
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:10,340
but I, but I'm more libertarian than
conservative even mean to you anymore.

486
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,790
What is like the phrase [inaudible]
when I think of a conservative,

487
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:16,520
think of a fiscal conservative
and a social conservative. Uh,

488
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:19,760
and on things like same sex marriage,
things like a doctor assisted suicide,

489
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:21,320
things like, uh, like drugs.

490
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,260
I believe all those things should
be done on a state by state basis.

491
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:28,280
I'm a federalist though, that way a lot
of conservatives are perfectly okay with,

492
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:30,620
in my opinion, passing
laws that would, uh,

493
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:35,350
banned certain behavior that
they don't like. And, and
I'm, I'm not, uh, I'm not, uh,

494
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,260
in that camp.

495
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:38,930
Okay.

496
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,880
I guess also conservatives

497
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,390
probably,

498
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,290
I remember listening to Ann Coulter,

499
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,780
Ann Coulter was talking
about how she posed the, um,

500
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:53,880
the idea of legalizing drugs and talked
about the cost to society for that.

501
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,030
Well, a libertarian wouldn't
think that way at all.

502
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,370
That you just accept that. What price to
pay for freedom, basically. Freedom is,

503
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:06,240
is a, is expensive. Uh, it's, it's,
it's, it's a value in and of itself.

504
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,970
And when you talk about the cost of this,
the cost of that,

505
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:11,970
what about the cost of freedom? What
about the value of freedom? The value,

506
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,500
the value of being able
to do what you want,

507
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,270
provided you're not hurting somebody else.

508
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,840
So when you said something to the effect
of that were all men of our own time,

509
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,270
do you think all you can be, it's just
in your, oh, you can be adjusted, Justin,

510
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,250
that's even better.

511
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:28,250
So when you said that if we were to look
back when we had federal laws and that

512
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:32,400
were, that actually were racist and
Jim Crow laws and things like that,

513
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:37,530
and then we had the civil rights act
of 1963 or 64, I always forget 64.

514
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,010
Um,
now that stopped it at the federal level.

515
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:44,160
Would you have been okay if
the states had dealt with that?

516
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:47,960
Because I get that one a lot now because
people will say rytary and they made

517
00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:48,794
the argument again,

518
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,980
it's probably the biggest question and
the biggest argument that people have

519
00:27:51,981 --> 00:27:55,220
against Libertarians. Yeah. Um, uh,

520
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,820
Barry Goldwater voted against
the civil rights act of 1964.

521
00:27:58,821 --> 00:28:02,570
He became the standard bearer for
the Republican Party and 64, uh,

522
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:06,500
he later on said he regretted
his vote against the bill.

523
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,270
But at the time he said,

524
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:12,920
I'm voting against the bill because of
libertarian reasons. He wasn't a racist.

525
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,680
He didn't believe the government should
tell you if you're operating a store,

526
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:18,170
whether or not somebody could
come in and come out. Um,

527
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,570
and whether or not you are,
should be forced to serve somebody.

528
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:25,680
And he is not wrong. I know that
freaks a lot of black people out. Uh,

529
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,010
but think about it.
Uh,

530
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,090
the country changed rapidly
and laws can't make you change.

531
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:37,310
We change and therefore the laws changed
because we changed. Uh, America changed.

532
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,440
Um, and bigotry,

533
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,620
there's zero tolerance for anti black.

534
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,800
White bigotry is zero tolerance
for it in America. My goodness.

535
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:50,080
Anybody who's out in as
a bigot gets hammered.

536
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,050
Look what happened to Donald Sterling.
He lost his team for crying out loud.

537
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:58,000
So if some guy somewhere decided he wanted
to open up a bar and no black people

538
00:28:58,001 --> 00:29:00,430
come and sign this as only whites,

539
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,870
he would be socially maligned. Friends
who go there have friends who go there,

540
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,080
uh, would malign the person. When
I lived in Cleveland in the 70s,

541
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:15,940
there was an area called little Italy
and I was told if you go to little Italy,

542
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:19,930
you're black, they will spit in your food.
They don't want you there. Everybody,

543
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,710
everybody I know told me that.
So nobody I know went there.

544
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,850
Anybody I know who did go there, if they
told anybody they will socially, uh,

545
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:28,684
scoring.

546
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,010
And then the 14 years I would living in
Cleveland elite got smaller and smaller

547
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,150
and smaller and smaller.

548
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:39,400
So racism is not financially beneficial.

549
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:44,500
Um, the reason branch Rickey hire Jackie
Robinson with not to be a civil rights

550
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:47,960
pioneer, he wanted to beat
the Damn Yankees and he
wanted to fast shortstop, uh,

551
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,960
a first baseman who could do it.
Uh,

552
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,710
and once other teams realize that these
guys were good, they had to get them to,

553
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,490
yeah.

554
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:59,410
So although I can tell you wouldn't
be for reversing the civil rights act,

555
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,640
you could make an argument in a modern
sense for that all of these things should

556
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:07,210
just be kicked to the states.
Right? Right. Correct.
Yeah. I'm there on that too,

557
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:09,880
which I think people are always
attacking libertarians for in,

558
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,900
regarding federal institutions like
schools and things like that, that, that,

559
00:30:12,901 --> 00:30:16,510
that our, that our government, uh, of
course, uh, the 14th amendment applies.

560
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,400
But can you explain why?
Because again,

561
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,890
this is where I think
people just get lost. Well,

562
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:25,690
the 14th amendment says no state, uh,
Shell, uh, deny anybody equal protection.

563
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,990
So it's gotta be a state actor, uh, a, uh,

564
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,820
a college or university that state,

565
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,110
but a private university should be able
to do what they want even though none of

566
00:30:35,111 --> 00:30:37,000
them can because everybody
accepts federal dollars.

567
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,940
And therefore the government can tell
you what to do. There is one university,

568
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,830
Hillsdale and a few others
that don't take any,

569
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,800
any federal money and therefore they
can admit who they want by whatever

570
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,680
criteria they want. And
that ought to be what, uh,

571
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,880
what should happen in any institution
in the private sector, whether it's a,

572
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,450
a grocery store or, or,
or college or university.

573
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:57,540
What do you make of just the line of
thinking that we would ever be able to set

574
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,930
a series of laws in place
that would perfect the whole
damn thing because that's

575
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:05,980
really what this comes down to. They,
they think basically we can just,

576
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:09,150
we can basically Riedel away your
ability to think really, right.

577
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,150
And then you'll all act like sort of
automatons and behave and no one will be

578
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:15,250
racist and whatever.
But at the same time,

579
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:17,230
and we know this because of
silicon valley right now,

580
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,630
no one will be able to come up
with the ingenuity of thought.

581
00:31:19,631 --> 00:31:23,350
No one will have an original premise
or ability to do anything cool anymore.

582
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,310
Right. Um, well that's a problem with the
left. That's why their moral busy body.

583
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:29,170
So right now,
and I think a Seattle,

584
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:33,070
they just passed a law that's going
to tax businesses so that, so that uh,

585
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,500
they can build more,
more shelter for homeless people.

586
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,630
The more you encourage
this kind of behavior.

587
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:38,800
It was just there in Seattle last week.

588
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,450
A lot of homeless people
that are going to get, yeah.

589
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,620
Have you been downtown La recently? Yeah,
up in Seattle, up in, up in San Francisco.

590
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:45,051
Uh,

591
00:31:45,051 --> 00:31:48,610
these are all places that are all left
wing and they're very generous and they

592
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:51,690
all feel sorry for the
homeless and therefore they're
making it easier, easier,

593
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,790
easier for homeless people all over
the country to move there and making it

594
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:57,790
easier and easier for you to be a little
less responsible because you know,

595
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,220
you're going to get a house. There's
somebody who's going to pay for, yeah.

596
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:03,940
So as a guy that you were born in La,
right? So you were born and raised in La.

597
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:06,370
First of all, why are we going?
Why, why, why haven't you?

598
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,530
You want to do a little thing on
it and you, it's a, um, first off,

599
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,740
I don't know where I'm going to go with
that. I have to interrupt you or not.

600
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,800
You don't have to. You interrupted
by flow. So, um, first all,

601
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,450
why haven't you run against
Maxine waters already? I mean,

602
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:23,620
what are you doing for God sakes? Let
me support you. Please. I would lose,

603
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,220
I supported a guy named Ross mowing
against her a few years ago and I've,

604
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,230
this is the only time I ever really
went out and campaign for somebody else.

605
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:35,110
I mean, I made speeches for
him, a donut, gave money to him,

606
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:39,980
had him on my radio show a bunch of times,
a Vietnam vet, great guy, white guy.

607
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,960
And he lost,
I want to say 84% to 16%.

608
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:49,520
I mean, it was just a smashing. Um, she,

609
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,860
she has that district
in her hands. And, um,

610
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,960
I mean she strikes me as actually
dangerous to democracy at a certain level.

611
00:32:56,961 --> 00:32:58,280
When she keeps going up,
we're going to,

612
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,350
we're going to find the
reason to impeach him.

613
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,960
She had who the president is for
sure what he thinks she is dangerous,

614
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:05,720
but they will tell you who I think the
more dangerous people like Eric Holder

615
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,310
because Eric Holder is taken seriously by
the left. Maxine waters, the caricature,

616
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,130
they have her for the reasons I mentioned
earlier, to keep life people angry,

617
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:13,881
to stoke up the anger,

618
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:17,990
but no one takes us seriously when
Eric Holder comes out and says, um,

619
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,080
that the fact that black
boys are disproportionally
expelled from their schools

620
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:27,140
compare to their population percentage
when he calls that pernicious racism,

621
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,430
when in fact it's because of their
bad behavior that's taken seriously.

622
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,630
When Eric Holder says that the reason
blacks get longer sentences, uh,

623
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,650
compared to white criminal, definitive
committed the same crime, uh,

624
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,050
when the US sentencing commission says
the reason is because judge has taken to

625
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:44,990
consideration arrest records at
the end of the sentencing process.

626
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,840
And the black criminal
defendant unfortunately has
a bigger restaurant arrest

627
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:51,530
record than the average white guy, uh,
who gets arrested for the same crime. Uh,

628
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:55,430
and Eric Holder in a speech referred
to that disparity as pernicious racism,

629
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,640
even though the sentencing commission
said what I just now said. Um,

630
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,240
Eric Holder says that the push for voter
id, which the majority of blacks want,

631
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,270
uh, is pernicious racism.
This guy is taken seriously.

632
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,160
That's the one that really bothers me,

633
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:11,900
that when they imply that somehow
black people can't get an id, I mean,

634
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,270
you have to have an idea to drive a car,
right?

635
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,010
You have to have an id to go into
a bar, some assault, some of,

636
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,940
some of the events that
Maxine waters puts on.

637
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:24,280
You have to have an ID to get into. Yeah,
I'm sure. I'm sure most of the Muni,

638
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,550
but really that like,

639
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:30,790
do they not realize that that actual
racism was condescending to is just,

640
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:34,520
it's, you know, yeah. Do you remember,
I think we discussed this once,

641
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:36,710
but I'd love to just dive
back into it for a second.

642
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,140
Like a moment in your formative years,

643
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:41,540
your younger years when
you finally were just like,

644
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:45,680
this is what it is and I'm just,
I'm just going to say what it is.

645
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,440
I can't think of a time like that.
I,

646
00:34:48,441 --> 00:34:51,110
I know that had been many times where
I've said things and we've gotten,

647
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:53,750
gotten a hell for it.
I remember being in college,

648
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:57,530
we read Daniel Patrick Moynihan report
that I mentioned that to you called a

649
00:34:57,531 --> 00:35:00,590
Negro family. That's national action,
a classical liberal, by the way,

650
00:35:00,591 --> 00:35:04,720
Daniel Patrick and I got hammered by
the whites of my class for being, uh,

651
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,470
uh, uh, pro, uh, patriarchal. I
think half of the term that was used.

652
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,630
And I'm in the raising the inner city
and I saw a problem and I thought that

653
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,300
Daniel Patrick Patrick Moynihan was a,

654
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,400
was a canary in the coal mine and talked
about this problem. So I said, so,

655
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:22,010
and I got hammered. Yeah. But I
don't remember any particular moment.

656
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:25,040
I've always just been confident about
who I am and what I am. And, um,

657
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,450
my parents always told me that I could
be whatever I want it to be and my dad

658
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:34,451
was a republican and so I watched
all my dad walk into a voting booth.

659
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,570
This is during the primary season in,

660
00:35:36,571 --> 00:35:39,450
in my neighborhood and because
there's nothing but Democrats there,

661
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:42,830
there must have been about 10 or 12
little booths where you stand in for the

662
00:35:42,831 --> 00:35:46,860
Democrat one for Republicans for that
where guy that came there and it's my dad,

663
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,730
he's the only Republican
in my whole neighborhood.

664
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:51,390
And he would come up there and every
everybody courses see he's Republican

665
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:53,160
because he'd walk up there,
you didn't care.

666
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:57,030
And he knew that a lot of blacks felt
republicans were bad people and evil

667
00:35:57,031 --> 00:36:00,630
people. He didn't care. My father
couldn't have cared less. And um,

668
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,950
yeah, it's just this, this thing
around race it, it's gross.

669
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:09,120
I hate the fact that I even where we have
you on that we ended up talking about

670
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:10,650
this. It is girls, especially when you,

671
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:14,130
when you consider America is the least
racist white majority society in the

672
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:17,800
country, the only one that's ever elected
a black president and reelected one. Um,

673
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,490
Orlando Patterson, the, um,

674
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:23,640
he's a left wing or a
sociologist at Harvard said
America has more opportunities

675
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:25,560
for blacks and any other
country in the entire world,

676
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:30,150
including all of those in Africa. Yeah.
Best Fared, best educated. Um, you know,

677
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,140
and here we are bitching and moaning
and whining about what happened. Uh, uh,

678
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:38,340
during slavery and Jim Crow. I mean,
honestly, in order to, to be successful,

679
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,600
this was a, this was a, um, an aid to
Bill Clinton. He said, you need to do,

680
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,720
do three things to escape poverty.
Graduate from high school.

681
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,870
Don't have a kid before you're 20 and
get married before you have a kid.

682
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,320
If you follow that formula, only seven
or 8% of people are poor. However,

683
00:36:52,321 --> 00:36:54,720
if you don't follow that formula, the
majority of people are going to be poor.

684
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,000
That's it. Now, what does
it have to do with racism?

685
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,530
Would have to do with David Duke
explaining that to me. Yeah. Let,

686
00:37:00,531 --> 00:37:03,720
let's talk about that part of it
though. So the, the, the David Duke's,

687
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,480
it's so silly to even have to bring
him up or, or just whatever the,

688
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,940
whatever the truly racist
part of the rite is.

689
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:12,750
And I do believe it does exist there.
There are racist, there are actual races.

690
00:37:12,751 --> 00:37:15,390
There are, you know, some of
this, some of the all right crew,

691
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:19,200
whatever that [inaudible] on the and left.
Absolutely.

692
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:22,410
I just want to give it to the devil, his
due I on the right for a moment. However,

693
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:26,850
however, uh, uh, David Duke doesn't
have a TV show every Sunday on MSNBC.

694
00:37:26,851 --> 00:37:27,900
The way I'll show up into us,

695
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,740
I'll sharpen falsely accused a white man
of raping to want Brawley referred to

696
00:37:31,741 --> 00:37:33,060
mayor, uh, uh,

697
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,230
David Dinkens a first and only black
mayor of New York as an inward whore. Uh,

698
00:37:37,231 --> 00:37:39,060
he was right in the thick
of the crown heights riot,

699
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,270
which was the most serious program
in the history of the of America.

700
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,430
He's on tape urging Jews,

701
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,830
depend their yama clothes and come
over my house and let's get it on.

702
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,880
He's on a surveillance tape with the FBI.
I discussing doing a cocaine deal.

703
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,800
He owes $5 million in taxes.

704
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:57,270
He's got a TV show on MSNBC
every Sunday interviewing a list.

705
00:37:57,271 --> 00:37:59,940
Important people,
Scotty beam me up.

706
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:05,130
And so when I hear all this stuff about
the, the, the racism on, on, on the right,

707
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,860
and this guy has a show,
I mean, it's outrageous.

708
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:12,450
And Don Lemon recently referred to
Brock a to the Donald Trump quote as a

709
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:17,070
racist. Nothing happened. Glenn
Beck, who's not a news guy,

710
00:38:17,071 --> 00:38:20,790
he's a commentator called Barack
Obama, a racist and a, uh,

711
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:22,590
group called color of change,
which is a,

712
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:26,520
a major Searles backed left wing
organization, put a petition.

713
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,960
The targeting has advertisers.

714
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,390
Nobody had a problem with Don
Lemon calling Trump a racist,

715
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,880
but calling Obama Racist,
oh my goodness.

716
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:37,810
Bring out the pitchforks is the problem
there that you don't want your side in

717
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:41,320
this case to start using the same tactics.
So it's almost,

718
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:45,490
it becomes like an uneven
battlefield, right? So like, um,

719
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,360
what's her name on Fox? Laura
Ingram says the thing about, uh,

720
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:53,290
David Hogg was it right?
And then, and then she gets
boycotted and Fox definitely,

721
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:55,720
at least for a couple of days,
was considering firing her. Him,

722
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,010
I'm told I'm pretty good account. Wow.
Uh, yeah. And, or at least, you know,

723
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:05,011
there was going to be some sort of
longer suspension or something and uh,

724
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:09,470
that the right doesn't do that. The
right just, if somebody on the left says,

725
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:12,150
I ain't crazy or, or just let's use the
case of the guy you're talking about,

726
00:39:12,151 --> 00:39:14,990
so I'll sharpen, he's on Msnbc and
it's just like, yeah. All right.

727
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,990
Nobody's watching this nonsense. Let,
well, the double standards, we just, it's,

728
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:23,760
it's just, uh, it's in the
cake. A recent example of that,

729
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:28,350
um, is this staffer, apparently a
low level staffer in the White House,

730
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,710
which was discussing the fact that John
Mccain apparently going to vote against,

731
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,020
Gina has mold the nominee for the,
for the CIA.

732
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,890
And the staffers said something to the
effect of, that's okay, he's dying anyway.

733
00:39:37,891 --> 00:39:42,390
Close quote. How that got out is beyond
me, but it gets out, her name gets out.

734
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,700
Uh, and now Donald Trump is being attacked
because he hasn't apologized to John

735
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,600
Mccain and John Mccain family for,

736
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:51,720
with this low level staffer
says when Obama was in office,

737
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,940
I think was 2014 a quotes senior Obama
official close quote was how the hill

738
00:39:56,941 --> 00:39:59,820
described it,
referred to Benjamin Netanyahu,

739
00:39:59,821 --> 00:40:04,310
the prime minister of Israel as chicken
bleep, except it wasn't bleep. Yeah.

740
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:08,820
And also called him a coward.
Nobody, nobody pressured the Obama,

741
00:40:08,821 --> 00:40:13,770
no apologizing. And Obama didn't
apologize, John Kerry did, uh, to, to, uh,

742
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,460
not in Yahoo, but uh, but Trump won.
But the Obama was not pressured into,

743
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:20,970
into saying this. Now what's worse,
calling one of our closest allies,

744
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:25,500
chicken bleep or some low level staff
referring to a senator because of his vote

745
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:28,560
and it doesn't matter. He's going to,
he's dying anyway, which is worse.

746
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:32,240
And which one caused, no, the more
controversy, the one about Mccain did,

747
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,310
the one about, uh, Obama tree fell
in the forest, didn't make a sound.

748
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,310
So with all the understandable,

749
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,990
the stain that you have for
the mainstream media, and I,

750
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:43,380
and I'm with you on all of
that. And, and you know,

751
00:40:43,381 --> 00:40:46,650
the things that I see people say about
you or just this group of people that I

752
00:40:46,651 --> 00:40:48,030
know to be decent human beings.

753
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,410
Are you at all concerned that if the
mainstream media completely collapses,

754
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:55,800
which I would argue either has already
happened or is an inevitability,

755
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:56,910
at least at this point,

756
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:01,440
that what we're going to be left with
is such a siloing of opinion that we are

757
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:06,060
going to be completely unable to have
any sort of national conversation.

758
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,210
May look, maybe that gets
everything back to a local level,

759
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:11,690
which I would be okay with. But are you
concerned with that at all? I'm, I'm not.

760
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,490
Um, I'm not one of those who thinks things
are worse now than they've ever been.

761
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,910
I mean,
this is a country where we've,

762
00:41:16,911 --> 00:41:21,290
we fought over a big issues for a long
time. Uh, the revolutionary war of course.

763
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,490
Uh, and then of course we had the war of
1812. We had the civil war, World War One,

764
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,200
World War II, Vietnam,
Korean War, w nine 11.

765
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:35,000
Uh, people hated Ronald Reagan. I
thought he was a, uh, George Bush. Uh,

766
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:39,860
uh, what was it? Bush lied. People died.
Uh, there's tension in this country.

767
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:42,440
There always has been a for
a very long period of time.

768
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,460
We get along better now than ever
before. We've, I said, man, I,

769
00:41:46,461 --> 00:41:49,730
I don't think you can understate the
fact that we elected and reelected the

770
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:51,650
black president. Uh, in the 50s.

771
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,700
The polls show that the percentage of
white Americans who would be willing to

772
00:41:55,701 --> 00:41:58,310
vote for a black person, no matter
how well to call it for qualified,

773
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,780
was in the single digits.

774
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:04,190
And now I think only three
or 4% of Republicans and
Democrats say that under no

775
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:07,340
circumstances would they vote for a
black person, for president. In fact,

776
00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:09,710
the greater prejudice against the Mormon,
uh,

777
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,980
and it gets worn for a woman than it is
voting for a black person now. So, uh,

778
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,370
America is a very different
place than it used to be.

779
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:21,830
And for the left to act like it's not
insults the men and women who worked hard

780
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,540
to get us to where we are
right now. Yeah. Well,

781
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,330
just that lack of acknowledgement
of how things have moved forward.

782
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:28,880
When I did this University of
New Hampshire thing last week,

783
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:33,050
I said at the beginning of the speech, I
said, everyone in this room, I would say,

784
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,580
I would guess this without exception,

785
00:42:34,581 --> 00:42:37,730
that everyone in this room has it
better than their grandparents had it.

786
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,820
And I didn't see anyone nodding.
Nobody, nobody said no, there's,

787
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:43,760
they're still yelling at me after about
all of this, this stuff. Meanwhile,

788
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,370
they're at an extremely good
school and all of those things,

789
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:49,390
but it's a lack of acknowledgement
of reality, right. I mean,

790
00:42:49,391 --> 00:42:53,950
let me give you a sort of
a trivial example. Personal
example. I was in school, um,

791
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,210
uh,
in college in the late seventies,

792
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,330
and I met a woman, um,
later on in Cleveland,

793
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:07,331
I met a woman whose father
was a aeronautical engineer
and he was about 10 years

794
00:43:08,511 --> 00:43:12,740
younger than my dad. And I said, she
first said he was an engineer and I said,

795
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:15,530
well, can I engineer? I thought she meant
like a trained engineer and she said,

796
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:19,730
aeronautical engineer. I said, your dad
is an aeronautical engineer. I have to,

797
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:20,241
where do you go to school?

798
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:23,180
When she told me he went to school with
a black school in the south and I said,

799
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:28,100
I would imagine they're no more than
five guys his age plus or minus 10 years

800
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,020
with a degree in aeronautical engineering.

801
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,680
And she went back home and ask her dad
and her dancing maybe five guides. He was,

802
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:37,310
she was, she had no idea how weird
this guy was. And so I met him,

803
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,160
I talked with him and I said, would
have, when you got out of school,

804
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,670
I couldn't get a job. I wrote to
everywhere, which wrote to Westinghouse.

805
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:46,700
I wrote to every major company
and nobody would hire me.

806
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,310
And I was going to get on a freight and
go to Mexico because I heard they were

807
00:43:49,311 --> 00:43:52,220
hiring. And right before they're going
to get on the frightened, I had no money.

808
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,950
I got a phone call from the government
and began working for the government,

809
00:43:54,951 --> 00:43:58,040
rest of his life engineer now,
um,

810
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,050
in the 70s,
I was in college and uh,

811
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,990
excuse me in law school and I had
a roommate who was an engineer,

812
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:09,230
a computer engineer,
and Dave,

813
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:13,330
the companies recruited
him like he was in, in c a

814
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:19,040
and he had another good friend too. Same
thing, both of them. One of them ended up,

815
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:19,580
um,

816
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,850
a long career at Procter and gamble and
made so much money that he dedicated a

817
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:26,840
wing to the, to the computer school at
Michigan. And the other one, my roommate,

818
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:29,750
William, is still with TRW.
Very good career there.

819
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:34,990
They were recruited like rock and my
girlfriend's father could not get a job as

820
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:38,910
an engineer, uh, when he got out of
school. That's a difference between,

821
00:44:38,911 --> 00:44:43,230
and that was an, and I was in, in law
school in late seventies, at 40 years ago.

822
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,580
You're telling me now things are much,
much better than, than even then.

823
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:51,300
And then they were recruited like
rockstars, knock it off. Do your homework,

824
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,280
graduated from high school.

825
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:56,820
Don't have a kid before you're 20 years
old and get married first and you will

826
00:44:56,821 --> 00:44:59,400
be just fine in America.
Yeah.

827
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:04,350
And it's so interesting how a healthy
society deals with its past injustices

828
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,380
because I use the examples of
going to Monte Cello, you know,

829
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:09,630
Thomas Jefferson's house
where you take that tour.

830
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,850
They are very honest about
his relationship to slavery
that he was having an

831
00:45:14,851 --> 00:45:19,170
affair with at least one slave and
affairs isn't right. Kind word to say.

832
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,350
Uh, while, uh,

833
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,770
while at the same time writing the laws
that freed the slaves where I went to

834
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,970
George Washington's house and he didn't
free his half of the slaves until he

835
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:30,840
died. It was in his will, but Martha
still kept the other half. But they,

836
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,440
but they acknowledge all of that and
there's so many people that just want to

837
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:38,370
point at them and say they were racists
and this country was founded by them.

838
00:45:38,371 --> 00:45:41,910
They knew it was a cancer and it was,
and that it was going to, um, uh,

839
00:45:41,911 --> 00:45:44,460
at some point after the point where we're,
where something had to be done.

840
00:45:44,461 --> 00:45:49,390
They knew it. Ben Franklin, his
last speech was a fiery speech, uh,

841
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,750
urging the abolition of slavery.
In fact,

842
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:54,450
he founded in a society for the
abolition of slavery. So the,

843
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:59,260
the founding fathers, uh, many of
them were conflicted. Uh, but, uh,

844
00:45:59,261 --> 00:46:01,920
many of them were aware that
this is something that we
need to deal with energy.

845
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:04,780
Know that in the constitution there's a
specific date that says at this point,

846
00:46:04,781 --> 00:46:07,740
and this, there'll be no more importation
of slaves and they goes 18, 24

847
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,290
and yet people want to want to kind
of sit in this and not let us escape.

848
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,860
And then, and then it leads to
identity politics on the left,

849
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:19,310
which then I think is the
reason that we now have a,

850
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:23,190
a version of identity politics on the
right. And then, and that were caught.

851
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:28,200
Well, 7 billion people, uh, are
in the world and I dare say it,

852
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:31,080
and most of them would trade places
with us if they could. Yeah. Uh,

853
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:33,420
and most Americans, many
Americans, unfortunately don't,

854
00:46:33,421 --> 00:46:35,160
don't seem to appreciate
that. Yeah. All right.

855
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:38,370
So let's talk about California a little
bit in La in particular because as you

856
00:46:38,371 --> 00:46:41,700
said, born and bred in
La. Um, south central,

857
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,360
if I'm not mistaken right now they call
it south la because south central has a

858
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:48,710
negative connotation. So they moved
it and now they call it [inaudible].

859
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,320
That's very fancy, very fancy. Um,

860
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:54,600
but we actually live about 10 minutes
away from me for another tell how old

861
00:46:54,601 --> 00:46:58,650
somebody is in La, if they refer to the
area where I grew up in south central,

862
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,670
south north of 50 calls the south
central. Anybody south of 50 calls it,

863
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,470
I did not even know it was south la now,
but that's, I knew there was a west La,

864
00:47:07,471 --> 00:47:09,540
I didn't even, I used to call
us. I knew there was east La,

865
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,690
south central became synonymous
with black la and that's racist.

866
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:13,830
So therefore they stopped doing it.

867
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,960
I think also real tourist
didn't like it either.

868
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,600
They didn't like the area of being
called south central because it meant the

869
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:21,060
property values might, uh, might
not be as high. Yeah. Well,

870
00:47:21,061 --> 00:47:24,240
we also have an area here, Baldwin
hills that's known as the black right.

871
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:28,080
Beverly Hills. And actually when I
was going to buy a house when I was,

872
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:32,050
I ended up at this, I went to Baldwin
Hills. Beautiful area and it's gorgeous.

873
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:32,621
I didn't know,

874
00:47:32,621 --> 00:47:35,110
I actually didn't know that it was
known as the Black Beverly Hills.

875
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:36,610
And obviously that wouldn't
have bothered me or anything.

876
00:47:36,611 --> 00:47:39,430
But when I went to the house and I'm
looking at the house and it's actually

877
00:47:39,431 --> 00:47:43,360
pretty nice and the prices pretty,
pretty decent relative to whatever,

878
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,170
cause there's some oil things
over there and whatever else. Um,

879
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:49,270
I remember the realtor was
like, and you, you know,

880
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:54,450
it's 90% black and 6% Hispanic
and 2% white or something.

881
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,230
And I was like, all right. All right.
All right. Yeah, it's okay. We're all,

882
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:00,131
we're all humans.
All right.

883
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:04,570
But I want to talk about La and California
in general because I do sense that

884
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,930
because progressive politics
have gone so bananas here.

885
00:48:07,931 --> 00:48:10,990
And you referenced San Francisco earlier
and I was just there and our car got

886
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:14,290
broken into and they stole
my bag. And it, you know,

887
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,410
basically 10 o'clock at night in
front of a nice restaurant and the,

888
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:20,490
and I literally saw someone
shooting up and they were,

889
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,110
they were homeless tents
and all of this stuff.

890
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:28,140
I think that because progressive politics
have gone so overboard that there is a

891
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:33,040
little bit of a libertarian
streak started to take root here.

892
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,830
I took a deep breath in,
as I said,

893
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:39,580
I hope you're right because the
homelessness problem is massive. Uh,

894
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:41,230
our budgets are terrible.

895
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:45,550
The fastest growing item on the budget
is a unfunded pension liabilities from

896
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:49,780
all the, uh, generous packages
that we've given a garment workers.

897
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:53,650
Those workers are our young, many
of them, I think in California,

898
00:48:53,651 --> 00:48:55,960
I read there about 10,000
former government workers,

899
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:59,080
they get pensions have $100,000 a year
or more for the rest of their lives,

900
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,340
which are adjusted for cost of living far
more generous than any pension you get

901
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:05,380
in the private sector. So when you
could get one in the first place.

902
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,010
So that's on automatic pilot and we're
driving away businesses with all the

903
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:09,844
taxes.

904
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:15,040
California has been rated the worst
state in which to do business for every

905
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,041
single year.

906
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:18,940
A magazine called CEO Magazine has
been in business a and small business.

907
00:49:18,941 --> 00:49:22,240
People have also rated it as one of the
worst places in which to do business.

908
00:49:22,241 --> 00:49:25,300
That's why we're losing
in a Digitas population.

909
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,620
People born and raised in California,

910
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,950
going to places like Texas and
Nevada and Florida. It's interesting.

911
00:49:29,951 --> 00:49:33,030
I was in Denver last week and uh,

912
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,910
the Uber driver was showing me how
there's Denver just exploding right now.

913
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,331
They're just,

914
00:49:37,331 --> 00:49:41,320
the whole area is exploding and all the
rural areas are just becoming bigger and

915
00:49:41,321 --> 00:49:43,480
bigger and bigger and the
guy goes, well, you know,

916
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,220
we got lower taxes here in Colorado,

917
00:49:45,221 --> 00:49:49,090
so all you rich California
people are coming here. So
we're, we're really, I mean,

918
00:49:49,091 --> 00:49:53,320
people really need to understand that
people eventually decide to use the foot

919
00:49:53,321 --> 00:49:55,390
vote and go, all right, I'm
sick of paying these taxes.

920
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:58,720
I'm going to go live in a mansion
where I can only live in a apartment.

921
00:49:58,721 --> 00:50:01,090
A little go and you go online and see
it. There's a, there's a, there's a,

922
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,640
there's an online site that
shows where the money goes,

923
00:50:03,641 --> 00:50:06,790
tax revenues and where and where it's
going. Where is it going? And it's going,

924
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:11,740
it's going to look to the so called
red states. States like Wyoming,

925
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:13,120
a state like that are, are, are,

926
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,540
are finding a blooming population
and states like Illinois, uh,

927
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:20,740
and California and Connecticut are losing
indigenous population to other states.

928
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,020
Yeah.
Because of the taxes in the regulations.

929
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:25,300
Do you think there's any chance
some of this could be reversed here?

930
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,590
You've been here for a long,
they had longer.

931
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:29,840
I've only been here for five
years and I'm slightly hopeful.

932
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,440
Here's the problem with California. The
demographics are not in our favor. Uh,

933
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,730
in 19, uh, I think it was 80, 1994,

934
00:50:37,731 --> 00:50:39,680
I think it was prompted,
you want 87 passed.

935
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:45,890
Talk about a quote, harsh, uh,
anti illegal immigration law.

936
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:51,260
When you tell me what 87 for bad
illegals using education funds,

937
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,440
uh, did not allow, uh,

938
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:58,860
illegal aliens to use any medical
funds except for emergency. So no,

939
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:03,920
no education, no healthcare, no nothing.
Illegal aliens. It passed among whites.

940
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,570
It passed among blacks, it passed
among Hispanics, uh, excuse me,

941
00:51:08,571 --> 00:51:12,590
pass them on Asians. It did not pass
a course about Hispanics at the time.

942
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:17,630
The Hispanic vote in California with
maybe 20, 10%. Now it's about 25%.

943
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:21,950
And it's, and it's rising.
And Hispanics believe,

944
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,240
especially those from Mexico,

945
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,780
Republicans are racist and they only
care about the rich la times did a study

946
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:28,550
and asked them questions like that.

947
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:31,430
And those are the two responses
that were the most frequent.

948
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:34,130
Republicans are racist,
only care about the rich,

949
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:37,330
selfish and only care about the rich.
Uh,

950
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:41,000
and they don't come from a libertarian
point of view at a federalist point of

951
00:51:41,001 --> 00:51:44,960
view. They don't know from, uh, from
Thomas Jefferson, from Article One,

952
00:51:44,961 --> 00:51:46,460
section eight of the constitution,

953
00:51:46,461 --> 00:51:48,470
which limits the federal
government to a handful of things,

954
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:50,360
leaving everything else to the
states and the individuals,

955
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:55,010
they don't know from that.
So the point is, we got our
work cut out for us. Listen,

956
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,290
we could do this forever.
That was a quick freaking hour.

957
00:51:57,291 --> 00:51:59,710
And I know you've got a hard out cause
you got it. You got it. Yeah. Yeah,

958
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:04,190
I have a radio show to do right now.
Got a radio show to do. Um, all right,

959
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:05,450
we're going to do the heavier fans.

960
00:52:05,451 --> 00:52:08,780
Follow me on Twitter at Larry
elder at Larry elder. I'm a pro.

961
00:52:08,781 --> 00:52:09,501
It's all right there.

962
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:12,950
Follow him on Twitter and I've got
a book called the elders statement.

963
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,830
Elder statement.com. Yeah. What are
you going to bring the mustache back?

964
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:19,530
Every time I Google image search you and
there's, I'm gonna rock the flowback.

965
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,740
You see my picture?
That picture?

966
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,870
I retweeted that picture because
you add I wasn't, that was like, uh,

967
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:27,950
well what happened is this troll said,
you think your wife,

968
00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:30,050
you've always wanted to be white.
You probably always want to be white.

969
00:52:30,051 --> 00:52:33,400
And so I said, really? And I put that
picture of that one out today. I want to,

970
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:35,570
I want to share it. So I will be looking
at saying, all right, man, listen,

971
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:38,930
it's a pleasure. There is a place, I
don't want to mention it on air. Uh,

972
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,900
but there is a new restaurant
right in between our houses.

973
00:52:41,901 --> 00:52:44,870
Like right in between that is
freaking awesome. Right around here.

974
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:47,480
I'm taking it out. Say the
word for dinner. You and your
girlfriend, you've got it.

975
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:50,280
It's been a pleasure, my
friend. I'm sorry. We have
to do this real quick. We're,

976
00:52:50,281 --> 00:52:52,550
we're to, we'll do this again.
All right. Power to the people.

977
00:52:52,551 --> 00:52:56,630
Death to the fascist pig. I can't do
better than that. And communication.
