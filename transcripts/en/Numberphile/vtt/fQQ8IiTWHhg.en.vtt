00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800
 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.580
This picture, seen from far away,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.000
looks like a shape.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.160
And this is the coat of arms, or the Emblem, of Trinity Hall, this College, which is founded in 1350.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.640
1350, by the way, is a significant date because it's the year after 1349,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.720
and 1349 is the year of The Great Plague in London, one of the great plagues,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.120
and that wiped out the entire and laywer generation in  London.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.920
And some people thought It was an act of God,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.060
but the founder of this college, Bishop Bateman, saw that the new generation of

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.400
lawyers had to be retrained, and that's why the 5 colleges were founded in the first place,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.080
but anyway, we don't have to have that in recording-

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.020
____________

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.520
So we have a very strange object.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.180
This is the coat of arms of Trinity Hall. If you look closely it consists of eights and ones.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.070
Ohhhhhhh. (My God)

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.420
There is a little bit of irregularity here

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.680
but otherwise it's followed by zero zero zero zero and,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.580
ends in a one. This turns out to be a prime and the number of digits in prime is

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.060
1350, which is the year of the foundation of the college.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.119
This was a gift from JF Mckee whom I didn't know personally,

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.980
but my senior colleague Tom Khanna did.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.020
He was a junior research fellow and was a postdoc of this college,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.820
who came maybe 20 years ago,
I am told by Tom and then

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.480
when a fellow of the college leaves the college,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.160
it is traditional for that fellow to leave some gift to the College,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.600
and usually it has to do the subject.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.560
And he, rather enterprisingly, left this gift to the College. The coat of arms of Trinity House with lots and lots of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.700
zeros at the end, but with one and which is a prime.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.840
Now, how surprising is that? I'm really lost in

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.800
awe of somebody who not only had this idea, but actually implemented this idea, and I think even today,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.940
It's a bit difficult to check that this number is a prime

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.780
I mean there are lots of Prime's in the world of special types.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.600
For example, Mersenne primes and what-have-you. And for which, the y'know,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.060
algorithm for checking that they are prime, checking and primality is a very well-known piece of mathematics

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.760
But this is a, fairly, sort of random prime. I mean it starts with eight, eight, eight, eight

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.200
and then so on, and so,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.020
How do you discover such a thing is prime? And the purpose of his game of course was to hit the prime

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.440
exactly at 1350. This is because it's the year of the foundation of college

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.860
So, you can't really fine tune and with a number of digits.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.740
That's why I think there's an irregularity here in the beginning-

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.920
zero followed by six, two, one.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.820
And, we are still looking for the special significance

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.100
Of the number six to one. I'm sure there is some cosmic importance to this number as well.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.280
Brady: What's your attachment to it?

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.840
Tadashi: To be honest it's sitting in the lunchroom, but I think most fellows don't notice its presence.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.600
It's just sitting there among some dictionaries and books on the side of the, erm, of the table and

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.280
every once in a while when somebody like you, who has interest in science and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.880
who has a mischievous aspect to the personality,

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.720
visit the college I love to show this to the people and they're all kind of amazed.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.540
Again, not that somebody had an idea, but somebody actually implemented this whole thing is it's really honorable(?) I think.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.680
Brady: Since recording with Tadashi,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.200
we've shed a bit more light on the identity of the mysterious prime number creator, JF McKee.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.900
It is in fact James McKee. Here he is around the time he was a research fellow in Pure Mathematics

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.220
at Trinity Hall and here he is now where he's a full professor at Royal Holloway.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.760
I did chat with him on the phone and by email, and if you'd like to find out more,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.800
have a look in the video description.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.840
*Tap, Tap*

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.700
Tadashi: And the point farthest from the handle

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.640
*Tap, Tap, Tap*

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.460
*Tap*

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.000
*Tap*

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.520
Behave exactly the same way whereas 45 degrees off

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.920
*Tap, Tap, Tap*

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.160
*Higher Tap, Tap, Tap*

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.480
*Tap, Tap, Tap*

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.760
*Higher Tap, Tap, Tap*

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.980
You get the hi-
