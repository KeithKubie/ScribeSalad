00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.860
their hate list often includes another minority group:

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.400
The Tree of Life Synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.200
which left 11 worshippers dead reminded Americans that hatred of Jews

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.760
is not simply a problem of the past or only one in Europe.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.500
actually has a long and often violent history in the U.S.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.980
It's also frequently been used by white nationalists and other right-wingers

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.880
to rally support against social and progressive change

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.040
You have white supremacists who are once again rising to

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.420
remove Jews from America.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.980
In his statements on social media the Pittsburgh synagogue killer

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.260
connected his hatred of Jews with his hatred for Muslims and refugees.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.520
So where exactly does all this hate come from?

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.826
American anti-Semitism doesn't exist in a vacuum and actually finds its way

00:01:00.826 --> 00:01:04.620
to the U.S. from Europe where Jews have been persecuted for centuries.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.000
Jews along with Muslims were deemed a threat by politically powerful churches and

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.440
persecuted by authoritarian rulers looking for scapegoats on which to

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.400
blame social and economic problems.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.940
But in America virulent anti-semitism didn't really take off until

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.220
immigrated here in the early 20th century.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.240
This migration also happened as part of a much larger wave of migration of some twenty million people from

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.300
Eastern and Southern Europe to the Americas. And so Jews were part of that too, just looking for

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.840
and so on.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.040
Many Jews were escaping

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.820
stoked by the monarchies of Eastern Europe, often as a diversion from challenges to their own power

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.920
There was massive pogroms that took place in the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.180
there was one in

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.020
And then with the 1905 attempt at a revolution in Russia Jews had invested themselves very fully

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.560
Like other immigrants at the time Jewish immigrants face xenophobic, racist, and anti-Semitic

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.620
hostility both in their neighborhoods and in the U.S. press.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.860
And so you began to see anti-semitic images of Jews as capitalists

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.200
So you have pictures of Jews and top hats carrying bags of money.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.920
Anti-semitic incidents were frequent during this era,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.306
including the lynching of Leo Frank by a mob in Marietta, Georgia -

00:02:24.306 --> 00:02:28.600
a violent tactic commonly used to terrorize African Americans in the U.S. South.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.040
He had come from the North to manage a pencil factory.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.240
A young white girl was found murdered and sexually assaulted in the factory

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.780
And he was blamed with the thinnest bits of evidence.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.120
He was tried and convicted. And while his sentence was being appealed a mob broke him out of prison,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.280
dragged him to Marietta and hanged him.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.660
But anti-Semitism during this era went far beyond what happened to Leo Frank.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.140
Remember the Jewish participation and Russian revolutions mentioned earlier?

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.620
Jewish involvement in these uprisings against the tyranny

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.340
of Russian monarchs spurred a new theme in right-wing propaganda.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.560
That Jewish revolutionaries were conspiring with Jewish bankers to take over the world

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.040
Accusations that Jewish revolutionaries and bankers were behind movements for social change

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.940
became a rallying cry for white nationalists to suppress campaigns for workers rights and black civil rights.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.790
You have figures like Rosa Luxemburg and Trotsky

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.400
who are very active in left-wing communist governments and movements,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.280
and so you begin to see images of Jews as sort of the bomb-throwing radical.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.955
So you have these contradictory images that exist at the same time.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.380
Which brings us the Father Coughlin, a Catholic priest who, in the 1930s,

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.680
was notorious for railing against Jewish bankers in many of his radio addresses -

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.200
something that white nationalists and the alt-right continue to peddle.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.680
Coughlin's vehement opposition to communism

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.660
and was a part of his conspiracy theories about a

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.580
And today, Jews are being accused of doing the same thing,

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.040
as being part of an international global conspiracy through organizations such as

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.320
White nationalist sentiments had prompted the U.S. government

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.740
in the 1920s to adopt

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.200
As a result, the U.S.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.200
That's very much the same rhetoric that we hear against

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.860
who are escaping religious persecution.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.680
This is the same rhetoric that our President Trump is using right now

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.320
against migrants who are coming up from Central America and hoping to find

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.260
sanctuary in the United States.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.497
And a younger generation of Jewish Americans have become

00:04:53.497 --> 00:04:57.160
more vocal about calling out attacks on marginalized communities.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.760
Rachael Goldstein of IfNotNow, a Jewish activist group which opposes Israel's

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.220
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.880
is calling for

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.500
When there's anti-Semitism, when there are anti-Semitic

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.040
attacks, that's not just an attack on Jews.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.400
It's really an attack on

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.780
In the decades since the Holocaust, however,

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.040
the white American mainstream has largely integrated Jewish Americans.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.260
A Pew study from 2017 found that more than half of Americans

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.040
rated Jews very warmly, higher than any other religious group

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.100
I've been really fortunate to grow up without

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.020
experiencing a ton of anti-Semitism,

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.300
especially not it's in its most vicious form.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.560
But I know that my grandparents

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.460
experienced things that were much different than what I am.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.900
Even my parents.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.940
And to be a fourth-generation American Jew

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.680
is a really different experience.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.600
All of this violence is interconnected.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.020
And I have to say, as a scholar of Jewish history and someone who's part of the Jewish community,

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.920
it seems incumbent upon Jewish Americans to recognize that

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.500
Meanwhile, the recent rise of white nationalists and alt-right groups

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.080
has seen them unafraid to espouse bigoted views towards Muslims, Latinos, African Americans, the

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.280
LGBT community and Jews.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.360
Before and after Pittsburgh activists in many of these targeted communities have

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.580
Here is Palestinian American activist Linda Sarsour addressing Jewish Americans

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.500
in front of the White House at a vigil for the victims in Pittsburgh,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.300
I'm here today with my

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:37.440
Arab American and Muslim family who came out here to send a very loud and clear message

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.640
to all of you that we love you.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.440
We stand with you.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.020
We are willing to risk everything so that you too can have a right to practice your religion

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.040
freely in these United States of America.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.280
And remember what happened at Charlottesville?

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.980
This now famous moment was actually an echo of a traditional white nationalist rallying cry suggesting

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.500
And at this time, with the political climate

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.100
that were in right now, with the rhetoric that Donald Trump is sharing with his base,

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:25.100
it has sort of allowed for anti-Semitism to come up to the surface,

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.380
to make it more acceptable for white nationalists to

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.100
explicitly say things like "Jews will not replace us."

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.980
The alt-right and white nationalists consistently use terminology that can only be described as

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.560
not-so-subtle attacks on Jews.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.180
So, the term,

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.640
that's being widely used today to attack George Soros and other Jews

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.600
is another variant of the term

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.200
which was used in anti-Semitic documents.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.655
The Jewish billionaire and philanthropist George Soros is today's incarnation

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.200
of the Jew that white nationalists love to hate.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.080
For decades he's funded the progressive causes and groups that

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.020
nationalists in both Eastern Europe and in the United States cannot stand and seek to discredit,

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.380
often as foreign menaces.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.220
This belief that there are wealthy Jews who are controlling world events

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.360
with a goal to destabilize Western countries -

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.320
Trump is not only sounding an anti-Semitic dog whistle

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.600
to cue other people,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.940
he's making straight-up anti-Semitic arguments himself now.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.560
President Trump has come under heavy criticism for his response to Pittsburgh and Charlottesville.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:34.100
He's been accused of fanning the flames by targeting specific groups through racist policies and rhetoric

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.040
He has opened the door and given legitimacy to a group of people

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.040
that have been sidelined and marginalized.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:42.700
and he has just

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.900
Robert Bowers, the killer at Tree of Life synagogue,

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.980
had said online that he was targeting Jews because

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.360
and named a Jewish charity helping to resettle Muslim refugees in America.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.240
Unsurprisingly, he had also ranted about the caravan of asylum seekers from Central America

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.000
Well, for some it's about recognizing the

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.840
I am a young American Jew who hasn't had to experience

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.042
quite the amount of pain that some of the older folks in the American Jewish

00:09:23.042 --> 00:09:24.140
community have.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.080
So as a young person,

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.640
and the future of other people who are being targeted by white nationalism.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.920
Jews need to make, I think, a decision

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.040
I think we're at a crossroads in some ways about

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:45.220
how we're going to approach this. Are we going to reassert our place within a white society

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:49.500
and align ourselves with the state? Align ourselves with authority

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.340
Or are we going to see that
