[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:06.680
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Oftentimes, we

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.970
hear that there aren't women
in tech, and that's not true.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.630
It's that we can't see them.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.380
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO:
Every individual

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.421
has their own unique
perspective, and all of them

00:00:14.421 --> 00:00:17.687
are necessary to create a future
that we all want to live in.

00:00:17.687 --> 00:00:19.520
DIRK PRIMBS: There is
a perception out there

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.880
that tech and engineering,
somehow, is not for women.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.980
And that's simply
not based on fact.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.830
Programs like Women Techmakers
help countering that.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.049
They showcase women who are
impressively skilled engineers.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.780
And bringing more female
talent to software and hardware

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.320
which [? tackles ?]
every one of us,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.160
is one of the key reasons
why running such a program

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.970
is important.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.094
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: The
mission of Women Techmakers

00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:46.430
is to increase the visibility,
community, and resources

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.190
for women, which is reinforcing
for the women that might

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.910
want to join the industry.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.951
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: We have
Google Developer Group

00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:56.240
organizers, whose focus is to
understand what are the needs,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.790
and to create these
experiences and events that

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.456
are going to best serve
those women locally.

00:01:01.456 --> 00:01:03.080
AZZURRA RAGONE: Being
a Woman Techmaker

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.750
is something that
completely changed my life.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.800
You can learn from each
kind of different event.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.507
You learn something that then,
you can apply on your job.

00:01:11.507 --> 00:01:13.340
NATALIE PISTUNOVICH:
Women Techmakers events

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.875
taught me more than anything,
whatever you want to start,

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:16.760
start rolling.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.600
Things will happen.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.010
You see someone does something.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.540
You learn by doing,
and then others

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.400
learn by seeing others do.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.140
DIRK PRIMBS: You have
access to content.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.150
You have access to
other communities.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.217
You're part of a global
movement, essentially.

00:01:28.217 --> 00:01:30.300
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: We're
learning from each other,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.520
sharing our best practices.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.790
And from that, we hope that
we can spread our learnings

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.910
to the community globally.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.910
NATALIE PISTUNOVICH: When
you see people succeed

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.550
by themselves, and you
see this living organism,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.290
I don't know how else
to describe this.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.934
It's just community at its best.

00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:45.350
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
These days are

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.770
filled with inspiration that
allows you to really carry on

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.290
for the next couple of
months or for the next year.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.170
DIRK PRIMBS: Women Techmaker
strives to create role models,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.670
really.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.378
AZZURRA RAGONE: If
you have a role model,

00:01:56.378 --> 00:01:59.390
you feel empowered because you
say, I can do the same thing.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.765
You can be what you can see.

00:02:00.765 --> 00:02:03.140
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: All of
these women that are here today

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.660
are GDG organizers, and
they're all volunteers.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.610
And they're bringing
their passion to life

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.720
because they care.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.647
And it's a special time
for us to give them

00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:12.980
the recognition that they
deserve with all the hard work

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.880
that they're doing.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.620
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: When you
come to Women Techmakers event,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.337
it's about coming together as
community, as a sisterhood.

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:20.420
One of the best ways that
someone can get involved

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.310
is to join our
membership program.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.160
We have communities and
scholarships to help you.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.960
So by joining Women
Techmakers, you're

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.580
a part of a movement
of women helping women.
