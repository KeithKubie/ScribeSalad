00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.530
Alright, so we understand at this point how to use these decision trees, but

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.310
this is a class about machine learning, right? So we need to figure out

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.120
how to make those decision trees happen as a result of processing a set

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.880
of training data. So, it's not clear to me how we're going to make that leap.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.460
&gt;&gt; Let's see if we can figure it out

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.670
together. So, I'm going to play a game with you, Michael,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.230
and if we do the game well. Then I

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.200
think we'll have an idea of what a good algorithm

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.710
might be for actually building a decision tree. So

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.080
we're going to play 20 questions. You're familiar with 20 questions?

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.660
&gt;&gt; Right, that's the game where I'm allowed

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.970
to ask yes/no questions to try to guess

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.790
something that you're thinking of, and if I

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.440
take more than 20 of them, then I lose.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.230
&gt;&gt; Right, okay. So, here's what I'm going to

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.550
do. I'm going to think of a thing, and,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.450
you ask me questions and I'm going to answer them and we'll see if you can guess

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.620
what thing I'm thinking about. Okay, I've got something in my head.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.980
&gt;&gt; The first question, the typical first question

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.970
is it animal, vegetable or mineral but that doesn't

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.830
seem like a yes/no question, so is it, is

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.519
it an animal, or like a, a living creature.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.520
&gt;&gt; The answer is yes.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.650
&gt;&gt; Alright, is it a person?

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:17.058
&gt;&gt; Is it a person?

00:01:17.058 --> 00:01:18.100
The answer is yes.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.270
&gt;&gt; Is it a famous person?

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.350
&gt;&gt; Is it a famous person? That's a

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.130
deep philosophical question, but I'm going to say yes.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.200
&gt;&gt; Is it a famous person that we both know in like directly.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.720
&gt;&gt; Oh, who we both personally know directly, I do not believe so.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.020
&gt;&gt; So, the answer is no.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.570
&gt;&gt; Is it a living person?

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.140
&gt;&gt; Living person, no.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.490
&gt;&gt; So it is a dead, famous person. Is

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.590
the person famous for, say being in the music industry.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.310
&gt;&gt; The answer yes.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.890
&gt;&gt; Did this person live during the 20th century?

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.870
&gt;&gt; The answer is yes.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.450
&gt;&gt; Is the genre of music that the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.960
person was associated with, say hip hop or rap?

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.100
&gt;&gt; No.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.270
&gt;&gt; Is the person a singer?

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.420
&gt;&gt; Singer? Yes.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.460
&gt;&gt; Male or female, is the person female?

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.500
&gt;&gt; Person female? No.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.490
That's ten questions, Michael.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.870
&gt;&gt; Yes, the, the clock is ticking down, but I feel like I have narrowed it

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.060
down quite a bit at this point. Did

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.680
the person die since you've become a professor?

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.290
&gt;&gt; So, say in the last How long have you been a professor?

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.500
&gt;&gt; Too forever it sounds like feels like. Let's see,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.120
recent death. And I'm going to say the answer is yes.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.610
&gt;&gt; Is the person's name Michael?

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.780
&gt;&gt; The answer is yes.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.050
&gt;&gt; Alright, alright, I think I'm on to it. Is it Michael Jackson?

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.510
&gt;&gt; No.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.040
&gt;&gt; Woo hoo!

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.940
&gt;&gt; Of course, it's Michael Jackson.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.820
&gt;&gt; Alright, Thriller.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.320
&gt;&gt; Yes, Michael Jackson is the answer.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.120
&gt;&gt; Alright. So that was, that was very fun. And

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.460
I'm very glad that I was able to solve it.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.728
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:03:08.728 --> 00:03:12.370
&gt;&gt; But it's not clear to me how, this

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.380
is going to give us an algorithm for building decision trees.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.180
&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's think about that for a second. So you asked a bunch

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.370
of questions, and you asked them in a

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.320
particular order. Right? So, here's a question I have

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.370
for you. Why was the first question you

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.970
asked me whether it was an animal or not?

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.370
&gt;&gt; well, it seemed like I needed some way of

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.330
narrowing down the space, and so I wanted to get

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.380
as much information out of that question as I could

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.360
to try to make progress towards figuring who it actually was.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.050
&gt;&gt; Right. So,

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.740
animal is the first question and it was because it narrowed things down. So,

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.470
your goal in asking questions was to narrow the possibilities, right?

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.083
&gt;&gt; Sure, right because I only have 20 questions and

00:03:55.083 --> 00:03:57.428
then I'm, you know I'm out of it, so if I

00:03:57.428 --> 00:04:01.046
asked questions like You know, if I had said--started with,

00:04:01.046 --> 00:04:05.830
Is it someone named Michael, that would have been really bizarre.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:06.990
&gt;&gt; Right, and if the answer was no,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.550
it's not clear that it would tell you anything

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.270
at all. So, actually, that's an interesting point. You started

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.340
with animal; you could have started with Michael. And

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.850
if I had said yes, that would have told you

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.100
something. But if I had said No, it wouldn't have told you hardly anything at

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.990
all. Right? So animal is a better attribute, or

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.320
feature, to ask about than Michael as a first question. Do you agree with that?

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because it could have been like a stapler or something

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.990
like that and then I, the Michael question would've been pretty silly.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.040
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So what about persons? So first you

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.638
asked about animal. Then you asked about person. Why person?

00:04:41.638 --> 00:04:45.900
&gt;&gt; Right, because, because again it seemed like of the space of possibilities

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.190
that I could think of person would help kind of again narrow things down.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.090
That I'd if it was the answer was yes, I would be able

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.640
to focus there. If the answer was no I could focus some place else.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.350
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And so I

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.510
think in fact we could, we have a general statement here.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.030
That each one of these questions. Person, famous, do we know this

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.200
person, personally, so on and so forth. All make sense because they

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.220
further narrow down the possibilities. And that bit about further is important.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.720
Because it implies that the usefulness of a question

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.870
depends upon the answers that you got in the

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.900
previous questions. So even though Michael is not a

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.730
particularly good first question to ask, it's a perfectly

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.340
reasonable twelfth question to ask or however far down

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.850
it is, given that you already know this person's,

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.550
this is an animal, a person, a famous person

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.710
we don't know personally who's not living, who's into

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.230
music, etc., etc., etc. Okay, that make sense?

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.080
&gt;&gt; Okay. So I think then, we have the hints of an algorithm. So let's

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.590
try to write down that algorithm and, and see if it matches with our intuition.
