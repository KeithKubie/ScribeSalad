00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.379
I've always enjoyed looking around

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389
I've always enjoyed looking around
 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.740
I've always enjoyed looking around
looking in nature seeing things that are

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750
looking in nature seeing things that are
 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.150
looking in nature seeing things that are
round round me and when I was very when

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160
round round me and when I was very when
 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.890
round round me and when I was very when
it was young about nine years old or so

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900
it was young about nine years old or so
 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.080
it was young about nine years old or so
my brother received the chemistry set

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090
my brother received the chemistry set
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.840
my brother received the chemistry set
and so of course i also wanted a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850
and so of course i also wanted a
 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.179
and so of course i also wanted a
chemistry set but my parents felt that

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189
chemistry set but my parents felt that
 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.970
chemistry set but my parents felt that
having to chemistry sets in the family

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980
having to chemistry sets in the family
 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.529
having to chemistry sets in the family
making smells and exploding things with

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539
making smells and exploding things with
 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.040
making smells and exploding things with
a little too much and so they my parents

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050
a little too much and so they my parents
 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.389
a little too much and so they my parents
gave me a microscope and so what i did

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
gave me a microscope and so what i did
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.860
gave me a microscope and so what i did
was to take sort of the run off on the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
was to take sort of the run off on the
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.119
was to take sort of the run off on the
sidewalk and such and i discovered

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129
sidewalk and such and i discovered
 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.069
sidewalk and such and i discovered
looking through the microscope these

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079
looking through the microscope these
 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.920
looking through the microscope these
little animals i mean they're called

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
little animals i mean they're called
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.709
little animals i mean they're called
rotifers and they have little discs on

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
rotifers and they have little discs on
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.200
rotifers and they have little discs on
the front of them and these discs rotate

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210
the front of them and these discs rotate
 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.939
the front of them and these discs rotate
and they sort of swim through the water

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949
and they sort of swim through the water
 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.149
and they sort of swim through the water
and you know when i saw that i told my

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
and you know when i saw that i told my
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039
and you know when i saw that i told my
brother and my father and then i add

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049
brother and my father and then i add
 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.050
brother and my father and then i add
various of my school friends come and

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060
various of my school friends come and
 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.100
various of my school friends come and
everybody thought that this was really

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110
everybody thought that this was really
 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.890
everybody thought that this was really
great and so that was sort of the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900
great and so that was sort of the
 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.340
great and so that was sort of the
beginning of my idea of going to need to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350
beginning of my idea of going to need to
 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.890
beginning of my idea of going to need to
science so actually my family we come

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900
science so actually my family we come
 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.620
science so actually my family we come
from Austria and they had left when the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
from Austria and they had left when the
 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.850
from Austria and they had left when the
osteo was taken over by the germans my

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
osteo was taken over by the germans my
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.210
osteo was taken over by the germans my
family had always had a physician in

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220
family had always had a physician in
 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.160
family had always had a physician in
there so that each generation had been a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170
there so that each generation had been a
 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.080
there so that each generation had been a
physician because physicians were one of

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
physician because physicians were one of
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.969
physician because physicians were one of
the things that you were allowed to be

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
the things that you were allowed to be
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.120
the things that you were allowed to be
in Austria even though you were Jewish

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
in Austria even though you were Jewish
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.789
in Austria even though you were Jewish
and so since nobody else was interested

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
and so since nobody else was interested
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.499
and so since nobody else was interested
in being a physician I some hours days

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509
in being a physician I some hours days
 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.749
in being a physician I some hours days
designated and when I was little I used

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759
designated and when I was little I used
 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.630
designated and when I was little I used
to go around and bandage chairs and such

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
to go around and bandage chairs and such
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.420
to go around and bandage chairs and such
and but it was sort of so it wasn't

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
and but it was sort of so it wasn't
 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.429
and but it was sort of so it wasn't
clear that I wasn't going to go to med

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
clear that I wasn't going to go to med
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.319
clear that I wasn't going to go to med
school and go into science even though I

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329
school and go into science even though I
 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.969
school and go into science even though I
was very interested in understanding

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979
was very interested in understanding
 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.230
was very interested in understanding
things

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240
things
 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.690
things
and it was really only finally when I

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
and it was really only finally when I
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.210
and it was really only finally when I
started college and got no sort of more

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220
started college and got no sort of more
 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.080
started college and got no sort of more
ideas but had a very good chemistry

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090
ideas but had a very good chemistry
 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.870
ideas but had a very good chemistry
teacher and realized that if you wanted

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880
teacher and realized that if you wanted
 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.090
teacher and realized that if you wanted
to study understand biology you had to

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100
to study understand biology you had to
 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.150
to study understand biology you had to
learn chemistry and physics and that at

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160
learn chemistry and physics and that at
 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.130
learn chemistry and physics and that at
that point really is when I gave up the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
that point really is when I gave up the
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.980
that point really is when I gave up the
idea of medical school and become a

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990
idea of medical school and become a
 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.740
idea of medical school and become a
scientist
