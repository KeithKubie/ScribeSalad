00:00:06.474 --> 00:00:07.890
HEATH ROWE: My
name is Heath Rowe,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.660
and I'm research
operations manager

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.150
for the Brand Studio of Google.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.240
And we're here today
with Jason Calacanis.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.180
Jason is a technology
entrepreneur, angel investor,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.209
and the host of a weekly podcast
called "This Week in Startups."

00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:24.000
He's the founder of a
series of conferences

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.590
that bring
entrepreneurs together

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.200
with potential
investors, and he was

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.470
a scout for top-tier Silicon
Valley venture capital firm

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.630
Sequoia Capital.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.400
He lives in San
Francisco, California,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.310
used to live down this way
in Southern California,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.150
and is author of a
relatively new book,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.510
it's about a month
old, called "Angel:

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.610
How to Invest in
Technology Startups,

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.500
Timeless Advice from
an Angel Investor

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.650
Who Turned $100,000
Into $100 million,"

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.250
published in July
by Harper Business.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.042
I've known Jason for
probably 20 years now?

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:55.958
JASON CALACANIS: Yeah.

00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.119
HEATH ROWE: Haven't seen
him forever and a day.

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:59.660
So it's good to have
you here, Jason.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.480
JASON CALACANIS: Thanks
for having me, Heath.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.354
We were journalists
together back in the day.

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:03.510
HEATH ROWE: Yeah, we were.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.680
JASON CALACANIS:
Covering technology.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.179
HEATH ROWE: Well,
let's start there,

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:07.260
because I first met you--

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.970
it wasn't photocopied
when I met you,

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.440
but "Silicon Alley Reporter."

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.530
You went on to "Digital
Coast Reporter," weblogs,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.510
Netscape, Mahalo.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.000
That journalism was
all generally focusing

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.900
on the gathering, curation,
and promotion of ideas,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.340
and powerful ideas.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.190
JASON CALACANIS: Yeah, I was
lucky enough to be in New York

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.610
when the internet
hit in 1994 and '95.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.920
CD-ROMs were becoming a big
deal, multimedia, and then

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.420
all of a sudden,
the internet became

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.930
commercialized with the Netscape
browser supporting images.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.260
And I started a zine,
because back then,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.170
if you wanted to be important
in the world, the real startup

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.430
idea you had was a zine.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.772
And a zine just
meant a magazine that

00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:48.480
was not professionally
produced, but that

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.250
was literally a photocopy.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.950
And so after starting that
photocopy zine, "Silicon Alley

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.280
Reporter," it quickly grew
into a print magazine.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.820
It had 300 pages, and I got
caught up in the whole dotcom

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.570
sort of wave of innovation.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.870
And so I got very lucky,
but being a journalist

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.440
is a great way to learn
how to interview founders

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.180
and to cut through BS.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.774
And you're kind of
a detective, right?

00:02:11.774 --> 00:02:13.190
Like when you're
a journalist, you

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.514
have to ask questions,
let the person talk,

00:02:16.514 --> 00:02:18.430
and maybe try to figure
out what the truth is.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.638
And when you're an angel
investor, it's very similar.

00:02:20.638 --> 00:02:23.097
You're talking to founders,
and sometimes they're tourists.

00:02:23.097 --> 00:02:25.512
They're people who are just
trying on the concept of being

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:26.230
a founder.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.645
They saw "The Social
Network," or they

00:02:28.645 --> 00:02:31.584
have seen how Uber, or
Google, or Airbnb have grown,

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:32.750
and they say, I want to be--

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.165
I want to be a founder.

00:02:34.165 --> 00:02:35.790
And then they start
pitching investors,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.998
and you realize, wow, this
person's going to give up.

00:02:37.998 --> 00:02:40.500
This idea does not have
real meaning to them,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.470
and they have no idea how
hard it is to be a founder.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.280
So I think that
journalism background

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.780
has helped a number of people,
including Michael Moritz, who

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.820
is the original investor
in Google was a journalist

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.910
and wrote a book, actually,
about Apple back in the '80s.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.600
And so it's one of the great
paths I think to investing

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.352
is either being a founder.

00:02:59.352 --> 00:03:00.810
Today you can be
a founder and then

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.920
go on to be an investor,
or somebody in growth.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.510
That's another
big one right now.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.134
Everybody is looking
for growth hackers

00:03:08.134 --> 00:03:10.740
to become investors,
and the journalists.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.990
It used to be MBAs.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.640
You have to go get a Harvard
MBA, or Stanford MBA,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.300
and then your fraternity
brothers would get you

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.140
into a venture firm.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.009
Now, it's really delightful that
the whole model has flipped,

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:24.300
and it's like if you don't
have operational experience,

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.216
they really don't want
you in venture capital,

00:03:26.216 --> 00:03:30.540
and it used to be all venture
capitalists had zero operating

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.690
experience, and they
were all finance,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.390
you know, MBA bros,
and all the firms

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.117
were just groups of, you know,
Harvard and Stanford MBAs.

00:03:40.117 --> 00:03:41.200
Now, it's totally changed.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.980
They don't want to hire people
without operational experience,

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.600
because the founders can
see through it immediately.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.400
They're like you've
never run a company,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.816
and I'm going to
take your advice?

00:03:48.816 --> 00:03:50.730
I'm going to take
a pass on that.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.850
HEATH ROWE: Mhm.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.266
And what do you
think caused that?

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:54.060
Or what happened in
the industry that

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.669
led to that shift in thinking?

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.710
JASON CALACANIS: The
founder-friendly movement, I

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.960
think.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.105
When a market gets hot,
and really Sean Parker--

00:04:05.105 --> 00:04:07.770
I would give Sean Parker
a lot of credit for it.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.040
You know, Sean Parker, and
Google, and Michael Moritz

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.290
had a little bit of a back
and forth over Plaxo back

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.400
in the day.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.029
And he then brought Zuckerberg
out to Silicon Valley

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:21.057
and famously left
Sequoia at the altar

00:04:21.057 --> 00:04:22.890
and wouldn't let them
invest, because of how

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.630
he felt he had been treated.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.080
And then Founders Fund,
Peter Thiel and Sean Parker

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.790
created Founders Fund.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.430
And the reason they named it
Founders Fund was specifically

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.590
to attack Sequoia and
other venture firms

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.280
and say, those firms are
interested in kicking out

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.390
the founders.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.220
These firms are interested
in being founder friendly.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.330
And then that just changed
everybody's thinking.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.790
We have to be founder friendly.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.085
And you know, there's
pros and cons to it.

00:04:51.085 --> 00:04:53.460
HEATH ROWE: How do you balance
the operational experience

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.680
with maybe an
idea-driven founder?

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.460
JASON CALACANIS: Yeah
it's pretty interesting

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.740
when you look at the
history of Silicon Valley.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.330
If you were to
say, I'm only going

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.900
to invest in founders who
have great experience,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.370
you would miss Larry and Sergey.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.389
You would have
missed Bill Gates,

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:12.930
and you would have
missed Zuckerberg.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.150
You wouldn't have
missed, you know,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.940
Uber or some other company
that had serial founders.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.250
Twitter had a serial founder
obviously in Evan Williams.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.390
So there is actually a theory
that the biggest outcomes are

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.430
by people who are first timers.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.470
It's not actually
backed up by reality.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.100
It's kind of 50/50.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.780
But the thing about venture
capital and angel investing

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.400
is you don't have
to hit everything.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.064
So if you missed Google,
and you get Facebook,

00:05:41.064 --> 00:05:43.230
or you get Facebook, and
you don't invest in Google,

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.350
or you get Airbnb, and you don't
get Uber, all you have to do

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.050
is hit one, and then they
let you write a book.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.760
I hit six unicorns in the
first 100 investments now.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.710
When I wrote the book
and did the book deal,

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.475
I had three unicorns.

00:05:57.475 --> 00:05:59.850
And since the book came out,
three of the other companies

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.870
have tipped over
into that territory.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.590
So it's a pretty
good track record.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.630
But you know, the reason
I wrote the book really

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.150
is it's so opaque the idea
of being an angel investor

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.680
and doing it professionally.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.410
But because of large--

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.900
the scale of internet
companies now

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.940
and the amount of
wealth being created

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.800
has gotten so great
that now we went

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.830
from just maybe 10 or 15
years ago, 10 years ago

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.159
when I started angel investing--

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.450
I started about seven years
ago, but about 10 years ago

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.710
when I was a founder--

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.500
raising money-- there was
only like a dozen or two dozen

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.525
angel investors of note.

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:34.650
And you could kind of make
the rounds very quickly.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.980
Now, I'd say in
Silicon Valley, there

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.797
are 500 to 1,000 people who
do it as a primary activity.

00:06:43.797 --> 00:06:45.630
In other words, they
spend 50% of their time

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.839
on angel investing or more.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.380
So I think there's going to be
a professional angel investing

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.550
class.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.680
The VCs have
retreated and said, we

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.407
don't want to take risk anymore.

00:06:54.407 --> 00:06:56.490
We don't want to do a
series A that's speculative.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.130
Bring us companies, because
there is so many companies,

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.130
they've moved
downstream and said,

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.421
just bring us companies that
have revenue and traction.

00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:06.180
If it's an enterprise company
with $100,000 or $50,000

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.250
a month, we'll meet with them.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.500
If it's a consumer
product, and it's

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.960
got 10,000 to 50,000
people using it a day,

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.255
and you've got three to
six months of traffic,

00:07:16.255 --> 00:07:18.630
we'll probably wait till you
hit 10 million users a month

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.000
before we invest
and do a series A.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.030
But really, that's opened
up this huge swath of what

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.950
I call the Goldilocks zone--

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.320
pre-series A,
pre-venture capitalists

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.470
wanted to join the board, but
post the product being launched

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.870
into the market, because
let's all face it,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.000
we know that you can get
any product to market,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.950
or I'd say nine
out of 10 products,

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.520
you can get some version of
it to market for either sweat

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.320
equity or $100,000 or less.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:44.820
Right?

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.924
So if you wanted to build
Slack, or Twitter, or even Uber,

00:07:48.924 --> 00:07:50.340
you could do that
for low hundreds

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.150
of thousands of dollars.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.650
In other words,
people can bootstrap

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.740
it, friends and family,
some close friends,

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.960
to get that beta out.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.780
And that Goldilocks
zone is where

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.180
I think a lot of
wealth creation is

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.360
going to occur in the future,
because you've removed

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.610
the 99% of founders who never
get their product to market

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.280
from your investment criteria.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:19.380
And then you don't have the
VCs with their sharp elbows

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.910
blocking the angel
investors yet.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.580
And that's just
probably a, I'll call it

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.040
a three year window in
most startups, where

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.381
angels can participate.

00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:29.130
There's probably about
four or five rounds

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.030
of funding in there as well.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:36.390
Anybody here have a friend
who's actively running a startup

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.909
and has raised money in
the last 12 months or so?

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.740
Right, so almost
half of the room.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.570
And if you talk to
them, they probably

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.270
will raise five rounds of
funding before a series

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.850
A. It used to be you raised
an angel around, friends

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.280
and family, an
angel or seed round,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.155
and then a series A. Now,
you raise friends and family

00:08:54.155 --> 00:08:58.650
that you do a pre-seed round,
a seed round, an angel round,

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.349
a pre-series A, a
series A extension.

00:09:01.349 --> 00:09:03.390
They come up with all
these crazy names for them,

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.550
but just call them $250,000
to $1.5 million rounds.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.040
And usually, there's
six convertible notes

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.047
converting when they finally
get to series A, which

00:09:14.047 --> 00:09:16.380
means you can really take
your time as an angel investor

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.030
and get to know the company.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.580
There is really no
need to panic and like,

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.802
I have to get in this round.

00:09:23.802 --> 00:09:26.010
You can actually wait and
just build the relationship

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.660
with the founders
over six months, which

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.368
is kind of what I
outlined in the book is

00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:34.290
my theory on how to do it given
today's environment, which is--

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.820
there's a lot of
startups, and they

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.440
raise a lot of
rounds of funding,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.446
and you really don't want
to be investing in startups

00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:41.820
before they finish
their product,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.111
because it's a bit of a talent.

00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:46.440
You can't finish the product
without raising a ton of money,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.382
maybe you're not
an actual builder.

00:09:49.382 --> 00:09:51.090
Sometimes it's true,
but most of the time

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.740
you're not an actual builder.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.490
HEATH ROWE: Yeah, it's
'99 all over again.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:55.948
JASON CALACANIS:
Basically, I mean,

00:09:55.948 --> 00:09:57.640
it is highly tourist
season right now.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.640
So the opportunity is still
very great, but a lot of people

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.720
are trying on and playing
the role of founder.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.370
And what they'll find is it's
a really, really difficult job.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.360
It's very hard to
be the founder.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.460
You don't sleep at night.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:17.140
You've got somewhere between six
weeks and 12 months of runway.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:21.820
Your product is probably under
assault from competitors,

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.760
and investors are
waiting to see,

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.090
and people are deciding between
joining Facebook or Google

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.524
and getting huge RSUs or
coming to your company.

00:10:30.524 --> 00:10:32.440
And you've got to convince
them, and then they

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.210
come for six months and leave.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:35.710
So it's very hard.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:41.000
And I think that's one of the--

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.247
the interesting
parts of this is just

00:10:43.247 --> 00:10:45.580
trying to figure out who's
going to stick with the idea,

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.860
because most days as a
founder, I would say,

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.420
are not super rewarding.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.890
They are generally hard.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.850
The reward you get for being a
founder of a technology company

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.140
is you hire the smartest
people you know,

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.480
and they all bring you the
problems they can't solve.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.270
You know, so literally
every week, it's

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.152
like, hey, we got
all this stuff done,

00:11:03.152 --> 00:11:04.610
but here's what we
didn't get done.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:05.630
Can you help us?

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:06.130
Wow!

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:06.921
That's challenging.

00:11:06.921 --> 00:11:09.324
You know, that's Elon's
life is like, OK,

00:11:09.324 --> 00:11:10.990
I hired the smartest
people in the room,

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:14.380
and now they can't
figure out these things,

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.840
and I've got to figure out how
to get the Model 3 out on time

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.470
or get the Falcon to
land properly, right?

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.320
It's a hard life, and
it never gets easier.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.150
HEATH ROWE: So you
mentioned Sequoia.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.077
Do you still work as
a scout for Sequoia?

00:11:26.077 --> 00:11:28.660
JASON CALACANIS: I'm still part
of the Sequoia scouts program.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.680
I do like a investment
once a year with them.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.230
But I just finished up my first
proper fund at a $10 million

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.710
angel fund, which was basically
my friends' and my money.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:43.640
And then I'll do
something in the future.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.850
You can't talk about those
type of things, obviously.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.080
But one would suspect I'm
going to stay in the game

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.730
and do another 150 investments.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.880
And then that'll put
me at 300 investments.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.250
It's very hard to
scale angel investing.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.050
That's one of the things
I'm trying to do right now.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.200
And part of the reason
I wrote the book was I

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.270
think there's a lot of
people who have money

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:05.920
in very boring asset classes.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.612
I call it dead money.

00:12:07.612 --> 00:12:09.320
You know, you've got
your money in bonds,

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.067
real estate, some equally
balanced equities portfolio,

00:12:13.067 --> 00:12:15.400
using Wealthfront, which is
a great tool for doing that.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.090
I'm an investor in that company.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:21.790
And so you have these swaths of
money that are sitting there,

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.160
and it's not kind
of helping society

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.020
in any way or changing things.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.390
I think people should take
maybe 5% of that net worth,

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.730
10% of that net worth,
and put it in something

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.020
that's highly risky.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.640
It may not return--

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.800
it may not have the
stability of, you know,

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.630
the stock market
balanced portfolio

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.600
that people talk about that
returns 4% to 7% a year

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.300
and doubles every eight years.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.670
But you have that outside
chance of going at 100 to 1

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.160
on an investment, or 1,000
to 1, which would then

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.610
double your net worth.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.820
So I think people are
overly risk averse,

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.970
and I try to outline in the
book, here's a strategy,

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.440
maybe investing in syndicates.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.660
People know Angel
List, or Seed Invest,

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.270
or I have my own syndicate
now, Jason Syndicate.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.970
People know that they can invest
alongside of angel investors.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.220
That's a great way to
learn how to do this.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.960
You're investing $1,000
or $3,000 in each startup,

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.020
and you do 20 startups.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.280
All of a sudden, you may
have invested $60,000 total.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.570
But you've done 30
investments, and you

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.760
are watching the monthly
updates of 30 companies.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.218
It's a great way
to build a network

00:13:20.218 --> 00:13:22.720
and get in the game for what
most people would consider

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.300
the price of one angel
investment, $50,000 or $60,000.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.440
So I try to outline all
of that in the book of how

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.850
to slowly learn how to do this.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.060
And I think it's probably
the most exciting career

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.109
you could have.

00:13:35.109 --> 00:13:37.150
You get to hang out with
the smartest people, who

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.620
want to change the
world, and meet them

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:43.330
when they have 1 to 10
employees in their company.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.520
It's pretty exciting,
I have to say,

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.130
and even if you lost
half your money doing it,

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.820
you'd be losing half of say
5% or 10% of your net worth.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.350
The network and
the knowledge you

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.570
would build during
that time would easily

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.404
make up for that 2.5%
of your net worth.

00:13:57.404 --> 00:13:59.320
HEATH ROWE: You're
smarter, bigger regardless.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:13:59.670
JASON CALACANIS: Yeah.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.060
And [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:00.880
HEATH ROWE: That's
one of the things

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.700
I liked most about the book
was the kind of attitude

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.890
of democratizing
angel investment.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.800
You mentioned earlier today
that there's a couple hundred

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.115
angel investors in the valley.

00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:12.490
But this is saying that grandma
can be an angel investor.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.580
A college student can
be an angel investor.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.950
Talk us through some of
the steps or the advice

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.905
that you would give people.

00:14:19.905 --> 00:14:23.049
JASON CALACANIS: Yeah, So I
think it's purposely opaque.

00:14:23.049 --> 00:14:25.090
We have a very unfair
system in the United States

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.240
where there's two classes of
people, accredited investors

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.040
and non-accredited.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.847
People who make
over $200,000 a year

00:14:31.847 --> 00:14:34.180
for a couple of years in a
row are considered accredited

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.170
if they have $1 million
or $2 million in cash.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.200
You can look it up
on the SEC's website.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.760
And then the other
95% of America

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.650
are considered non-accredited.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.100
But those 95% can go to Vegas
and bet on a sports team,

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.280
or they can play in their local
poker game, or they can buy,

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.240
you know, they can do whatever
they want with their money,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.152
using bad judgment, good
judgment, et cetera.

00:14:54.152 --> 00:14:56.110
They could even buy stocks
in the public market

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:59.632
without having to
check with anybody.

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.840
But the idea of investing
in private companies, which

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.330
is where ultra wealth is
created, really outsized

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:06.720
outcomes, is very--

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.530
there's nowhere you can
have these kind of odds

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.020
to get these kind of
returns except in Silicon

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.340
Valley and startups.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.360
So I think that we'll
see that change.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.940
It's in Europe,
which is interesting,

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.606
because it's a pretty
protectionist kind

00:15:19.606 --> 00:15:22.470
of vibe over there obviously.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.037
They allow everybody to invest
their money however they want.

00:15:25.037 --> 00:15:27.120
So here in the United
States, we have a little bit

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.820
of history of not trusting
people with their own money,

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:30.990
but that's unraveling.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.510
It's good intention, but now
they have some actual equity

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:36.840
crowdfunding, websites like
SeedInvest and Republic

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.730
are taking companies
and allowing

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.860
them to raise money
from civilians,

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.480
non-accredited
investors for $500.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.340
So I look at it and
say, you know what?

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.881
I see people out
there spending money

00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:48.510
on all kinds of dopey stuff.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.150
I think making investments in
startups would be a lot better.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.390
And if you were to ask
all of the Etsy sellers,

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:57.780
early Etsy sellers, hey,
you're not accredited,

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:01.030
but we have 5,000
creators on the platform.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.360
You could each invest up
to $1,000 in the platform.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.890
How many of them
would have done it?

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.900
And what kind of wealth
would be created?

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.506
EBay, same story, think
about all the AdSense

00:16:09.506 --> 00:16:10.630
partners in the early days.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.150
If you had told me
when we were in Gadget

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.380
is AdSense going to work?

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.180
I was like, well, we're
making $3,000 a day

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.240
off of it 10 years ago, I
would have made that bet

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.440
and bought pre-public
Google shares for sure.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.480
But that opportunity
wasn't open to me.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.280
I wasn't accredited
yet at that time.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.040
I was negative $10,000
actually in my bank account.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.390
So I was stuck.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.610
So I'm hoping that
all changes over time,

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.240
and since I wrote the
book, it's been 25 days,

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.850
we had 1,200 people in
our angel syndicate,

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.940
and we've had 700 more joined.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.280
So we're averaging something
like 30 people a day

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.584
applying and then accepting
maybe half of them.

00:16:46.584 --> 00:16:48.750
And so I think this is going
to change in a big way.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.850
A company Cafe X, which
I'm an investor in,

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.440
which is a robot
a coffee machine,

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.960
who has raised two, not
equity crowdfunding,

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.290
but two syndicates of note,
like upwards of a million

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.530
from investors
$10,000 at a time.

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.640
Now, we have hundreds of
investors on that [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.250
table under one
umbrella, my syndicate.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.220
And all of those people
get to participate.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.220
I'm super proud of that.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.710
If that becomes a unicorn,
and those people turn $10,000,

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.140
and it goes 100x,
I mean, I would

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.780
be super excited to see
people become millionaires

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.870
or to generate that
kind of wealth.

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:24.869
And I've seen it happen.

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:27.990
I mean, in Silicon Valley, I
see people who are pretty dopey

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.570
make angel investments and
make millions of dollars

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.390
pretty regularly.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.050
And it should be
open to more people,

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.330
and most people have
a good eye for this.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.340
If you were to ask anybody
who was on LinkedIn

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:43.260
in the first two years who were
recruiters, or HR executives,

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.880
those HR executives
and recruiters

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.470
who would normally
not have access

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.790
had the inside information.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.130
They knew that LinkedIn
was going to become

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.050
a very significant platform.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.300
The early creators
on YouTube knew

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.050
that it was going to
be something special.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:59.280
It was obvious to them, but they
could not participate into it.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.980
And Chad would have absolutely
allowed YouTube creators

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.092
to invest if that was allowed.

00:18:04.092 --> 00:18:06.300
And that's what we're slowly
starting to have happen.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.850
It started last June.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.142
And it's been a year.

00:18:09.142 --> 00:18:10.850
The companies that
are doing equity crowd

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.170
funding I would say are the--

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.170
in some cases, the ones
that didn't clear market

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.174
with venture capitalists angels.

00:18:18.174 --> 00:18:19.590
But I think that's
slowly starting

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:23.876
to change where the scariness of
doing something new, like angel

00:18:23.876 --> 00:18:26.250
with syndicates was very new,
and people were very scared

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.170
of it, that's flipped over.

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.010
So if everybody were to
invest 5% of their net worth

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.610
in startups, I think the world
will get better a lot quicker,

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.330
it would create a lot
more jobs, and we'd

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:37.955
see a lot more problems
getting solved.

00:18:37.955 --> 00:18:40.410
So I actually believe that
this is something bigger

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:41.470
than just making money.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:42.730
I think it's making
change in the world.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.270
If you think about all the
great change that's occurred,

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.940
it's because some angel
investors supported

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.390
some crazy kids who had some
crazy idea, whether it was

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:55.020
Larry and Sergey, or Chad,
and the team at YouTube,

00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:00.180
or Snapchat, and they all needed
some small amount of money

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.080
to get going.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.850
And these experiments
are worth trying,

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:07.380
and if you lose, you know,
6, 7, 8, or 9 out of 10 bets,

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.280
and the last bet returns more
than 10x, you're in the black.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:16.320
And just as a gambler myself,
as a semi-professional gambler,

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.680
in fact, like high
stakes gambler in poker,

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.600
it's very hard for people
to deal with losing

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.850
six or seven hands in a row.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.410
Anybody here play poker?

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.300
Anybody here ever lose
seven or eight hands

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.820
in a row when they
were the odds favorite?

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.410
Yes, people are
raising their hand.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.810
I mean, it's going to happen
one out of every 500 games

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:37.950
you play, right?

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.750
And when you're not ready for
it, you stare at the ceiling

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.139
and go, how did I lose
all of those hands?

00:19:43.139 --> 00:19:45.180
I lost six hands in a row
that I should have won.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.520
It's a very odd feeling.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.929
That's actually normal
for angel investing

00:19:49.929 --> 00:19:50.970
if you're doing it right.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:57.600
Like when I introduced people
to Uber, 17 of 22 or 23,

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.870
only three people said yes
out of maybe 20 or 25 people

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:01.890
I introduced them to.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:03.806
And we're talking about
the greatest investors

00:20:03.806 --> 00:20:05.390
in the world said no to Uber.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.930
And they said no
two or three times.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.510
And the three people
who said yes all

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.760
have nine-figure positions.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.917
And the people who said no, some
of have 10-figure positions.

00:20:15.917 --> 00:20:18.250
Some of the people said no,
just every time they see me,

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.583
they go, I should have listened.

00:20:19.583 --> 00:20:23.797
And the list of reasons of why a
startup will fail is very long.

00:20:23.797 --> 00:20:26.380
And the list of reasons of why
it will succeed are very short.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.250
And so what I've learned to do
is work against my natural--

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:34.330
our biological nature is to be
conservative as humans, right?

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.684
If you were to swim
across the river,

00:20:36.684 --> 00:20:39.100
the river might take you, or
the alligator might take you.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.440
Or if you go over the hill,
the lion might eat you.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.610
We are conservative
animals for good reason.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.750
But we don't need to be
conservative in this aspect

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:48.250
of our life.

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:49.620
We should be risk taking.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.820
But risk taking is
something that people just

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.700
don't have in their DNA.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.191
So you have to unlearn what
your DNA is telling you.

00:20:56.191 --> 00:20:57.440
You should be taken this risk.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.315
There is no crocodile
that's going to eat you

00:20:59.315 --> 00:21:00.357
if you lose your $10,000.

00:21:00.357 --> 00:21:01.731
You're just going
to lose $10,000

00:21:01.731 --> 00:21:02.960
and make it back next month.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.960
So don't worry about it.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.300
It's fine to burn that $10,000.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.180
It's a worthwhile risk.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.461
And people overestimate the
downsides so much it's crazy.

00:21:10.461 --> 00:21:11.960
HEATH ROWE: Let's
unpack that a bit.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.050
So when you're looking
at an opportunity,

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:17.480
what characteristics or
qualities do you look for?

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.770
And the question beyond
the question, what

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:24.254
makes you push past that fear?

00:21:24.254 --> 00:21:25.170
JASON CALACANIS: Sure.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.590
Yeah.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.860
So I usually do make that
long list of reasons just

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:30.985
to get it out of my system.

00:21:30.985 --> 00:21:33.276
And then I just take it, and
I cross it out, or rip it,

00:21:33.276 --> 00:21:35.860
because I assume that a smart
founder will get through those.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.740
And you have to ask yourself,
not what could go wrong,

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.300
but what could go right.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.200
What could go right
for the company?

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.570
And if those things are even
a 1 in 100 chance, or a 1

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:50.620
in 50 chance of it going right,
if the odds payoff higher

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.490
than that, it's worth doing.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.350
And so that's kind of how I look
at the entire world right now.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.120
I've changed my whole thinking.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.530
I tend to bet on people.

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.650
And I am good at
reading people, and I

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:06.850
think the biggest mistakes
I've made in investing, which

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:10.630
were Tesla, Twitter, and Zinga,
I wasn't an angel investor

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:13.420
at the time, but my friends
were starting those companies,

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.180
and I could have
invested in each of them,

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.130
and it would have been a $50
million return on average each,

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:20.980
based on the checks size I was
writing shortly after that.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.070
And in every case,
with Twitter it was--

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:29.400
I just thought Twitter was
such a terrible idea, because I

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.132
sat there with Evan and Biz.

00:22:31.132 --> 00:22:32.590
And I said to them
like-- they were

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.810
like, hey, look just
take your BlackBerry out,

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:36.847
and we'll text 40404.

00:22:36.847 --> 00:22:39.430
And you say what you're having
for breakfast, and Biz is going

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:41.110
to say what he's having for
breakfast, and Ev says what

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.730
they're having for business,
and all of our phones go off,

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.800
and it was an SMS
service at the beginning.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.880
There were no apps.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.744
And I was like,
oh, my god, Evan--

00:22:48.744 --> 00:22:50.000
this is Evan Williams--

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.250
I was like, this is so stupid.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.770
Nobody cares what Biz is
having for breakfast or what

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.510
we're having for breakfast.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:58.240
And you just cost me like $0.04.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.610
I'm going to run through
my whole SMS plan.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:02.590
And there's no blog post here.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.700
You created Blogger.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.084
You sold it to Google, right?

00:23:05.084 --> 00:23:06.250
People wrote their thoughts.

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:07.450
It was full thoughts.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:08.617
And now you're saying just--

00:23:08.617 --> 00:23:10.866
it's the same as blogger
except without the blog post.

00:23:10.866 --> 00:23:11.900
It's just the title.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.010
HEATH ROWE: And now
it's back to medium.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:13.930
JASON CALACANIS:
Right, and I was

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.013
like, you realize that if
this succeeds it's going

00:23:16.013 --> 00:23:17.560
to be a cacophony of idiots?

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.430
Like literally everybody
who can't put together

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:24.580
a blog post, which
is only 400 words,

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.650
they're going to write
140 characters instead

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:28.936
of 140 or 300 words.

00:23:28.936 --> 00:23:30.310
Every idiot in
the world is going

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:32.290
to be on this thing all
day saying stupid things,

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.373
and it's going to be getting
magnified like crazy.

00:23:34.373 --> 00:23:36.700
I was absolutely right.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.194
And it cost me $50 million.

00:23:38.194 --> 00:23:39.610
So then I realized,
you know what?

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.020
I don't have to know.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.480
If there is a Jason's
law of angel investing,

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.060
it's I don't need to know if
your idea is going to succeed.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.020
I just need to know if
you're going to succeed.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.870
So since I started that
approach to angel investing,

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.980
which is does this
person have passion?

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.370
Do they have skill?

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.220
Do they understand how to
build a product and a team?

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.600
I look for those traits.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.510
And when you ask people
questions, short questions--

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:02.650
what are you working on?

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:04.084
Why will this idea work now?

00:24:04.084 --> 00:24:05.500
Has something
changed in the world

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.150
that makes this idea work now?

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.150
Or tell me about
the product design.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.302
Or why are you doing this?

00:24:11.302 --> 00:24:13.760
Just like literally pointing
out one feature of the product

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.270
to say, what does this
syndication thing,

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:18.850
this little snippet here on
YouTube, why is that important?

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:21.430
Like if you were
to ask Chad early

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:24.044
that, he was like, oh,
because people want

00:24:24.044 --> 00:24:25.210
to put videos on their site.

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:26.240
There's no easy way to do it.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.448
They have to put up a server.

00:24:27.448 --> 00:24:30.550
So if they put this JavaScript
into their blogger, dotcom

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:32.627
account, they could put
a video on their site.

00:24:32.627 --> 00:24:33.710
Oh, why is that important?

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.419
Well, because it's
free marketing for us.

00:24:35.419 --> 00:24:37.126
We're giving them free
hosting of videos.

00:24:37.126 --> 00:24:39.050
They give us free marketing
to their audience,

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.925
and we're going to grow
the service that way.

00:24:40.925 --> 00:24:44.430
That was the why now
syndication and cloud computing.

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:47.470
So I now have three
or four founders

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:51.797
who are creating products
that I invested in

00:24:51.797 --> 00:24:53.380
after investing in
their last company.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.810
So Raul created a
company called Rapportive

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:57.160
that people may have used.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.810
That was that little
sidebar in Gmail

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:00.710
that told you
everybody's social stats,

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:02.680
and this is their Twitter
handle, and here's

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.280
a bunch of information on them.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.350
He sold that to LinkedIn.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.558
Now, he's doing something
called superhuman, which is

00:25:07.558 --> 00:25:09.424
like a better Gmail, I mean--

00:25:09.424 --> 00:25:10.840
well, anyway, I
don't want to make

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.357
anybody feel bad in the room.

00:25:13.357 --> 00:25:15.940
But it's kind of like nobody's
taking on Gmail in a long time,

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:16.440
right?

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.920
It feels like Gmail is like--

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.990
it was so radical when
it came out 15 years ago.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:23.602
So he's kind of taking
an approach of--

00:25:23.602 --> 00:25:25.560
the same approach that
Gmail took towards email

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.110
of like a radical email client.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:28.870
And so when he
sold Rapportive, I

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:31.700
made two or three times
my money, and I told him,

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:32.650
hey, this is fine.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:33.730
I'd rather we don't sell.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:36.460
But OK, you've got
four co-founders.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.080
I only ask one thing, Raul.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.420
When you have your
next idea, you call me,

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.430
and I can be the first investor.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:43.000
He called me.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.320
I put a million dollars in.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.340
I joined the board.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:46.270
Boom, we're off to the races.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:47.590
This has happened
like three times

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.840
now where somebody who I
invested in who got a single,

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.690
or double, or lost my
money, we come back.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:53.390
We do it again.

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:57.100
So I'm investing in arc
of a founder's career.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.740
And I think that's the way to--
that's, in my mind, the best

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:00.294
way to do it.

00:26:00.294 --> 00:26:01.960
If you know somebody
is a winner, if you

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.460
know they work, if you
know they're passionate,

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.168
if you know they're
not going to give up,

00:26:05.168 --> 00:26:07.390
these are the qualities
of the founders who win.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:08.530
They won't give up.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.110
They have skills, and they
have passion for the space.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:15.130
If an intelligent
person wakes up one day

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:17.850
and realizes how
hard it's going to be

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.110
and how much sacrifice
there is, and they're not

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:23.080
passionate about the idea,
the rational thing to do

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.080
is to quit and say, this
is going to be too hard.

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.890
You have to really, really care
to blow up two or three rockets

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.840
and still go to work
the next day, you know?

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.980
Elon is a close
personal friend of mine.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.785
When he blew up the second or
rather rocket, I mean, it was--

00:26:38.785 --> 00:26:41.620
you know, I think that was--

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.060
that pushed him to the brink.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.490
I mean, he was really,
really focused.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:47.920
But he wasn't going to give up.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.640
It strengthened his
resolve, if anything.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.410
And now you watch these idiots
on Twitter, back to Twitter,

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.920
a cacophony of idiots,
like criticizing the Model

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.120
3 for it being like a couple
of weeks late or something,

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.990
and can he hit the numbers?

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.190
I mean, I was just driving
the car for a couple days

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.690
last week.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:06.550
It's got a 300-mile range.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.650
It drives like a Porsche.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:11.330
These idiots are
still doubting him.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.120
It's like, did you not--

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.280
have you not been
paying attention?

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:15.780
These guys--

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.084
HEATH ROWE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:18.084 --> 00:27:20.500
JASON CALACANIS: Literally,
there were always these haters

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.900
out there and doubters,
who throw rocks

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.720
at these companies who are
trying to change the world.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:30.360
And literally, if Elon
succeeds, no more smog,

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.470
energy independence
from dictators

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:35.950
who won big swaths of fossil
fuels, global warming,

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:41.080
like free transportation
eventually, no more road deaths

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.490
because of self-driving.

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:44.602
There's this whole swath
of incredible things

00:27:44.602 --> 00:27:45.310
that will happen.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:49.150
So it's so amazing to
me how people could not

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:51.640
be positive about what's
happening in the world

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.280
where everything is trending
so much in the right direction.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.534
And there are small
issues here on the sides

00:27:57.534 --> 00:27:58.450
that we have to solve.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:27:59.324
Some of them are big.

00:27:59.324 --> 00:28:05.410
But I look at them all as
incredibly solvable, incredibly

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:09.970
solvable, including jobs,
including environmental issues.

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:11.410
I think we can
solve all of them.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:17.170
It's a lack of positivity and
a lack of paying attention

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:19.210
to what's happened to date.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.220
We seem to solve a
lot of the problems

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.920
that we face as
humanity if we are

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.460
indefatigable and
clever in our approach,

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.380
and we're a clever species.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.630
HEATH ROWE: Well, let's talk
about the people building

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:33.213
that better world,
because the book is

00:28:33.213 --> 00:28:36.517
written kind of in the guise
of how to become an investor.

00:28:36.517 --> 00:28:38.350
But it would also be
really useful to people

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:40.640
who want to build a company
that others would invest in.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.100
JASON CALACANIS: That's
what it's really about.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:42.730
HEATH ROWE: Talk about that.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.080
JASON CALACANIS: Yeah, well
as a founder, you know,

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.181
everybody is trying to figure
out how to hack investors.

00:28:48.181 --> 00:28:50.680
The whole point of Y Combinator
for the last couple of years

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:55.990
has been how to manipulate and
get an edge on the investors.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.940
And I think it's
the wrong approach.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.981
I think they've realized
it's the wrong approach,

00:28:59.981 --> 00:29:01.700
because you're really
in it together.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.790
You don't want to try
to trick the investors.

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:05.470
So people are
constantly asking me,

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.450
how do you get an
investor to invest?

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.526
And it's like, well, if
you have a great team,

00:29:09.526 --> 00:29:11.150
and a great company,
and great product,

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:14.320
and customers who love you,
and some level of traction,

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.750
you're going to
meet 100 investors.

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:19.300
And eventually six or
seven of them will invest,

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.790
and then it's that simple.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.760
But they're trying to figure
out how to hack the investment.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.830
Instead of trying to hack the
investment, how about hacking

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:30.170
the usage and the engagement
level of your customers?

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:34.000
So if you had 100 units of
work, this idea of spending

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.180
90 units on hacking the
investor community, which

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:41.290
is a pretty sophisticated group
of people to try and hack,

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:42.940
why not spend those
90 cycles trying

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.580
to triple the engagement of
your current customer base

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:49.750
and then explain with the last
10 units of energy, here's

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.870
what we did to increase
engagement and tell that story?

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.330
So I think this is
the rookie mistake.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:59.380
It's just too much gaming
of the investor community

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.180
and trying to figure
out how to hack it.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.740
And what are they thinking?

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.676
It's pretty simple
what they're thinking.

00:30:04.676 --> 00:30:07.200
Does this person
have the ability

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:12.189
to build a team that can build
a product that delights users?

00:30:12.189 --> 00:30:13.980
And if they can get
that product to market,

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:16.740
you've built that credibility.

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.200
And to think it's going to
happen after one meeting is

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.340
probably silly.

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.150
Like it usually
happens over five,

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.440
six, seven meetings
an email update.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:29.340
So I'm so pro this monthly
update that I require it

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:32.232
for my investments, because
the first 100 investments

00:30:32.232 --> 00:30:34.440
I did, I didn't require them
to send monthly updates.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.467
Now, in my legal documents,
I require a monthly update.

00:30:37.467 --> 00:30:39.300
That starts with the
most important metrics.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.454
How many months of
run we need to have,

00:30:41.454 --> 00:30:42.870
how much cash is
left in the bank,

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:44.661
when do we need to
raise money next, what's

00:30:44.661 --> 00:30:47.250
the revenue, what's
the user engagement.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.950
And so I've been making
this a requirement,

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:53.220
because so many founders
don't send these updates.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.170
And then they don't
have the opportunity

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.120
to raise money from the
investors who they have already

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.203
convinced to put money in,
because those investors

00:30:59.203 --> 00:31:00.240
lose faith.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.480
What I tell founders now is,
if you want me to invest,

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.690
so many deals coming
at me right now,

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:08.670
put me on your monthly
update for three months.

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:10.628
I'll read your monthly
updates for three months

00:31:10.628 --> 00:31:12.180
before I invest,
and then I'll decide

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.596
like looking at your monthly
update when it's right for me

00:31:14.596 --> 00:31:16.980
to invest, when it's
in my Goldilocks zone.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:18.780
And so the best thing
the founders can do

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:22.560
is really understand what
that investor is invested in

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.810
and what their
timing typically is.

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:27.410
There are investors who like
to invest when the company is

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:29.790
worth a $1 million or
$2 million before it

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.390
launches their product, because
they're product driven people.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.181
They make products.

00:31:33.181 --> 00:31:35.657
So they want to be involved
in the product creation,

00:31:35.657 --> 00:31:37.740
and they want to be there
for the day it launches.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.770
There is other people who want
to be there right after it

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:41.700
launches, like myself.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.940
I want to see six weeks of data.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.830
There are other people who
want to see two years of data,

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.210
you know, VCs typically.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:51.160
And you just have to
know your audience.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.800
And so I get monthly
updates more consistently

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.740
in some cases from companies
I passed on investing in

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.140
than the ones I did invest in.

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.360
Literally, I have somebody who
was sending me legal documents

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.870
to sign for an approval of
a Silicon Valley bank loan

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:07.800
and credit facility.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.490
You know, when
you're an investor,

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.800
you have to sign off on
these future investments.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.450
And I'm like, I haven't
heard from you in 18 months.

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:13.300
What's going on
with the company?

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.130
It's explaining
everything that occurred.

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.200
I am like, you could've just
done this monthly or whatever.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.325
HEATH ROWE: Don't catch up.

00:32:19.325 --> 00:32:21.580
JASON CALACANIS:
Yeah, It's just weird.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.620
So I think the monthly
update puts people

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.190
on this cadence where they
can build trust and build

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.480
credibility with investors.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.260
And that's what
you're really trying

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.676
to do with those
investors is just

00:32:32.676 --> 00:32:35.520
trying to build this
sense that you're credible

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.844
and you're not stopping.

00:32:36.844 --> 00:32:38.760
Like when people get the
sense that you're not

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.910
going to give up and that this
train is leaving the station,

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.554
and they can either
get on it or not,

00:32:43.554 --> 00:32:45.345
that makes it a very
attractive investment.

00:32:45.345 --> 00:32:47.760
It's like, this person's
not going to give up.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:52.440
And that's a-- at least you
know that your money didn't

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.951
get burned without
people even trying.

00:32:55.951 --> 00:32:57.450
It's nice to know
that people tried,

00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.158
and I don't mind people
losing the money,

00:32:59.158 --> 00:33:00.940
as long as they tried hard.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.070
That's really the goal.

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:07.290
HEATH ROWE: You've lived in
New York for many, many years.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:08.855
You've lived in
Southern California.

00:33:08.855 --> 00:33:10.230
JASON CALACANIS:
30 and 10, yeah.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:11.975
HEATH ROWE: And
now San Francisco.

00:33:11.975 --> 00:33:13.350
JASON CALACANIS:
For three, yeah.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:15.979
HEATH ROWE: How do the
business communities differ?

00:33:15.979 --> 00:33:18.270
How does being an investor
in those communities differ?

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:19.890
JASON CALACANIS: Sure.

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:23.589
You can build a great company in
those three cities, no problem.

00:33:23.589 --> 00:33:25.380
A great founder will
build a great business

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.670
in those three cities.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:28.045
If you're in
Southern California,

00:33:28.045 --> 00:33:29.419
or if you're in
New York, you are

00:33:29.419 --> 00:33:32.040
going to have less competition
as a founder for talent.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.630
Talent will stay longer.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:35.730
Cost will be a third less.

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:36.855
Those are all great things.

00:33:36.855 --> 00:33:38.604
You're going to have
to come to the valley

00:33:38.604 --> 00:33:39.630
to meet with investors.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.004
And those investors
will not mind

00:33:41.004 --> 00:33:42.720
going to New York
or Los Angeles,

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.140
because they are awesome cities.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.999
And if you were to
rank the three cities,

00:33:45.999 --> 00:33:47.790
New York is the greatest
city in the world.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:51.210
Los Angeles is probably the
better lifestyle and very

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:53.820
similar to New York, as people
who have lived in both cities

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:54.765
will say.

00:33:54.765 --> 00:33:57.090
And San Francisco is
the worst-run great city

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:57.680
in America.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.250
It's just horribly run.

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:02.910
It's completely dysfunctional
and like can't even

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:04.150
solve minor issues.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:07.650
So it's pretty tragic in a way.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:09.870
But if you're a founder
there, obviously you

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:12.719
have access to a
wider talent pool.

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:14.520
I wouldn't say
necessarily better.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.469
But the costs are ridiculous.

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:18.770
It's really like
showstoppingly bad.

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:21.150
So the high art
I think right now

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:24.239
is to put your headquarters in
Silicon Valley in a wee work

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:26.520
office and then have
everybody in Arizona,

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.969
or Los Angeles, or San Diego,
or have your team at Waterloo

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:30.690
doing your code.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:32.100
HEATH ROWE: So have a
mail drop in the valley.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.933
JASON CALACANIS:
Basically, it's like having

00:34:33.933 --> 00:34:37.165
this little headquarters in
the valley until you can get

00:34:37.165 --> 00:34:41.250
valley VC to put a series A in.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.820
Your chances as an angel
investor in hitting a unicorn

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.340
are greatly reduced
outside of Silicon Valley

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:48.570
just statistically.

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:49.449
Everybody knows that.

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:52.290
And if you look at the $100
billion, the $50 billion,

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:55.020
or $100 billion
outcomes, those almost

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.180
universally come
from Silicon Valley.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:01.620
You do have Amazon and Microsoft
as the two notable exceptions,

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.054
and you have Snapchat down here.

00:35:03.054 --> 00:35:04.470
But Snapchat might
be a $5 billion

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:07.980
company, not a $10
billion plus company.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.730
So what I say in the book
is to be a great investor,

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:12.560
do you need to be
in Silicon Valley?

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.980
The answer is yes.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.040
Now, you could go there.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.640
So I've lived here and
was going up their weekly.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.600
And that was a lot of work.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.320
But that's how I did
investing, and I hit four

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.030
of the six unicorns doing that.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:28.400
So just going up
there and going up

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.590
for two days,
three days a month,

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:32.690
you have a chance to just
book all your meetings

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.290
and get it done that way.

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:37.162
So there's something very
special about the community

00:35:37.162 --> 00:35:38.870
up there, but you see
something very nice

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:40.036
happening down here as well.

00:35:40.036 --> 00:35:42.680
And I think the
question is will those

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.266
people who make
money off of Snapchat

00:35:45.266 --> 00:35:46.640
or working for
Dollar Shave Club,

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.260
will they become angels or not?

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.750
And will they start investing
in this community or not?

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:52.010
And that's what
happened in New York.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:53.884
You know, the "Silicon
Valley Reporter" days,

00:35:53.884 --> 00:35:55.490
there weren't that
many investors.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:58.296
Things started to work out, and
you had some of like Kevin Ryan

00:35:58.296 --> 00:36:00.920
from DoubleClick, who had made
a ton of money, launch "Business

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:07.720
Insider" and a DNA
company, a CDN company,

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.960
I can't remember the name
of it, that did very well,

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.290
and he also did a
flash site sale.

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:14.480
So he was just investing
in everything there.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.110
And you start to see that cycle.

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:19.745
I think actually [INAUDIBLE],,
was at Ziff Davis in New York,

00:36:19.745 --> 00:36:22.370
and then they did [INAUDIBLE],,
and they started a venture firm

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:24.140
that invested in "Buzzfeed,"
and "Huffington Post,"

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.320
and all that kind of stuff.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.778
So you see that
renewal happening--

00:36:26.778 --> 00:36:29.310
new firms and new
individuals in those cities.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.630
So Stockholm is
another crazy example--

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:34.960
nine unicorns out of Stockholm.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:35.550
It's crazy.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:37.221
How did that happen?

00:36:37.221 --> 00:36:38.720
I've been asking
for an explanation.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.966
Nobody can give it to
me except that they

00:36:40.966 --> 00:36:43.340
work really hard over there,
because there's no sunlight.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.040
HEATH ROWE: Long winters.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:44.720
JASON CALACANIS: Long winters.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.380
They just work for
12 hours a day,

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.588
but you know, there were
nine that came out of there,

00:36:48.588 --> 00:36:50.340
which is pretty amazing.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.942
So innovation can
come out of any place.

00:36:52.942 --> 00:36:54.650
How are things going
here after the memo?

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:55.460
I'm curious.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.010
Are we allowed to lot of
talk about that or not?

00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:59.593
I was like, what
should we talk about?

00:36:59.593 --> 00:37:01.610
They are like Google
Memo, Uber, and Benchmark.

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:04.040
They are like, those are all
the controversial topics.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.467
HEATH ROWE: Well, to sidestep
that question entirely--

00:37:06.467 --> 00:37:07.550
JASON CALACANIS: Go ahead.

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:09.091
HEATH ROWE: --let's
talk a little bit

00:37:09.091 --> 00:37:11.000
about growth and optimism.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.541
JASON CALACANIS:
Growth and optimism.

00:37:12.541 --> 00:37:15.497
HEATH ROWE: What areas do you
see nascent opportunity in?

00:37:15.497 --> 00:37:17.330
We've talked a little
bit about free energy.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:18.590
We've talked about robotics.

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:22.220
JASON CALACANIS: Yeah,
well, in our industry,

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:26.030
we always have false starts,
and so if you think about VR

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:29.420
as an example, how many
people remember VRML,

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.070
the Virtual Reality
Markup Language.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.611
There was like, literally, we
were going to through the Yahoo

00:37:33.611 --> 00:37:35.390
index and be like,
flying through in 3D,

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:38.740
and like picking arts and
leisure, photography, nudes,

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.390
you know, whatever, like
pulling out the folders.

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:43.670
And it was going be this
incredible gyrolinear world,

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:46.610
and it never happened.

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:48.226
Now, you put an
Oculus on, and you're

00:37:48.226 --> 00:37:51.200
like, wow, that's incredible,
but still hasn't happened.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.440
Like when is that going
to happen exactly?

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.000
VR might be a false
start right now.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.120
The headsets seem
extremely expensive,

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.010
and it might still
be four or five years

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:03.900
away before we have 100
million people using it, right?

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.380
You really need to have
tens of millions of people

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.621
to possess the technology
in order to have 10 million

00:38:08.621 --> 00:38:11.120
use it in a day, and that's
when you sort of hit the tipping

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:11.619
point.

00:38:11.619 --> 00:38:13.484
Now, AR feels a
lot closer, right?

00:38:13.484 --> 00:38:14.900
So that's something
where it feels

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.691
like you could have 10
million people a day

00:38:16.691 --> 00:38:19.010
using it two years from now.

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:22.591
And so I do think there's
something there with AR and VR,

00:38:22.591 --> 00:38:24.090
whether it's two,
three, four years.

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.750
So that would make it a good
time to start investing,

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:29.280
but people who invested two
years ago in VR companies,

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.870
those companies are running
out of money right now.

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.360
And they're desperate,
because they

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:36.080
thought they would be selling $5
million worth of software apps,

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.910
and they're selling
$50,000 a year.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:42.309
And it's like really
early adopters.

00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:44.100
AI was one we had a
lot of false starts on,

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.740
and now it's not a false start.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.290
So I've been pitched on
six or seven companies that

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:52.520
are taking AI into human
resources, customer support,

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.930
legal, and it's pretty
obvious that like,

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:59.600
I don't know, 60%,
70%, 80% of legal docs

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.060
that have been created, you
should just be able to be like,

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.060
OK, Google, I need a
nondisclosure with Jason that

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.144
says this, this, and this.

00:39:06.144 --> 00:39:08.310
And then it's just like,
OK, we sent it over to him.

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.550
And then I get it, and
OK, I sign it, and boom.

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:15.080
Like, we could do most
contracts that way.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.260
And so white collar
jobs like that I

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.586
think are going to be at risk
in the next 10, 20 years,

00:39:20.586 --> 00:39:22.460
because it's going to
be so easy to do things

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:26.214
like contracts or
accounting, you

00:39:26.214 --> 00:39:27.380
know, these kind of things--

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.020
AI is for real, obviously.

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.891
And you guys all know
that from DeepMind

00:39:30.891 --> 00:39:32.390
and the impact
that's going to have.

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:33.770
And that's a horizontal impact.

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:35.930
So when you have
something like AI

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.695
and machine learning
hitting at this pace,

00:39:38.695 --> 00:39:40.070
and people learning
about it this

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:42.547
quickly, and implementing
it, tensor flow,

00:39:42.547 --> 00:39:44.630
all of this other stuff,
like, it's getting easier

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:47.000
to implement Watson, et cetera.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.770
So that means
you're going to have

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:50.570
a whole group of
entrepreneurs being backed

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:59.690
by angels to try to redo every
vertical to make it AI enabled.

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:02.330
If you look at Google Photos,
I think it's a great example.

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:04.304
Google Photos is just
anticipating what I want.

00:40:04.304 --> 00:40:06.470
I don't know if anybody
works on Google Photos here,

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:11.240
but high five to you
guys crushing it.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.300
I'm like, I download
Google Photos

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:14.509
for my phone like for a year.

00:40:14.509 --> 00:40:17.091
People are like, you have to get
Google Photos on your iPhone.

00:40:17.091 --> 00:40:18.410
I'm like, no, I don't.

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:19.610
I got iCloud.

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:20.360
I'm paying for it.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.151
And then I get Google
Photos, and I'm like,

00:40:22.151 --> 00:40:23.270
oh that's pretty dope.

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:25.270
It's telling me I should
check out these photos,

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:26.690
and it's telling
me, look here we

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:28.160
made a video for you, because
we know you like videos.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.090
It's kind of scary.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:32.720
It's figuring out what I like
and delighting me every day,

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.779
and it's obviously using
machine learning and AI

00:40:34.779 --> 00:40:35.570
to figure that out.

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:39.120
It can only get scarier
and better as time goes on.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.790
So I think that's pretty real.

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:43.370
And I think robotics is the one
that was another false start.

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:46.520
We had all of these
Roombas, and Segways,

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:50.600
and other robotic-ish
devices, hardware devices,

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:54.560
that were going to change
the world and didn't.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:59.060
And now I have two startups
that are using robotics

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:03.140
in a way that are
truly disruptive.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.580
The Cafe X one is a
robot a coffee machine

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.490
that maybe you'll see
here in Google one day.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:11.750
I wouldn't be surprised
if you saw it here.

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:14.300
And it's two Coca-Cola
machines wide.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.247
It's got the arm, and
it makes your coffee,

00:41:16.247 --> 00:41:17.330
and it makes it perfectly.

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:18.590
And you can order
it on your phone.

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:20.660
It knows the distance
you are from the machine.

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.690
So it makes your coffee
in under 60 seconds.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:23.940
It gets it perfect every time.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.619
It remembers your
last instructions.

00:41:25.619 --> 00:41:26.660
I want this type of milk.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:27.701
I want this type of bean.

00:41:27.701 --> 00:41:29.140
I want this type of caffeine.

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.380
I want this temperature.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:32.270
You can really dial it in.

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.784
You pick it.

00:41:32.784 --> 00:41:33.450
You go order it.

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:34.580
It hands it to you.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.820
It takes under 45 seconds.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.650
And so the idea of
waiting at intelligentsia

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:43.340
for how long to get a coffee?

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.590
That's about 20 minutes.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:48.920
They have the same Intelligencia
beans in their machine now,

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.560
and you'll be able
to, every airport,

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.350
every two gates there'll
be a Cafe X machine,

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:56.810
and it will cost one-third
less to get a cup of coffee,

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:58.850
and it will take 19
or nine minutes left.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:41:59.840
Everybody has been
in that position

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.298
where there's like a line for
coffee, and you just give up.

00:42:02.298 --> 00:42:05.251
So the idea of people
making coffee for a living--

00:42:05.251 --> 00:42:06.750
a robot should be
doing that, right?

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:07.700
It doesn't make much sense.

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.658
Unless you want to have
the charming experience

00:42:09.658 --> 00:42:14.195
of a barista with suspenders
and a big mustache.

00:42:14.195 --> 00:42:16.070
That will still exist
somewhere in the world.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:17.810
And then this other
company Blockable

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:19.514
is making modular housing.

00:42:19.514 --> 00:42:20.930
And they're going
to use robotics.

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:22.460
So you are going to be able
to take out your phone or iPad

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.850
and be like, I just bought this
lot over here in Culver City.

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:27.830
And I need a house that's
like this dimensions,

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:29.240
and I want to have it delivered.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.656
And the robot is
going to make it.

00:42:30.656 --> 00:42:33.604
HEATH ROWE: It's like prefab,
modular, robot-made housing.

00:42:33.604 --> 00:42:34.520
JASON CALACANIS: Yeah.

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.890
And so it may be
the same price--

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:39.850
$200, or $300, or
$400 a square foot,

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:45.530
but it may take out six months
or 12 months of time to build.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:48.410
Or then eventually it might
cost less actually too.

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:50.300
Or it might cost
10%, 20%, 30% less,

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.820
but the time savings will be
where the real savings is.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.861
And then they might have
four of those factories.

00:42:54.861 --> 00:42:56.690
So depending where you
live in the country,

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:58.400
you know, it could
be conceivable

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.780
that you order a nanny
unit or an in-law unit,

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.581
I think they call them, in the
back of your place in Culver

00:43:05.581 --> 00:43:06.080
City.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.577
And it's outside your
house in two days.

00:43:08.577 --> 00:43:10.160
HEATH ROWE: So you
order the addition.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.540
You laser cut the new door.

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:13.456
JASON CALACANIS: Boom,
and then like literally

00:43:13.456 --> 00:43:15.720
like the crane drops
it in your backyard.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.620
So housing and coffee
are like two areas

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:21.540
where robotics specialized
are going to do really well.

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:25.190
So I really believe
in looking at areas

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:28.220
where we had false starts,
because if you think

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:31.291
about going back to
YouTube as an example,

00:43:31.291 --> 00:43:32.790
there were hundreds
of startups that

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:34.400
tried do video on the internet.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.700
But the reward for putting a
video on the internet back then

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:42.140
was you would, if it went
viral, you got a $5,000 bill.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.667
And then the video
got turned off.

00:43:43.667 --> 00:43:46.250
Some people in the room might
be too young to experience this,

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:48.890
but it was often that you
would go to a website that

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:51.650
went viral, and it
would say, this user

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.260
has used up their bandwidth
cap, and therefore, you

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.560
can't see the blog
post for the video.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.080
HEATHE ROWE: You couldn't
afford to be successful.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.329
JASON CALACANIS: You couldn't
afford to be successful.

00:43:59.329 --> 00:44:03.770
And because of cloud computing,
just Stephen and Chad

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:05.300
had this like vision
like, wow, it's

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.490
cheap enough where we're
kind of in that range

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:09.680
where we can kind of let
people host for free.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.800
The idea that you
could put a video

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.550
online without putting
your credit card in

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:13.460
was kind of crazy.

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:15.920
Now, it's like, 4K video,
uploaded to Google, free

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.710
forever, uploaded to
iTunes, almost free forever,

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:22.830
like we've come a
long way in 10 years.

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:24.650
So I like to look
at those spaces

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:27.680
where people try
try, try, and tried.

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.590
And that's one of the things
that investors totally,

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:33.770
by and large, mess up.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:36.770
They always look at their
personal history and knowledge

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:40.350
of the space, and they
correlate that with, oh,

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:41.350
it hasn't worked before.

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:42.410
Therefore, it won't work.

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:44.750
Google was the 11th
or 12th search engine.

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:46.670
It was just 20 times better.

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:49.010
PageRank was just
that much better.

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:50.890
The algorithm was the why now.

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:53.030
It's this very
complex algorithm that

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:56.720
really made the results
demonstrably better.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.770
And somebody taking
another swing at bat

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:02.960
at an idea that
became $100 million

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.920
or a billion-dollar
company is worth it.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:08.490
And we saw that with WebVan
versus now InstaCart,

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:12.750
and other Google,
Amazon Prime Now.

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:15.157
Google has-- I don't
what it's called in--

00:45:15.157 --> 00:45:17.240
I don't know if you have
the Google delivery here.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.060
Do you have the Google?

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.090
HEATHE ROWE: I think we--

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:20.190
JASON CALACANIS:
Shopping Express up here?

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:21.356
Or is just in San Francisco?

00:45:21.356 --> 00:45:22.014
It's here too?

00:45:22.014 --> 00:45:24.180
Yeah, so like all these
things that we're using now,

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:28.170
UberEats and PostMates, these
were things that were tried--

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:34.350
Cosmo, Urban Fetch, WebVan,
and now just GPS, logistics,

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:37.179
robotics, all of this stuff
has gotten so much better

00:45:37.179 --> 00:45:38.470
that it's actually working now.

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:40.345
And they're to figure
out the unit economics,

00:45:40.345 --> 00:45:42.160
and it's going to
change the world again.

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.618
HEATHE ROWE: It's
kind of replaying

00:45:43.618 --> 00:45:45.830
the hype cycle for new
appetite, and new timing,

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.010
and new position.

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:47.820
JASON CALACANIS: Look at gaming.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.361
We had this whole
thing on web gaming

00:45:49.361 --> 00:45:52.124
where casual gaming was
going to be a big deal.

00:45:52.124 --> 00:45:53.790
Then all of a sudden,
Facebook came out,

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:55.590
and social gaming
was a big revolution.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:58.020
Then apps were a big revolution.

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:01.200
So you keep having
these games, you know,

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.180
waves coming one
after the other,

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.890
and I think we'll
have that for AR.

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:10.149
I think there'll be an AR gaming
wave that'll be just crazy.

00:46:10.149 --> 00:46:11.940
When you put glasses
on, and like we're all

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.084
playing like zombie paint ball
around the office right now.

00:46:15.084 --> 00:46:16.500
HEATHE ROWE: We're
playing it now.

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.380
JASON CALACANIS: Exactly.

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.796
It's just some
people with glasses

00:46:18.796 --> 00:46:20.520
on are like watching
the zombies attack.

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.330
It's going to be a lot of fun.

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:23.871
So I think there's
going to be some--

00:46:23.871 --> 00:46:26.560
I think the AR stuff
is really interesting.

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.810
It's super, super interesting.

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:29.250
HEATHE ROWE: Can we open
up the floor for questions?

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:29.670
JASON CALACANIS: Yeah, sure.

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:30.169
Yeah.

00:46:30.169 --> 00:46:32.940
HEATHE ROWE: Does anyone
have any questions for Jason?

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:33.840
We have a microphone.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.131
JASON CALACANIS: They're
going to throw the box at you.

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:42.410
There it is.

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:43.350
AUDIENCE: Sure, right.

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:49.380
So you mentioned that you
started off in journalism

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.975
and then broke into
investing, and you

00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:55.560
were doing it long distance
even from LA to Silicon Valley.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:59.610
How did you break into the
kind of bro MBA circles?

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:03.060
Because I guess investing must
be a pretty social activity.

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:07.470
JASON CALACANIS:
Yeah, Sequoia had

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:09.865
this idea that their
entrepreneurs, who

00:47:09.865 --> 00:47:11.490
they invested in,
and they had invested

00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:15.150
in our company, Mahalo,
which is now Inside.com.

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:19.500
They thought that it would
be really cool for founders

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.180
to scout out
investments for them,

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.890
and that's actually how I did
my first 15 or so investments.

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:27.524
So I was kind of pushed
into it by Sequoia,

00:47:27.524 --> 00:47:29.190
because they had this
idea to do scouts.

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:31.320
And then they kind
of created a monster,

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:33.460
and I started
doing it on my own.

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:36.750
But now, since that time, I used
to host something called Open

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:38.400
Angel Forum, which was just--

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.340
I would have a conference
room, and a law firm, or at

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.620
somebody's house, and
invite 10 angel investors

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:44.760
to see companies.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.920
And actually Thumbtack
and Uber both came

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.830
to Open Angel Forum, which
was AngelList, but in person.

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:54.330
And so now Angel List exists,
and these syndicates exist.

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:58.000
The best way to break in is to
just join as many syndicates

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:58.500
as you can--

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.620
Funders Club, AngelList,
SeedInvest, and just watch

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:03.300
the deal flow go by.

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.982
And then you could do
one of two scenarios.

00:48:05.982 --> 00:48:07.440
One, you could play
fantasy sports,

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.940
where you read the deal
memos, and you say,

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:11.940
I think this is going to
work for these reasons.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:14.340
I don't think its going
to work for these reasons.

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:17.240
And my conviction level
is between 1 and 10.

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.080
It's a 7.

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:22.590
And so I'm going to
pretend I put in $5,000.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:25.470
And I'm going to remind myself
every six months on this Google

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:27.699
sheet to check in on
the company's valuation

00:48:27.699 --> 00:48:29.490
and see if they raise
more money and to see

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:30.448
if I'm good at picking.

00:48:30.448 --> 00:48:33.294
And you could do it in a
"Moneyball" fantasy sports kind

00:48:33.294 --> 00:48:35.460
of way, which is what I
tell young people in college

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:38.820
is you're like creating
a virtual portfolio.

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:41.064
But now if you have a
little bit of money,

00:48:41.064 --> 00:48:42.480
I think doing this
micro investing

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.938
and putting real
money on the table

00:48:43.938 --> 00:48:47.850
will make your senses
go a little bit,

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:50.490
you know, just like
playing for money,

00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:56.490
changes it when you're playing
for pennies or for fake money.

00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:58.800
So I like the idea
of going to a casino

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.870
and playing poker for
$1, $2, while you're

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:02.120
learning, even though
you're going to burn

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.090
for a couple of hundred bucks.

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:04.950
You're going to play
these tournaments,

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:07.230
and you'll feel the
sting of losing your $40.

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:08.610
You need to have that pain.

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:12.542
So I like that pain
for you specifically.

00:49:12.542 --> 00:49:14.250
You look like you need
to feel that pain.

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:16.874
So I would say, just go on Angel
List, join all the syndicates,

00:49:16.874 --> 00:49:20.520
go on Seed Investor and all
syndicates, and trust your gut.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:24.300
Make 10 bets of $1,000 each,
and see how you wind up.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:27.180
Now, here's the secret.

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:29.380
Building networks is not
as hard as people think.

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:30.796
After you do those
10 investments,

00:49:30.796 --> 00:49:31.860
you put $1,000 in each.

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:35.580
Act as if you put $10,000 or
$100,000 in, which is to say,

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:36.840
email the founder.

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:37.890
Introduce yourself.

00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:38.994
Follow them on Twitter.

00:49:38.994 --> 00:49:40.410
Favorite and retweet
what they do.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:41.820
Look at their job board.

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:45.670
And check in with them every 60
days and say, how's it going?

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:47.010
Is there any way I can help?

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:49.710
And then find all your
co-investors in the company

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:52.140
by looking at Crunchbase,
or Mattermark, or any

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.300
of the publicly-available
places.

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.920
Put them in a Google sheet.

00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:00.540
And then email the hundreds of
them with a mail merge and say,

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:04.022
hey, I notice we're co-investors
in Acme Company together.

00:50:04.022 --> 00:50:06.480
I was wondering if you had any
interesting companies you're

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:07.810
looking at.

00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:10.680
I'm breaking into
angel investing.

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.251
And I'm investing in
this company next.

00:50:13.251 --> 00:50:15.000
So I started doing
that in the early days.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.020
I was telling people
like, hey, have you

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.360
seen anything interesting?

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.094
And literally, I
would do a mail merge

00:50:19.094 --> 00:50:20.760
like that, where I
would email 50 people

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.550
and say, have you met any
interesting companies?

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:24.956
Like one sentence.

00:50:24.956 --> 00:50:27.330
And I would say a half of the
time, people would respond.

00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:29.100
And then some people would
respond three or four times.

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:29.960
Yeah, I'm meeting
with this company.

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:30.960
I met with that company.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.330
People are more than
happy to share deal flow,

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:36.250
because in the early stages,
you need probably 30, 40,

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:40.000
50 investors before the company
gets ready for a series A.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.580
So if you're one
of the first 10,

00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:44.875
that means there's another
40 spots left to fill.

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:46.500
If you're investor
50, there might only

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.750
be a couple of investments left.

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:50.310
So that's how you
build that network.

00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:52.366
You just email your
co-investor and say,

00:50:52.366 --> 00:50:53.490
we're co-investors in this.

00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:56.855
That makes you like
family members.

00:50:56.855 --> 00:50:58.230
You're now on a
first-name basis,

00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:59.880
because you're both
invested in Uber together

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:00.921
or this company together.

00:51:00.921 --> 00:51:03.085
And what other deals
are you looking at?

00:51:03.085 --> 00:51:04.710
People really don't
understand how easy

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:06.936
it is to build a network
in today's environment

00:51:06.936 --> 00:51:08.310
with all this
information online.

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:09.155
It's super easy.

00:51:09.155 --> 00:51:11.280
AUDIENCE: Does that mostly
work when you get a hit?

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.696
It's not really
your [INAUDIBLE]..

00:51:12.696 --> 00:51:15.290
JASON CALACANIS: No,
because it's sort of like--

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:16.290
it's sort of like poker.

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:18.670
You ever get invited to a poker
game, and you're a bad player?

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:20.420
And you're like, why
are they inviting me?

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:21.990
It's like-- we need
some bad players.

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.860
HEATHE ROWE: I think
they want your money.

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:23.370
JASON CALACANIS:
They want your money.

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:25.650
No, but also, you need
to fill a table, right?

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:26.910
So we need to fill a table.

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:29.592
We have a company Cafe
X that's just starting.

00:51:29.592 --> 00:51:31.050
We need to raise
a million dollars.

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:32.400
We have $400,000 in.

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.542
We don't care what
that next $600,000 is.

00:51:34.542 --> 00:51:36.000
When it's that
first round, we need

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.412
to get that $600,000 so they
can prove out in 18 months

00:51:39.412 --> 00:51:41.870
that this is a possibility that
they can build the machine,

00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:43.910
that they can get
to $1,000 a day

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:45.960
and profits, whatever it is.

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.950
And so, again, most
people overthink it,

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:51.080
and the whole industry
is cracked wide open,

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:54.734
because of AngelList, and
SeedInvest, and the reason

00:51:54.734 --> 00:51:56.150
I wrote the book
was really to try

00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:58.880
to inspire people to
get involved in it

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.500
and not overthink it.

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:05.610
Investing and losing 1% of your
net worth, if you learn a ton,

00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:07.762
it's going to be well
worth it in my mind.

00:52:07.762 --> 00:52:08.970
AUDIENCE: A quick follow up--

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:11.100
thinking about this.

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:12.830
On overthinking, do
you try to time it

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:15.792
in terms of, well, this thing--

00:52:15.792 --> 00:52:17.750
there's been not enough
false starts quite yet?

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:20.090
Or there's a paradigm
shift, and I really

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:22.490
should be looking
in this direction?

00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:25.510
JASON CALACANIS: Yeah, don't
overthink it is what I think.

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:30.170
To the Twitter
example, I understood

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:33.830
it could become a huge
cacophony of idiots.

00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:35.240
Yet I missed the obvious.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.940
If it does, who cares
if they're idiots,

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:41.060
or geniuses, whatever
it is, it's a big thing.

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:43.340
And big things in the world
generate tons of wealth,

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:46.430
and this thing also, in addition
to being a place for idiots

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:49.569
to spew hate, is a place where
revolutions can start, right?

00:52:49.569 --> 00:52:51.860
AUDIENCE: So you're saying
that if you don't personally

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.740
like something, that shouldn't
be a barrier toward--

00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.350
JASON CALACANIS: I think you
have to let go of your ego,

00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:59.240
and what you think
of the idea, and what

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.430
you think of the possibility
that it could work.

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:05.300
Now, if you're offended by
the existence of something,

00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:06.080
then I don't think
you should invest.

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:07.120
You're not enthusiastic.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.380
But I'll give another example.

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:10.850
I didn't have a chance
to invest in Airbnb.

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:13.520
But I thought when I
heard the Airbnb idea,

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.060
I literally said to people,
they were like, yeah,

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:17.060
you can rent your couch.

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:17.840
It's like couchsurfing.

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:19.670
So you let somebody
sleep on your couch.

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:21.635
And I'm like, like
a serial killer?

00:53:21.635 --> 00:53:23.510
So I'd let a serial
killer sleep on my couch?

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:24.670
They're like, no,
no, no, no no no.

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:26.128
They're all like,
it's a community.

00:53:26.128 --> 00:53:28.000
And I'm like, of serial killers?

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.529
They're like, no, it's not.

00:53:29.529 --> 00:53:31.070
Or you could stay
on somebody's couch

00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:33.597
for like $50 or $30
bucks, if you go to--

00:53:33.597 --> 00:53:35.180
if you couldn't
afford to go to Paris,

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:38.720
you could stay in Paris for
$30 on a serial killer's couch.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:41.249
Like how many people here
have stayed in an Airbnb?

00:53:41.249 --> 00:53:43.040
Raise your hand if you
stayed in an Airbnb?

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.100
It's everybody.

00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:46.580
How many people have hosted
somebody as an Airbnb host?

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.496
Raise your hand if you've
done an Airbnb host.

00:53:48.496 --> 00:53:49.060
One person.

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:53.416
OK, how do you--

00:53:53.416 --> 00:53:55.040
I could never have
somebody in my house

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:56.248
who I don't know and do this.

00:53:56.248 --> 00:53:58.280
Like I'm just not brave
enough to do that.

00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:00.440
And sure enough,
I was like, how do

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.294
you stop a meth head
from renting a place,

00:54:02.294 --> 00:54:03.710
and just tearing
it to the ground,

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:05.626
and ripping it apart,
and having a meth party.

00:54:05.626 --> 00:54:08.046
And sure enough, in a year
two of Airbnb, it was like,

00:54:08.046 --> 00:54:09.920
there was a meth party
at this woman's house,

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.180
and they took all
her photos, and they

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:13.640
made their own collages,
and put like, kill everybody

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:16.550
on the walls, and it was like
the most horrific horror movie

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:17.450
ever.

00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:19.474
And I was like, yep,
just like a hotel room.

00:54:19.474 --> 00:54:20.390
I was like, oh, I see.

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:21.860
I overthought it.

00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:26.210
Like there's 20 meth
parties going on right now

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:27.410
in hotels in Los Angeles.

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:29.040
We are not aware of them.

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:32.330
But this is what
people do in hotels.

00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:34.157
There's meth parties
going on, I guess.

00:54:34.157 --> 00:54:35.990
So of course it's going
to happen to Airbnb,

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.865
and there's whatever.

00:54:36.865 --> 00:54:39.470
So you have to be able to like,
again, write the long list

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:40.970
of why it's not going to work.

00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:42.344
There's going to
be a meth party.

00:54:42.344 --> 00:54:44.810
Or somebody is in it
tragically-- you know,

00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:46.880
a ride sharing service
is going to flip a car,

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.800
and people are going to die.

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.960
Or an airplane is going to die.

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.021
People are going to
die in an airplane.

00:54:53.021 --> 00:54:54.770
I just couldn't get
through it in my mind,

00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:57.950
so I think sometimes, taking
yourself and your understanding

00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:59.870
of the issue in the
market out of it

00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:01.737
and just looking
at the founder--

00:55:01.737 --> 00:55:02.570
are they passionate?

00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:04.490
And are they making
a great product?

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:07.073
If they're able to make a great
product, and their passionate,

00:55:07.073 --> 00:55:10.130
and they're smart, well, if the
product doesn't get that uptick

00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:12.440
from users, they're probably
going to pivot a bit

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.780
and figure out another product.

00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:18.830
Whereas a team of idiots who
have a great story about how

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:20.300
big the market
is, but they can't

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:23.970
build a really great product,
they're not going to succeed.

00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:25.387
They're just not
going to succeed.

00:55:25.387 --> 00:55:26.011
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:55:26.011 --> 00:55:26.620
Thanks.

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:27.500
JASON CALACANIS: I think
you have a question here.

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:28.240
HEATHE ROWE: You have
a hand in the back.

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.399
JASON CALACANIS: I'll
do shorter answers.

00:55:30.399 --> 00:55:31.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah, what
about the people

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:34.080
raising money with
virtual currency now?

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.050
JASON CALACANIS: It's
a great question.

00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:38.070
I have looked at the companies.

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:43.310
And I would say the first wave
of ICOs are extremely scary.

00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:47.570
It reminds me of the dotcom
bubble, so I'd be very careful.

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:50.480
People who have
crazy ideas, have not

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:53.510
built them, raising $30
million or $100 million,

00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:56.480
is a recipe for disaster.

00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.790
In the height of
the dotcom boom,

00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:02.630
we had people raising money or
taking companies public based

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:04.547
on the idea that they
would raise $100 million

00:56:04.547 --> 00:56:06.463
and then figure out what
to do with it, right?

00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:08.300
There was a company
called CMGI, I remember,

00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:09.530
that was like an incubator.

00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:11.960
And all these companies were
going public with the idea

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.692
that they would
create companies.

00:56:13.692 --> 00:56:15.150
So you have people
who are creating

00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:18.320
ICOs for products that don't
exist that are crazy ideas.

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.250
Will one of them work?

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:19.749
Sure.

00:56:19.749 --> 00:56:20.720
Will 99 of them fail?

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:21.890
Probably

00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:24.680
And then where is this
money coming from?

00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:28.070
And this money is dark money
from I think the crypto boom.

00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:31.430
So people have a ton of
Ethereum, or a ton of Bitcoin,

00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:34.370
and like, OK, I'll diversify,
so I'll buy all these ICOs.

00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:36.800
It feels like the ultimate
Ponzi scheme to me.

00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.090
It's real technology.

00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:40.520
It could have a real impact.

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.070
But this early cohort--

00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:45.050
I would not be surprised
if almost all of them

00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:47.520
went to zero, and all of
that money got burned,

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:50.372
and there were massive
lawsuits around it,

00:56:50.372 --> 00:56:52.580
and that there was massive
fraud occurring right now.

00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:57.680
I believe Bitcoin is probably
one of the most massively

00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:00.830
manipulated currencies in
the world or most manipulated

00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:02.160
things in the world.

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.730
What's to stop somebody from
creating 100,000 wallets,

00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:06.950
or 10 of us from creating
100,000 wallets each,

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:09.500
and moving a bunch
of bitcoins around

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.630
and making it look like
there's all this volume,

00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:15.140
and then making the
share price go up?

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:17.240
There's a lot of
ability to manipulate

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:18.980
anonymous currencies.

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:22.864
And the SEC is not very--

00:57:22.864 --> 00:57:25.280
we talked a little bit earlier
about non-accredited versus

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:25.850
accredited.

00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:31.330
The SEC, they do not have a--

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:32.870
what's the right way to say it?

00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:37.580
They're not looking
for creative solutions

00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:41.430
to be put into the market
with people's money at risk.

00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:42.320
They're risk averse.

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.930
Their whole reason to
exist is to protect people

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:47.862
from losing their money
and being tricked.

00:57:47.862 --> 00:57:49.820
These things seem like
people could get tricked

00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:50.945
and could lose their money.

00:57:50.945 --> 00:57:54.439
And then a lot of people are
like, it's not an offering.

00:57:54.439 --> 00:57:55.730
It's not like a stock offering.

00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:57.170
And then the people
buying it are buying it.

00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:59.060
When you ask them why
are they buying it?

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:01.420
They're saying, because it's
going to go up in value.

00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:03.920
If the people buying it
believe it's a security,

00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.900
and you are pretending
it's not while you're

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.970
cashing in tens of
millions of dollars,

00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:11.290
this is, I think, disingenuous.

00:58:11.290 --> 00:58:14.810
So some people who are
taking in the money in I know

00:58:14.810 --> 00:58:18.200
are doing things like
paying taxes on it,

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.570
saying it's future
revenue for software,

00:58:20.570 --> 00:58:22.372
because this is our
API calls or whatever.

00:58:22.372 --> 00:58:24.080
So they're actually
going pay their taxes

00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:27.260
on it-- pay as if it's profits
against software revenues.

00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:29.120
So I think that's smart.

00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:32.930
I do think that the fund,
having a venture fund, where

00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:36.800
the LP interests, the Limited
Partners are in coins and are

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.984
on a ledger, is inevitable.

00:58:37.984 --> 00:58:40.400
And that people will then be
able to trade their interest.

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.320
So if you were in
the Sequoia Fund

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:45.080
with Google at the IPO
or right before the IPO,

00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:47.450
and you wanted to sell your
shares to another person

00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:50.300
or your benchmark right now in
the Uber situation where Uber

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:52.650
and Benchmark are fighting.

00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:55.700
If Benchmark shares
were freely tradeable,

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:57.530
and the LPs could
trade them, well, they

00:58:57.530 --> 00:58:58.730
might liquidate right now.

00:58:58.730 --> 00:59:02.180
Or they might be wanting to
buy from another party, right?

00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.990
And so you would have
this more fluidity.

00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:06.830
So I do think that that will
come very quickly, like two

00:59:06.830 --> 00:59:09.500
or three years, and other
countries are going to lead it,

00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:11.791
because we are very conservative
when it comes to this.

00:59:11.791 --> 00:59:14.630
So I think
Scandinavian countries,

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:18.410
and Asian countries,
not companies,

00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:20.090
are going to be
very fluid with it.

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:24.830
But I'm monitoring it, because
you know, if you were a fund--

00:59:24.830 --> 00:59:27.920
if you have funds like
I have had, or have,

00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:30.300
it's an interesting concept.

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:33.630
I'm certainly a believer
in the technology.

00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:35.550
But I also saw a
lot of companies,

00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:38.150
I think, in that group,
that I just thought,

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:40.885
they could not clear a market
with the venture community.

00:59:40.885 --> 00:59:43.010
That doesn't mean the
venture community is perfect,

00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:44.190
or the angel
community is perfect,

00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:45.934
but they tend to know
what they're doing.

00:59:45.934 --> 00:59:47.600
And that machine is
a well-oiled machine

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.530
that knows how to take risks.

00:59:49.530 --> 00:59:51.890
So if the well-oiled
machine of Silicon Valley,

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:54.200
and venture money,
and angel money

00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:56.280
passed on investing
in these companies,

00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:58.760
and then they were able to
raise from dark pools of capital

00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:03.145
of unsophisticated
people, I don't know.

01:00:03.145 --> 01:00:05.270
I don't know if there's
that much wisdom in crowds.

01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:06.354
I'm very worried about it.

01:00:06.354 --> 01:00:07.728
HEATHE ROWE: I
think we have time

01:00:07.728 --> 01:00:09.040
for a couple of more questions.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.200
Do you have a question?

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
actually had a couple.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.700
The first one was
on average, how many

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.920
of your initial investments
significantly change

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.960
product direction?

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.470
Like prototyping stage
or initial customer base.

01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:25.800
And then another
question would be,

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.620
how many investments have
you made or do you usually

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:32.610
see where you're investing
in someone who's also like,

01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:34.110
for example, like
working at Google,

01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:37.440
but has legal acceptance to
work on a product on the side,

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:41.460
or maybe any of the big
five and have done very well

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:44.884
those companies, and they
later on quit, of course?

01:00:44.884 --> 01:00:46.425
And then maybe just
how do you see it

01:00:46.425 --> 01:00:48.847
in terms of Southern California.

01:00:48.847 --> 01:00:50.430
Excluding Silicon
Valley, where do you

01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:54.702
see Southern California against
the other cities in the US?

01:00:54.702 --> 01:00:56.160
JASON CALACANIS:
Yeah, so we talked

01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.640
before, technology and talent
can come from anywhere.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.679
And I think Southern California
is so close to Silicon Valley,

01:01:03.679 --> 01:01:05.970
and the people in Silicon
Valley, especially investors,

01:01:05.970 --> 01:01:07.803
and people who live
there, are kind of tired

01:01:07.803 --> 01:01:09.180
of Silicon Valley.

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:11.430
It's pretty horrible to
live there right now,

01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:14.340
because of cost, because of
homelessness, because of crime.

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:16.860
It's much better to
live here, to be honest.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.260
It's a much better lifestyle,
like five times better.

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:20.801
So I think you have
a lot of them who

01:01:20.801 --> 01:01:23.034
are moving down here
and a lot of people

01:01:23.034 --> 01:01:24.450
who are willing
to move down here,

01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:26.580
because it's literally like--

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:28.160
it's like a borough, right?

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.790
It's a one-hour flight.

01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:33.930
So your question about
people doing their side

01:01:33.930 --> 01:01:37.695
hustle, I think most investors
like to see a clean break,

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:39.570
because they want to
know that you're all in.

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:42.330
So I generally don't invest
when people are doing

01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:44.190
those kind of side hustles.

01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:46.890
Even if they have permission,
we want to get a clean break,

01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:48.900
know you're full time
on it, and then make

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.660
the investment, but willing
to meet and see the prototype.

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:54.030
But I've been in a
lot of cases where

01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:56.940
people have those side hustles,
and they've got permission

01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:00.240
from their manager, and
then the big five company

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.280
is like, yeah, we're
going to pull you back in,

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.988
because we kind of
like your side hustle,

01:02:03.988 --> 01:02:05.770
and let's get that
back in the company.

01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:08.640
So because those big five are
so competitive with startups now

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:11.670
and aware of the
startup ecosystem,

01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:13.320
I think a clean break
is the wisest way

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.630
to go if you want to
raise some serious people.

01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:20.550
And most companies
pivot here and there.

01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:24.510
The term pivot used to mean
taking what you've learned

01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:27.290
and changing your
direction slightly.

01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:30.840
One foot staying where it is,
and then you're moving around.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.930
The word pivot somehow meant
dropping the existing idea

01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:36.500
and coming up with a
completely different idea.

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:39.330
That's not the term
pivot as we all use it.

01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:40.830
But people are like,
we're pivoting.

01:02:40.830 --> 01:02:44.455
And pivoting now in Silicon
Valley means this failed.

01:02:44.455 --> 01:02:45.330
Now we're doing this.

01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:47.100
That's not pivoting.

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:50.580
Pivoting is we were
going to go and do

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:52.770
video for the enterprise.

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:55.890
But then we found this
new class of prosumers.

01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:58.650
So we're kind of going
to make it prosumerwear.

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:01.080
It's free for most people and
paid for the elite people,

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.913
but it's not going to
be an enterprise video

01:03:02.913 --> 01:03:05.857
solution anymore, because
we realize the enterprise,

01:03:05.857 --> 01:03:07.440
you know, they like
to roll their own.

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.220
That would be a pivot.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.750
You're staying in
the same vertical.

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:11.708
You're shifting the
customer base a little bit.

01:03:11.708 --> 01:03:13.990
But the product and everything
is in the same zone.

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:16.560
So that happens in
almost every company

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.714
where you learn as you go.

01:03:17.714 --> 01:03:18.630
Very few get it right.

01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:23.160
In fact, if you look at
Uber, is going into ride

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.830
sharing an Uber pool, a pivot?

01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:29.100
No, but maybe in the
classic term it was.

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.690
We started with black cars--

01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:32.670
Lincoln Town Cars,
expensive cars.

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:34.560
We pivoted to ride sharing.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.580
We added it.

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:40.260
You know, we moved our
focus over a bit to it.

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:44.310
So I think it depends on which
definition of pivot you're

01:03:44.310 --> 01:03:46.480
going with.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:50.100
But there are people like
Stewart Butterfield who

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:52.110
did Flicker after doing
a failed video game

01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:54.990
and did Slack after doing
a failed video game.

01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:58.080
I mean, basically, if he
does another video company

01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.790
I'm investing, it's
just for the pivot.

01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:02.139
HEATHE ROWE: He did a
really good video game.

01:04:02.139 --> 01:04:04.430
JASON CALACANIS: The video
game will never be released,

01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:06.120
and a billion dollar
company will come out

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.495
the other side
that has something

01:04:07.495 --> 01:04:10.907
to do with the team that's
building the failed video game.

01:04:10.907 --> 01:04:12.740
Like the second he
succeeds at a video game,

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:13.740
I'm going to be worried.

01:04:16.339 --> 01:04:18.880
HEATHE ROWE: All right, is the
fellow in the back still here?

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.760
It doesn't look like he is.

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.142
I think that's all the
time we had for questions.

01:04:23.142 --> 01:04:24.600
JASON CALACANIS:
Thank you so much.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.224
If anybody wants me
to sign their book,

01:04:26.224 --> 01:04:27.700
I'm willing to do that as well.

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.825
HEATHE ROWE: All right,
thank you very much, Jason.

01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:31.430
[APPLAUSE]
