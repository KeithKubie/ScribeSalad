00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.960
You're spinning and I'm spinning and the Earth
is spinning and the sun is spinning and the

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.540
solar system and the WHOLE DAMN GALAXY.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.680
BUT WHY!

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:20.650
You might remember from our "How Fast Is the
Universe Moving" video that you're moving

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.930
really fast right now.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.340
For example, the Earth is rotating around
it's axis at 1,040 miles per hour (465 m/s).

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.340
Planets rotate.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.340
That's what they do, right?

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.230
But then science comes along and asks WHYYY…
and once you start thinking about it, it's

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.230
staggering.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.879
To figure it out, we have to go back to the
beginning.

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.730
Four and a half billion years ago, our solar
system began to form from clouds of helium

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.610
and hydrogen -- kind of like a nebula.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.110
As the gas was moved and undulated through
the universe, some of it was denser and some

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.110
thinner.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.780
Something, perhaps a nearby supernova, caused
the gases to begin to coalesce, and as the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.680
gravity of these particles increased, they
fell toward each other -- and began to spin.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.710
Funnily enough, every time this happens, the
spin rotates the same direction, counter-clockwise.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.150
There's no UP in space, of course, but if
you think about the angular moment of the

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.910
spin as a FORWARD direction, then most things,
Earth, Mars, the Sun… they all rotate counterclockwise.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.350
Because they're all conserving their angular
momentum.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.030
As the gases continued to gravitate toward
each other, constantly moving, they formed

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.980
a tossed pizza dough shape.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.360
A ball in the middle, slowly expanding outward
into a disc.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.390
This is the shape we see most often in the
universe, because of the laws of physics.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.550
As interstellar clouds rotate and collapse
onto themselves they fragment, according to

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.030
Scientific American, and then those smaller
parts collapse again, and again.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.570
And over the next few hundred million years,
all that gas gathers and fuses into suns,

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.060
planets, asteroids and (eventually, after
lots more time) you and me!

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.870
All the while, the angular momentum of the
original cloud it maintained; that original

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.810
gaseous angular momentum set the stage for
all the rotation to follow -- inertia keeps

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.810
it going.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.460
Yes, it IS slowing over time.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.289
A day in 100 years will be 2 milliseconds
longer, but ultimately we'll all keep spinning

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.000
unless something big smacks into us.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.850
Strangely, Venus rotates clockwise, and we're
not sure why.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.090
Either the axis of the planet was flipped
upside down at some point, or it slowed rotating

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.850
counterclockwise, stopped and began to rotate
the opposite -- possibly due to its dense

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.069
atmosphere and closeness to the sun.

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.650
It's not the only weirdo; Uranus was knocked
on it's side, her rotation is ALL screwed

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.650
up.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.570
Even on a macro level, everything is spinning.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.390
But galaxies, relative to Earth, spin both
clockwise and counterclockwise.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:51.970
Though spiral galaxies DO tend to spin with
their arms trailing behind them, but even

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.420
that isn't a hard rule.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:02.099
In 2002, the Hubble spotted galaxy NGC 4622
whose arms LEAD her rotation, but they believe

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.980
it's because it interacted with another galaxy.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.980
Sounds hot.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.410
In the end, everything in the universe is
spinning.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.680
Energy must be preserved over time; so when
a figure skater spins with his arms in, he'll

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.340
spin faster, but with his arms out he'll move
slower.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.670
That's simple physics, but it operates on
a galactic level too!

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:57.180
Does a science question have your head spinning??
