TODD: Hello, YouTube
audience and welcome

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.330
to yet another
episode of "Game On!"

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.540
I know it's been a while
since our last one,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.980
and I've missed you.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.840
So I'm glad we have this time
together to chat about games.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.980
I'm Todd Kerpelman.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.030
I'm on the developer relations
team on Google Play Games.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.970
And, in real life, my
forehead is not this shiny.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.530
I swear it's the
lighting in the studio.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.960
Anyway, we're going to move
on and talk about this week's

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.540
episode, which is the Play
Games half-birthday party.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.700
If you weren't aware,
Play Games Services

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.280
launched at Google
I/O 2013, which

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.610
means it's just about six
months old as of today.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.630
So we're celebrating
with a party,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.730
except that I'm
the only one here.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.300
Wolff is out, and Dan's
gone, and Bruno's gone.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.790
So it's me here alone, sort
of like all my other birthday

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.290
parties.

00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:03.590
Oh, yeah.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.750
Dan, my producer is
here, so that's good.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.060
So it's double the size of
most of my previous birthday

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.780
parties, so that's kind of nice.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.350
Anyway, what better way to
kick off a birthday party

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.400
than with some stats, huh?

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.150
May explain why no one showed
up to my other birthday parties.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.024
Anyway, we're at
2,000 plus games

00:01:22.024 --> 00:01:23.690
that have integrated
Play Game Services.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.240
That's not bad for six
months, and that number

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.980
is continuing to grow.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.350
We are very excited about that.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.430
So, yay, there's our
stat for the week.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.871
And this birthday, we're going
to be giving gifts to you.

00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:39.370
Eh?

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.990
A little twist there.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.000
In terms of updates, so
there is a newest version

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.030
of the games' SDK if
you are using Android.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.310
I believe it's SDK number 13,
but not quite sure about that.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.190
I'm the iOS guy.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.230
You Android folks
are on your own.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.950
But you can download this, and
the version of Play Services

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.440
has already been pushed
out to devices everywhere.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.680
So feel free to start using it.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.620
If you are an iOS developer,
you can download SDK version 1.2

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.650
from the downloads page.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.300
And what is in these latest
and greatest SDKs, you ask.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.510
I'm glad you asked.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.060
It includes things
like score tag.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.740
This is basically a 64, or up
to 64, character URI safe string

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.700
that you can submit
along with any score

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.500
that you send down
to our service.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.560
In case you're
wondering what URI safe

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.970
is, I went and
looked up the RFC.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.300
And, basically, it's
alpha characters, digits,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.580
and four different
punctuation marks.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.590
And you can basically create
any kind of string you want

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.900
and send that down with your
score data to our servers.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.610
And why would you
want to do that?

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.310
Well, there's a
number of reasons.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.880
Partly, you might want
to use it for metrics.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.890
Maybe you're just
kind of curious

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.810
as to how people are
achieving these high scores.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.170
And so you might find out
what level they were playing

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.170
or what power-ups
they were using,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.380
or what boosts they had
enabled when they managed

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.040
to receive this
really high score.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.620
And so you can submit
that along with the score

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.510
and analyze that later.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.980
If you as a developer
just do a score.list

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.590
on your public
leader boards, you'll

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.020
be able to get the score
tag information along

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.900
with the scores
that get sent down.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.260
You could use it
to create a hash.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.570
Think about if you take
that score, maybe add

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.640
on some other kind
of string that's

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.340
semi-secret-- it'll
be on the clients,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.220
so it won't be completely
secret, but hard to dig up.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.670
Create a hash on that.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.850
You can then use that
as sort of a nice way

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.220
to verify that the score that
is being sent is legitimate.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.860
You could also link
to a database entry.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.640
Say you've got a game that
is primarily server-based.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.330
Your server is sort of the
primary keeper of truth,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.520
but you still want to submit
scores to our service.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.320
You can basically add a link to
a unique ID within your server

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.500
database that you
can then use later

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.930
to cross check and verify that
these scores are legitimate.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.780
And, finally, you could use
it to display custom user

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.080
messages.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.000
Maybe if you've got your own
way of displaying leader boards

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.750
within the game, you
might want to have

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.430
users pick their
own icon or taunt

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.340
message or something like this.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.080
I have a comment here just to
say be very careful with this.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.880
You don't want to just take
any user-submitted data, that

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.930
might be out of your control--
Lord knows what kind of stuff

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.550
your users are saying.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.760
In general, again, data created
by the client you should always

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.980
view it with suspicion
and do some verification.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.940
So I recommend rather than
letting users type in anything

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.270
they want, have a list
of preselected messages

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.459
that a user could pick.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.000
You can view that
later and show that

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.210
in your scoreboard of
the taunt or the thing

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.070
that your user wants to say.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.280
Anyway, this could also
be used in conjunction

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.830
with some of those management
REST calls that we talked

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.470
about last episode to write
your own anti-cheating script.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.770
So think about it this way.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.005
Let's say you use that
hash implementation

00:05:14.005 --> 00:05:15.920
that we talked about
in the previous slide.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.390
You create a hash
of the user score

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.160
before it get sent
down to our service.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.770
Then what you can
do on your side

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.480
is you can call it
scores.list, which

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.330
we'll get an entire list of the
users' scores along with all

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.680
the score tags.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.160
Iterate through those,
and check out those tags.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.140
Generate your hash on your side.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.560
See if that equals the hash
that you see in the score tag.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.770
And if it doesn't match, if
something looks suspicious,

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.780
you can call players.hide
to hide that player

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.450
from the public leader board.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.080
Combine all this,
make it a script

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.110
that your customer service
person runs once or twice

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.670
a day, and you've got a
very cheap and easy way

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.670
to keep your leader
boards clean.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.410
So definitely consider this
option, experiment around,

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.290
see what you can do.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.910
I think this can
be really useful.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.690
Next, we are giving
you the ability

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.384
to set absolute
achievement progress.

00:06:11.384 --> 00:06:12.800
This is something
that's available

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.030
right now on Android
and web only.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.030
We will be making progress
on other platforms soon.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.110
And what this means
is, basically,

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.300
if you call right
now, we have a way

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.060
that you can submit
progress towards incremental

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.430
achievements by essentially
submitting a delta.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.690
So you would say,
hey, this achievement

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.450
where I have to
shoot 100 spaceships.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.772
The user just shot four of them.

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.230
And so on our
service we would say,

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.780
OK, their total's now four.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.480
And you'd say, OK,
now they shot eight.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.420
And we'd say, OK,
the total's now 12.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.370
You'd say the user
blew up three more,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.870
we would record that as
15, and so on and so forth.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.390
All of the work to
keep track of this data

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.750
is being done on our servers.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.440
However, some
developers would rather

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.790
keep track of that
information on the client.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.850
And so we've added this call.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.970
It's the set achievement
steps call that basically

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.530
lets you submit the absolute
amount of achievement progress

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.640
you want to make
towards unlocking

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.000
an incremental achievement.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.630
So you'd say, OK,
the user has blasted

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.560
a total of two
spaceships, and then

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.060
they have blasted a total
of seven, 15, and so on.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.560
You'll notice in
that last row there

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.180
in the table we submit
18, and the service

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.210
keeps the last entry of 20.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.040
Basically, if you
submit a number that

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.480
is less than the progress
that we've already recorded

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.630
that will not go down.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.340
You can never lose progress by
calling a set achievement steps

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.290
call.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.882
So this is useful
one if you do want

00:07:46.882 --> 00:07:48.840
to have your client be
the main source of truth

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.220
for incremental achievements.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.760
It's also very useful for
seeking achievement progress.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.590
If a user is signed
into services,

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.560
but they've been playing on
your game for a while already,

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.280
and you're not quite
sure how to sync up

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.690
their progress between anything
you've recorded locally

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.990
and what's already
on service, this

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.610
is a cheap and
easy way to do it.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.170
You just say, OK, you know what?

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.410
I trust my client.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:15.450
I know that the user has blasted
43 spaceships on the client.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.110
I'll just send that
down to the server.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.270
And that will make sure
that the server is now

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.170
in sync with your client.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.890
We have added the ability
to call some of these V1

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:30.650
management calls from the client
on iOS, and of course web.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.200
So what does this mean?

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.179
This means that
within your game,

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:37.990
you can now create your own
little QA view controller.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.070
And, within there, you can make
some calls to, for instance,

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.270
here we set the scores
for that particular player

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:47.570
on a particular leader board.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.890
You've got your QA
person who has managed

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.770
to get some amazing
high score, possibly

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.460
by finding a bug in your game.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.504
And you want to make sure
they can reset and try again.

00:08:59.504 --> 00:09:00.920
See if they can
reproduce the bug.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.280
They can call this reset
call to reset that score.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.170
We also have a similar call
to reset an achievement.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.280
This is especially
helpful for testing.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.130
You've got your
QA person that is

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.460
trying to earn an achievement.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.070
They do it once.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.080
If they want to try
and do it again,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.810
the easiest way would--
again, from within your app--

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.900
set up something to
make this call directly.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.960
And we also have another method
to reset all achievements.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.230
Again, very useful for testing.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.610
Remember again that
these calls only

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:39.530
work if you're tester account
is listed in this testing access

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.530
part of the Development Console.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:47.416
So do make sure that your
QA people are listed here,

00:09:47.416 --> 00:09:49.040
because they will be
the only ones that

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.080
are allowed to make these
V1 management calls.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.810
Finally, there's a few
other fixes here and there

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:56.570
on the iOS side.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.400
We have made some
fixes to the widgets

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.066
so that they work
properly in iOs 7.

00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:03.690
There were some
crashing issues before.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:04.440
Sorry about that.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.620
Everything should be
good now in iOS 7.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.800
We've also added some fixes
so that the library behaves

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.120
better, if you're using that
as well as Google Analytics.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.390
On the Android side, there's
been a number of fixes

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.200
around multiplayer.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.700
Even if you're not
going to make use

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.830
of any of these other features
that we've talked about,

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.530
if you do have a
multiplayer game,

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.350
I strongly encourage you
to recompile your app

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.840
with the latest SDK.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.540
Because there are a number
of multiplayer fixes

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.170
that have been made that I think
will make your game better.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.060
And, finally, for those of
you who can't get enough of me

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.730
and are wondering, OK,
what happened to those iOS

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.270
screencasts that you were doing.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.340
Don't worry.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.510
There's more on
their way eventually.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.960
I'm still around.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.170
I just got pulled off onto a
top-secret project for a couple

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.430
weeks.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.440
And hopefully now
that that's over,

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.930
and I have a little more time
to think about games again,

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.250
I'll be getting back into
the screencasts, which

00:10:59.250 --> 00:10:59.792
will be good.

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:01.166
Except that my
hard drive's full.

00:11:01.166 --> 00:11:03.740
Video files, it turns out that
they take up a lot of space.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.549
So I guess as soon as I delete
some of those Steam games

00:11:06.549 --> 00:11:08.340
that are taking up all
my hard drive space,

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.630
I'll go and make some
more screencasts.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:14.070
So thanks very much, developers.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.670
I'm going to go off
and, I guess, sit

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.860
in the corner and drink
like all my other birthdays.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.120
And we'll see you
a couple weeks.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.670
Bye.
