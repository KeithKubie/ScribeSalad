00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
that but I guess how crystal clear it is
 

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.260 align:start position:0%
that but I guess how crystal clear it is
um<00:11:45.450><c> I</c><00:11:46.280><c> don't</c><00:11:47.280><c> know</c><00:11:47.430><c> what</c><00:11:47.610><c> they</c><00:11:47.700><c> did</c><00:11:47.880><c> but</c><00:11:48.060><c> I</c><00:11:48.090><c> mean</c>

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:48.270 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what they did but I mean
 

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.930 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what they did but I mean
it<00:11:48.360><c> just</c><00:11:48.480><c> looks</c><00:11:48.720><c> especially</c><00:11:49.680><c> clear</c><00:11:50.130><c> in</c><00:11:50.310><c> this</c>

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
it just looks especially clear in this
 

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.310 align:start position:0%
it just looks especially clear in this
movie<00:11:51.270><c> that</c><00:11:51.450><c> a</c><00:11:51.480><c> lot</c><00:11:51.630><c> of</c><00:11:51.660><c> our</c><00:11:51.840><c> effects</c><00:11:52.140><c> I've</c>

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
movie that a lot of our effects I've
 

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.690 align:start position:0%
movie that a lot of our effects I've

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
seen and it builds up to this climax
 

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:03.830 align:start position:0%
seen and it builds up to this climax
that<00:11:57.000><c> I</c><00:11:57.210><c> I</c><00:11:57.480><c> can't</c><00:11:58.200><c> go</c><00:11:58.590><c> that</c><00:11:58.950><c> much</c><00:11:59.370><c> into</c><00:12:00.470><c> I</c><00:12:02.840><c> guess</c>

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
that I I can't go that much into I guess
 

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.780 align:start position:0%
that I I can't go that much into I guess
I'll<00:12:04.140><c> say</c><00:12:04.380><c> this</c><00:12:04.530><c> a</c><00:12:04.740><c> lot</c><00:12:05.160><c> of</c><00:12:05.190><c> people</c><00:12:05.340><c> not</c>

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:05.790 align:start position:0%
I'll say this a lot of people not
 

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:06.740 align:start position:0%
I'll say this a lot of people not
knowing<00:12:06.090><c> the</c><00:12:06.330><c> books</c>

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:06.750 align:start position:0%
knowing the books
 

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.330 align:start position:0%
knowing the books
I'm<00:12:06.840><c> guessing</c><00:12:07.530><c> they</c><00:12:07.650><c> did</c><00:12:07.830><c> this</c><00:12:07.950><c> in</c><00:12:08.070><c> the</c><00:12:08.100><c> books</c>

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing they did this in the books
 

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.450 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing they did this in the books
but<00:12:08.820><c> not</c><00:12:09.030><c> knowing</c><00:12:09.390><c> the</c><00:12:09.480><c> books</c><00:12:10.250><c> might</c><00:12:11.250><c> be</c>

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
but not knowing the books might be
 

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.050 align:start position:0%
but not knowing the books might be
disappointed<00:12:12.180><c> in</c><00:12:12.270><c> the</c><00:12:12.330><c> climax</c><00:12:12.960><c> it's</c><00:12:13.320><c> both</c>

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:14.060 align:start position:0%
disappointed in the climax it's both
 

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.550 align:start position:0%
disappointed in the climax it's both
it's<00:12:15.060><c> both</c><00:12:15.180><c> giving</c><00:12:15.690><c> you</c><00:12:15.810><c> exactly</c><00:12:16.260><c> what</c><00:12:16.380><c> you</c>

it's both giving you exactly what you
 

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.890 align:start position:0%
it's both giving you exactly what you

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
same time and I think they might throw
 

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.910 align:start position:0%

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:35.910 align:start position:0%
quite work that way it's a little
 

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:41.690 align:start position:0%
quite work that way it's a little

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:44.430 align:start position:0%
what it does the climax but I think a
 

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.070 align:start position:0%
what it does the climax but I think a
lot<00:12:44.640><c> of</c><00:12:44.700><c> people</c><00:12:45.180><c> might</c><00:12:45.420><c> look</c><00:12:45.600><c> at</c><00:12:45.720><c> that</c><00:12:45.900><c> like</c>

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
lot of people might look at that like
 

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
lot of people might look at that like
well<00:12:46.230><c> hey</c><00:12:46.380><c> where's</c><00:12:47.540><c> where's</c><00:12:48.540><c> my</c><00:12:48.840><c> sort</c><00:12:49.530><c> of</c><00:12:49.650><c> real</c>

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:49.890 align:start position:0%
well hey where's where's my sort of real
 

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.950 align:start position:0%
well hey where's where's my sort of real
climax<00:12:50.430><c> that</c><00:12:50.520><c> I</c><00:12:50.670><c> wanted</c><00:12:51.240><c> my</c><00:12:51.420><c> serve</c><00:12:51.660><c> good</c>

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
climax that I wanted my serve good
 

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.580 align:start position:0%
climax that I wanted my serve good
versus<00:12:52.530><c> evil</c><00:12:52.680><c> it</c><00:12:53.460><c> kind</c><00:12:54.180><c> of</c><00:12:54.300><c> blurs</c><00:12:55.050><c> it</c><00:12:55.380><c> and</c><00:12:55.560><c> I</c>

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:55.590 align:start position:0%
versus evil it kind of blurs it and I
 

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.650 align:start position:0%
versus evil it kind of blurs it and I
think<00:12:55.680><c> it</c><00:12:55.950><c> does</c><00:12:56.130><c> it</c><00:12:56.280><c> in</c><00:12:56.400><c> a</c><00:12:56.520><c> very</c><00:12:56.550><c> clever</c><00:12:57.240><c> way</c>

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
think it does it in a very clever way
 

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.250 align:start position:0%
think it does it in a very clever way
that<00:12:57.690><c> hasn't</c><00:12:58.200><c> really</c><00:12:59.010><c> been</c><00:12:59.220><c> done</c><00:12:59.280><c> because</c>

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:00.260 align:start position:0%
that hasn't really been done because
 

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.900 align:start position:0%
that hasn't really been done because
it's<00:13:01.260><c> not</c><00:13:01.590><c> the</c><00:13:01.770><c> standard</c><00:13:02.130><c> formula</c><00:13:02.460><c> you</c><00:13:02.760><c> have</c>

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:02.910 align:start position:0%
it's not the standard formula you have
 

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.210 align:start position:0%
it's not the standard formula you have
to<00:13:03.060><c> know</c><00:13:03.180><c> going</c><00:13:03.420><c> in</c><00:13:03.720><c> this</c><00:13:04.020><c> is</c><00:13:04.080><c> your</c><00:13:04.440><c> climax</c><00:13:04.920><c> and</c>
