00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:10.130
Out of all the words that I dislike, the one
that makes me the most uncomfortable is “love.”

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.970
Hello all you crevice dwellers, Julian here
for DNews.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.160
Have you ever heard a word that gives you
the heebee jeebies?

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.660
Some word that you just can’t stand hearing
because you have a visceral reaction to it?

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.060
And I don’t mean because the word is overused
and abused, like literally or ironic, and

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.550
I don’t mean because it’s a swear or potty
talk.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.240
I mean a mostly innocent word, that’s minding
it’s own business doing it’s wordy thing,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.290
giving form to an idea, and you just hate
this thing.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.530
A word like…

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.530
Moist

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.290
A study published in PLOS ONE in April suggested
that 10 to 20% of you just cringed or even

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.180
felt physically ill when i said…

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.460
moist.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.230
This is what psychologists call word aversion,
the phenomenon when a word itself feels unpleasant

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.330
or disgusting.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.860
The reason for why certain words elicit that
response is still not fully understood but

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.629
there are a lot of competing hypotheses.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.290
One that was explored in the PLOS one study
was the idea that some words just have a bad

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.340
combination of sounds.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.479
They just don’t sit right when we say or
hear them, or even think about them.

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.979
Indeed participants in the study who were
moist averse were more likely to say this

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.600
was why they didn’t like moist.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.539
It was also speculated that the very face
shape necessary to make these sounds contributed

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.759
to how people felt about certain words.

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.829
They have an exceptional “mouth feel.”

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:24.970
But the results supported a different hypothesis.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.669
Namely that people don’t like the word because
of its connotation with sex, genitalia, or

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:30.959
bodily functions.

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:34.759
Across five experiments the results showed
that despite the reasons people speculated

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.240
they didn’t like the word moist, usually
they disliked words with related connotations

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.399
like damp or wet, especially after being primed
to think about sex or bodily functions.

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.989
They were even more OK with moist itself when
first primed to think about cake.

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:54.450
Meanwhile words with similar sounds like hoist
and rejoiced were rated as much more innocuous.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.960
Not all studies agree with these findings,
others have concluded that just the sounds

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.389
of certain words conjure up strange feelings.

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:02.899
Baylor College of Medicine neuroscientist
David Eagleman

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.250
conducted experiments using made up words
and found the sounds of some were rated as

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.329
more unpleasant by participants than others.

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:14.650
Dr. Eagleman suggests something akin to synesthesia
is at work, where senses blend together and

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.690
certain sounds cause a visual or emotional
reaction.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.049
This would help explain why many words with
a naughty association like panties are almost

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.549
vomit inducing to some, while totally innocent
words like crevice, ointment, and fiduciary

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.030
are repellant to others.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.750
But the science on word aversion is fairly
unexplored.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.189
Most of the data gathered has been in the
form of simple surveys asking people to rank

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.239
or list their least favorite words, and if
you couldn’t tell, I was trying to jam in

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.430
as many of those words into this episode as
I could.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.390
Moist sits atop the list though, dripping
down over the damp cornucopia of other repugnant

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.040
locutions below it.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.730
And its popular unpopularity gives rise to
another possibility: maybe all the moist hate

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.079
is just a fad.

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.760
Maybe so many people dislike moist because
so many people dislike moist.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.730
It’s become a cultural phenomenon at this
point, having appeared as a plot point in

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.730
a couple TV shows like How I Met Your Mother
and Dead Like Me.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.999
In a few years or decades maybe we’ll all
move on and irrationally hate some other poor

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:10.939
word that was just doing it’s job.

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.260
My vote is for “gorgeous.”

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.319
If you don’t like the word moist because
of its relationship with sex and sexuality,

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.569
Laci Green made many a great video for DNews
back in the day that may help you come to

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.569
terms with it.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:29.469
Like this one wherein she talks about literal
boners!

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:47.890
Are there any 
weird words you can’t stand hearing?
