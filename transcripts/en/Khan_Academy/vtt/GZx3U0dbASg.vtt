00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.630
My goal in this video
and the next video

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.210
is to start giving
a sense of the scale

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.529
of the earth and
the solar system.

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:09.945
And as we see, as
we start getting

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:11.444
into to the galaxy
and the universe,

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.860
it just becomes almost
impossible to imagine.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.050
But we'll at least
give our best shot.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.220
So I think most of us
watching this video

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.295
know that this
right here is earth.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.400
And just to get a
sense of scale here,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.380
I think probably
the largest distance

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.760
that we can somehow relate
to is about 100 miles.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.537
You can get into a car for
an hour, hour and a half,

00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:33.495
and go about 100 miles.

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:36.560
And on the earth that
would be about this far.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.480
It would be a speck that would
look something like that.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.690
That is 100 miles.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.660
And also to get
us a bit of scale,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.600
let's think about a
speed that at least we

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.940
can kind of comprehend.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.797
And that would be, maybe,
the speed of a bullet.

00:00:56.797 --> 00:00:58.380
Maybe we can't
comprehend it, but I'll

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.970
say this is the fastest thing
that we could maybe comprehend.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.129
It goes about-- and there are
different types of bullets

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.110
depending on the type of gun and
all of that-- about 280 meters

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:18.030
per second, which is about
1,000 kilometers per hour.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.360
And this is also roughly
the speed of a jet.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.170
So just to give a
sense of scale here,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.310
the earth's
circumference-- so if you

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:47.750
were to go around the planet--
is about 40,000 kilometers.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.070
So if you were to travel
at the speed of a bullet

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.570
or the speed of a jetliner,
at 1,000 kilometers an hour,

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.950
it would take you 40 hours
to circumnavigate the earth.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.289
And I think none of this
information is too surprising.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.296
You might have taken a
12- or 15-hour flight that

00:02:12.296 --> 00:02:14.170
gets you-- not all the
way around the earth--

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.210
but gets you pretty far.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.540
San Francisco to Australia,
or something like that.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.710
So right now these aren't
scales that are too crazy.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.000
Although, even for
me, the earth itself

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.510
is a pretty mind-blowingly
large object.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.270
Now, with that out of the way
let's think about the sun.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.020
Because the sun starts to
approach something far huger.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.810
So this obviously
here is the sun.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.660
And I think most
people appreciate

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.150
that the sun is much
larger than the earth,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.970
and that it's pretty
far away from the earth.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.110
But I don't think most
people, including myself,

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.170
fully appreciate
how large the sun is

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.930
or how far it is
away from the earth.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.180
So just to give you
a sense, the sun

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:07.040
is 109 times the
circumference of the earth.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.180
So if we do that same
thought exercise there--

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.300
if we said, OK, if I'm traveling
at the speed of a bullet

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.330
or the speed of a jetliner,
it would take me 40 hours

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.480
to go around the earth.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.190
Well, how long would it
take to go around the sun?

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.020
So if you were to
get on a jet plane

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.770
and try to go around
the sun, or if you

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.200
were to somehow ride a
bullet and try to go around

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.130
the sun-- do a complete
circumnavigation of the sun--

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.350
it's going to take
you 109 times as long

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.930
as it would have taken
you to do the earth.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.300
So it would be 100
times-- I could do 109,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.360
but just for approximate--
it's roughly 100

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.140
times the circumference
of the earth.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.840
So 109 times 40 is
equal to 4,000 hours.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.580
And just to get a sense of
what 4,000 is-- actually,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.430
since I have the calculator out,
let's do the exact calculation.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.516
It's 109 times the circumference
of the earth times 40 hours.

00:04:06.516 --> 00:04:09.140
That's what it would take to do
the circumference of the Earth.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.080
So it's 4,360 hours to
circumnavigate the sun, going

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.980
at the speed of a
bullet or a jetliner.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.100
And so that is-- 24 hours in
the day-- that is 181 days.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.100
It would take you
roughly half a year

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.530
to go around the sun at
the speed of a jetliner.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.870
Let me write this down.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.610
Half a year.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.420
The sun is huge.

00:04:41.627 --> 00:04:44.210
Now, that by itself may or may
not be surprising--and actually

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.350
let me give you a
sense of scale here,

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.550
because I have this
other diagram of a sun.

00:04:49.824 --> 00:04:51.240
And we'll talk
more about the rest

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.823
of the solar system
in the next video.

00:04:52.823 --> 00:04:56.379
But over here, at
this scale, the sun,

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.420
at least on my screen--
if I were to complete it,

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.220
it would probably be about
20 inches in diameter.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.069
The earth is just this little
thing over here, smaller

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:04.735
than a raindrop.

00:05:09.145 --> 00:05:11.520
If I were to draw it on this
scale, where the sun is even

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.990
smaller, the earth
would be about that big.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.400
Now, what isn't obvious, because
we've all done our science

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.060
projects in third and fourth
grade--or we always see these

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.420
diagrams of the solar system
that look something like this--

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.950
is that these planets
are way further away.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.650
Even though these are
depicted to scale,

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.840
they're way further
away from the sun

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.660
than this makes it look.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.350
So the earth is 150 million
kilometers from the sun.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.110
So if this is the sun
right here, at this scale

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.920
you wouldn't even be
able to see the earth.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.850
It wouldn't even be a pixel.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:13.269
But it would be 150 million
kilometers from the earth.

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:15.810
And this distance right here is
called an astronomical unit--

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.480
and we'll be using that
term in the next few videos

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.120
just because it's an easier
way to think about distance--

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.080
sometimes abbreviated
AU, astronomical unit.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.350
And just to give a sense of
how far this is, light, which

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.620
is something that we think
is almost infinitely fast

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.760
and that is something
that looks instantaneous,

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.840
that takes eight minutes
to travel from the sun

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.400
to the earth.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.000
If the sun were to disappear, it
would take eight minutes for us

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.540
to know that it
disappeared on earth.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.630
Or another way, just to put
it in the sense of this jet

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.750
airplane-- let's get
the calculator back out.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:07.080
So we're talking about
150 million kilometers.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.910
So if we're going at
1,000 kilometers an hour,

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.990
it would take us 150,000
hours at the speed of a bullet

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.170
or at the speed of a jet
plane to get to the sun.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.630
And just to put
that in perspective,

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.690
if we want it in days,
there's 24 hours per day.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.610
So this would be 6,250 days.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:33.410
Or, if we divided by
365, roughly 17 years.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.530
If you were to shoot a
bullet straight at the sun

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.130
it would take 17
years to get there,

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.430
if it could maintain
its velocity somehow.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.680
So this would take a
bullet or a jet plane

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.060
17 years to get to the sun.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.620
Or another way to visualize
it-- this sun right over here,

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.420
on my screen it has about a
five- or six-inch diameter.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.430
If I were to actually do it
at scale, this little dot

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.400
right here, which
is the earth, this

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:09.590
speck-- I would have to
put this back about 50 feet

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.520
away from the sun.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.610
50 or 60 feet away from the sun.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.540
If you were to look
at the solar system--

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.305
and obviously there's other
things in the solar system,

00:08:16.305 --> 00:08:18.430
and we'll talk more about
them in the next video--

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:19.930
you wouldn't even
notice this speck.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.010
This is a little dust thing
flying around this sun.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.696
And as we go further and further
out of this solar system,

00:08:25.696 --> 00:08:27.570
you're going to see even
this distance starts

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.640
to become ridiculously small.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.790
Or another way to
think about it--

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:39.770
if the sun was about this size,
then the earth at this scale

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.620
would be about 200
feet away from it.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.510
So you could imagine, if you
had a football field-- let

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.600
me draw a football field.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.200
These are the end zones-- one
end zone, another end zone.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.770
And if you were to
stick something--

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.480
maybe the size of
a medicine ball,

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.240
a little bit bigger than a
basketball, at one end zone--

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.260
this little speck would
be about 60 yards away,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.287
roughly 60 meters away.

00:09:04.287 --> 00:09:05.370
So it's this little speck.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.619
You wouldn't even notice it
on the scale of a football

00:09:07.619 --> 00:09:09.179
field, something this size.

00:09:09.179 --> 00:09:10.720
Anyway, I'm going
to leave you there.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.820
Hopefully that just
starts to blow your mind

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.510
when you think about the
scale of the sun, the earth,

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.911
and how far the earth
is away from the sun.

00:09:19.911 --> 00:09:22.160
And then we're going to see
even those distances, even

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.520
those scales, are super
small when you start thinking

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.120
about the rest of
the solar system.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.100
And especially when we start
going beyond the solar system.
