00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.520
Construct an
equilateral triangle

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.230
inscribed inside the circle.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.505
So let me construct
a circle that

00:00:07.505 --> 00:00:11.040
has the exact same dimensions
as our original circle.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.270
Looks pretty good.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.670
And now, let me
move this center,

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.490
so it sits on our
original circle.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.180
So they now sit on each other.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.340
Or their centers now
sit on each other.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.800
So I can make it, and
that looks pretty good.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.780
And now, let's think
about something.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.290
If I were to draw this
segment right over here,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.237
this, of course, has the
length of the radius.

00:00:34.237 --> 00:00:35.320
Now, let's do another one.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.120
And that's either
of their radii,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.990
because they have
the same length.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.070
Now, let's just center
this at our new circle

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.275
and take it out here.

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:47.650
Now, this is equal to the
radius of the new circle, which

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.360
is the same as the
radius of the old circle.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.276
It's going to be the
same as this length here.

00:00:51.276 --> 00:00:55.010
So these two segments
have the same length.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.420
Now, if I were to connect
that point to that point,

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.900
this is a radius of
our original circle.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.510
And so it's going to have
the same length as these two.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.600
So this right over
here, I have constructed

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.960
an equilateral triangle.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.490
Now, why is this at all useful?

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.280
Well, we know that the angles
in an equilateral triangle

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.090
are 60 degrees.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.640
So we know that this angle
right over here is 60 degrees.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.130
Now, why is this being
60 degrees interesting?

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.460
Well, imagine if we constructed
another triangle out here, just

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.630
symmetrically, but kind of
flipped down just like this.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.360
Well, the same argument,
this angle right

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.500
over here between
these two edges,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.440
this is also going
to be 60 degrees.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.200
So this entire interior
angle, if we add those two up,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.880
are going to be 120 degrees.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.550
Now, why is that interesting?

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.860
Well, if this interior
angle is 120 degrees,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.420
then that means that this arc
right over here is 120 degrees.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.380
Or it's a third of the
way around the triangle.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.410
This right over here is a third
of the way around the triangle.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.810
Since that's a third of the
way around the triangle,

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.390
if I were to connect these
two dots, that is going to be,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.110
this right over
here is going to be

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.020
a side of our
equilateral triangle.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.400
This right over here,
it's secant to an arc

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.919
that is 1/3 of
the entire circle.

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.210
And now, I can keep doing this.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.040
Let's move-- I'll reuse these--
let's move our circle around.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.420
And so now, I'm going to move
my circle along the circle.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.420
And once again, I just want
to intersect these two points.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.780
And so now, let's see, I
could take one of these,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.950
take it there, take it
there, same exact argument.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.330
This angle that I
haven't fully drawn,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.190
or this arc you could
say, is 120 degrees.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.180
So this is going to be one side
of our equilateral triangle.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.960
It's secant to an
arc of 120 degrees.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.350
So let's move this around again.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.020
Actually, we don't even have
to move this around anymore.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.060
We could just connect
those last two dots.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.010
So we could just
connect this one.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.370
Actually, I just want to, let's
connect that one to that one.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.270
And just like that,
and we're done.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.992
We have constructed our
equilateral triangle.
