The Halftime Retreat is an opportunity to step back

Jonathan:
in your Princeton experience, look at it, evaluate it,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.760 position:73%
Jonathan:
appreciate it, most importantly, and then to go

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.930 position:77%
Jonathan:
back into it as kind of a changed person and more

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.730 position:72%
Jonathan:
confident in what you want to do with the rest

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.980

Sophomore year just kind of jumps on you.

Gracie:
You don't really expect all these decisions to bombard you

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.490 position:88%
Gracie:
all at the same time, but they really do all bombard you

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.540
Gracie:
within a few weeks from each other.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.620 position:81%
Gracie:
And after Halftime, I definitely realized that there

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.300 position:61%
Gracie:
were certain things that I wanted to do

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.800
Gracie:
while here at Princeton.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.980

And Halftime helps clarify that.

The best part was the sledding.

There was an exercise that we did, and we had to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.320 position:86%
Russell:
rate our satisfaction in certain portions of our lives.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.780 position:89%
Russell:
Having that moment to really think about what I wanted to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.350 position:69%
Russell:
do, and what made me personally satisfied --

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.310 position:63%

in the end, it was a rewarding exercise.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.220 position:73%

The exercises were really wonderful in terms of

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.890 position:72%
Leana:
going over what we wanted to do in our future.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.380 position:86%
Leana:
But the real fun happened after hours, I'm not going to

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.200 position:84%
Leana:
lie, when all the board games that were stacked in the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.740 position:75%
Leana:
corner were ravaged, and taken across the floor.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.860
Leana:
There were games of--

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.670 position:61%
Leana:
I'm trying to remember what there was--

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.390 position:81%
Leana:
there was Scattergories, there was Taboo, there were

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.700
Leana:
different games of cards going on.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.610 position:84%
Leana:
But the most intense of them all was definitely Mafia.

You meet so many people.

And it's very relaxed.

If you're thinking about going on Halftime,

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.880
Jilly:
definitely do it.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.150 position:80%
Jilly:
Because you'll learn more about who you are and how

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.650 position:63%
Jilly:
other people are making some of the same

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.000

decisions that you are.

It was like a summer camp in the middle of the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.850
Russell:
winter with college kids.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.730

There are no downsides.

Leana:
I can't really think of a single reason

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.600
Leana:
you shouldn't go.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.850

It was the time of my life.
