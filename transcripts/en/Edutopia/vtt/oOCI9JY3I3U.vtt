00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.760
- The reason that we're here today is we
are going to go on a learning walk

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.930
to look at different ways that some of our
teachers are using their flexible spaces.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.340
We're looking to become
more of a facilitator.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.580
- The power of the professional 
development on campus

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.080
is that all of our staff 
gets to learn from one another.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.780
It's all about transforming 
teaching and learning

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.260
and building a culture of
collaboration.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.180
- At Kettle Moraine High School, 
we place priorities on transforming our campus

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.220
and part of that is changing 
what our space looks like

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.640
to allow teachers to move 
from in front of the classroom

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.500
and allow students 
to really own that learning.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.720
- We've been working to 
really personalize to different learners

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.980
and allow our students to choose 
where they feel they'll learn best.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.360
- Classrooms with more open space
instead of rows of desks...

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.940
it makes a lot easier to work with
other people.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.040
- Over the last seven years

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.360
most of our spaces have changed

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.080
and we're right now changing over 
the last few classrooms.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.720
Our social studies department is going to be 
getting their new furniture next year

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.260
and as part of their transition 
we took them on a learning walk.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.820
- So we're looking to continue 
to empower students through

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.180
choice of where they're sitting, who
they're choosing to work with.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.100
Kind of be looking for things that you maybe want
to replicate for your space.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.960
- A learning walk is a way 
for teachers to get out

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.220
and view other teachers 
in their environment.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.680
- Spread out as we get in.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.620
- In my room, rather than having everyone 
in the class reading the same book,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.200
I've actually been able to put them 
into different groups with furniture

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.660
that can be easily moved by students

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.460
and then they can lead 
their own discussions

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.420
and they have a lot more 
ownership in their learning.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.380
- (Student) but she's like so focused
on like pleasing others

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.340
- (Student) I think that kind of makes her 
unlikable to the reader a little bit.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.580
- They were sharing out ideas.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.560
A lot of what they were discussing 
was very high-level critical thinking.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.360
To share out in a large group
might have been very intimidating for them,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.260
so the smaller groups worked really well.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.180
- Not too long ago we went through
remodeling the library,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.540
remodeling the cafeteria, 
remodeling the common spaces,

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.420
to where the cafeteria itself 
becomes a flexible space that,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.440
minus lunch hour, you can
bring your classroom down there.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.920
It's not just classrooms,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.100
it's the entire campus
has become a flexible learning space.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.420
- We have couches and 
we have high-top tables,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.620
we also have two small rooms 
to allow for some privacy

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.340
yet still allow a teacher to supervise.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.240
And then the last classroom we went to, 
we saw the teacher allowing students

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.880
to make choices of whether 
they were going to work alone or work together.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.160
When a teacher doesn't have to be 
in the front of the room,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.500
they can make choices with their curriculum

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.680
that allow students 
to choose a path to follow.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.380
- Some of the teachers that went on the walk have
had the same classroom setup for

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.120
the last 20 years, 
and to hear their ideas about

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.060
how they can use this 
new furniture to enhance

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.660
the things they're already doing 
was really exciting.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.320
- Today when I was looking at 
all the different classrooms

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.980
I wasn't as afraid as 
I have been in the past

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.820
of having students facing 
in the other direction.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.800
- Students told me that when 
instruction is being given

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.260
everyone sits and turns their chairs,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.660
therefore is focusing on the teacher,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.480
and then when it's time 
to get to work then they pair off.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.240
- We need creative spaces in order to 
teach the best way that we can.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.340
Students really work much better 
and learn much better

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.940
when they can get up and move.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.020
- The idea of flexible furniture is not just 
to get something new and fancy

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.580
that might look good 
as you walk past a classroom.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.660
It's truly about how can we help students 
have a better educational experience.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.500
I'm very excited for 
that possibility next year.
