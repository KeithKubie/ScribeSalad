00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.702
Still ahead on this Monday,

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:04.570
Democrats are ramping up
their calls

00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:05.972
to impeach President Trump.

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.574
Let's go.
They're trying to impeach me.

00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:10.843
REPORTER:<i> Democratic congressman
 Brad Sherman</i>

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:13.379
<i> has filed an article
 of impeachment.</i>

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:16.382
Sherman, nobody impeaches me.

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:18.251
I think we're gonna be hearing
the word "impeachment"

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:19.318
a lot more often.

00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:21.788
Wow. Unbelievable.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.122
Sherman?

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:24.624
You know Congressman Sherman?

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.493
He's a white guy.
He's kind of a loser. Jew-y.

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:30.096
Help me.
I don't want to get impeached.

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:31.764
Sheila?

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:33.766
Is Sheila Jackson-Lee here?

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:37.270
People want to impeach me.
You realize that? Why?

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:40.907 line:0%
Yeah. But besides that.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.108
Where's Sherman?

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:43.643
Sherman?

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.245
Sherman!

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:48.047
Where the hell is that guy?

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.582
Oh, there he is!

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:51.317
Sherman? Where's Sherman?

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.052
-Mr. President...
-Yeah, I don't care.

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:56.656
Hello. Sherman,
you're gonna impeach me?

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.525
Let me tell you something,
I'm gonna impeach you.

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.060
I'm gonna make you feel

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:03.062
like Jeff Sessions
fell into a puddle.

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:05.198
You understand me?
You think you're tough?

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.200
You're fired.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:11.804
Mr. President, you can't fire
a member of Congress.

00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:13.206
That's stupid.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.674
Sit down. Let's talk.

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:16.643
Okay.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.245
Mr. President...

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:21.114
Where'd you get that,
a yard sale?

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.649
No, that probably goes back
100 years

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:25.051
here in the House
of Representatives.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:28.187
-We've had it for a long time.
-Total junk, okay?

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.722
Well, Mr. President, first,

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:31.858
I'd like to serve
these papers on you.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.459
-Wow. Thank you. -Usually,
you don't do that in person.

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:35.661
-Whoa. -It's been referred
to the judiciary committee.

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:39.198
And if the whole House votes
in favor of those articles,

00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:40.666
you will be tried in the Senate

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:42.335
for high crimes
and misdemeanors.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:45.671
TRUMP:<i> I can fire Meatloaf,
 but I can't fire this guy?</i>

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:47.607
<i> Got to find another way out
 of this.</i>

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.342
How's this?
I'll make a deal with you.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.077
I'm one of the great dealmakers.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.411
So, what do you want?

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:55.414
All I want
is this letter of resignation.

00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:58.551
How's this?
What if I give you a cool name,

00:01:58.584 --> 00:02:00.620
like the Bradster?

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:03.156
Or, like, Sher-man!

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.659
Like, "Hey, Sher-man,"
instead of "Sherman."

00:02:06.692 --> 00:02:11.797
Or how 'bout, like,
Brad-ley Whit-ford?

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.734
If we could terminate
your presidency,

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:17.937
then I might be known
as the Sherman-ator.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.939
<i> "The Sherman-ator."</i>

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:22.608

is obstruction of justice.

-Fake news.
-It's illegal...

Oh, big deal.

-No.

Mr. President,

look at the Watergate example.

-Uh-huh. -About a year

Whoa. Wait a minute.
There was a cyber burglary?
