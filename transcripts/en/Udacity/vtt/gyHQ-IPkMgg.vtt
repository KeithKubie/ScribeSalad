We're now half way there. We have the equations of two of the lines that we are

00:00:03.746 --> 00:00:08.395
going to need to help Athena design her glasses logo. This is the right-hand

00:00:08.395 --> 00:00:12.446
side of the frame. And the other half of the frame should just be exactly like

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:17.420
this one, simply reflected in the y-axis. So, here are the two functions we've

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.296
already found. And over here, I'd like you to just write the right-hand side of

00:00:21.296 --> 00:00:26.050
each of their reflections in the y-axis. So, these are the two functions that

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.059
are represented on the left-hand side of the graph over here.
