00:00:00.671 --> 00:00:02.494
- [Voiceover] Hello,
grammarians, and hello, Paige.

00:00:02.494 --> 00:00:03.327
- [Voiceover] Hi, David.

00:00:03.327 --> 00:00:05.210
- [Voiceover] Paige, I
have a question for you.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.043
- [Voiceover] What's up?

00:00:06.043 --> 00:00:08.658
- [Voiceover] You like cheese, don't you?

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:09.760
- [Voiceover] Why, yes, I do.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.073
- [Voiceover] So, Paige,
what I've just asked you

00:00:11.073 --> 00:00:14.231
is an example of what's
called a tag question.

00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:16.901
So I'm making an assertion

00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:19.107
and then I'm actually
looking for confirmation;

00:00:19.107 --> 00:00:22.033
so I'm making a statement and then,

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:25.156
consumed by doubt, I have to turn, comma,

00:00:25.156 --> 00:00:26.805
and ask you for confirmation.

00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:30.125
So I say: "You like
cheese", comma, "don't you?"

00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:33.720
And so what's cool about
tag questions is that

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.858
they kind of follow this
positive-negative flow.

00:00:37.858 --> 00:00:40.493
So it begins with a
positive assertion, like:

00:00:40.493 --> 00:00:43.198
"Here is a thing that is
true", and then the doubt,

00:00:43.198 --> 00:00:45.404
so you then negate it to ask the question.

00:00:45.404 --> 00:00:46.925
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:49.282
- [Voiceover] You can
also do this backwards

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:51.093
and begin with a negative assertion

00:00:51.093 --> 00:00:53.183
and ask a positive question, like:

00:00:53.183 --> 00:00:55.191
"This won't hurt", comma, "will it?"

00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:56.712
And we're using the comma to perform

00:00:56.712 --> 00:01:00.879
its separating function
because that's what commas do,

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.546
and separate between

00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:08.170
the assertion and the doubt question.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.386
And that's what tag questions are.

00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:13.067
Sorry to just launch into it.

00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:15.540
So today we're gonna
talk about tag questions,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.640
direct address,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.459
and using commas in the
context of yes and no.

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:21.292
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:21.292 --> 00:01:22.886
- [Voiceover] So, Paige, how are you?

00:01:22.886 --> 00:01:24.616
- [Voiceover] Why are you asking me this?

00:01:24.616 --> 00:01:27.239
- [Voiceover] Because it's
an example of direct address.

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:31.406
So if I start off an utterance
by directly addressing you,

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:36.362
it follows a pause, I
would say: "Paige," comma,

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:38.127
"how are you?"

00:01:38.127 --> 00:01:39.032
- [Voiceover] I see.

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:40.019
That makes sense.

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:41.784
- [Voiceover] But also I'm
interested in your well-being.

00:01:41.784 --> 00:01:43.142
- [Voiceover] Oh, well thank you!

00:01:43.142 --> 00:01:44.700
I'm good.
- [Voiceover] Good.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.342
So if you're directly addressing a person,

00:01:47.342 --> 00:01:49.199
it doesn't have to be just Paige,

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:51.370
it could also be me, it could also be Sal,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.771
whoever, you would say the
name followed by a comma

00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:59.312
then the question, or whatever
the sentence was going to be,

00:01:59.312 --> 00:02:02.934
like: "Paige, I'm going to
the grocery store later.

00:02:02.934 --> 00:02:04.977
"Do you want some cheese?"

00:02:04.977 --> 00:02:05.915
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:08.910
I do definitely want some cheese.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.337
- [Voiceover] So then in
that response actually

00:02:11.337 --> 00:02:13.844
you could have the final thing
we're going to talk about

00:02:13.844 --> 00:02:16.607
today, which is yes and no commas.

00:02:16.607 --> 00:02:19.607
So when you're answering a question,

00:02:20.885 --> 00:02:22.331
whether yes or no,

00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:26.267
you kind of use yes or no as
sentence adverbs, kind of.

00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:28.984
It's an introductory
element, so you would say:

00:02:28.984 --> 00:02:31.329
"Yes," comma, "I would love some cheese",

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.406
or "No," comma, "I hate cheese"

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:37.691
if it were like an
alternate-universe version of you.

00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:40.083
- [Voiceover] Yeah, no,
I definitely love cheese.

00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:41.964
- [Voiceover] But that's how it works.

00:02:41.964 --> 00:02:46.131
You would use, say, yes or no
and follow it with a comma.

00:02:47.687 --> 00:02:50.601
So this is just another example
of how powerful commas are.

00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:52.076
You can use them in all these

00:02:52.076 --> 00:02:54.179
different separating abilities.

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.300
So you can separate
between the tag question,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.992
the positive assertion and
the negative question, like:

00:02:58.992 --> 00:03:00.525
"You like cheese," comma, "don't you?",

00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:03.160
or "This won't hurt," comma, "will it?"

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.763
You can use it in direct address, like:

00:03:04.763 --> 00:03:07.026
"Paige," comma, "how are you?",

00:03:07.026 --> 00:03:09.325
and in yes-or-no responses, like

00:03:09.325 --> 00:03:11.123
"No," comma, "I hate cheese",

00:03:11.123 --> 00:03:14.329
or "Yes," comma, "I
would love some cheese."

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.444
- [Voiceover] Commas are so powerful.

00:03:15.444 --> 00:03:16.767
- [Voiceover] Yeah, for real.

00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:18.427
- [Voiceover] The viewer can
learn anything, can't they?

00:03:18.427 --> 00:03:21.017
- [Voiceover] Yes, Paige,
I believe they can.

00:03:21.017 --> 00:03:21.887
David out.

00:03:21.887 --> 00:03:23.100
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
