Hello, I’m Craig and this is Crash Course
Government and Politics and today we’re finally

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.340
gonna talk about a topic I know that you've all been
waiting for: Monetary and Fiscal policy. Hurray!

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.640
You haven’t been waiting for monetary and
fiscal policy? Are you sure? I’ve been talking

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.020
it up for weeks, you know? Well, let me see
if I can’t convince you to be as excited

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:29.600
as I am. Monetary Policy! Wooo! Fiscal Policy!
Yeah! I want to get fiscal, fiscal.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.920
Come on and get fiscal…
okay let’s start the show.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:41.580
[Theme Music]

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.580
Let’s start with monetary policy because
it’s not at all controversial.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.900
Well, it kind of is controversial, but it’s less
contentious than fiscal policy.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.620
Monetary policy is basically the way the government
regulates the amount of money in circulation

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.730
in the nation’s economy. Controlling the money
supply is the primary task of the Federal Reserve

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.940
System and since it’s a little bit complicated, I’m going
to talk about the other things that the Fed does first.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.360
The Federal Reserve System was created in
1913 to serve as America’s central bank.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.940
Before then, there were state and local banks
as well as a Bank of the United States, which

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.600
was a much more limited central bank.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.400
The Fed is made up of 12 regional banks, and two
boards. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors, who are appointed by

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.960
the President, and the Federal Open Market Committee, 
which is partially appointed by the president.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.240
The Fed has two primary tasks: to control
inflation and to encourage full employment,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.560
and it has four basic functions, but one of
them is way more important than the others.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.170
The Fed is responsible, ultimately for clearing
checks, and for supplying actual currency,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.560
most of which is kept in highly secure facilities
staffed by robots. With laser eyes.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.020
I don’t know if they have laser eyes.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.659
The Fed also sets up rules for banks, although
these can also be set by Congress. But the

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.799
most important thing that the Fed does is
loan money to other banks and set interest rates.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.950
That’s why when you hear about the Federal
Reserve, nine times out of ten it’s about

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.240
interest rates, because that’s the main
way the Fed controls the money supply.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.549
The Fed loans money to banks, sweet, sweet
money, which they in turn loan out to businesses

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.759
and individuals and, like all loans, the Fed
charges interest. The Fed sets the rate on

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.419
the interest, called the discount rate, and this determines, mostly, how much money banks will borrow.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.180
The lower the rate, the more banks will borrow
and the more money goes into circulation.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.170
Other banks peg the interest rates they charge
to the Fed’s rate, charging slightly more,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.099
so in this way the Fed determines, or sets,
interest rates in the economy as a whole.

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.989
The Fed also creates regulations that control
how much money circulates in the economy.

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.500
One of these is the bank reserve requirement, or the
amount of money in cash that a bank has to have on hand.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.079
Now the amount of money that a bank holds
in reserve is only a fraction of the total

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.340
amount of money held in deposit at the bank
– that’s why it’s called fractional

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.980
reserve banking – but the reserve requirement
is there so that you don’t get catastrophic

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.689
bank runs like we saw during the Great Depression
when so many frightened depositors took their

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.790
money out of banks that the banks failed.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.189
Raising the reserve requirement reduces the
amount of money in circulation and lowering

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.019
it pumps more money into the economy.

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.829
The Federal Reserve also sets the interest
rate banks charge to lend money to each other,

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.019
which again controls the amount of money that
circulates.

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.399
If banks are charging each other a lot of
money to borrow, they won’t borrow as much,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.419
and they won’t lend as much to firms and individuals
and there will be less money in the economy as a whole.

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:01.730
There’s at least one more important way
that the Fed influences the money supply in

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.010
the U.S. and that’s through Open Market
Operations.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.859
This is a fancy way to say that the Fed buys
and sells government debt in the form of treasury

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.059
bills, or government bonds. When the Fed sells
bonds, it takes money out of the economy,

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.529
and when it buys them more money goes into
the economy.

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:18.370
This is the idea behind what was known as
Quantitative Easing, which is really complicated.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.829
To be honest, I’m not crazy about wading
into economics here, and thankfully there’s

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.209
a whole other series to do that, but I have
to mention inflation at this point.

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.900
Inflation is a general rise in prices that
can be caused by a number of things, but one

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.419
of them is the amount of money that circulates.
If there’s more money around, there’s

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.379
more that can be spent and this makes it possible
for prices to go up.

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.819
But this isn’t an absolute rule, as of 2016
we’ve had years of basically zero interest

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.680
rates, which means it’s really cheap to
borrow money, which means that there should

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.069
be a lot of money in circulation, yet inflation
remains quite low.

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.760
Hey, it’s real cheap to borrow money. Can I borrow two bucks? No! [punches eagle] He never has any money.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.080
Usually low interest rates tend to cause inflation
and reduce unemployment, and high interest

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:59.589
rates are expected to cool down an overheating
economy, but that hasn’t happened much in

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:02.699
the past few years. I’ll say again, I glad
this isn’t an economic series.

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.109
It’s important to note here that the Federal
reserve is an independent body, meaning that

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.260
its board of governors and chairperson are
not elected or really subject to much regulation

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.449
from Congress. And they throw the best parties.
That’s probably why.

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.639
This is intentional and probably a good idea.
Ideally, you want people in charge of the

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.340
money supply to be able to look after broader
interests than their own re-election, and

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.669
this is why the Fed is supposed to be insulated
from politics and remain independent.

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.409
Ok, so that’s monetary policy, which is
one lever that the federal government can

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:32.080
use to influence the economy. Increasingly
it’s the only lever, because in America

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.009
we have a hard time with fiscal policy.

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.500
What’s that, you might be asking? Fiscal
policy refers to the government’s ability

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.050
to raise taxes and spend the money it raises.
Since I know that by this episode you’ve

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.460
been paying a lot of attention to American
politics, you know that in the past 20 or

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.509
30 years, at least, Americans have generally
been reluctant to raise taxes, and somewhat

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.020
reluctant to have the government spend money.
The difference between these two goals – spending

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.199
money and not raising taxes – largely explains
why we have deficits.

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.599
Before we get into tax policy, which I know
is what you’ve been waiting for, calm down,

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.080
I need to point out that the way the government
can spend more money on programs than it takes

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.340
in taxes is by borrowing it, which the
government does by, you guessed it, selling bonds.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.640
Good thing we talked about Open Market Operations.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.680
Let’s tax the Thought Cafe people with a lot of work,
by talking about taxes and spending in the Thought Bubble.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.440
First, ever since Ronald Reagan came to office
there has been a hostility towards higher

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.439
taxes and government spending that is theoretically
based in an idea called supply side economics.

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:25.280
I’m not going to discuss the details of
the theory or even whether it’s right or

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.319
wrong or somewhere in between, but the basic
thrust is that if you lower taxes on businesses

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.669
and individuals, the individuals will be able
to spend more, the businesses will be able

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.110
to invest more, and the economy as a whole
will grow. It’s a simple and politically

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.310
powerful idea and has set the terms of the
debate for a generation.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.090
In general, over the past 30 years the trend
is for there to be lower federal taxes and

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.560
for them to be less progressive, meaning that
wealthier people pay a lower percentage of

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.560
their income in Federal taxes. The wealthy
still pay the largest share of federal taxes

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.960
overall, though, so it’s not completely
accurate to say that they aren’t paying.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.930
Since Reagan, and especially during the presidency
of George W. Bush, income tax rates on the

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.039
highest earners have fallen, as have taxes
on estates (although they did go up again)

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.009
and on capital gains and dividends. President
Obama did raise tax rates, but primarily on

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:08.810
people earning above $450,000 a year.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.439
Corporate tax rates have also declined and
Social Security taxes have gone up, which

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:15.959
is important because this is the federal tax
that most of us are most likely to pay.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.999
Overall the percentage of revenue that the federal
government receives from taxes has held pretty

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:25.110
steady at between 43% and 50%. If you’re
interested in the numbers, for 2013 the government

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.139
received almost $2.8 trillion in tax revenues.
And it spent $3.5 trillion, which math tells

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.919
us means a deficit of around 700 billion dollars.

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.219
Thanks, Thought Bubble. When people say that
they need to cut spending and balance the

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:39.669
budget, this is what they are talking about,
but it’s not quite as simple as just spending

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:43.349
less, because there are some places where
the government can’t cut spending even if they want to.

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:46.620
There are certain items in the federal budget
that must be spent because they are written

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.580
into law by Congress. These are called uncontrollables,
or mandatory spending.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.600
One uncontrollable that relates to monetary
policy is interest payments on federal debt.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.550
The government can’t not pay its interest,
otherwise no one would lend us money.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.960
That's just how lending works, or it's
supposed to work.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.499
Farm price supports – subsidies – are
also counted as uncontrollables, and they

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:08.639
are important, but not nearly as important
as the two big-ticket mandatory spending items.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.500
These are social security and Medicare, and
they are paid for with dedicated federal taxes.

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:15.909
They provide income and health insurance for
elderly people and it’s unlikely that the

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:19.710
amounts the government spends on them is going
to decline anytime soon for three reasons.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.379
First, is that the population is aging, meaning
that the percentage of older Americans is

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:27.139
rising in proportion to younger Americans.
This means that more people will be receiving

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:31.819
Social Security payments, which leads us to the second
reason they are unlikely to go down: people like them.

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:35.819
The third reason is more political: older
people tend to vote more regularly, so a politician

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:39.909
who wants to keep their job is unlikely to
vote for cuts in Social Security or Medicare.

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:43.240
So, here’s the thing about the Federal Reserve
and economics: The American economy is really

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.379
huge, and really complicated, and has some
issues that need addressing.

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:49.520
Whether you care a lot about budget deficits
or don’t think they're a big deal will depend

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.180
a lot on your feelings about economics in general,
but there are a couple of things to keep in mind.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.819
First, there's only a limited range of programs
on which the government can choose to spend

00:07:56.819 --> 00:08:00.520
or not spend. These are called discretionary
spending and when people call for cuts in

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.240
government spending, this is what they mean.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.870
By far the largest chunk of government spending
goes into defense, over $600 billion in 2013,

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.790
but the next largest item is healthcare for the poor, Medicaid, at $498 Billion.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.480
Nothing else even comes close.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.360
Spending on the Department of Education,
for example, was $41 billion in 2013.

00:08:18.379 --> 00:08:21.199
The second thing to bear in mind is that in
addition to cutting spending, the government

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:25.759
could balance its budget by doing what everyone
loves - raising taxes. It's done this on occasion,

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:29.919
but the political consequences can be pretty
tough. Just ask George H.W. Bush.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.340
Finally, the combination of Americans’ aversion
to raising taxes and the government’s limited ability

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:39.539
to cut spending means that monetary policy becomes
its major lever in broad-based macroeconomic policy.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.579
That’s why we paid so much attention to
the Federal Reserve system at the beginning

00:08:42.579 --> 00:08:45.039
of this episode, and why you probably should
too.
