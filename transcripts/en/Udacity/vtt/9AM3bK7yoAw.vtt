Alright, Sam. So chatter's cool. I'm into the social

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.270
thing, but I want to make this thing mobile.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:06.970
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.039
&gt;&gt; You promised me that I can.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.290
&gt;&gt; You already did.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.240
&gt;&gt; So I have this thing called an iOS simulator, and it

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.640
let's me show you what this would look like on an iPhone.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.300
&gt;&gt; Sweet.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.570
&gt;&gt; And right now it's not that impressive.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.970
It looks like a crappy website on an iPhone.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.890
&gt;&gt; What is this? A website for ants?

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.890
&gt;&gt;

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.950
[LAUGH]

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.880
And that's bad. The main ten ants maybe.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.545
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:25.880
[LAUGH]

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.530
&gt;&gt; I can zoom in, but still this is kind

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.630
of, you know, not that impressive, so what can I do?

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.870
&gt;&gt; All right, so you could install an app right off,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.460
you know, the app store into your phone. Or you could just

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.280
navigate to a new URL, that will pull up all of

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.070
this data and all of your applications in a mobile web app.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.210
&gt;&gt; Okay, what.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.480
&gt;&gt; So.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.290
&gt;&gt; What is this mystery URL?

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.835
&gt;&gt; Sales

00:00:50.835 --> 00:00:52.470
Force One, yow.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.940
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.170
&gt;&gt; Alright so, don't delete everything, just at the end of this URL, we'll

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.730
delete everything back to dot com, so just keep going back.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:09.648
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yep, and then, there you go and then /one/one.app.

00:01:09.648 --> 00:01:13.573
&gt;&gt; w, I mean, o-n-e?

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:14.479
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.890
&gt;&gt; One.app?

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.796
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:20.000
&gt;&gt; Oh man, that is cool. Okay.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.820
&gt;&gt; Alright, so first what we're looking

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.550
at right now is. That's our chatter feed.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.930
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.200
&gt;&gt; But this whole thing is pulling up SalesForce one, which is.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.480
&gt;&gt; I'm going to like this, sorry.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.880
&gt;&gt; You're going to like your own post?

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.840
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.640
&gt;&gt; Is it, is it lame?

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.380
&gt;&gt; It's okay. It's socially acceptable in the corporate world.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.310
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.010
&gt;&gt; All right, but, what this is, is it's a

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.720
mobile representation of all of your Salesforce data in one application.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.090
And so maybe you didn't realize this the whole time we

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.920
were going through all of our app building, but you simultaneously

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.320
built a mobile app that's completely functional with everything that you've

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.170
already done. And you can see its service in a phone.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That is really cool. So, let me poke around a bit.
