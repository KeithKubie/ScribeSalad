DON DODGE: Hi.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.380
I'm Don Dodge, and this
is Google Root Access.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.645
Today my guest is
Jay Simons, president

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:13.700
of Atlassian Software.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.340
Welcome, Jay.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.048
JAY SIMONS: Yeah.

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:15.930
Thanks, Don.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.970
DON DODGE: Jay, developers
know what that Atlassian is,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.340
but maybe some of
our audience doesn't.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.330
What is Atlassian?

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.500
What kinds of products?

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.440
What do you do?

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.773
JAY SIMONS: Atlassian is an
enterprise software company.

00:00:26.773 --> 00:00:28.290
We make collaboration
software used

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.290
by software teams
and other companies

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.960
to help them build
software better.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.390
So whether you're an
automotive company building

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.050
the next electric car or you're
an investment bank building

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.750
a new trading algorithm or
you're a shoe company building

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.400
digital devices to track
fitness, all of those things

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.230
involve software.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.800
And software is an
important key ingredient

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.380
to how products, markets,
industries, the world

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.970
will innovate.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.680
DON DODGE: JIRA is a
product that I know about,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.040
but there are others.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.732
What is JIRA?

00:00:57.732 --> 00:00:59.190
And what do your
other products do?

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.810
JAY SIMONS: Think about
our product portfolio

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.120
as kind of the
three-legged stool.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.494
Any team that's
building software

00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:04.940
needs to do three things.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.340
They need to track projects
and activity and work.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.470
That's what JIRA does.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.870
They need to kind
of share and iterate

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.020
on unstructured content ideas,
specifications, roadmaps,

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.262
product requirements, the
things that actually define

00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:21.720
what you're going
to build and what

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.190
that work is going
to be involved in.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.972
And Confluence is the
product that handles that.

00:01:27.972 --> 00:01:29.930
And then, because we're
talking about software,

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.480
developers need to share and
iterate and collaborate on code

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.410
and do a number of different
things around that code,

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.165
things like code reviews or code
insight, continuous integration

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:43.860
and deployment.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.610
That kind of product
family is anchored

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.980
by a product called Stash,
which is a management

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.382
application for the distributed
source control system Git.

00:01:53.382 --> 00:01:54.090
DON DODGE: Great.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.190
So developers, then,
are your users.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.964
JAY SIMONS: Developers are a
very important group of users.

00:02:00.964 --> 00:02:03.380
But actually, if you think
about the modern software team,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.313
the developer is actually
a very important minority.

00:02:06.313 --> 00:02:08.229
The group of people that
are building software

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.850
include project managers,
key stakeholders

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.950
that are going to define
what developers need

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.200
to build to begin with, people
in support and marketing,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.902
documentation
writers, designers.

00:02:18.902 --> 00:02:20.360
There's a whole
bevy of people that

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.240
are involved in actually
designing, specifying, building

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.190
supporting software.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.590
And so our products help
bring all of those people

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.340
together, technical and
non-technical alike.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.202
DON DODGE: And how are your
Atlassian products sold?

00:02:36.202 --> 00:02:38.160
JAY SIMONS: Our products
are sold over the web.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.680
We use the internet,
basically, to reach customers.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.500
They're available to
customers to deploy

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.482
both in the cloud as a
service or to install and run

00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:48.190
on their own servers
behind the firewall.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.630
DON DODGE: And is it a
subscription-based things

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.030
or license?

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.960
Or how does it work?

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.293
JAY SIMONS: The licensing
model for the cloud deployment

00:02:55.293 --> 00:02:57.200
is subscription, either
monthly or annual,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.200
which is fairly typical.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.750
The deployment model
behind the firewall

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.340
is sold as a perpetual license
with an annual maintenance

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.700
and support agreement.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.080
DON DODGE: You compete with some
open source kinds of products

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.900
or free freemium
kinds of products.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.470
But you're an enterprise
software company.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.720
So how does that work?

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.220
JAY SIMONS: Well,
I would say we're

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.260
an alternative to both open
source at the bottom end,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.580
or at one end,
and very expensive

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.400
traditional enterprise
software from IBM and Microsoft

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.670
and HP at the top end, so
things like Rational or even

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.337
Team Foundation Server
or HP Quality Center

00:03:42.337 --> 00:03:43.420
at the very, very top end.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.461
Those are products that
are millions and millions

00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:49.070
of dollars a year that typically
are sold on a per developer

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.280
seat basis.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.530
Then at the other end, you've
got open source products

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.851
like Bugzilla and Trac
and Mantis and Redmine.

00:03:55.851 --> 00:03:57.350
And then there's a
bevy of companies

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.970
in the middle that
do various things.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.810
I think Atlassian
is, I think, actually

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.390
the only company that's combined
just excellence in discipline,

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.824
initial project
tracking, content

00:04:07.824 --> 00:04:09.490
collaboration, and
source collaboration.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.050
And that's what sets
us apart, one thing.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.030
The other thing is that
we've intentionally

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.380
priced, in part because
of our business model,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.410
to be affordable and
provide great value.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.120
And in exchange for providing
that great value to customers,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.750
we don't have the traditional
expensive enterprise sales

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.230
organization to justify or
support the expense of products

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.300
at that other end.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.660
DON DODGE: So you compete
at both ends of the market,

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.990
and you've priced it so that
you can compete effectively

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.510
with the free or
freemium-type models.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.610
But then you compete with
big software companies.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.450
Those big software
companies typically

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.550
have technical
support and pre-sales

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.070
and all kinds of consulting
and all that sort of thing.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.910
So I understand how you can
compete at the open source

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.040
level or freemium
by pricing well,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.874
but how do you compete
at the high end

00:05:05.874 --> 00:05:07.040
against these big companies?

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.706
JAY SIMONS: By building
better products.

00:05:08.706 --> 00:05:11.347
By investing in R&amp;D.
Where those companies have

00:05:11.347 --> 00:05:13.180
to invest in all the
things you'd mentioned,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.190
sales and more
support and pre-sales,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.012
to help explain how their
products should work or help

00:05:19.012 --> 00:05:21.470
compensate for maybe where the
product doesn't work like it

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.905
is, we invest a very
significant amount in R&amp;D

00:05:24.905 --> 00:05:27.030
to make sure that the
product kind of sells itself.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.280
We believe that we sell
largely to a technical audience

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.180
and a technical
constituent who, I think,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.365
believes inherently that
they have the capacity

00:05:37.365 --> 00:05:39.740
to understand whether this
product will support what they

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.210
need or what their team needs.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.820
And we invest a
lot in making sure

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.180
that the product does that.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.460
So they can spin it
up online, or they

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.690
can download and install it.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.240
And ultimately, it's going to
say, hey, welcome, evaluator.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.730
Let's show you around and help
you understand whether or not

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.820
this is going to do the job.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.830
DON DODGE: Developers and
product managers and project

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.265
managers are the
same kinds of people

00:06:03.265 --> 00:06:05.140
and do the same kinds
of job, whether they're

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.300
in a tiny startup up or
in a Fortune 500 company.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.220
So I guess, in some sense,
supporting them, it's the same.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.160
You're supporting
the users, and you

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.390
don't do anything
different for Fortune 500

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.350
developers versus small
startup developers.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.900
JAY SIMONS: We don't.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.780
Very, very large companies have
different scale and performance

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.680
requirements.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.905
And so there is a difference
between a company that

00:06:30.905 --> 00:06:33.030
has 100 people using our
software in a company that

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.630
has 10,000 or 20,000.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.660
We built a product to support
both ends of that spectrum,

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.505
which was hard, requires a
lot of R&amp;D and specialization

00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:44.690
and people that understand
how to make it scale.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.610
And you have to think where
sometimes if you build

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.050
a software with only 10 users,
the user picker that you design

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.320
is different than
the one for 10,000.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.960
I think we're a
unique company that

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.130
needs to think about
solving problems

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:03.450
for a very large and
varied customer base.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.750
When you're supporting teams
of 10 and teams of 10,000,

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.160
designing a product
that supports

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.970
both ends of the
spectrum is, I think,

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.470
a difficult R&amp;D
challenging and one

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.990
I think we do well, probably
better than any other software

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.270
company I can think of.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.240
DON DODGE: And do you
handle developer support

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.920
through discussion
forums and FAQs?

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.930
How do you do that?

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.680
JAY SIMONS: Big emphasis
on documentation.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.570
Again, our whole philosophy
is around customer empowerment

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:29.955
and customer self-service.

00:07:29.955 --> 00:07:31.330
We believe in
that, and we invest

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.538
a lot to make that-- That
doesn't happen organically.

00:07:33.538 --> 00:07:35.890
You have to consciously
invest in making sure

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.850
that that works by
building great product,

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.720
by building great
documentation, by thinking

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.757
about empowering your end
user or your customer.

00:07:43.757 --> 00:07:45.590
We do have a technical
support organization.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.720
We also complement that with
community-based support.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.480
And so again, we invest a lot in
creating an opportunity for it.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.295
We've got 30,000 companies
as active companies using

00:07:57.295 --> 00:08:00.690
our software and, in that
group of active companies,

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.289
millions of end users.

00:08:02.289 --> 00:08:03.830
So there's a treasure
trove of people

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.309
who actually know how to solve
problems, either for themselves

00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:09.100
and might be willing
to share that solution

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.030
with other customers.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.580
Creating an
opportunity, I think,

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.720
for customers to help each
other is a really important part

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.940
of a scalable support model.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.460
And we complement that with
our own technical support

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.916
organization to dig
deep where we're needed.

00:08:22.916 --> 00:08:23.730
DON DODGE: Wow.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:24.500
Awesome.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.620
Well, thank you very much.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.250
This is an interesting
topic, and I'd

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.289
like to have you back to
discuss this more in the future.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.880
But this is all we
have time for today.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.409
So thank you for joining us.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:40.539
I'd like to remind you that
if you're a cloud developer,

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:44.970
we have a special $2,000
credit for Google Cloud.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.910
You can see the details
of where to sign up

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.010
for that credit
on the screen now.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.200
Thank you very much, and
we'll see you next time.
