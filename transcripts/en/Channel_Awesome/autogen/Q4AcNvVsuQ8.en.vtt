00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.270
me out of it a bit and you never had
that problem here because by not

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:44.280
that problem here because by not
 

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.400
that problem here because by not

to bet it's easy to believe the stuff is
 

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:27.770
to bet it's easy to believe the stuff is
really there and I think part of that is

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:27.780
really there and I think part of that is
 

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.320
really there and I think part of that is
because you know this is it strange

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:30.330
because you know this is it strange
 

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.210
because you know this is it strange
because it's both a bigger and a smaller

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:32.220
because it's both a bigger and a smaller
 

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.640
