00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.014
In 3D computer graphics, we usually use a Cartesian Coordinate System. In this

00:00:05.014 --> 00:00:10.586
system, we have an origin and three direction vectors called x, y, and z. The

00:00:10.586 --> 00:00:15.142
origin is some fixed point in space whose location everyone agrees on. This

00:00:15.142 --> 00:00:19.120
point can be anything. I could build a world based on the location of our

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.329
surveyor's marker, a dot drawn on a tablet, or a reference point is simply

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.316
imagined. For example, if I'm designing a great new teapot, I don't really care

00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:31.484
where the rest of the world is located. So, I can state that my origin is just a

00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:35.465
point in empty space. I might then build a the teapots model so that this origin

00:00:35.465 --> 00:00:39.492
point is in the center of the bottom of the teapot. Here's a prettier view since

00:00:39.492 --> 00:00:43.730
I want you to see the 3D coordinates better. The three direction vectors define

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.569
the axes of the coordinate system. They are normally each perpendicular to the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:52.944
other. That is, the angle here, here and here are all each 90 degrees. It's

00:00:52.944 --> 00:00:56.696
possible to define a coordinate system with axes that are not perpendicular but

00:00:56.696 --> 00:01:00.600
this is rarely done in practice. For example, finding the distance between two

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.580
points becomes a tricky concept when the axes are not mutually perpendicular.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.870
Given an origin and three vectors, we can then define the location of any point

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.268
in space with a triprelative numbers. For example, this point has a triprelative

00:01:14.268 --> 00:01:19.724
2, 3 and 4, as it's two units along the x, three along the y, and four along the

00:01:19.724 --> 00:01:24.539
z. 3D vectors are described by a similar coordinate system, except that the

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.366
origin is not needed. A vector describes a motion, which again can be described

00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:33.812
by three numbers. That is, it describes how far to move to get from one point to

00:01:33.812 --> 00:01:38.067
another. However, this movement is not fixed in any particular location in

00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:43.330
space. To understand the difference, think about time. A specific time is like a

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.180
point. An amount of time is like a vector. It specifies a duration, but no

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.813
starting time is given.
