00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.190
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks to all
of you for coming to this talk

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.295
by Michael Cremo on forbidden
archaeology here at Google.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.750
So when was the last time
somebody questioned evolution?

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.170
Do you know?

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.630
In your experience, any numbers?

00:00:19.012 --> 00:00:21.220
I'm just trying to say how
often it happens, somebody

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.550
questioning such a major
theory as evolution.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.970
Any guess?

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.161
I mean, before the talk.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:28.660
Sorry?

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.330
AUDIENCE: It happens
all the time in the US.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.038
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:00:31.038 --> 00:00:31.760
That's good.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.140
That's good that people
are aware of that debate.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.801
Some people don't even
know that it's a theory

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:39.550
and know it's being
debated, and they just

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.625
take it for a fact
as much as gravity.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.270
That's good to know that
you are aware of that.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.750
So we have Michael Cremo here.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.440
So he has a lot of
extensive introduction

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.050
about how we got
into this topic.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.070
So I don't want to steal that
as part of my introduction.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.850
And so I'll just go over
the introduction of him

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.850
as a person.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.160
I've known him for
more than 10, 15 years.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.220
And he's a very thoughtful,
methodical person

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.430
with extreme
intellectual honesty.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.130
And he expects that of others.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.910
So that's where his research
was born into this book.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.540
So the scope of
this talk is just

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.740
questioning the current
theory and based

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.320
on the evidences available.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.350
But he's not going to present an
alternate theory in this talk.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.050
We have to wait
for a year for that

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.490
to happen if he have
a job until then.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.240
So now, the scope of
this talk is questioning

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.060
the current theory based
on the available evidences

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.320
from researched literature.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.990
And the next topic
he usually presents

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.350
is called human devolution,
presenting an alternate theory.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.770
So there are books
for that outside.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.390
So that's your only
resource right now.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.560
So with that, let's
welcome Michael Cremo

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.147
to Google with a big hand.

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:59.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.270
MICHAEL CREMO: Thank you
for the nice introduction.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.170
And thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.850
for coming to hear a little
something about the topic

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.770
forbidden archeology, evidence
for extreme human antiquity.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.030
So just to keep
things honest, I'm

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.000
a researcher in human
origins for the International

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.100
Society for Krishna
Consciousness.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.220
And my research is
inspired by my studies

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.480
in the ancient Sanskrit
writings in India,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.190
especially the Puranas,
the historical writings.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.120
Now, for many today,
those two things

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.900
would be complete
disqualifications for me

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.940
to say anything about
a scientific topic

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.170
in scientific circles.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.080
However, quite
surprisingly to me even,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.080
there are people within
the scientific world who

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.590
are interested in hearing
what I have to say.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.820
And I've been invited to present
my ideas at some of the leading

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.060
scientific institutions
of the world,

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.950
such as the Royal
Institution in London,

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.420
the Russian Academy
of Science in Moscow

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.770
Department of Anthropology,
the Indian Institute of Science

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.280
in Bangalore, and many
others around the world.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.820
So the question
I'm dealing with is

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.490
how old is the human species.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.530
Today, the most common
answer to that question

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.960
comes from the modern followers
of Charles Darwin, who

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.710
propose that the
first humans like

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.100
us came into existence less
than 200,000 years ago.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.890
Before that, they
would say there

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.330
were no humans like us
present on this planet,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.820
simply more primitive,
ape-like human ancestors.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.500
However, the Puranas,
the historical writings

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.940
of ancient India,
give a different idea,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.560
namely that humans
have been present

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.740
for vast periods of time
on this planet going back

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.655
many millions of years.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.740
Now of course, in
scientific circles,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.970
I wouldn't expect anyone
to take a statement

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.510
from some ancient
writings as evidence.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:29.240
So in the scientific circles
where I'm invited to speak,

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.850
I do something else.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:39.290
I make a prediction, namely
if what the Puranas say

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.940
about human antiquity
is true, there

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.220
should be reports of
archaeological evidence

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.410
for humans existing much further
back in time than 200,000

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.970
years ago, perhaps going
back many millions of years.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.040
So my method for
testing that prediction

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.670
is to examine all archaeological
reports from the time of Darwin

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.330
to the present.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.090
And not just in English.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.010
I have a reading
knowledge of most

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.985
of the major European languages.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.560
So when I speak about
examining reports

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.370
from the scientific
literature, I

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.850
mean two kinds of scientific
literature, the primary

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.890
and the secondary
scientific literature.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.590
By primary scientific
literature,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.430
I mean original reports by
archaeologists, geologists,

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.650
paleontologists, and
other Earth scientists

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.006
reported in the professional,
peer reviewed, scientific

00:05:43.006 --> 00:05:43.505
literature.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.110
By secondary literature,
I mean things

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.830
that are based on the primary
literature, such as textbooks,

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.535
for example.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.620
So I had two principal findings.

00:06:00.224 --> 00:06:05.100
The first finding is
not so surprising.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.770
There are no reports of evidence
for extreme human antiquity

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.460
in the current secondary
literature, textbooks,

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.910
survey studies, and
things of that sort.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.026
My second finding was a
little more interesting.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.480
There are many
reports of evidence

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.210
for extreme human antiquity
in the primary scientific

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.620
literature of past and present.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.150
So I collected those
reports and this book,

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.920
"Forbidden Archeology,"
which was reviewed

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.780
in most of the
professional, academic,

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.140
and scientific
journals that deal

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.856
with the question
of human origins.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.995
So this constitutes a
kind of peer review.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:07:00.010
Now, as you might expect, many
of those reviews were negative,

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.820
some extremely so.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.816
However, quite
surprisingly to me even,

00:07:08.816 --> 00:07:14.900
even some of my critics
were able to point out

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.305
some positive
aspects of the work.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.880
For example, David Oldroyd,
a noted historian of science,

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.320
in a 28 page review
article about the book

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.160
asked the question, so
has forbidden archeology

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.080
made any contribution
to the literature

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.045
on paleoanthropology.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.290
Our answer is a guarded
yes for two reasons.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.270
First, he said, much of
the historical material

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.390
has not been scrutinized
in such detail before.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.920
In other words, as a
professional historian

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.910
of science dealing with
these particular questions,

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.790
he had not encountered
any work which

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.320
had gone into history
in such depth before.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.790
And second, he said,
the book raises, quote,

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.230
a central problematic
regarding the lack

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.810
of certainty in
scientific truth claims.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:14.390
Now, after the
book was published

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.140
and many of the
reviews came out,

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.540
I began speaking about
the topic of the book

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.870
at scientific conferences.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.260
The first time I
did that was in 1984

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.785
at a meeting of the World
Archaeological Congress.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.440
It's the world's largest
international organization

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.650
of archaeologists.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.299
I presented a paper there
called "Puranic Time

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.690
and The Archaeological Record."

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:43.950
And that paper was
selected for publication

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:47.090
in a peer reviewed conference
proceedings volume called

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.150
"Time and Archaeology,"
which came out from Rutledge,

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.065
a major scientific publisher.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.000
And subsequently, I've
presented papers on my work

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.420
at many other meetings of the
World Archaeological Congress,

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.766
and also meetings of
the European Association

00:09:06.766 --> 00:09:07.516
of Archaeologists.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.420
And the reason I'm
mentioning this

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.620
is just to show that the
kinds of things I'm saying

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.120
are part of the
scientific discourse

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.830
in the scientific
disciplines that

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.020
are related to human origins.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.220
Now, admittedly, it's
not a popular voice.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.930
It's an extreme minority
voice limited maybe even

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.355
to a minority of one.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:43.200
But still, surprisingly
enough to many people,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.810
it is a part of the discourse.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.660
So one of the questions I had
about the kind of evidence I'm

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:57.460
talking about is
why exactly is it

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.390
missing from the current
secondary literature

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.245
if it's there in the
primary literature.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:10.050
And I'm proposing it's because
of a process of knowledge

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.620
filtration that operates
in the world of science.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.530
And here, I'm not talking
about a Satanic conspiracy

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.585
to suppress truth.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:21.410
I'm talking about
something that philosophers

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.810
of science and
historians of science

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.520
have understood for
a long time, namely

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.230
that theoretical preconceptions
can influence how scientists

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.040
may react to different
categories of evidence that

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.160
come to their attention.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.150
We can call the blue box
the knowledge filter.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.410
And what it represents
is the dominant consensus

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.280
in the scientific discipline
at a particular point in time.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.600
And reports of
evidence that conform

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.530
to the dominant consensus will
pass through the knowledge

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.850
filter fairly easily,
whereas reports

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.260
of evidence that
radically contradict

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.540
a dominant consensus
tend to be filtered out,

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:10.440
ignored, forgotten,
set aside, dismissed.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:17.990
And this was something that one
of the reviewers of "Forbidden

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.835
Archeology" noted, the
French archaeologist Marylene

00:11:21.835 --> 00:11:26.430
Patou-Mathis noted in her
review of "Forbidden Archeology"

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.080
in "L'Anthropologie."

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.030
"Cremo and Thompson have
written a provocative work

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.780
that raises the problem of the
influence of the dominant ideas

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.920
of a time period on
scientific research.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.680
These ideas can
compel the researchers

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.700
to orient their
analyses according

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.990
to the conceptions
that are permitted

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.680
by the scientific community."

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.040
So it was interesting to
me that an archaeologist

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.450
grasped correctly
what the point we

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.460
were trying to make in the book
and wasn't just dismissing it

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.945
as, oh, these are
conspiracy theorists.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.830
I'm now going to go over
some of the kinds of reports

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:10.910
that I'm talking about.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.560
This is Virginia Steen-McIntyre,
an American geologist.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.900
She was involved in dating
an archaeological site

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.130
at Hueyatlaco in Mexico.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.600
There, archaeologists had
discovered projectile points

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.770
and other stone
tools and weapons.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.710
And they were, of
course, interested

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.600
in how all these things were.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.560
This is the excavation
at Hueyatlaco.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.100
And the artifacts were
photographed intact

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.180
in the layers of rock in
which they were found.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.600
Virginia Steen-McIntyre
and her colleagues

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.980
used four different
methods to date the site.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.080
Animal bones with
butchering marks

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.070
were found in the same
layers with the stone tools.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:59.600
The geologists used the
uranium series method

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.000
to date those bones.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.380
They got an age
of 245,000 years.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.500
Above the layer
with the stone tools

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.540
was a layer of volcanic ash.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.890
The geologists used the Zircon
Fission Track method to date

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.480
that layer of ash.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.750
They got an age
of 270,000 years.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.700
Using all four methods
that they employed,

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.580
the geologists
concluded the site

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:28.170
must be at least
250,000 years old.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:32.080
However, the archaeologists
refused to accept it.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.870
They said humans capable of
making those artifacts didn't

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:40.930
exist anywhere in the
world 250,000 years ago.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.600
They hadn't evolved
yet, what to speak

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.470
of being present
in North America.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.690
They considered the oldest
human presence in North America

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.820
to go back only
about 20,000 years.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.540
So they refused to publish
the age for the site

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.280
given by their own hand-picked
team of geologists.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.990
So Virginia Steen-McIntyre
and her colleagues

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.650
were a little surprised by that.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:07.250
So they decided to
independently publish

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.580
the age for the site
in a journal called

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.690
"Quaternary Research."

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.890
But when they did
that, they experienced

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.890
an extreme negative backlash
from their colleagues

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.290
in the scientific
world because they

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.740
had dared to publish
something like this.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.740
Virginia Steen-McIntyre
wrote to one

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.770
of the editors of the journal,
"Not being an anthropologist,

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.800
I didn't realize how deeply
woven into our thought

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.140
the current theory of
human evolution has become.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.840
Our work at Hueyatlaco has been
rejected by most archaeologists

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:48.370
because it contradicts
that theory."

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:52.460
So some of the cases I'm
going to be talking about

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.750
are from the more recent
history of archaeology,

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.400
some from the more distant
history of archaeology.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.280
Some of the cases
are going to be

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.630
closer to what the
mainstream concepts allow.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.420
And some are going to be further
and further distant from what

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.820
current ideas would
consider possible.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.530
This is one of the founders
of modern archaeology, Jacques

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:18.330
Boucher de Perthes.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:24.390
And one of his excavations,
Moulin Quignon near Abbeville

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.780
in Northeastern France, he found
an anatomically modern human

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:29.280
jawbone.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.190
He found it in the bottom
layers of his excavation

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.110
with stone tools and weapons.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:41.950
According to modern geologists,
that layer at Abbeville

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:47.200
is about 430,000 years old.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.390
It was quite a
controversial discovery,

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.835
even in the 19th century.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.210
Many scientists could
not accept that humans

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:01.230
existed at that
distant point in time.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.586
So some of them proposed,
well, Boucher de Perthes

00:16:05.586 --> 00:16:07.085
must have been the
victim of a hoax.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.310
Somehow or other,
someone must have

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:16.120
gone to some Roman cemetery,
gotten a jawbone 2,000 or 3,000

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.940
years old and buried it in the
excavation for him to find.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.930
And that's actually
the explanation

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.910
that we see in
today's textbooks.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:31.010
However, what we do not
see in today's textbooks is

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:35.590
that after these hoax
accusations came out,

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.890
Boucher de Perthes made
additional excavations

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.030
at Moulin Quignon.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.320
And these additional
excavations,

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.020
in the same location
he found over 100

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.560
additional anatomically
modern human bones and teeth

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.680
in the same formation,
which to me indicates

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.710
a human presence going
back over 400,000 years.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:08.130
And I reported on this case
in this paper, which was later

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:12.079
published in a peer reviewed
conference proceedings volume.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:17.180
Recently, just last
year, archaeologists

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.500
reported the discovery
of footprints

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:24.109
at a place called Happisburgh
in the United Kingdom.

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:25.880
They were found in
a formation that

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.420
is at least 780,000
years old and is perhaps

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.820
up to a million years old.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:39.240
The archaeologist who studied
the footprints published

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.500
results suggesting
they are consistent

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.415
with anatomically
modern human footprints.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.670
For example, they
studied the foot index,

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.460
which is the width divided
by the length times 100.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:59.455
The average for all of the
Happisburgh footprints was 39.

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:05.470
The average for living Native
American Indians is again, 39.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:13.120
The average for living Eskimos
today, the foot index is 38.26.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.490
And other features
of the footprints

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.810
were consistent with those
of modern human beings.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:24.330
Now, of course they
did not believe

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.480
that humans like us
existed at that time.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:34.930
They don't think Homo sapiens
existed over 780,000 years ago.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.770
So they attributed
the footprints

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.540
to a species called
Homo antecessor, an ape

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.430
man that they believe
inhabited Europe at that time.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:49.430
But from the evidence itself,
they could just as well

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.730
have been made by
humans like us.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.940
And there is evidence that
anatomically modern humans

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.095
existed at that time.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.580
This is the Buenos
Aires Skull, which

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:07.463
was discovered early in the
20th century in Argentina.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.860
Researchers were
conducting digging.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.590
And they had gone
down about 45 feet.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:17.710
And they encountered
a solid layer

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.530
of limestone rock
locally known as Tosca.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.590
And after they broke
through that layer,

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:27.770
they found a human skull cap
of an anatomically modern

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:32.880
human type in the
[INAUDIBLE] formation,

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:38.670
which geologists consider to
be 1 and 1/2 million years old.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.810
This discovery was reported
to the scientific world

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.980
in the primary
scientific literature

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:48.640
by the South American
scientist Florentino Ameghino.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:54.600
I reported on this
case and some others

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.220
in this paper presented
at a meeting of the World

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:00.185
Archaeological Congress in
Cape Town, South Africa.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.290
Many people have heard
of Olduvai Gorge.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.400
Many important discoveries
have been made there.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.040
Most people are not aware
of the first discovery that

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:16.190
was made at Olduvai Gorge
by the German scientist Hans

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:20.130
Reck, who reported
on it in 1913.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.510
He found a fairly complete,
anatomically modern

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:28.220
human skeleton-- that's the
skull cap of it-- buried

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.290
in upper bed II
of Olduvai Gorge.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:38.930
Upper bed II of Olduvai
Gorge is between 1.15 and 1.7

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:40.590
million years ago.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.250
It was a very
controversial discovery.

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.710
There were decades
of debate about it.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.030
Many people thought the
debates were finally

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:54.550
settled in the 1970s when
a German scientist named

00:20:54.550 --> 00:21:00.370
Reiner Protsch did a radiocarbon
test on a fragment of bone

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:04.290
that he said was
from Reck's skeleton.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:08.300
And he got an age of
less than 10,000 years.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.520
However, I question
the reliability

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.890
of that given that Reiner
Protsch was removed

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.750
from his position at
Frankfurt University

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.620
after an academic
committee there found him

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.130
guilty of having forged
dozens of radiocarbon dates

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.195
during his long career there.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:36.300
Another report from the
earlier history of archaeology,

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.920
the jaw, fossil
human jar reported

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.515
by Doctor Robert Coliyer.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.840
This anatomically
modern human jaw

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:50.500
was found 16 feet deep in the
Red Crag Formation in England

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.850
at a place called Foxhall.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.050
The Red Crag
Formation, according

00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:02.210
to modern geological studies,
is between two and three

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.730
million years old.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:11.940
In 1979, Mary Leakey announced
the discovery of footprints

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.370
at a place called Laetoli
in the country of Tanzania

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:16.050
in East Africa.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.930
According to her
report, the footprints

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.730
were indistinguishable from
modern human footprints.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.940
Other scientists also agreed.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.470
Paleontologist Tim White wrote,
"Make no mistake about it.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.830
They are like modern
human footprints."

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:37.260
Now, neither Mary
Leakey nor Tim White

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.490
believe those footprints
were made by humans like us.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:45.590
They propose they were made
by some type of ape man

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:49.920
who lived at that time who just
happened to have feet exactly

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.895
like those of
modern human beings.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.990
Actually, we have the
skeletons of the ape men

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.773
that existed at that
time in eastern Africa.

00:22:59.773 --> 00:23:01.106
They're called Australopithecus.

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:05.630
And the foot bones
of Australopithecus

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:06.660
have been discovered.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.450
And their foot is
not exactly like that

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.700
of a modern human being.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.290
They have very long toes, sort
of like short human fingers.

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:18.460
In other words, their feet
were somewhat ape like.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.530
Actually, the only creature
known to science today

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:25.940
from skeletal evidence that
has a foot exactly like that

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.520
of a modern human
being is, in fact,

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.365
modern human beings
like ourselves.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.540
So what did Mary Leakey find?

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.990
I think we have to remain open
to the possibility she found

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:43.380
evidence that humans
like us were present

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.060
almost four million years ago.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.120
The footprints were
found in layers

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.740
of solidified volcanic
ash that were dated

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:58.250
using the potassium argon method
as being 3,700,000 years old.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:04.020
I presented evidence
on this case

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.320
at a meeting of the European
Association of Archaeologists

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.660
that was held in England.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.940
Now, some people might
say, OK, footprints

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:18.010
are perhaps a little
bit ambiguous.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:21.400
It would be better if there
were human skeletal evidence

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.230
almost four million years old.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.960
Such things have
been reported in

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.040
the primary
scientific literature.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.450
For example, the
Italian geologist

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.420
Ragazzoni reported
finding human skeletal

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.050
remains at a place called
Castenedolo in northern Italy.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.130
They were found
in layers of rock

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.270
that modern geologists
consider to be

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:47.430
about four million years old.

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.530
I went to the village
of Castenedolo.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:50.950
I met this gentleman there.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:56.230
And he gave me a copy of a very
rare geological report dealing

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.060
with this discovery.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.210
And from the information
in the report,

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.070
we were able to
locate the place where

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.365
the discoveries were made.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:11.810
Now, the current explanation
of these discoveries

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.220
is, well, it's not
really possible

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.530
that you could have anatomically
modern human skeletons

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:21.860
in layers of rock four
million years old.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:27.860
So the proposal is that
maybe about 4,000 years ago,

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.260
somebody died on the surface.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:35.800
His friends dug a grave
and put the skeleton down

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.270
in that ancient layer of rock.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:42.470
And that's why
you think you have

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:45.150
a human skeleton four
million years old.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.210
Things like this can
happen, technically.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.650
It's called intrusive burial.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:53.960
However, if you look at
Ragazzoni's original reports

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:57.650
in the Italian
language, which I did,

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:00.500
he says-- because
even at the time,

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.330
he was a professional geologist.

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:06.480
He was aware of the possibility
of intrusive burial.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.540
He said, if it had been
an intrusive burial,

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.590
the layers of rock
above the skeleton

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.490
would have been undisturbed.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.640
However, he found
that the layers

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:20.010
of rock above the skeleton were
all intact and undisturbed.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:24.490
Actually, he said each layer has
its own micro-stratigraphy that

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:25.230
was undisturbed.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:31.850
So I take this as evidence
for human presence going back

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:33.385
over four million years.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.600
This is Carlos Ribeiro, who
was the chief government

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.430
geologist of Portugal.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.140
He found hundreds
of human artifacts

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.455
in his country of Portugal.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:49.080
He found them in layers
of rock that date back

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.500
to the early Miocene
Period, which

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:56.170
means they would be about 20
million years old according

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:57.615
to today's understanding.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.630
He, as a professional geologist,
he said they cannot have come

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:05.940
into those layers from any
higher level through any

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.865
fissure, or crack, or all
the usual kinds of counter

00:27:09.865 --> 00:27:10.406
explanations.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:16.410
He displayed the artifacts
in the Museum of Geology

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.120
in Lisbon.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.381
But if you go there today,
you won't see them on display

00:27:21.381 --> 00:27:21.880
anymore.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.300
They're kept in the
cabinets behind me.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.780
But I was able to get
permission from the directors

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.740
of the museum to
study and photograph

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:36.140
some of these human artifacts
from the early Miocene period.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:40.400
I also carefully studied
Ribeiro's original maps,

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.760
and field notes,
and correspondence

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.030
of the museum archives.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.690
And then I went into the
countryside of Portugal

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:51.030
and I relocated
some of the sites

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.310
where he made his discoveries.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.970
This is the quarry
at Murganheira.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.940
And he found human
artifacts there

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.937
in lower Miocene formations.

00:28:03.937 --> 00:28:04.770
This is one of them.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:05.850
It's a flint artifact.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.920
It's interesting what happened.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.690
When Ribeiro was
alive, the artifacts

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:17.240
were displayed in the museum
with labels showing a lower

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:21.030
Miocene age for them,
about 20 million years.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:23.870
After he died, his
colleagues in the museum

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:25.015
did something interesting.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.450
They left the
artifacts on display,

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:31.070
but they wrote new
labels for all of them.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.630
This is the new label they
wrote for the artifact I just

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:34.340
showed you.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.390
Second line gives the
age-- Paleolitico Superior,

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:41.210
Upper Paleolithic Period.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.180
According to geologists
today, that period in Europe

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.720
goes back about 20,000 years.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.860
So it's interesting.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.400
Ribeiro's colleagues
thought 20 million years,

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.920
that's clearly impossible.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.080
20,000 years, that
sounds about right

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.780
for discoveries like this.

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:04.770
So they just wrote new labels
for all of the artifacts.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:09.500
Now, the next generation
of officials in the museum

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.460
just put the entire
collection away.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:16.240
And I'm the first researcher
to see these things in over 50

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.600
years.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.000
I presented a paper on
this case at a meeting

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.280
of the European Association
of Archaeologists

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.210
that was held in Lisbon,
Portugal in the year 2000.

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:33.340
That paper was later
published in a peer reviewed

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:37.490
scientific journal from
Europe, "The Journal of Iberian

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:40.740
Archaeology."

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.590
A case that's
always fascinated me

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:45.190
has been the California
gold mine discoveries.

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:47.650
Gold was discovered
in California.

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:50.870
And miners went to places
like Table Mountain

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:53.180
in Tuolumne County near Sonora.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.070
Actually not too far from here.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.310
And deep inside the
tunnels, the miners

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:02.630
found human bones
and human artifacts.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:06.780
For example, they found
many of these stone mortars

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:07.640
and pestles.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.820
What makes them so
interesting to me

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.070
is they were found in
layers of solid rock

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:16.840
that date to the early part
of the geological period

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.370
called Eocene, which
means they would

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:23.700
be about 50 million years old.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:27.010
Some of the details about the
dating of the discoveries.

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:31.800
It was done in modern times
using the potassium argon

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.730
method and analyzing
the plant and animal

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:38.000
fossils found in
those layers of rock.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.970
These discoveries
were originally

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:44.680
reported to the scientific
world by Doctor JD Whitney, who

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.686
was the chief government
geologist of California.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:55.540
His report was published by
Harvard University in the year

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:56.380
1880.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:00.970
But we don't hear very much
about these discoveries today

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:04.120
because of the process
of knowledge filtration

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:04.980
that I mentioned.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:08.310
This is the anthropologist
William Holmes,

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.460
who worked with the
Smithsonian Institution.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:15.470
And he wrote in his report, "If
Doctor Whitney had understood

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:20.020
the theory of
human evolution, he

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:22.630
would not have published
those discoveries."

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:26.390
In other words, he would've
known that humans could not

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:29.060
possibly have
existed at that time.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.620
A few years ago,
I was a consultant

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.580
for a television documentary
called "The Mysterious

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.676
Origins of Man"
that aired on NBC.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.670
And the producer
of this documentary

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:47.120
had read my book,
"Forbidden Archeology"

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.875
and wanted to include some
cases in the documentary.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.690
I told him he should go to
the Museum of Anthropology

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:56.980
at the University of
California at Berkeley

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:00.780
because artifacts from
the California gold mines

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.030
were still in that collection.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.510
And the museum officials
refused to allow

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:10.100
him to see the artifacts.

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:12.440
Anyways, we were able
to get some photographs

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.250
of the artifacts
that Doctor Whitney

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.020
had taken in the 19th century.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:21.250
It was interesting what happened
when this documentary aired.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:25.590
Actually, many
scientists were outraged

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:31.680
and they wanted the FCC to
investigate NBC, censor NBC,

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:37.790
fine NBC millions of dollars for
having aired this documentary.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:42.760
And I'm happy to say the FCC
didn't do any of those things.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:46.210
But it was interesting that
such attempts were made.

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:48.860
Later, I went back
to the museum myself.

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.230
And I personally was given
access to the discoveries,

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.030
and they are still there.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:33:00.260
They also went out to
Table Mountain near Sonora.

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.260
And we were able to relocate
some of the old 19th century

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.150
gold mining tunnels where these
discoveries were originally

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:09.180
made.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.750
I reported on this case at
this meeting of the World

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:19.150
Archaeological Congress that was
held in Washington, DC in 2003.

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:24.070
So how far back in time can
we go with evidence like this?

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:27.290
In 1862, a scientific
journal called

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:29.890
"The Geologist" published
an interesting report.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.820
An anatomically
modern human skeleton

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.480
was found 90 feet
below the surface

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:41.050
of the ground in Macoupin
County in the state of Illinois

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:42.390
near St. Louis.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.120
According to the report,
above the skeleton

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:50.750
was a thick layer of slate
rock that was unbroken.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:54.280
That's an important detail,
because it kind of rules out

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.630
the intrusive burial hypothesis.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.940
This report from
"Scientific American"

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:04.080
tells of a beautiful,
metallic-- whoops.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.740
I wanted one more detail.

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.370
According to modern
geologists, the layer

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:13.420
where the skeleton was found
is about 300 million years old.

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:18.350
This report from
"Scientific American"

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:20.550
tells of a beautiful
metallic vase

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:25.600
that was found 15 feet deep in
solid rock in Dorchester, which

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.800
is in the Boston area.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.210
According to modern
geological reports,

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:34.760
the age of a formation at
that location and depth

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:38.070
is about 600 million years
from the Cambrian Period.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:42.830
Now, I could actually keep
you here for days, and days,

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:45.719
and days because
there are hundreds

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:49.315
of reports like this in the
primary scientific literature.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.710
I'm not going to do that.

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:56.570
But I'll make some
concluding remarks.

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:59.860
The significance
of this evidence

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.110
would be that it
would contradict

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:05.850
the now dominant ideas
about human origins.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.960
And this was actually
recognized by one

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.650
of the architects of the
current paradigm, Doctor William

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:17.860
Howells of Harvard, who
wrote to me after he

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.890
read "Forbidden Archeology."

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:22.560
And he said a few
things about it.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.990
He said, "'Forbidden
Archaeology' represents much

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:28.690
careful effort in critically
assembling published

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:29.410
materials."

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:32.560
I thought it was nice
that he recognized that.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:36.220
And then he said, "Most
of us, mistakenly or not,

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:39.130
see human evolution with
man emerging rather late."

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:40.505
And that's the actual fact.

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:46.540
Most scientists actually
do see things that way.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:52.850
And he went on to say, "To have
modern human beings appearing

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:56.100
a great deal earlier would be
devastating to the whole theory

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.490
of evolution."

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:03.480
So that's what he saw as the
impact of this kind of evidence

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.670
if it were to be
taken as genuine.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:11.086
Now, not everybody is willing
to do that, admittedly.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:16.450
Now, another
interesting statement

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:18.360
about "Forbidden
Archaeology" was

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:22.130
made by archaeologist Tim
Murray in his review published

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:27.090
in "British Journal for
History of Science."

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:30.515
Now, Murray is
one of my critics.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:38.670
And still, even though
he's not really prepared

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.700
to accept my conclusion, he
has some interesting things

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.505
to say that I think
are worth repeating.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.040
He said, "'Forbidden
Archeology,'" quote,

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.080
"provides the historian of
archaeology with a useful

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.940
compendium of case studies
in the history and sociology

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:58.780
of scientific knowledge, which
can be used to foster debate

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:02.420
within archaeology about how
to describe the epistemology

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.310
of one's discipline."

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:06.880
And that's actually
what I was trying

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:14.190
to do in putting that book
together, to foster debate

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:17.430
within archaeology about the
epistemology of the discipline.

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:22.880
And to see this acknowledged
in the professional literature

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.650
was kind of interesting.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:28.660
Now, he went on to say,
"'Forbidden Archaeology' is

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.840
designed to demolish the case
for biological and cultural

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:36.700
evolution and to advance the
cause of a Vedic alternative."

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.825
Now, I plead guilty
to that indictment.

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:45.900
And it's at this point that many
in the world of science today

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.985
are really going to
have strong objections

00:37:47.985 --> 00:37:50.590
to the kinds of
things that I do.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:54.760
This mention of Vedic
alternative, in other words

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.540
some alternative
that has its roots

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.620
in some religious
or spiritual idea.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:03.170
According to many in
the world of science

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:05.510
today, this is
completely verboten.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:09.530
That's why I called the
book "Forbidden Archeology."

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:16.130
But it's interesting what Tim
Murray had to say about that.

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:21.770
He said, "The 'dominant
paradigm' has changed

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:22.790
and is changing.

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:25.880
And practitioners
openly debate issues

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.860
which go right to the conceptual
core of the discipline.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.070
Whether the Vedas have
a role to play in this

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:36.070
is up to the individual
scientist's concern."

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:39.950
And I think that's an
enlightened attitude

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:41.565
that I can support.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:49.520
No ban, but it's just
up to each individual

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.890
to make up their
mind whether or not

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:56.470
they're going to try to do
something like I'm doing

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:57.400
or agree with it.

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:04.755
Gets you into a whole discussion
about religion and science.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:11.330
Now, I'm going to close
with some of my experiences

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:13.750
in presenting this kind
of thing at university

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:15.830
audiences around the world.

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:18.920
I've spoken at hundreds of
universities around the world.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:22.202
My books are now in about
25 different languages.

00:39:22.202 --> 00:39:23.160
One of them is Russian.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:26.960
So I've lectured at a lot
of universities in Russia,

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.350
from Vladivostok to
Saint Petersburg.

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:31.085
And usually, the
lectures go fine.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.170
At this particular university,
the Tyumen State University,

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:38.670
there was a little
bit of a problem.

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:40.920
Some professors there
had invited me to speak.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.530
And a lecture was scheduled.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:46.940
But when other faculty
members found out

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.710
that I was being
invited to speak,

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:51.780
they approached
the administration

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.990
of the university and
said, we can't have this.

00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:58.953
We shouldn't allow this person
to speak at our university.

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:04.970
First of all, he's
contradicting a dominant theory.

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:07.820
And second, and
even more damningly,

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:13.010
he's doing it from some Vedic
spiritual kind of perspective.

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:18.680
So the president of the
university cancelled

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.840
the lecture.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.490
The professors who invited me
and wanted to hear me speak

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:27.170
went to the president and tried
to get him to change his mind.

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:29.680
But the pressure from the
other side was just too big,

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.120
so the lecture was cancelled.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:34.520
So then, the professors
who invited me

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.395
went to the local branch of the
Russian Academy of Sciences.

00:40:37.395 --> 00:40:39.870
And they spoke to
the director there.

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:41.990
And he said, OK,
if they won't let

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:44.970
him speak at the university,
he can speak here

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:47.240
at the Russian Academy
of Science building.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.510
So they had buses bring
students and professors

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:55.581
from the university to the
Russian Academy of Science

00:40:55.581 --> 00:40:56.080
building.

00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:00.860
And the professors who invited
me said, more people came then

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:06.105
would've come if the lecture
had been held at the university.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:12.140
And then the next year,
something interesting happened.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:15.970
I went back to the
same university,

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:20.430
and I was able to speak
at the biology department

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:21.260
there no problem.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.090
I guess they just thought,
better let him talk

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:27.910
and let people just make
up their minds about what

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:28.480
he's saying.

00:41:29.917 --> 00:41:30.750
They're intelligent.

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.935
They'll be able to figure out
if they can agree or not agree.

00:41:34.935 --> 00:41:37.185
It's not going to be the end
of the world if he talks.

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:41.350
These are some of my works--
"The Forbidden Archaeologist,"

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:44.100
"Forbidden Archaeology," "Hidden
History of the Human Race,"

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:48.790
"Human Devolution," "My
Science, My Religion."

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:51.203
Some contact information.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:42:01.160
And if you do like the kinds
of things you've heard today

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.110
and are interested
in hearing more,

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:05.330
you may want to
come on this cruise

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:09.960
where I'm the speaker
in June, 2015.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:15.305
Go up and see the glaciers
and hear some weird stuff.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:23.950
So I have ended five minutes
before I intended to.

00:42:25.487 --> 00:42:28.896
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.760
I did want to leave
some time for questions.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.760
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.878
We'll start from here.

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:41.000
AUDIENCE: So I was also hoping
to get your point of view

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:49.010
from Vedic or Purana on
the how old is humanity,

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:50.630
and what did you find there.

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:52.870
Because I think in
the talk, somebody

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:57.200
replied that you would also come
to know about religious books,

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.480
like Ramayana or
Mahabharata, how much of that

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:04.340
is true based on the
archaeologic [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:11.500
MICHAEL CREMO: Well, it depends
upon what kind of circles

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.230
I'm speaking in.

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:18.680
For example, if I go to
Rishikesh or Haridwar

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.370
in the Himalayan
mountains and sit around

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:26.710
with a bunch of Vedic
scholars who accept statements

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:31.260
from Vedic literature
as evidence, then,

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:38.590
well, I can say in
the Bhagavad Purana,

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:42.070
there are statements
that humans were existing

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:45.780
during the [INAUDIBLE]
Period, which

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:49.565
is in the first part of
the Culpa, or the day of--

00:43:49.565 --> 00:43:52.100
and they'll understand
what I'm saying.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.710
And they'll accept
that as evidence.

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:58.850
If I'm at a meeting of the
World Archaeological Congress,

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:04.994
or speaking at
Google headquarters,

00:44:04.994 --> 00:44:07.780
my audience is not
necessarily going

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:12.100
to accept a statement
from the Bhagavad

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:17.800
Purana or the
Mahabharata as evidence.

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:27.460
So it's like if you
go to a baseball game,

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:31.350
you have to play by the
baseball game rules.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:38.360
And one of the rules is that
you can't use a statement

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:44.460
from a spiritual
text as evidence.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:46.240
Now, you can.

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:53.310
So for the people who do--
I get questions like yours

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:54.490
from many people.

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:55.920
They want to say,
OK, you've given

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.160
all this archaeological
evidence that you

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:02.830
say is consistent with
Vedic texts, which talk,

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.530
according to you,
in a general way

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:07.730
about extreme human antiquity.

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:09.941
But what do they actually
say, the Vedic literature

00:45:09.941 --> 00:45:10.440
themselves?

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.860
So for such people,
I'm writing a book

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:18.380
in which I will collect
all those Vedic statements.

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.510
And then they can see.

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:26.900
But that's not the audience
that I am presented with today,

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.230
that I'm presenting to today.

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:33.387
It's not the audience that
I get at universities.

00:45:33.387 --> 00:45:35.220
It's not the audience
that I get at meetings

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.700
of the World Archaeological
Congress or European

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:40.200
Association of Archaeologists.

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.470
A good question.

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:43.980
And I'm writing a
book to answer it.

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:47.240
AUDIENCE: Could you say more
about the actual contradiction

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:53.200
between the extreme antiquity
of humans and evolution?

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.950
Because in my mind,
it would just seem,

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:58.420
well, the evolution
theory could just

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:01.840
be oh, you just have to push
it back a few million years

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.219
and it could still hold up.

00:46:03.219 --> 00:46:05.760
It's just that it happened a
lot earlier than people thought.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.020
That seems like a
simplistic resolution.

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.160
But is there
something else that's

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.520
constraining the timeline which
makes it really inconsistent?

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:17.480
MICHAEL CREMO: Well,
it's a good question.

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:22.140
I'll refer you back to the
statement of William Howells,

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:27.350
who said, if the kind of
evidence that I'm talking about

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:33.380
is consistent, it's inconsistent
with the general theory

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:34.060
of evolution.

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:38.140
Because he said-- I
didn't quote everything

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.770
he wrote to me in his letter.

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:41.540
He said, but you're
putting evidence

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:44.540
for an anatomically
modern human presence

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:48.400
before the known presence
of even the most simple apes

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:52.600
and monkeys, which would be
our prospective ancestors.

00:46:54.150 --> 00:47:01.310
So you could conceivably
come up with another version

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:03.280
of the evolutionary
theory, but it

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:07.970
would be quite
different from anything

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:10.310
that's being proposed today.

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:17.210
So that would be one
possible response,

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:20.130
to do something like that.

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:26.640
And if you feel inspired
to do it, then right on.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.380
This

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:30.370
AUDIENCE: So you talked a lot
regarding your critics throwing

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:33.400
out the archaeological
evidence based on it just

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.340
being out of their paradigm,
filtering it away, and so on.

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:40.300
But some of the critics who've
truly engaged your work,

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:42.360
has it been just
that, or do they

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:46.400
have valid,
scientific reasons why

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.970
they're refuting your evidence?

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.640
MICHAEL CREMO: Normally--
I mean, everybody's

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:55.430
going to have to make up their
own minds about these things.

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:59.420
What I try to do in
"Forbidden Archeology"

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:08.790
was provide in each case all
of the different opinions,

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:10.700
all sides of the
question, and leave it up

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.470
to the reader to make up
their own mind whether they

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:16.330
think it's valid or not.

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:23.880
Typically, the
reactions are to suggest

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:27.385
first of all, it's old evidence.

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.485
In other words, but
this is very selective.

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:36.440
It's the idea that--
kind of like a milk

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:40.090
carton, scientific evidence
got an expiration date.

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:44.610
That any science
conducted before midnight,

00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:49.390
January 1, 1900
somehow has expired.

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:56.360
But I noticed that those who
make that type of criticism

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.820
are applying it
very selectively,

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:03.580
because the standard
textbooks of archaeology

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:05.750
are full of
discoveries that were

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:10.855
made in the 19th century,
early 20th century.

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:16.830
So it can't just be that
just because something

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:20.060
is from the earlier
history of archaeology,

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:21.170
it has to be wrong.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:26.280
Another category
of objection has

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:31.350
to do with lists of ways in
which something could be wrong.

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:35.070
It's possible there was a hoax.

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:38.830
It's possible it could've
slipped in through a fissure.

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:44.050
It's possible that the original
investigator made a mistake.

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:46.445
It's possible this,
it's possible that.

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:50.960
My general response to
that category of criticism

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:54.120
is everything is
certainly possible.

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:57.590
But if you're going to
proceed in a scientific way,

00:49:57.590 --> 00:50:02.120
you should be able to show that
in this particular location,

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.290
there was a fissure.

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:07.350
There were artifacts
on the surface that

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:09.800
resemble those that were
found at that level.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.790
And there definitely was a way
they could have got down there.

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:21.670
So that's another
category of objection.

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:26.130
And of course, I'm willing
to engage on that level.

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:27.820
And it's one of
the things I hope

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:34.610
to accomplish with the book is
to have a second look at some

00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:35.740
of these things.

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:39.070
And if there are
objections, raise them.

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:44.650
AUDIENCE: My question
is you mentioned

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:50.300
about a guy that in 19th century
found a jawbone in a layer that

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.970
was 400,000 year old.

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:55.035
How did they knew
in 19th century

00:50:55.035 --> 00:50:58.650
that this particular
layer was that old

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:00.040
without any dating methods?

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:00.790
MICHAEL CREMO: OK.

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:01.920
It's a good question.

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:05.720
What I said, if you
listened carefully,

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.032
was that according
to modern geologists,

00:51:09.032 --> 00:51:12.880
the layer is a certain
number of years old.

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:21.300
At that time, they characterized
things in another way,

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:26.620
not using necessarily
years, but characterizing

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:33.350
things as early Pleistocene,
early middle Pleistocene,

00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:34.790
and things of that sort.

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:46.440
So if you translate those
terms to the modern dates that

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:50.310
are attached to those
terms, it works out.

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:56.980
So they would have
said, that jawbone

00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:02.830
was found in an early
Pleistocene layer, which

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:08.375
would mean it would have
to be several hundred

00:52:08.375 --> 00:52:10.895
thousand years old at least.

00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:14.390
That's why I went by the modern.

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:18.530
To give an age in years, I
went by the modern geological

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:22.410
dating of those
layers at Abbeville.

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:26.700
For example,
Ribeiro, he would've

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:31.160
said these stone tools
are early Miocene.

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:35.940
Now, in the 19th century,
the conception of the Miocene

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:36.650
was there.

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:40.800
But it wouldn't be exactly
the number of years

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.270
that we now attach to it.

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:45.630
But still, it was
considered to be very old

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:49.950
in terms of the succession
of geological layers.

00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:57.140
But just for current reference,
I give the estimates in years

00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:01.800
that modern geologists have
determined for these layers.

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:04.870
The same with Doctor
Whitney's report.

00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:10.630
He would have said, these layers
are from the Pliocene Period,

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:13.285
which is an old
geological period.

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:18.360
Now, the layers that
he considered Pliocene

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.300
are considered to be Eocene.

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:24.865
And the age for them is between
30 and 50 million years.

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:30.800
In the 19th century,
they wouldn't

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:34.760
be using the same number
of years that we do.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:38.510
But they had a concept
still that, in terms

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:42.430
of the system they were
using, it was older.

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:45.490
They expected human
beings like us

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:51.710
to appear only in the very
latest, very recent Pleistocene

00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:52.210
Period.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:01.220
So if it was from the middle
or the early Pleistocene,

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:03.550
that would be
anomalous for them.

00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:06.755
Is that helping?

00:54:08.037 --> 00:54:09.620
AUDIENCE: Let's say
it's 19th century.

00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:12.650
We dig a hole in the ground
and we find few layers.

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:16.300
And they somehow decided,
oh, this layer is younger,

00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:19.410
this is older
based on the depth.

00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:21.790
But then they put
some dates to it.

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:26.280
And I think it's almost
the same as right now.

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.690
We also have layers and they
have dates attached to them.

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:34.430
And my concern is that maybe we
just attached the dates badly.

00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:35.970
How do you know exactly?

00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:38.370
Just like they might be
wrong about the dates

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:40.770
in 19th century, they might
be wrong about the dates

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:41.490
right now.

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:43.130
MICHAEL CREMO: I'm
prepared to accept

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:47.850
that if we want to say we
don't know how old anything is,

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:52.430
really, and all the dating
methods are unreliable,

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:54.030
we could certainly do that.

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:56.130
That's one approach to take.

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:58.530
The approach, however,
that I've taken

00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:00.420
is you have to have
some kind of framework

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:01.960
for discussing things.

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:07.786
And I'm addressing an audience
of geologists, archaeologists,

00:55:07.786 --> 00:55:08.452
paleontologists.

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:15.530
And my way of creating a frame
of reference for the discussion

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:19.280
is to say, according to
methods that you consider

00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:24.520
reliable-- radiocarbon dating,
potassium argon dating, uranium

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:27.810
series dating, zircon
fission-track dating--

00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:32.350
these layers belong to
this geological period,

00:55:32.350 --> 00:55:37.730
which you consider to be
millions of years old.

00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:42.110
Now, if you want to take the
approach that, well, nothing

00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:44.840
is reliable and we
don't know anything

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.290
about the real age
of anything, that's

00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:50.580
certainly an approach
that could be taken.

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:58.670
And some out in the world--
say if you're a young Earth

00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:03.210
Christian creationist who
believes that the Earth is

00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:07.870
no older than
10,000 years, you're

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:11.340
going to be very critical of all
the different dating methods.

00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:16.190
And that may be the
way that such a person

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:18.150
would approach this.

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:21.680
The Vedic time scales
are more or less

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:25.260
consistent with the
modern scientific time

00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:29.190
scales for the universe, and
the Earth, and things like that.

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:34.280
So perhaps I'm not
motivated sufficiently

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:39.451
to try to dismiss all the
different scientific dating

00:56:39.451 --> 00:56:39.950
methods.

00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:45.600
AUDIENCE: Are there
cases where the age

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:50.740
of the layer and the dating,
some kind of scientific dating,

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:56.315
of the actual bones, say, is
the same and is very ancient?

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:07.330
MICHAEL CREMO: Well, there are--
if we're talking about bone,

00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:10.090
there are only a
very few methods

00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:15.700
that can be used to
directly date bone.

00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.460
There's the radiocarbon method.

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:20.460
But that works only
back to about 50,000

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:23.030
or 100,000 years at
most because it's

00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:29.780
based on the decay
of carbon-14, which

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.350
has a half life of
about 5,000 years.

00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:35.180
And after about 20
half lives, there's

00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:36.225
nothing left to measure.

00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:40.490
There's the uranium
series method,

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:45.430
which is based on
the decay of uranium

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:47.745
to different daughter isotopes.

00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.990
And by measuring the
ratios of those isotopes

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:55.280
and making certain assumptions
about intake and outflow

00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:02.350
of ions, you can
date bone going back

00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:04.473
a few hundred thousand years.

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:10.230
But if we're talking
about the formations that

00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:15.450
are millions of years old-- say
early Pleistocene formations,

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:19.270
Pliocene formations,
Miocene formations,

00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:21.430
there's no method
that will allow

00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:24.035
you to directly date the bone.

00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:32.240
Now, let's look, for example,
at the Castenedolo discoveries

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:37.795
from Italy, where Professor
Ragazzoni found human bones

00:58:37.795 --> 00:58:42.070
in layers of rock from
the early Pliocene

00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:44.610
Period, or middle
Pliocene Period.

00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:50.860
There were attempts about
40 years ago to date

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:55.010
those bones using the
radiocarbon method,

00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:57.000
and a young age was obtained.

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:02.850
Now, the problem
with that is if you

00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:07.350
have a bone that really is,
say four million years old,

00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:09.670
and it gets contaminated
with the least

00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:12.940
amount of modern
carbon-14-- which

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:17.510
can happen in numerous ways
through the groundwater,

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:21.530
through just even a
scientist touching

00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:25.080
the bone it can contaminate
it with recent carbon.

00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:30.570
Then even if the bone really
is, say, four million years old,

00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:32.640
if it's gotten
contaminated with the least

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:37.230
amount of modern carbon, which
can take place through bacteria

00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:40.790
infiltrating it, through
any number of methods,

00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:45.390
it will show an age of
100,000 years or less.

00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:49.900
So each case has to be
looked at very carefully.

00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:58.440
So there are cases--
but as I said,

00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:03.860
the methods that you can
use to directly date bone

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:10.355
are limited to bones of, say, a
few thousand years old or less.

01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:14.330
For many the cases
that I'm talking about,

01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:16.190
the appropriate
method is to date

01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:20.270
the age of the formation
at which the bone is found

01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:22.080
and show it's not intrusive.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.830
AUDIENCE: But you could say,
OK, well this layer is more

01:00:26.830 --> 01:00:29.360
than 300,000 or
400,000 years old,

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.890
and the bone is shown to
be greater than 300,000,

01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:35.510
something greater than 300,000.

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:37.715
But are there any
cases like that, then?

01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:42.000
MICHAEL CREMO: I can't
think of any right offhand

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.450
because usually the attempt
is to show the bone is,

01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:51.650
in the kinds of cases
that I'm dealing with,

01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:56.290
there are attempts to
show that bone is not

01:00:56.290 --> 01:01:00.710
as old as it's purported to be.

01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:02.940
Undoubtedly, there
are cases like that.

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:10.030
But I can't-- I'm not able to
give you one right off the top

01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:10.850
of my head.

01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:15.240
AUDIENCE: I'm curious whether,
from your perspective,

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:18.350
the scientific evidence is
sufficient to convince you

01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:19.800
by itself.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.290
And if it is sufficient
to convince you by itself,

01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:24.990
then why refer to the
Vedic texts at all?

01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:27.360
Is there something special
about the Vedic texts

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.810
that mystical texts from
other cultures lack?

01:01:33.407 --> 01:01:34.240
MICHAEL CREMO: Yeah.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.100
It's a very good question.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:43.160
And I am open about what my
epistemological commitments

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:43.660
are.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:51.300
And if we study the
Vedic epistemology,

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:57.370
it tells us there are different
ways of getting evidence.

01:01:57.370 --> 01:01:59.320
There are different
categories of evidence.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.120
They're called pramanas.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.490
One is called the
pratyaksha pramana.

01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:07.050
That means sense
evidence, things

01:02:07.050 --> 01:02:09.075
we can touch, see, measure.

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:15.180
Then there's anumana, which
means logical inference.

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:18.300
If it's like this and this,
then it must be like that.

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:23.120
These methods for getting
knowledge about-- especially

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.010
about things that are beyond
the range of the senses,

01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:30.810
like what was happening millions
or billions of years ago,

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:32.595
they become problematic.

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:38.890
And therefore, according
to the Vedic epistemology,

01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:42.743
one can rely upon another
type of evidence-- testimony.

01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:47.440
It's called the
sabda pramana, which

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:52.290
is based on the idea there
is some kind of higher

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:54.910
intelligence that is
aware of these things

01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:58.510
and can communicate
information about them.

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:04.160
And that's considered to be
a higher kind of evidence.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:12.150
However, as I said, that is not
the epistemological assumption

01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:14.800
that's dominant today
in the world of science.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:18.180
If you actually go back
in European science,

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:22.600
even to 300 or 400
years ago, you'll

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.890
find that many of
the scientists had

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:33.900
similar epistemological
commitments where they were--

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:40.640
I mean, even, say, somebody like
Michael Faraday, a physicist

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:47.457
who did a lot of the work
that unified electricity

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:48.040
and magnetism.

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:53.020
He worked along with
Maxwell to come up

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:57.750
with the electromagnetic
field equations.

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:03.670
The reason why he
started looking for unity

01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:06.620
was because he was a member
of a Christian sect called

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:10.620
the Sandemanians, who had the
idea that all energies are

01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:11.820
unified in God.

01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:17.240
So based on his
spiritual conviction

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:23.120
that energies are
unified, he was

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:28.000
inspired to do the work
that led to his integration

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.380
of electricity and magnetism.

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:34.380
And he also tried to bring
gravity into the equation.

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.790
It's something that's still
troubling physicists today,

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:42.090
how to bring gravity
into the whole picture.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:49.790
But I understand that's not
the dominant epistemological

01:04:49.790 --> 01:04:51.330
position today.

01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:53.330
So I put that aside.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.210
But you're asking me why.

01:04:57.210 --> 01:05:04.430
Say if-- so my
position is I'm going

01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:08.930
to represent an idea
from the Vedic text

01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:13.510
if there is any evidence that
can be used to justify it.

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:15.280
If there were no
evidence, then I

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:20.230
wouldn't have anything to say
about it in scientific circles.

01:05:22.202 --> 01:05:25.070
On my own, I might still
have the conviction

01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:27.020
that that's true.

01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:31.340
But I might stop trying
to represent that idea.

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:35.490
Say if somebody could convince
me that there is absolutely

01:05:35.490 --> 01:05:41.130
no archaeological evidence
for extreme human antiquity,

01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:46.200
I would still believe in extreme
human antiquity for the reasons

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.340
that I stated.

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:52.370
But I might stop trying to
talk about it to audiences that

01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:55.913
don't have similar
epistemological convictions.

01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:58.390
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:00.235
I think with that, we
will end the session.

01:06:00.235 --> 01:06:03.170
And we'll thank Michael Cremo
for visiting Google once again

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:05.590
and giving us this
wonderful talk.
