00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.530
Have you ever tried VR?

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.370
Did you ever feel a little sick?

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:11.230
Maybe it’s not all in your head, maybe it’s
in your chromosomes.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.830
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.880
Virtual Reality is racing full steam ahead
into being one of the fastest growing areas

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.089
of future entertainment.

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.240
I’ve tried it.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.869
Full headset with goggles and headphones.

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.820
I found it kind of fun, but it’s still a
ways off from revolutionizing the world.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:34.789
One main challenge is that men seem to have
a better experience with it than women.

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.340
Before we get to that let’s take a look
at how VR works in the brain.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.410
One study published in the journal Nature
Neuroscience found that the brain treats the

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.110
space in VR as different from the real world.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.399
Neurophysicist from UCLA were originally searching
for clues on Alzheimer's, specifically in

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.440
regards to the hippocampus.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.199
A part of the brain that deals with memory
but also with spacial awareness and creating

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.140
a mental map of the environment.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.570
In the study they tracked the neuron activity
of rats as they entered a room and then as

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.050
they entered the same room but only on a VR
system.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.729
They were studying to see if the brain would
respond the same way with both rooms, even

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.820
though the VR room wouldn’t have smell or
sound.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.680
The researchers found that the brain responded
very differently depending on the situation.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.540
When the rats were in the VR room their neurons
fired randomly, suggesting they had no idea

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.640
where they were in space.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.320
And what’s more interesting, half the neurons
that fired in the real room were fired in

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.320
the VR room.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.350
It was like half of their neurons were shut
down in the fake space.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.159
So maybe there’s something missing from
VR with our other senses.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.010
The researchers think we take in clues from
sounds and smells to figure out where we are

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.010
in real space.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.229
But headphones easily fix the sound problem,
but other problems are a little tricker to

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.229
solve.

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.850
VR is also missing virtual movement, our inner
sense called theta-phase precession, and our

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.479
sense of where our body parts are, which is
called proprioception.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.260
But some companies are working on this, like
the Virtuix Omni, which is treadmill to walk

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.729
on as you use the Oculus Rift.

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.340
You’re attached to this harness and almost
buckled into this cage so you won’t fall

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.340
off.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.240
Writer Raymond Wong compared it to a baby
walker.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.200
And VR is missing things from its visual systems
too, something that could lead to gender bias

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.200
in VR.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.950
Basically there’s two ways your eyes perceive
things like depth.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.840
Motion parallax, is when something is moving
towards you it gets bigger in your perception.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.790
And shape-from-shading, when you move around
an object your eye picks up on subtle clues

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.900
from shadows.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.030
As you move around the object, the shadows
change.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.300
But your eye does this by flickering just
ever so slightly.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.860
But sex hormones act on the eye, strongly.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.550
So men and women literally see things differently.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.709
Women tend to rely on shape from shading to
judge depth and dimension, men seem to rely

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:29.910
on motion parallax.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.570
VR, while it’s made great strides in the
past decade, still isn't the greatest when

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.400
it comes to shape from shading.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.150
According to Danah Boyd Principal Researcher
at Microsoft Research and the founder of Data

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.840
&amp; Society Research Institute, computers are
terrible at simulating that tiny, constant

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.970
flickering of your eyes.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.739
So VR systems mostly rely on motion parallax.

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.040
What does that mean?

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.239
Well Boyd suggests it could be a possible
reason so many women get sick from VR.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.739
A system that makes half the world’s population
sick, still needs more research.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.510
But it’s definitely something to look forward
to in the future.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.300
Just like all the cool innovations Intel is
working on!

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.380
Intel creates the breakthrough technologies
that make amazing experiences possible.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.560
Having Intel inside makes for better experiences
outside.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.890
Intel drives innovation with products like
processors, wearables and IOT devices, and

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.200
within data centers.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.570
In the PC and beyond.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.720
While VR gets better every year, one thing
it seems to be getting really good at is virtual

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.720
sex!

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.560

VR?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.590
