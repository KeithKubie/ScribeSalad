[music playing]

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.210
NARRATOR: Across the
globe, over 1.5 billion

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.210
people believe in
reincarnation, including

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.670
nearly all Eastern philosophies
as well as the Kabbalistic sect

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.210
of Judaism.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.210
Tibetans, we believe rebirth.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.880
In the Kabbalistic
tradition of Judaism,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.710
reincarnation is considered
a fundamental belief.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.920
And unlike other religions,
which believe you have only one

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.620
lifetime in which
to get it right,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.120
in the Kabbalistic
tradition, it is

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.080
believed that souls are
given multiple chances

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.120
to get it right.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.960
So souls are believed to
reincarnate time after time.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.120

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.960
NARRATOR: The idea of the
preexistence of the soul

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.040
was once a significant doctrine
of the Christian canon,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.620
before it had been
excised from the teachings

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.460
by Roman Emperor Justinian
the Great in 553 AD.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.290
The early Christian
belief in reincarnation

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.170
was eventually
declared a heresy.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.250
Instead of recycling to
earth over and over again,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.920
you now only have one
destination after this life.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.790
That destination is either
Heaven or it's Hell,

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.830
depending on how
you behaved in life.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.330
It was used as a
control mechanism.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.830
JONATHAN YOUNG:
In ancient Greece,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.290
Socrates, Pythagoras,
and Plato all

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.330
commented on the possibility
of reincarnation.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.830
In the dialogues, Plato says,
"I am confident that there truly

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.420
is such a thing as living
again, and that the living

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.290
spring from the dead."

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.040
So here's a strong
sense of reincarnation.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.710
CAROLINE CORY: There are
many beliefs around the world

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.380
that reincarnation exists.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.040
Some people believe that
certain types of souls

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.880
are able to come back--

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.290
not just in one body, but
in several bodies at once--

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.500
to perform specific tasks.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.460
And that's one of
the reasons why there

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.170
are so many more
people on the earth

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.670
today than there used to be.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.290
And, also, it is
possible for you

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.500
to reincarnate
from other planets.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.330
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
Oftentimes, when reincarnation

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.710
is discussed, we only
talk about it that people

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.500
are reincarnated here on Earth.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.500
And I personally always thought
that that was a limiting idea

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.330
of reincarnation.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.420
I think even
extraterrestrial organisms--

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.000
biological ones--
would be reincarnated

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.920
throughout the universe.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.920
[music playing]

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.250
NARRATOR: If souls
are indeed recycling

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.420
through various bodies--

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.750
as so many cultures both ancient
and modern have proposed--

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.210
is this simply the natural
continuation of life,

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.380
or might this
process be directed

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.170
toward some greater end?

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.170
One that reaches
far beyond Earth.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.420
Perhaps further clues can be
found by examining the stories

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.120
of those who claim to
have been reincarnated

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.210
with a specific
purpose for humanity.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.250
