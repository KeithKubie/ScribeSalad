00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.760
Vaginal births are OUT and surgical births
are IN!

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.340
So......yay science?

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.660
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.150
Yall have heard of c-sections, right?

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.520
It's like...a surgical birth.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.210
The surgeon makes an incision in mom's abdomen
and uterus to pull the baby out.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.890
The Cesarean Section originally emerged as
an alternative to vaginal birth in the case

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:25.890
of an emergency.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.310
For instance: if the umbilical cord prolapses
or --more commonly--if the labor fails to

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.310
progress.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.180
In recent years, however, c-sections have
become WILDLY popular.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.629
In 1970 only 1 in 20 newborn babies was delivered
via c-section and now it's....1 IN 3.

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.760
Some Obgyn's predict that it will be MORE
popular than vaginal birth in our lifetime.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.340
Is this trend a problem?

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.269
Weeeeellll.....there are definitely some things
to consider.

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.379
For one, it's an actual surgery.

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.289
So like most surgeries, when it's not a medical
necessity, it increases the risk of complication.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.449
C-section also carries triple the death rate
that vaginal birth does, and for the mom,

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.280
recovery is much longer and more difficult
- 20% of patients experience abdominal pain

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.460
for months.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.619
For babies, those that aren't delivered vaginally
don't get the same exposure to their mom's

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.100
microbiome.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.200
C-section babies have markedly fewer "good
gut bacteria", and they're at a higher risk

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.030
for allergies, asthma, and poor health later
in life.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.979
It is also the case that more than a third
of c-sections in the US are performed too

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:25.979
early.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.210
Of course, premature birth is a health risk.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.290
So, why have c-sections become so popular
then?

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.680
One big factor is efficiency.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.920
Doctors may find it more efficient to make
an incision and pull the baby out than to

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.219
have to guide the baby through the vaginal
canal.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.649
Birth is also easier scheduling-wise if you
can just set a date and put it on the calendar.

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.050
This may help doctors run a tighter schedule
and patients to feel more in control.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.530
It's also worth noting that one study found
unplanned c-sections spike right around the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.560
end of the work day, between 3 and 4PM.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.170
I actually know a woman who was pressured
by her doctor and he told her straight up

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.320
he had dinner plans.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.549
Still, probably the largest force driving
an increase in c-sections is that, awhile

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.259
back, a handful of studies found that giving
vaginal birth to another baby after a c-section

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.729
may increase the chance that your uterus will
rupture.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.320
However, more recent studies questioned the
findings, and found that this is the case

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.090
for...less than 1% of women.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.580
In response to the trend, the American College
for OB/GYNS and the Society for Maternal-Fetal

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.150
Medicine are calling for fewer c-sections
with guidelines recommending that doctors

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.810
and patients allow the proper time it takes
for nature to take its course.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.250
They say that the rates are too high and the
risks are too great -- and they advise that

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.820
doctors need to refocus on using the procedure
as a last resort.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.700
What do you folks think about c-sections and
the current trend?

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.079
