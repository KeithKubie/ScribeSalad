00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now I want to ask you one quiz question.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What if we wanted to return or to print all values of the filled-in formula

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
rather than just the first one?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
For some of these formulas there are multiple possibilities of digits to fill in

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that would all work equally well.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If we wanted to see them all, if we wanted to have them all printed out, what should we do?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Should we change the function fill-in to return a list rather than generate results?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Should we change the single word "return" to "print" in the function solve?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Should we change the function valid to do something else to validate

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
each of these possible formulas?

00:00:45.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Or do we need to add a new function to do something that we haven't done before?
