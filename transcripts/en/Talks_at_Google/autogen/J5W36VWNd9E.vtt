00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.570
DANIELLE KRETTEK: Krista
Tippett is here with us

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.810
today, which is just
absolutely amazing.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.270
I'll read a little
bit about her first.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.820
And then we will just
dive right into it.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.970
Krista Tippett is a Peabody
Award-winning broadcaster,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.120
National Humanities medalist,
and a "New York Times"

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.530
bestselling author.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.930
She founded and leads
the On Being project,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.690
hosts the globally-esteemed
"On Being" public radio show

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.110
and podcast, and curates the
Civil Conversations project,

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.870
an emergent approach to
conversation and relationship

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.970
across the differences
of our age.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.150
Her books include, my
favorite, "Becoming Wise--

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.850
an Inquiry into the
Mystery and Art of Living,"

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.470
and "Einstein's God--

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.810
Conversations about Science
and the Human Spirit."

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.510
And I think, literally, even
just with those two titles,

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.110
you see this beautiful and vast
spectrum that Krista covers

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.410
and that is so perfect for us
here at Google-- literally,

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.580
from mystery and spirit to
the human spirit to Einstein.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.250
It's just so perfect to have
her here in conversation here.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.349
We're so lucky.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:05.890
And I think, really--
we were talking

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.270
the other evening about
what it means to inquire

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.380
and the idea of asking
these questions,

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.100
these fundamental questions,
that get to the essence of what

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.540
does it mean to be human?

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.940
What does it mean to
be human together?

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.980
And what are the
lessons we can learn

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.930
in this practice with everyone?

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.260
So we'll look at that today.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.950
But first, I'll just share
a quick funny little moment,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.080
which was, as I was
preparing for this--

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.280
I've been listening
to Krista for years.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.820
A couple of years ago, as I
was actually founding the lab,

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.950
I found myself
listening to Krista.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.980
I'd discovered her
then rediscovered her

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.250
in the project.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.310
And every day-- it
was over a break--

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.450
I was listening to one a day
or even two a day sometimes--

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.380
her podcast.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.110
And what I found is
they were so enlivening.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.150
And they really helped
birth the Empathy Lab.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.441
So I feel like I wouldn't be
here if it wasn't for her.

00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:55.997
So it's a treat
to have you here.

00:01:55.997 --> 00:01:58.330
But what was funny is thinking
about preparing for this.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.829
And I was like, should I go
back and listen to every podcast

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.440
and find my favorite moments?

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.020
And then it just would have
been this incredible mountain

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.169
of beauty that I would
have clearly fallen

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.804
under because there was
just too much there.

00:02:10.804 --> 00:02:12.220
So what was beautiful
was actually

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.290
reflecting on the thing
that touches me most

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.590
about her conversations and
these beautiful moments that

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.470
unfold between her and other
people, even across distances--

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.460
are just, in the
moment that you're

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.920
listening, what comes
alive in you, what

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.580
echoes in you in the days,
weeks, months, years to follow,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.160
and how these sparks
come alive in us.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.920
So that leads us to this
form of listening that--

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.440
I feel like I really
learned to listen, even

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.489
just in being presence with
her before knowing her.

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.780
And I feel like we're all so
lucky to have her speaking

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.890
to us about listening today.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.765
And so I'll just start
with one of her quotes

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:49.060
that really, I feel,
touches the core of what

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.390
this art is all about,
which is, "listening

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.220
is about being actively present.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.040
It's not just about being quiet.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.830
I meet others with
the life I've lived,

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.200
not just with my questions."

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.500
So let's welcome Krista
with open minds and hearts

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.555
and, of course, our
ears, to share more

00:03:10.555 --> 00:03:12.077
of her gracious wisdom with us.

00:03:12.077 --> 00:03:13.660
And of course, we
are trying something

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.276
a little different today
with this intimate gathering.

00:03:16.276 --> 00:03:18.150
So what we'll do is,
Krista will share a bit.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.810
We'll probably go
back and forth.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.990
And then we'd love to open it up
is a real conversation for all

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.170
of us to live in together.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.470
So if you have any questions,
definitely, listen.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.390
Don't think about
them the whole time.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.310
But as they rise up
in the room, please

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.480
feel brave and courageous.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.890
This is what this
moment's about.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:33.760
So thank you.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.740
And welcome, Krista.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.615
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.470
Well, it's exciting to be here.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.630
I love this invitation.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.145
I feel like I made
too many notes.

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:50.560
And so Danielle and I
decided-- because I really

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.760
love a conversation.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.230
And the more I do this,
the longer I live,

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.580
the more I trust that.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.530
And I like being on
both sides of it.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.460
So I've just said to her, I
want her to interrupt me and ask

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.000
questions.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.025
And I really would like to open
it up and be in conversation

00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:03.524
with you.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.850
The request was to talk a little
bit about the art of listening.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.030
And I'm a person who
listens for a living.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.640
But one of the things--

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.487
what you were saying
about that experience

00:04:18.487 --> 00:04:19.695
of listening to the podcast--

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.282
listening is about presence,
which I'm going to say again.

00:04:26.282 --> 00:04:27.990
But what's so
fascinating-- and you and I

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.448
talked about this
the other night--

00:04:29.448 --> 00:04:33.010
is that I am usually
not in the room.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.820
In fact, I'm often
halfway across the world

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.550
from the people I'm
in conversation with.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.110
And the technology of
radio, of podcast--

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.470
these are not
physical experiences.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.190
But my conversations,
because of the topic,

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.370
and then because the
medium allows for this,

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.714
are very, very intimate.

00:04:59.714 --> 00:05:01.630
And they're intimate
between me and the person

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.840
I'm speaking with.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.200
And then it's an
intimate experience--

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.939
the magic of radio--

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.980
and of course, that's just
the old-fashioned word

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.670
for podcasting--

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.320
is that it is profoundly
individual and also absolutely

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.500
communal at the same time.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.470
And there's also a time
shift that goes on.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.920
It defies time because, in
the moment that you listen,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.100
you're in that room
when it happened.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.790
And I think of a conversation--

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.860
what I hope for every
conversation I have

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.570
is that it is an adventure
and that something will happen

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.190
that will surprise both
of us and, as a listener,

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.520
you also are there for
that moment of surprise.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.922
So I was thinking a lot
about that, actually,

00:05:51.922 --> 00:05:53.380
as I was thinking
about being here.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.020
Because we're talking
about human presence.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.800
And there is this
miracle that it's

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.774
absolutely possible with and
through and in technology.

00:06:04.774 --> 00:06:06.190
And I think that
what you're about

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.790
is figuring out
how to amplify that

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.780
and to explore all the
possibilities in that.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:20.380
So I think of listening
as a basic social art.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.930
I think of social
art and virtues

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.860
as spiritual technologies.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.470
And that is to say,
just a tool for the art

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.760
and craft of living,
and for a deepened,

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.540
more generative-- which
is a nuanced unproductive,

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.570
although it can be productive--
but a more deepened,

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.650
generative, higher-quality,
human experience.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.630
And the interesting thing--

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.970
so it is a basic social art.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.740
I think it's something
we know how to do

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.530
or we've known how to do,
but we've actually unlearned.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.530
I think that, growing
up in this culture,

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:06.380
we learn that listening is--
or the experience we have,

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.930
which we internalize to be
about what listening is about--

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.710
is to be quiet while the
other person says what

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.350
they have to say
until it's time for me

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.690
to say what I have to say.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.400
But actually, listening
is not about being quiet.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.370
The being quiet
is a side-effect.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.600
Listening is about
being present.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.150
And as I just said,
interestingly, you

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.330
can be present online as well.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.190
And so because we've
unlearned this thing,

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:41.890
I think it's interesting
to think about,

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.160
what are it's really
basic component parts?

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:52.510
For me, listening brings a
quality, musters a quality,

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.365
of generosity.

00:07:54.365 --> 00:07:57.940
And a spiritual
technology is always

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.140
working in two directions.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:03.100
It's inner work as much
as it's outer work.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.740
So especially in this
world we inhabit now,

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.730
and with so many things
we're fighting about

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.540
and so many things
were fearful about,

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.160
this is not as easy
as it sounds, right?

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.330
In fact, it's not
very instinctive.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:24.670
To me, a generous listener,
a definition of that would be

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:30.010
wanting to understand the
humanity behind the words

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.620
of the other-- so it's not just
about the words that are going

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.120
to pass between us--

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:39.370
and wanting to bring your own
best words and your best ideas

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.010
into the conversation.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.220
You have to muster
also, in yourself,

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.720
a real curiosity to bring that
kind of generosity to bear.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.410
And again, this is
really a withered muscle.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:58.490
The thing about curiosity is
you can't actually fake it.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:03.760
And again, whether
we're online or offline,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.140
we, at an animal level, when we
encounter another human being,

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.710
absolutely know whether
they're really curious

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.710
or whether they're just
asking us a question.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.290
We know that in our bodies.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:23.680
So really, even just
this basic component

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.680
of the art of living,
of being curious,

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.260
becomes a spiritual discipline.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.730
Or if you don't
like that language,

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.520
it becomes a muscle that
we need to flex and flex

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.470
so that it, again, starts
to feel like instinct,

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:39.730
starts to feel natural.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.420
Listening involves
vulnerability.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:52.900
One litmus test about whether
you have actually gotten

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.850
yourself to a curious
place that you

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.860
can ask-- whether
you go into a room,

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.530
whether that's a virtual
room or a physical room--

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:03.970
is are you willing
to be surprised?

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.450
And again, we walk
into all of our spaces

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:12.010
these days so guarded,
so clear about what

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.650
we have to say, what
we have to present,

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.620
what we have to
protect, and also

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:22.240
so clear about what we think
those other people stand for.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:29.260
So to be willing to be surprised
is an unnatural move right now.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.510
And then the final piece
of this that I want to add

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:36.550
is that, actually,
in many of the spaces

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.920
we are currently working with
and living in and meeting

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.990
each other in, it
wouldn't actually

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.620
be reasonable to ask
other people to surprise

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.140
themselves or surprise us.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.790
So there's a piece of this--

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:54.490
I think that the
social art of listening

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:58.420
is intimately connected with
the virtue of hospitality,

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.900
another spiritual technology.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.320
One thing I love
about hospitality--

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.500
it's a gateway to all
the other great virtues--

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.135
compassion or love.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.846
It's much easier.

00:11:12.846 --> 00:11:13.970
It's an easier entry point.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.510
You don't actually
have to love someone

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.526
to be hospitable towards them.

00:11:18.526 --> 00:11:19.900
You don't have to
agree with them

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.150
to be hospitable towards them.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:26.140
You don't even have to like them
to be hospitable towards them.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:30.990
But we know, in
our analog lives--

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.920
and I think, maybe, we're
learning in our online lives--

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:42.060
that the space you create
absolutely limits or expands

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.370
what is possible that
will happen there.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.970
There is a difference
between creating a space

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:54.710
with a welcome and an ethos
or just opening the door so

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.060
that anything can happen.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.300
Something that's
very clear to me

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.630
that I think a lot about, that
it's fun to say in this room,

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:14.630
is that, to me, the digital
world is just a new canvas

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:18.020
for the old human condition.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.820
There's nothing
that happens online

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.000
that doesn't have an offline,
although, things can absolutely

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.500
get amplified.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.420
It's the good, the
bad, and the ugly.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.810
We're encountering the trolls.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:38.580
We all walk around with
trollish places in our psyches.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:44.221
Now they have this public
room to run around in, right?

00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:44.763
But they're--

00:12:44.763 --> 00:12:46.637
DANIELLE KRETTEK: That's
such a great visual.

00:12:46.637 --> 00:12:47.160
Just like--

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.076
KRISTA TIPPETT: Right?

00:12:48.076 --> 00:12:48.971
But think about it!

00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:49.470
Yeah.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:58.950
So this has always been
true that the quality

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.740
of the encounter, of the
listening, of the relationship,

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.800
of the possibility of what can
happen between two people--

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.540
whether they agree with each
other or don't or similar

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.240
or don't--

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.165
is very much affected
by creating this space.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:18.930
And I think there's
just a real need, again,

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.350
in the physical world as
much as in the online world,

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.260
to create alternative spaces--

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.100
and I'll say it
again-- where it would

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.600
be reasonable to ask any of us
to walk in and bring our best

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:36.360
selves and be looking
for the good in the other

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.200
and be willing to surprise
ourselves and be truly inviting

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.050
other people to surprise us.

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:47.910
So I guess the other thing
I would want to just mention

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.910
that I absolutely
think of, in terms

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:57.120
of a companion to
listening, is the art

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.570
of asking better questions.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:06.450
In American life, we
mostly trade in answers.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:11.280
And we actually mostly
trade in competing answers.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.870
And a lot of what
calls itself a question

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:21.940
or presents as a question
is actually not questioning.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:27.990
It's tools or weapons to
incite or corner or catch

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.000
or, at least, entertain.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.060
And this is certainly true
in my field of journalism.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.340
The question is
often about how it

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.740
makes the journalist
look and not really

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:43.560
about what it's going to elicit.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.200
What I want to point out in
that spectacle, which we're all

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.350
very familiar with,
is how powerful

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:53.700
a form of words a question is.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.210
The way I've come
to experience it

00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:01.950
is that questions elicit
answers in their likeness.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:06.840
Answers rise or fall to
the questions they meet.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.130
And in the negative
expression of that,

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:17.370
which we're very
familiar with from media,

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:21.480
it's almost impossible to
meet a simplistic question

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.410
with anything but a
simplistic answer.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:31.570
It's almost impossible to
transcend a combative question.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:37.570
But the positive side of that
is that it's almost impossible

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:41.830
to resist a generous question.

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.210
And we've all had
that experience

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.530
that there is something
life-giving about asking

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.305
a better question.

00:15:49.305 --> 00:15:50.680
DANIELLE KRETTEK:
Can I ask you--

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.120
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah?

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.690
DANIELLE KRETTEK: May
I ask you a question?

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:53.260
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yes, you may.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:53.970
Yeah.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.857
AUDIENCE: Good practice.

00:15:55.857 --> 00:15:57.190
DANIELLE KRETTEK: I know, right?

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:58.600
You're like, if it's a good one.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.590
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:00.570
DANIELLE KRETTEK:
Is it generous?

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:01.444
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:16:01.444 --> 00:16:05.230
DANIELLE KRETTEK: So what I'm
hearing, as you're speaking,

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.980
is there is this sense of
an opening that happens when

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.660
there is a generous presence.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.460
There is an opening
in the question.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.360
There's an opening in
the space between you

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.970
where things can be put there.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.890
I'm so curious.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.020
You mentioned it the other
night with the word--

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.570
you set an intention before
you go in-- the listening

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:23.620
before the listening.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.050
And I'm just curious, how
does that work for you?

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:28.450
How do you cultivate
that opening

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:29.950
in yourself, that invitation?

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:34.080
Because it is that first step
of hospitality is open the door,

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.520
and come into this space
that we can be in together.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.060
I'm just so curious.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:37.960
KRISTA TIPPETT:
So when I'm having

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.370
a conversation or an interview?

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.780
DANIELLE KRETTEK: When
you're having a conversation

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.821
and when you're figuring
out the right questions,

00:16:42.821 --> 00:16:44.800
the questions that have
the opening in them.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.675
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.310
Well, I do actually think
in terms of hospitality

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.150
in the work I do.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.330
And so I think of
the preparation

00:16:55.330 --> 00:17:01.300
I do for an interview
as work of hospitality.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:06.730
Because again, so
much is determined

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:11.680
about how an encounter is going
to go in the initial moments

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.660
before words are spoken.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:18.890
So just setting
that table, which

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:21.787
is an image of a certain
kind of hospitality,

00:17:21.787 --> 00:17:22.745
but it's the same idea.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:32.610
When we don't do that, then
the most obvious things

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:36.660
about us that we're all carrying
out front right now just

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:40.060
define what's possible.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.900
And so what I'm interested
in is how can we--

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.700
not solve all the problems
or make it that we're--

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.700
because I really want to
be in rooms with people

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.390
I disagree with and
who are different

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:52.050
and who I need to
learn from and who

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.270
I know I want to share
life with, even if I really

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.190
don't understand them--

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:57.090
not violent people.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.381
But most people aren't violent.

00:17:58.381 --> 00:18:00.270
There's this huge swath
in the middle where

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.910
those fellow humans are there.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.480
So what I want to do
is create the space

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.290
so that the things that we
already know are problematic

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.580
are certainly present.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:16.380
But they don't define what
becomes possible between us.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.810
In my interviews--
when you just asked me

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:23.200
that, intuitively, what comes
to mind is, I get excited.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.780
I'm just excited about
the conversation.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:33.340
And I want to prepare
because I want

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:38.440
them to be able to relax as
quickly as possible so that we

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.540
can really go deep.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:47.680
And one way I do that is by
knowing about them, by honoring

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.310
them, by reading their books
if they've written books,

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.890
or knowing what they do.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.030
I do a lot of--

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.330
I will also read other
interviews they've given.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:03.820
I would say-- so I think of
my interview preparation mode

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:09.190
as the Vulcan mind-meld mode
of interview preparation,

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.590
you know?

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.900
My mind, your mind, your
thoughts to my thoughts--

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.620
because my goal in
preparing is not

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:24.580
that I know what they think
as much as how they think.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.400
And again, this works if they're
halfway across the world,

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.000
and I'm in a studio,
and they're in a studio.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.750
That, we all know what
this experience is,

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:40.870
if you meet someone new,
and you know very quickly

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:45.730
if you're going to have to
explain yourself, defend

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.280
yourself, be on guard.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.870
And then that's what your
whole body gears up to do.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.000
And then that just--

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.600
then you're off.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.600
But what I'm aiming for
is this other experience

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.260
we have all also had
where you meet somebody,

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.950
and you just know
that they get you.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.170
And even when I say
that to you right now,

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:15.130
my body relaxes, and there
is a lot more possibility.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.540
And it's a soft--

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.040
right?

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.980
It's a soft space in which
just more can happen.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.220
And I think it's a more
playful adventurous

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.970
space for the same reason.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.590
DANIELLE KRETTEK: I interrupted
you with my question, so--

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:28.180
KRISTA TIPPETT: No, no.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:28.679
I love that.

00:20:28.679 --> 00:20:30.159
DANIELLE KRETTEK: So please--

00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:31.450
KRISTA TIPPETT: I did want to--

00:20:35.599 --> 00:20:38.550
one of the things you said
to me is that you also

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.760
wanted to invite me here
at Google to just say

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.610
whatever was on my mind that
I would want to say and--

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:49.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:49.980
--to you.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:54.790
And actually, I have a fair
number of conversations,

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.390
not about technology, per
se, but about our lives

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:04.000
with technology and do think
about this a great deal.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.850
And one thing I want
to say is that--

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.360
and I know you all are--

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.960
we're now having this kind
of reckoning, culturally,

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.070
with the civilizational
effect of the work you

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:22.210
do, the work that
happens in this industry.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.980
And we've all created that
civilizational effect.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.690
We've all co-created it.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.580
And it's so new.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.160
And these technologies are
so much in their infancy.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.560
And I think one of the
messages that's come through so

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.870
clearly is--

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.790
with wise people in
my conversations--

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:43.050
is that we forget that all
of this is in its infancy

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.520
because it is so powerful.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.080
And it has so quickly--

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.780
feels like-- taken
over our lives.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.700
But there is the opportunity.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.480
And the challenge is
to shape our lives

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.710
with technology and the
technologies to human purpose.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:02.440
And I'm also aware of--

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.830
I do think-- this is
also true in journalism.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.950
Culturally, we're
so much more skilled

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.530
at sophisticated analysis
and criticism of what

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:17.440
is flawed and failing and
destructive and terrifying and

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.120
catastrophic.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.700
We're really good at that.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:29.090
And we're not as sophisticated
at seeing and analyzing

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:33.150
and working with and,
thereby, nurturing

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:37.870
what is generative and
beautiful and humane.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.320
And I think that you--

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.870
I know you know this.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:46.620
There's so much that is
human and beautiful, humane

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:53.070
and generative, in our lives
with technology as well.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.200
I would just say one
of the things that's

00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:02.940
so clear to me in the sphere I'm
in is the abundance of poetry

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:07.380
that has this whole
new life online

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:12.720
and how people are making
poetry and putting it up there

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.180
and sharing it.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.050
And I think this is also
a civilizational move.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.390
Poetry does, in fact,
in human societies,

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.940
rise up when we are
in these moments

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.515
of cultural and
political disarray.

00:23:26.515 --> 00:23:27.115
It does.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.640
It's something we are turning
to as our official forms

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:40.790
of language and discourse are so
broken and failing us so badly.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:47.240
And it gives us ways to give
voice to the best of ourselves.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:52.340
And actually, also, it gives
us ways to put questions

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.430
into the room--

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:56.360
and I mean "the room" in
a very expansive sense,

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.380
the public room--

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:04.130
that are there for us to live
rather than answer or fight

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:04.630
about.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.650
And one of those
questions, by way

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.240
of poetry, that
I work with a lot

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.860
is from Elizabeth Alexander, who
was the poet of the first Obama

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:18.790
administration.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:22.540
And she has this
poem, which ends,

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.480
"Poetry is the human voice.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:30.220
And are we not of
interest to each other?"

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:34.840
To me, that is a question
that reframes, like,

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.830
can we get along?

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.080
Or are you a Republican
or a Democrat?

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.850
That's a question
that could help

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.100
reframe our grappling
with all the things we

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.120
want to grapple with.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.290
And then I'm sure many of you
are aware that Mary Oliver died

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:48.100
last week.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.460
And I was so
privileged to have, I

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.900
think, the last
big interview she

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:57.370
gave in 2015 in
which, I will share,

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.560
she smoked the entire time.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.530
It's the only
interview I've ever

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:07.450
had where my producer texted
me before I arrived and said,

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:09.266
she wants to smoke,
are you OK with that?

00:25:09.266 --> 00:25:10.890
I was like, she never
gives interviews.

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:12.056
Of course, I'm OK with that.

00:25:12.056 --> 00:25:15.070
But it was so perfect.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.785
Because--

00:25:15.785 --> 00:25:17.360
DANIELLE KRETTEK: And you
were in the room for this one?

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:17.800
KRISTA TIPPETT: What?

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.010
DANIELLE KRETTEK: It
wasn't remote smoking.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.670
It was in the room.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:20.470
KRISTA TIPPETT: No,
we were in the room.

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:21.580
It was in my face.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.050
And I was privileged.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:25.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:27.340
And she was wearing a New
England Patriots sweatshirt.

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.670
And it was just-- it made her
so much more perfect that she's

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.050
so three-dimensional.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:33.490
Because you know Mary Oliver--

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.301
her critics think that
she's like poetry-lite,

00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:38.800
because she writes beautiful
things about the natural world.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.780
And I think some of the
people who love her most

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.000
put her up on a pedestal
and turn her into a saint.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.870
And the truth is, if you think
about a sophisticated analysis

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:53.950
of goodness and beauty,
she fled to the woods

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.980
and started writing
poetry because she was

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.970
living in an abusive household.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:06.220
And the poet-- she spent
years, in young adulthood,

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:11.180
gathering berries because
that's what she had to eat.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.320
And it was that
three-dimensionality of her--

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.830
and that's what gives her
poems about beauty and goodness

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:18.670
such heft.

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:20.050
And actually, I took--

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.120
so here, a question she
put out into the world

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.340
that is now rippling
through it again--

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.310
and it's one of these
transformative questions

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:28.780
we can live--

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.050
tell me, what is it you
plan to do with your one

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:35.520
wild and precious life?

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.390
And another gift she gave
me and that interview was--

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:41.500
to just bring this to a close--

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.190
is the phrase--

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.820
I like the phrase,
generous listening.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.660
Mary Oliver used the
phrase, convivial listening.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.494
DANIELLE KRETTEK: Hmm-- there's
like a bubbling in that.

00:26:52.494 --> 00:26:53.410
KRISTA TIPPETT: It's--

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:54.300
DANIELLE KRETTEK:
--that's really lovely--

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.130
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.020
DANIELLE KRETTEK: --being
the poetess that she is.

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.390
I'm glad you brought Mary up.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.867
Because actually,
when I saw that,

00:27:00.867 --> 00:27:02.450
I thought immediately
of you because I

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:03.680
listened to that interview.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.100
And the thing that touched
me the most in that interview

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.040
with Mary was how she
talked about her poetry

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.380
being a moving thing--
that she would walk to have

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.630
the poetry coming through her.

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:16.504
And then she'd have to
run home and get the--

00:27:16.504 --> 00:27:19.190
and what I loved about
that was just that it

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.930
was the living the questions.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.589
It isn't the-- I sit down, and
[? these ?] things comes to us.

00:27:23.589 --> 00:27:25.880
And I think something that
you were talking about a few

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:29.690
minutes ago with journalism--
which is the nature

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:33.290
of the questions-- again, you
can go so easily to the places

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:34.760
of--

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.762
the darker spaces, the shadowy
spaces because it works.

00:27:38.762 --> 00:27:40.470
There's a lot of edge
there to work with.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.760
I think design and journalism
is very similar, in terms of,

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.280
there's a curiosity.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:46.790
It's funny.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.680
You can almost say--

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:53.900
search poetry and replace design
or art or all these things.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.272
It's all inquiry into that
thing at the core of something

00:27:57.272 --> 00:27:59.480
that you're going to bring
out and make felt and move

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.670
everything else away.

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:02.540
And when I look at
design or journalism,

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.190
I think about this
deep curiosity

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.660
that rises up into us.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.250
And do we want to just look for
the problems we want to solve,

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.090
the itchy seams
that drive us crazy

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:13.100
or the things that feel
like they're not right?

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.080
Or is there actually
something even deeper

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.650
than that that's more
unifying than that that

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:20.000
is this place of beauty?

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.700
And the way you
describe beauty is--

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.470
actually, I don't want to
misquote you right here.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:30.020
So let me make sure
that I get this right.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:32.270
In my notes, I literally
have the [? hippiest ?] quote

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:35.270
on beauty, which is always
my touchstone, which

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.420
is, "The world is
hopelessly reeling.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.070
Stay close to the sounds
that bring you alive."

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:43.820
And your quote is, "Beauty is
that, in the presence of which,

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.160
we feel more alive."

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:45.510
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:46.700
DANIELLE KRETTEK:
So this vitality

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.840
you're speaking about--

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.715
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:28:48.715 --> 00:28:51.170
And that's actually a
language of John O'Donohue,

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:56.610
who is another poet and
theologian and philosopher.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:59.960
And so he was talking--

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:05.060
we were actually
talking about how

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.960
a lot of the words that we need
the most and love the most also

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.485
get ruined.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:17.300
And I think that's true of words
like peace and justice and love

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.510
and kindness.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:22.870
They get on bumper stickers, or
they get partisan affiliations.

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:27.140
And so I think sometimes we
have to put them to one side,

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.720
and use them less, and
say what we're saying,

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.830
and use a universe of words,
and not expect those words to do

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.790
the work for us.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.890
But sometimes we just
really have to claim a word

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:38.390
and say, no.

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:39.723
We're not going to let this die.

00:29:39.723 --> 00:29:40.800
We have to resurrect it.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.640
And I'm trying to do that
with the word "civility."

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.560
But he used the word "beauty."

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:51.830
And I said to him, well, beauty
is another one of those words.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.420
I said, if you
just threw the word

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.930
"beauty" into many
conversations, maybe

00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:01.430
where my mind would go is to
the flawless face on the cover

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:03.350
of a magazine, right?

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.760
And he said, no, no.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.075
That's glamor.

00:30:06.075 --> 00:30:11.330
And he said, beauty is that,
in the presence of which,

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:12.680
we feel more alive.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:23.480
And what you just said
about the inquiry--

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.720
if we're focused on
solving the problems,

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.210
do we then end up orienting
towards the problems?

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:36.560
And I don't think we have
to do one or the other.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:41.210
I think we do, to some extent,
need to focus on the problems.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:46.530
And it's also just as
serious and robust a question

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:50.930
to ask, what do
we want to amplify

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.500
because it is good for us?

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.500
DANIELLE KRETTEK: Mm-hm.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.440
KRISTA TIPPETT: Because
it speaks to and elicits

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:02.150
the best of which our
species is capable.

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:04.650
DANIELLE KRETTEK: I think that
so much of the conversation--

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.015
to speak for Google.

00:31:06.015 --> 00:31:08.040
No, to speak for
myself and as part

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.870
of the community of Google--

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:13.060
I think that's part of what's
so fascinating about this braces

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.110
phase, awkward adolescent
moment we are in with technology

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:16.680
right now.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:16.800
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.091
DANIELLE KRETTEK: You're right.

00:31:18.091 --> 00:31:21.100
The power is what has brought
us along so far, so fast.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.750
But there's so much
more to be done.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:23.990
There's so much expansion.

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.990
There's so much support.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:26.610
There's so much positivity.

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.580
It's easy to focus on the fear
part of it because that's real,

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.190
and that's happening,
and things must shift.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:35.250
But there's so much
potential if you focus on,

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:37.620
what are the things that we
want to expand in people?

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.270
What are the ways
we can support?

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:41.850
How can we look, not just at
the functional and productive

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:45.110
needs, but at the generative,
spacious needs of people?

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:47.500
How is the whole person welcome?

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.160
And I think, what's so curious
and part of why this listening

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.860
conversation-- it's so wonderful
to have everyone in the room

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:53.700
here--

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:58.440
is we are really trying to go
back to these core skills that

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:02.400
are so easy to forget with the
speed with which we all live

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.210
and remember, what does it
mean to, in our process,

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:08.730
open up moments
where we have spaces

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:12.090
for better listening, where
we are practicing some

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.640
of these skills in
a different way,

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.680
working with the design process
so that it's not the normal way

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.730
that we make things?

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:22.470
But that we ourselves--

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:25.500
more of us is welcome in that
room and at the whiteboard--

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.890
that there is, for the humans
on this side and the way that it

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:32.640
touches people on the outside,
and the way that all circles--

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.670
what does it mean to
work with new models

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:38.730
and open spaces in these
places that we all create in?

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:40.190
KRISTA TIPPETT:
That's also where--

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.814
you think about that
as an intersection

00:32:41.814 --> 00:32:44.330
of design and the
hospitality virtue, right?

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:47.540
DANIELLE KRETTEK:
Mm-mm, absolutely.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.080
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:33:00.410
I'm very clear that, as much
as we are, again, seeing the--

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:02.324
well, we're seeing the
dark side of ourselves

00:33:02.324 --> 00:33:03.365
on this great big canvas.

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:12.019
And we're seeing this very
young industry, which--

00:33:12.019 --> 00:33:13.560
one of the things
I've learned here--

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.060
is it's not really an industry.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.514
It's a bunch of companies
competing with each other.

00:33:18.514 --> 00:33:20.805
But the world actually needs
you all to be an industry.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:31.660
This industry-- I spent
my 20s in divided Berlin.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:35.590
And I keep thinking
about it this out here

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:36.370
in Silicon Valley.

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:40.260
Because as much
as we are riveted

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.540
by what's happening
in Washington, DC

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:49.200
or in London, your company--

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.725
these companies are the
superpowers of this century.

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:55.840
And that's huge.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.940
And we're all now
aware of the perils

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.800
of that and all the
pieces that need

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.870
to be in place for
that to be true

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.480
and to be good for humanity.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.160
But I also see that--

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:15.130
every generation,
every century has

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:18.730
had its life-altering
technologies, right?

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:20.925
The railroad changed everything.

00:34:20.925 --> 00:34:22.300
The telephone
changed everything.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.591
Electricity changed everything.

00:34:23.591 --> 00:34:26.100
Fire changed everything.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.230
But what is new about
our technologies--

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:31.701
of course, the
pace is different.

00:34:31.701 --> 00:34:33.159
But I don't think
that's really it.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:35.350
Because I think, in
other generations,

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:38.889
the pace of those things
was equally completely

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:40.540
disorienting.

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.870
It is the intimacy.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:50.050
Our technologies are woven
into the fabric of our days,

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:51.770
into the fabric of our lives.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:58.150
They are shifting the way
we make and lead and learn

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.420
and love.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:06.320
They are woven into
the human enterprise.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:11.750
And what I also see is
that these technologies,

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:15.620
and the interconnected world
and economies they've given us,

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.350
have actually
given us the tools,

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:25.670
for the first time as a species,
to think and act as a species.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:29.030
We are not anywhere living
up to that right now.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:30.870
That's not the picture.

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:33.270
But this is the reality.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:36.410
This is the potential.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:38.610
DANIELLE KRETTEK: I love
that articulation of it.

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.320
I've never heard
it quite like that.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.720
But indeed, it is--

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.740
yeah-- the ability
to be interconnected.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.320
When you say, woven,
it's interconnected,

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:51.950
not just in our humanity,
but actually in the way

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:53.282
that we are connected.

00:35:53.282 --> 00:35:53.990
And I think the--

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.440
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.640
Inside and outside.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.720
DANIELLE KRETTEK: Yes.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.100
That inner and outer
is so critical.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.250
And actually, it's perfect
that you said that.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:04.562
Because there was a
moment that you had,

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:06.020
that you reflected
on in your book,

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.240
with Dr. Rachel
Naomi Remen where

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.179
you talk about tikkan olam.

00:36:10.179 --> 00:36:11.720
And what's interesting
is, I actually

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.610
had a moment where I
was like, [GASP] shall

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:16.230
I talk about
spirituality at Google?

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:18.107
And I was like, absolutely, yes.

00:36:18.107 --> 00:36:19.940
This is the human heart
we're talking about.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.290
The language is almost--

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:24.040
you can use whatever
language you want.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.270
The thing that we were
speaking about, the thing that

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:28.728
breaks all of our hearts, the
thing that connects all of us

00:36:28.728 --> 00:36:29.730
is always the same.

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:31.130
So that is what this is.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:33.830
"But sometime early in
the life of the world,

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:36.584
something happened to shatter"--
you know, this origin myth--

00:36:36.584 --> 00:36:38.750
"the light of the universe
and the countless pieces.

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:41.630
They lodged as sparks in
every part of creation.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.880
Our highest human
calling is to help repair

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:48.140
the part of the world that
we can see and touch."

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:51.620
And I just immediately thought,
what if everything we designed

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.930
had that beauty and service--

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:55.730
and your version of beauty--

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:58.070
you and John's-- to it?

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:00.830
This idea that we can repair
the parts of the world

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:04.670
that we see and touch, that is
a pretty incredible fabric when

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:08.220
we think about what filament is
at our fingers here at Google.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:11.840
What a great mission to
organize and organize

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.970
the world's information,
to light it up

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:15.120
and repair it as well.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:15.630
I think that's
where we're moving.

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:16.220
KRISTA TIPPETT: And
you know what's else?

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:19.160
It's also, at the one and
the same time, it's audacious

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.890
and it's doable.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.990
Because that's the Jewish--

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:25.560
the story behind the--

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.140
it's called "The
Birthday of the World."

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:30.980
And it's behind the
moral commandment

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.314
to repair the world.

00:37:32.314 --> 00:37:34.730
And I really love-- like,
that's another piece of language

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:36.320
that I think is so useful.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.750
It's so much better
than "save the world,"

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:41.390
which was what the
20th century was about.

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:44.810
And so much damage was done in
the name of "saving the world."

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:46.310
And it also made people--

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:50.810
it actually alienated people
from their sense of agency.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:53.420
But repair the world--

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:57.320
and you know, ever
since 2016, it's just--

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.330
all the images that
come to mind about what

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:01.430
we have to do in our country--

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:07.800
it's weaving, stitching, it's
all these-- mending, repairing.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.370
And the thing is,
it's a big picture.

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:11.790
But it's one
relationship at a time.

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:13.550
And that's what she said too.

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:19.150
Repair the world is the
highest human calling.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:21.900
But you start with what
you can see and touch.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.237
That's what you're called to.

00:38:24.237 --> 00:38:25.320
DANIELLE KRETTEK: I just--

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.890
I love that pragmatism.

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:30.070
And also, what I feel
like is rising up in

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:32.920
the conversation too is this--

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:33.870
save the world.

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:35.320
It made me think.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.660
There is this really beautiful
intention we have in the Valley

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.430
and in technology.

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:42.850
How can we solve these
audacious human problems--

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:44.810
these large-scale
massive things?

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:48.070
How can we-- the intention
of that is so beautiful.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:51.490
The results of that
are not always.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.825
When you speak about
intentionality and hospitality

00:38:53.825 --> 00:38:55.450
and this whole space
that we've started

00:38:55.450 --> 00:39:00.160
to unroll in our conversation,
what's your advice for us

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.875
with that?

00:39:02.875 --> 00:39:06.550
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah,
well, that's all.

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:08.110
I'm going to now
solve it for you.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:10.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:13.810
But what I will say, I
think the intentionality--

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:14.876
your question is so good.

00:39:14.876 --> 00:39:16.500
You know, that's my
highest compliment.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.560
DANIELLE KRETTEK: Aw!

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.180
KRISTA TIPPETT: That--

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.680
DANIELLE KRETTEK:
It is my birthday.

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:21.850
And I think that
was, officially,

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:23.120
the best birthday gift ever.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:29.560
KRISTA TIPPETT: We all know--

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:34.260
we know, in our lives, we
know, in the lives of companies

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:39.400
and organizations,
that intentionality--

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.900
that the beginning
of something--

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.750
the intentionality
that's embedded in it

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:47.490
has this mysterious power
to be in the DNA forever.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:56.030
But culturally-- and
I think, especially

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:59.630
in the realm of productivity
of every kind, we

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:05.780
really privilege the "what"
and the "when" questions

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:08.015
and not the "how" and the "why."

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:15.130
And I actually
believe that, if we

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:17.020
are going to wrap
our arms around

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.220
these big civilizational--

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.580
these intimate and
civilizational challenges

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.180
we have--

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.790
and the problem is,
as we also know,

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:32.370
if you rush to do something--

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:37.830
if you rush to a solution,
you often waste time.

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:42.040
You often end up
setting something loose

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.540
that didn't have the
intentionality that it needed,

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:50.040
that you then spend time
rolling back and dismantling

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.120
and solving for.

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:59.890
Which is all by way of saying,
it would behoove us now--

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.110
and I mean, in every
aspect of our lives

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:04.570
and in everything we do,
whatever our work is--

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:12.500
because this is a
critical moment--

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:22.690
to really invest our time,
our creativity, our attention,

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:26.980
the sophistication we would
give to solving a problem

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:31.120
to the why and the how of it.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.140
Yeah.

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.410
And what that means--

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:43.280
but that has some trade-offs
that are culturally difficult,

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.000
right?

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.100
That means you would
spend a lot more time

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:49.790
on something that doesn't
look like you're being busy.

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:52.650
So there's a culture shift
that has to happen around this.

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:57.679
A language I love that actually
comes from spiritual traditions

00:41:57.679 --> 00:41:58.970
is the language of discernment.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.136
DANIELLE KRETTEK: Mm, mm-hm.

00:42:04.759 --> 00:42:06.800
KRISTA TIPPETT: I know
these industries you're in

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.030
are all about innovation.

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:10.760
And we actually have
to hoist in that a lot

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:15.200
of the massive problems
we're dealing with now

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.380
are the result of innovations.

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:24.160
Like, what we did with
food 50 years ago,

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.870
where we created convenience--

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.850
do you know what
an innovation it

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:35.230
was to have food coming
out of boxes and cans?

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:39.070
Life-changing, amazing--
so bad for us--

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:46.660
very lucrative-- so bad for us.

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:51.310
And then our government
policies followed it.

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:53.170
Agriculture followed it.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:54.590
All of these things followed it.

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:59.320
But now we're implicated in
this massive complex of things

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:03.040
around climate and
health and economies

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.440
that we have to take apart
and solve for, right?

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:10.240
So innovation is not,
in itself, a good.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.280
Innovation is not
necessarily progress.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.950
And so that's
something to ponder.

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:17.750
And I think, if you say--

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:20.470
if our technologies and
our lives with them are

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:24.130
in our adolescence, if these
super-power companies are also

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:25.990
very young--

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:27.940
I think that
discernment muscle--

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.160
of course, innovation
has been a core value--

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:34.960
but in the next stage, asking,
will it be good for the world?

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.410
Will it be good for humanity?

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:39.040
And that's going to
look like wasting time--

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.600
being discerning.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.850
DANIELLE KRETTEK: You use
the word, imagination, a lot

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:44.892
to describe that
generative, spacious process

00:43:44.892 --> 00:43:45.600
in the beginning.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:45.700
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.440
DANIELLE KRETTEK: And I think
imagination and discernment

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.810
go really beautifully
together towards that.

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:52.840
I must pick up-- so you
mentioned that civility is

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:55.321
a word that means a lot to
you now and just talking about

00:43:55.321 --> 00:43:55.820
these--

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:58.270
I love saying that these are
civilization-level problems

00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:01.000
because it includes the
humanity and the culture

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.610
and just all things at once.

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:05.590
Please share your
definition [? now-- ?]

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:06.923
KRISTA TIPPETT: Oh, of civility?

00:44:06.923 --> 00:44:08.812
DANIELLE KRETTEK: Yes.

00:44:08.812 --> 00:44:11.020
KRISTA TIPPETT: Well, I know
it's a problematic word.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.030
And I always add
other adjectives.

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:16.600
Like, I say, adventurous
civility or muscular civility.

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:27.120
I think we have to get
past the idea that--

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.230
to me, it's not--

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:29.370
again, what is it not?

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:32.280
It's not being nice,
kind, polite, and tame.

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:41.550
Those aren't big enough
qualities to meet this moment.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.570
I'm not saying there's
not a place for them.

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:45.850
But that's not what
civility is about.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:51.510
I want to say that civility,
that the intentionality

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:54.405
behind it is this repair
of our life together.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:10.140
I think the questions that have
been with humanity and animated

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:13.950
humanity and, I
think animated us

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:16.590
at our best, that are
ancient and enduring are,

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:17.910
what does it mean to be human?

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:19.035
And how do we want to live?

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:26.770
And the third question is,
who will we be to each other?

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:29.590
And that question,
across history,

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:32.420
has been optional
in many settings.

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.420
And I think, actually,
the technologies

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:39.330
you've created make that
question inextricable now

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:42.340
for humans--

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:45.560
inextricable from the question
of what it means to be human

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.092
and how we want to live.

00:45:47.092 --> 00:45:48.300
DANIELLE KRETTEK: Absolutely.

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:51.970
KRISTA TIPPETT: And
civility, in my mind--

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:54.700
we're also-- there's so
many different things

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.440
happening at once,
which is part of what

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.620
makes this moment dizzying.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.620
And we're very focused
on what's going wrong.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:03.810
But there are so
many ways that we're

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:07.530
understanding the fullness
of what it means to be human

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:11.700
and understanding our
bodies and our brains

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:14.250
and the interaction
between them.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:21.370
And also, in culture--

00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:26.290
fitfully, imperfectly,
too slowly, but--

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:30.360
but-- gaining a sense
of the fullness of--

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:34.410
what is-- I want--

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:37.740
I think these words like
diversity and tolerance

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:40.310
are way too small.

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:43.330
Inclusion-- still,
there's an in-circle.

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:45.180
But I think we're really
moving beyond this.

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.760
We want the full
array of humanity

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.470
in the room to have its place.

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:55.560
We have such a newly
robust understanding

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.140
just of the matter of identity.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:01.035
We are the generation
that is redefining gender.

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:10.160
So I think one of the things
that happened with the notion

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:13.220
of civility was that it was
about-- like, these phrases--

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:17.420
like, we would all
get on this same page.

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.790
Or the thing we do-- like,
the democratic instinct.

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:22.456
Well, you've got some people who
think that it's something like,

00:47:22.456 --> 00:47:25.130
take a vote, and move on.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:28.640
But these intimate
civilizational questions

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.850
of how we're going to live,
we all have a stake in them.

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:34.430
So to me, civility,
in this generation,

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:37.400
is about knowing that
we walk into the room

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.910
or into the discussion with
deep, profound differences

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:43.200
that are meaningful
and important to us.

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.690
And the point is not agreeing.

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:51.970
The point is getting
into a relationship.

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:54.860
The point is coming
to know each other.

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:57.490
And that thing of
opening up what is--

00:47:57.490 --> 00:47:59.500
not letting those
things we disagree

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.590
on define what is possible
between us-- opening up

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:07.000
a new space where, perhaps,
what we have in common are

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.050
our questions.

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:09.660
DANIELLE KRETTEK: Absolutely.

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:10.160
Yeah.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.950
And that opening
of the space that's

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:14.080
bigger than the
differences that allows

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.350
for all of the questions,
all of the voices--

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:20.680
something that you were
speaking with Pico Iyer

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.680
about in that recent
interview was how he

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.450
talked about how-- what was it?

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:26.955
In the institutions
of skepticism--

00:48:26.955 --> 00:48:29.560
he's gone to all these
incredibly decorated

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.870
universities, which
he refers to as

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:33.630
the institutions of skepticism.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:37.510
And he says that we learned how
to talk, but not how to listen,

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:39.940
how to put ourselves
forward, but not

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:42.250
how to actually erase ourselves.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:45.195
And so much of that is this--
the living of the listening,

00:48:45.195 --> 00:48:47.350
the living of the questions.

00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:49.810
If we do that in an
artful way, there really

00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:51.880
is space for all of that.

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:54.077
Whereas, the way
currently it works,

00:48:54.077 --> 00:48:55.660
maybe there isn't
always space for it.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.909
Because it feels like there's
not enough space for us,

00:48:57.909 --> 00:49:00.060
because all of us isn't there.

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.000
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.510
DANIELLE KRETTEK: But
this idea of seeking--

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:07.300
I think, he also said that
everything important he lived--

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.700
or everything important in
his life that he's learned

00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:11.935
has come through his heart
and not through his mind.

00:49:11.935 --> 00:49:12.620
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:14.536
DANIELLE KRETTEK: And I
think that's something

00:49:14.536 --> 00:49:17.820
that we, as good souls
here at Google, doing

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.842
what we want to do,
good work for the world,

00:49:20.842 --> 00:49:23.050
there is this tension between
the things that we feel

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.360
and the things that we know,
the things we can prove

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.440
and the things that we intuit.

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.100
And I'm just curious, as
well in this listening

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.320
and in the allowing
of all things,

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.140
for this greater
sense of civility,

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.441
how does one navigate that?

00:49:37.441 --> 00:49:38.690
KRISTA TIPPETT: Navigate the--

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:39.480
DANIELLE KRETTEK: This--

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:40.300
KRISTA TIPPETT: --heart space?

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:40.510
DANIELLE KRETTEK: Yeah.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:42.676
And I think you do it so
beautifully with your work,

00:49:42.676 --> 00:49:46.010
because you sit in
conversation with everyone.

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:47.800
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.930
Well, we're going
to have to innovate

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:52.510
some new forms for that, right?

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:56.980
Because we don't reward the
time or the energy that--

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:04.060
yeah, we reward what
comes from the mind

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:06.880
and not from the heart,
unless you can pitch it

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.019
as something that--

00:50:08.019 --> 00:50:09.310
and that's what we do actually.

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:11.590
Because most of it is--

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:16.060
all this language we've
always used about "your gut"--

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.770
and now, we've
basically learned that--

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:21.180
what they're calling the
biome, the second brain.

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:22.750
Like, we've actually known that.

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:23.534
We knew somewhere.

00:50:23.534 --> 00:50:25.450
DANIELLE KRETTEK: Mm--
science is catching up.

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:26.991
KRISTA TIPPETT: So
I do think science

00:50:26.991 --> 00:50:29.350
is our companion in
being able to make

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:32.170
a rational, serious
argument about this.

00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:40.070
But yeah-- and so I think,
right now, all the structures

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:45.650
we have, they're inadequate.

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:47.600
And I mean that in
all of our workplaces

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.140
and all of our institutions.

00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:53.870
They're behind on
what we're learning.

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:57.170
And actually, they're behind on
how actually the world really

00:50:57.170 --> 00:51:04.940
works and how change
really happens

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.850
and on the difference
between what

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:13.910
is innovative and
transformative, generatively

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:16.380
transformative.

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.660
So that's part of the task.

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:20.857
And there's no
one-size-fits-all solution.

00:51:20.857 --> 00:51:22.940
And I think that that is
one of these things where

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.400
the repair is going to have
to be everybody starting

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.650
very close to home--

00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:31.720
what you know, what you
touch, the immediate people

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:32.850
and structures around you.

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:35.290
How do you make space
for that to be rewarded?

00:51:35.290 --> 00:51:38.730
DANIELLE KRETTEK: Mm--
that's interesting--

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:43.035
the idea of how to reward
the how and the why.

00:51:43.035 --> 00:51:44.574
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:51:44.574 --> 00:51:48.870
DANIELLE KRETTEK: If anybody
has a question for Krista--

00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:50.550
AUDIENCE: My
question is, what is

00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:52.899
your thought behind
always asking someone

00:51:52.899 --> 00:51:54.315
at the beginning
of your podcast--

00:51:54.315 --> 00:51:55.920
KRISTA TIPPETT: Oh, yeah.

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:59.070
AUDIENCE: --what is something
from their childhood

00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:00.726
that is spiritually
important to them?

00:52:00.726 --> 00:52:01.600
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:06.180
So I almost always ask some
version of the question of,

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.130
was there a religious
or spiritual background

00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:09.400
to your childhood?

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.940
So the truth is that
just about everybody

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.010
has a really
interesting story there,

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:16.530
whether it's a story of absence
or presence or something

00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:18.550
that was good or bad.

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:25.200
But the strategic reason I
ask it is because of where

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.820
it plants the question.

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.730
So again, it's like, the
beginning is everything.

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:34.570
If you get the beginning
right, you can go places.

00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:37.050
And if you don't, you're
always working really hard

00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:41.310
to get it on the rails.

00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:45.120
So what I've learned
about that place--

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.360
it's true of other questions
about childhood or origins.

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:52.950
So sometimes, if I'm
in a particular setting

00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:56.040
with a theme, I might ask--

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:59.280
let's say, it's a conversation
about compassion or--

00:52:59.280 --> 00:52:59.850
I don't know.

00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:05.280
And I might say, can you
remember the very first time

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.350
that that word meant
something to you?

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:11.730
Or what is your memory of the
earliest understanding of what

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:14.850
you think of as compassion now?

00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:19.560
The thing about asking somebody
a question that takes them--

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:22.440
what I don't want to
do is start with--

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:26.940
how we present generally-- we
walk in with our credentials

00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:29.170
and what we know
and what we've done.

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:31.680
And it's very chin up.

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.300
And it's performative.

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:37.230
And that's what
we're asked to do.

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:42.300
That question, it plants people.

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:45.240
It's not a question that
anybody feels defensive about,

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.730
because I'm not
asking you also--

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:48.396
and I would never ask
somebody-- tell me

00:53:48.396 --> 00:53:49.770
about your spiritual life.

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:51.780
Are you religious?

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:56.550
That question would be designed
to just make everybody uptight,

00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:57.720
including me.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:00.100
If you ask somebody
that question,

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:05.670
it takes them to a very soft
searching place in their memory

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:08.950
and, therefore, in their body.

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:12.660
It's also, interestingly-- as
much as we think of religion,

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:15.660
culturally, as a matter
of convictions and beliefs

00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:16.950
and answers--

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:21.030
it's a place where
beautiful questions reside.

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:23.940
And it's interesting
to me how many people--

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:27.760
when they start reflecting
on that part of their life,

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.570
it turns out that there's some
question they asked when they

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:34.832
were 4 or 7 or 9 that
ended up influencing

00:54:34.832 --> 00:54:35.790
the rest of their life.

00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:39.090
Like, some of their life
has been some trajectory

00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:41.880
on the course of that question.

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:45.210
So it's where to start.

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:49.110
And then everything
follows from there.

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:51.690
If I can invite people to
be soft and searching right

00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:56.370
up front, then we probably
are going to stay soft

00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:59.091
and searching.

00:54:59.091 --> 00:55:01.590
AUDIENCE: I used to work for
the World Bank as an economist.

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:03.240
And you talked about
saving the world.

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:06.720
And then I moved
to Silicon Valley.

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.390
And here, people have
the same intentions.

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:12.492
And it seems that the
intentionality is right.

00:55:12.492 --> 00:55:14.950
And speaking for the World
Bank, you wouldn't believe that.

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:16.440
But the same is true.

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.010
People truly believe
in what they are doing

00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:20.890
as doing good in the world.

00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:24.210
So if it's not intentionality,
where do we go wrong?

00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:27.630
Is it that we think it's,
intentionality is right,

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:29.910
but it's really not,
and it's our ego?

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:30.715
Or what is it?

00:55:30.715 --> 00:55:31.590
Where do we go wrong?

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:34.410
And how can we fix
this-- that we start off

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:36.840
with good intentions and
end up with bad results?

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:37.751
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:55:37.751 --> 00:55:38.250
Right.

00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:39.600
Well, that's a good question.

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.504
Intentionality is
not everything.

00:55:41.504 --> 00:55:43.170
I think, then, I would
want to come back

00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:44.970
to this discernment piece.

00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:48.280
And I do think that--

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:52.760
yeah, the question of
ego, which is often--

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.260
and of course, our
egos are part of us.

00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:59.510
It's not, you get rid of that.

00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:08.290
But it resides so intimately
with intentionality.

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:12.450
And so I think, part
of spiritual life--

00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:14.220
of a cultivated interior life--

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:20.470
is to grow in knowing
the difference.

00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:23.220
Because they often do
feel like the same thing.

00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:27.140
And actually to grow
these other muscles

00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:31.910
around discernment and asking
the how and the why question--

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:36.680
and the scale of what the
World Bank is working with

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:39.260
or the scale of what Silicon
Valley is working with

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:41.220
is tremendous.

00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:44.980
But I do think that
there's something

00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:51.520
we're waking up to a little
late about how disconnected

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:55.600
our view of the problems and,
therefore, the solutions is.

00:56:55.600 --> 00:57:00.250
And this is something about
the post-enlightenment world.

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:02.500
We were fascinated
with the parts.

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:05.252
And then we created
this world of parts.

00:57:05.252 --> 00:57:07.210
So in every discipline,
there's this challenge.

00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:09.080
In medicine, there's
this challenge.

00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.210
We have specialists for
every part of your body.

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:13.210
And we didn't learn how
to see the whole and all

00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:14.510
the interactions.

00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:18.070
And there's a corollary to
that in everything we do--

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:24.120
in the economy, in politics,
in social policies.

00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:29.120
And so, in some
ways-- like, this

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:34.020
is kind of a civilizational
muscle of discernment.

00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:38.510
We actually have to start
to think outside the frames

00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:43.335
that we inherited
and see in a new way.

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:50.920
But another piece of language
that's really important to me

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.740
now is thinking about
having, not just imagination,

00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:55.300
but moral imagination.

00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:03.900
And then, again, discernment--

00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:05.970
there's no prescription.

00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:10.400
It's going to be different
in every setting.

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.320
But I think there are
muscles we can build up

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:16.350
and also ways we can help
hold each other accountable.

00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:20.540
AUDIENCE: So in my role here,
I serve the manager and leader

00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:21.590
community.

00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:25.959
And my intention and goal is
to support them, actually,

00:58:25.959 --> 00:58:27.750
through asking them
questions rather than--

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:29.426
KRISTA TIPPETT:
Sorry, what community?

00:58:29.426 --> 00:58:31.300
AUDIENCE: The community
of leaders at Google.

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.130
KRISTA TIPPETT: OK.

00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:34.730
AUDIENCE: And so I'm
always on the lookout

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:36.800
for really solid questions.

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.510
And of course,
you're full of them.

00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:39.440
Both of you are.

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.320
And it's obviously a
very difficult time

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.430
to be a leader here or anywhere.

00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:50.210
But I'm seeing leaders
struggle with how to listen

00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:52.160
to questions that are--

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.140
sometimes, just, they're
so loaded, right?

00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:56.750
And these leaders don't have
the answers, necessarily.

00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:59.680
And they're not necessarily
responsible for the causes.

00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.850
And they have their own
questions about what's

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:03.180
going on in the struggle.

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:06.830
So my question for
you is, what advice--

00:59:06.830 --> 00:59:09.420
potentially, in the
form of some questions--

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:12.380
do you have for
our leaders for how

00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:16.010
to listen, respond,
be with what's

00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:18.085
being asked of them right now?

00:59:18.085 --> 00:59:18.960
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:19.560
You're right.

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:21.480
I think, when you talk
about loaded questions,

00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:23.188
then they're not really
questions, right?

00:59:23.188 --> 00:59:27.720
They're arguments
presented as questions.

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.940
That just feels like
a huge responsibility

00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:30.960
to answer that question.

00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:44.640
I do think that what the world
needs leaders in this sphere

00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:51.930
to be asking is,
how will we shape

00:59:51.930 --> 01:00:00.490
these technologies to human
purpose, to be good for us?

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:04.290
And if I say, audaciously,
that these are the tools--

01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:06.570
you have created the tools to--

01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:14.420
whereby we could start to
think and act as a species--

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:16.820
and we must, if we're
going to tackle something

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:21.090
like climate change, just to
name one of our big challenges,

01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:23.390
but perhaps the one that
is the ultimate one.

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:31.750
How can that-- like, I don't
want to say it as a problem--

01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:34.690
how to rise to that challenge--

01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:36.955
take that on as a
design question.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.290
Disrupt all the
compartmentalization.

01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:47.429
Disrupt all these
barriers and walls

01:00:47.429 --> 01:00:48.970
between all the
different disciplines

01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:51.490
we need to be
talking to each other

01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:55.004
to wrap our arms around some
of these big challenges.

01:00:55.004 --> 01:00:57.170
DANIELLE KRETTEK: I think,
I'd add to that as well--

01:00:57.170 --> 01:01:01.380
because I just
wholeheartedly agree--

01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:05.460
is we tend to think very fast.

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.696
And we tend to be very
reactive because there's

01:01:07.696 --> 01:01:09.820
so much at stake, and it's
all happening right now,

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:11.040
And there's a lot on the--

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.040
to say the stake thing again--
there's so much on the line.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:19.050
And really, the listening
aspect, the silence aspect,

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:22.770
the patience aspect of this,
I think, is how do we know--

01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:25.371
there are things about humanity
that will never change.

01:01:25.371 --> 01:01:27.120
There are the things
that are wired inside

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.990
of us that will always be true.

01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:31.380
How do we think
as slow as we can

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:33.600
to the things that never change?

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.540
Because that's where the
real responses will come.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:38.670
The fast answers
are so challenging

01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:41.670
and loaded-- as loaded as the
questions and as dangerous

01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:43.050
for individuals too.

01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:45.557
There's just so much
going on in that moment.

01:01:45.557 --> 01:01:47.640
When, really, when we stop
and think about the way

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.890
that we are, as
people, and the way

01:01:49.890 --> 01:01:51.690
that we are as people
together, and what

01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:53.880
it means to live in
a particular way,

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.380
that we can all be
proud of and that

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.810
feels like it is about
human flourishing

01:01:57.810 --> 01:02:01.980
and civility and the space
that includes all of us.

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:03.240
Those are harder questions.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.579
Those are feeling questions.

01:02:04.579 --> 01:02:06.870
We're not all necessarily in
the practice of that, even

01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:07.980
personally.

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:10.890
Just encouraging and having
those conversations here,

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:14.310
making space for that, that's
the beginning of all of it.

01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:17.460
So I thank you for
doing your work

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:19.160
and for asking the questions.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:24.660
KRISTA TIPPETT: Something else
I might say is, given that--

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:27.900
I don't think anybody who
started any of these companies

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:31.900
wanted to be changing human na--

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:36.310
interwoven into people's bodies,
brains, and psyches, right?

01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:37.940
That's not what
anybody set out to do.

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.064
But that's what's happened.

01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:48.750
A lot of the terrible reckonings
we're having now, even around

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:51.690
things that we thought we'd
made great progress on socially,

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:57.580
like racial dynamics
and gender dynamics--

01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:01.920
50 years ago, there were
beautiful movements,

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.680
and a lot of laws changed.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.440
And we kind of came into
the 21st century thinking,

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.470
we cracked this.

01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:11.250
We can keep getting better at
it, but we basically did this.

01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:13.530
And we hadn't.

01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:18.440
And one way I analyze
that is that we

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:21.772
have this idea that,
if you know history,

01:03:21.772 --> 01:03:22.730
it won't repeat itself.

01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:25.400
But the truth is, actually, that
history always repeats itself

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.110
until you know yourself.

01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:34.690
And we changed laws, but
we didn't change ourselves.

01:03:34.690 --> 01:03:37.750
And now, again, with
science as our companion,

01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:39.930
we learn about implicit bias.

01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:42.890
We learn how our
brains were hard wires.

01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:45.520
And we didn't know
how to effect that.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:49.140
The beautiful thing-- so it's
terrible to wake up to the fact

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:52.297
that we were so much less
farther along than we thought.

01:03:52.297 --> 01:03:53.880
But the beautiful
thing is we actually

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:57.450
now know we have knowledge
that can be a form of power.

01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:00.660
And you are working in a
sphere that is actively

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.880
engaging our brains--

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.180
actively involved in our
inner lives as well as

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:08.530
our outer lives.

01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:12.330
So again, I would say, take
that as a creative challenge,

01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:15.600
a generative challenge.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.070
And it's uncomfortable, right?

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:17.640
I know.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:18.930
It's not what anybody wanted.

01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:20.607
But there it is.

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:23.190
DANIELLE KRETTEK: I'm going to
sneak a question in between you

01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:26.877
and Peter, who will
be our last question.

01:04:26.877 --> 01:04:28.710
One of the things that's
come up a few times

01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:32.640
here is the poetry, art,
the space of the heart,

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:35.180
the wisdom traditions.

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:37.210
These are things that
I think live very much

01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:38.980
in the spirits of
many people that

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:41.570
are in all of these places.

01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:43.090
What do you think
that we all have

01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:45.370
to learn from those
traditions explicitly,

01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:48.310
not necessarily
in our own homes,

01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:49.610
in the doors of our heart?

01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:50.735
That's where it all begins.

01:04:50.735 --> 01:04:52.210
But what do the
wisdom traditions--

01:04:52.210 --> 01:04:57.940
what do all of these ancient
human languages of our souls--

01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:00.133
what place do they
have in this space?

01:05:00.133 --> 01:05:01.757
How can we invite
them in, potentially?

01:05:01.757 --> 01:05:05.230
KRISTA TIPPETT: Well,
this is the part

01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:08.950
of the human enterprise
where we tried

01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:13.404
to think about what our soul
is and what our heart is

01:05:13.404 --> 01:05:15.945
and, actually, what the fullness
of our human-- because these

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:18.310
are also the parts of the
human enterprise where

01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:23.310
we are actually honest about how
complicated and messy we are.

01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:25.390
The technocratic
20th century wanted

01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:27.670
to think that we could just
bracket those things out.

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:30.160
And you could check your
personal life at the door.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:35.770
And we wouldn't bring messy
things into the public sphere.

01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:39.340
And it didn't work that way.

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:41.380
And now, all of that--

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.000
now, we're in this moment--

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.640
I think this has something
to do also with technology

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:49.650
and just how rapidly
things have shifted--

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:53.150
that everything that
we have been thinking

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:55.820
was such a rational discipline--

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:59.900
our politics, our
economics, the data--

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:02.900
that these are just
the thinnest of veneers

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:05.570
over the human drama.

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:08.240
And again, it's really
messy and uncomfortable

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.740
to say, oh, my god.

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:10.860
That's what we have to do?

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:14.480
But I actually think, that,
we have to address in order

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.440
to do all the other work.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.550
And these are the parts
of the human enterprise

01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:23.210
where that has been
investigated and where,

01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:27.820
again, spiritual technologies
have been developed.

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:30.550
And that's there
for us, whatever--

01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:32.692
there are these
great institutions

01:06:32.692 --> 01:06:33.650
which came out of that.

01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:36.050
There's the history of religion.

01:06:36.050 --> 01:06:39.100
But that's not all it is.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:41.035
DANIELLE KRETTEK: I
love how, in your book,

01:06:41.035 --> 01:06:44.470
you said that it was
comforting to you, as you spoke

01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:47.140
to all of these great
scientists and minds

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:50.100
to know that everyone
is equally as--

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:52.450
or basically, that
black holes are easy.

01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:53.925
And humans and the
human condition

01:06:53.925 --> 01:06:54.985
is so perplexing for us.

01:06:54.985 --> 01:06:55.860
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:59.140
And astrophysicists will
tell you that nothing

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.030
they're working with--

01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:04.810
no black hole is as complex as
any living organism, not just

01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:05.630
human beings.

01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:06.880
DANIELLE KRETTEK: I love that.

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.050
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:10.070
DANIELLE KRETTEK: Peter--
want to take us home?

01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:11.080
KRISTA TIPPETT: Hi.

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.240
Thank you so much
for sharing and being

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.539
generous with your
wisdom and experience.

01:07:16.539 --> 01:07:17.830
There's so much that you said--

01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:20.335
I'm a disciple of Danielle's.

01:07:20.335 --> 01:07:23.380
I focus on, actually,
strategy to look

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:26.260
at how we can use a lens
of empathy and emotional

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.050
intelligence and behavioral
science to help guide, perhaps,

01:07:29.050 --> 01:07:30.760
a better future.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.410
But on that note,
there are things

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:34.630
you're saying, like
repair versus save,

01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:37.780
which I thought was wonderful
because it's an admission

01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:39.310
that we were responsible.

01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:43.620
And you have to admit that to
participate in the healing.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:47.770
So I think the stuff that
you're giving us, imparting us,

01:07:47.770 --> 01:07:51.040
is really going to help us.

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:56.590
I wanted to ask, because
you have, in your own sense,

01:07:56.590 --> 01:07:59.770
the mastery of listening
and interviewing--

01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:03.160
and you say you prepare, and
you do the ritual of being

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:08.680
hospitable and vulnerability--
all of these things are very,

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:12.250
to your point,
dynamics that engender

01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:16.720
reciprocal vulnerability
and generosity.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:21.830
But when you prepare, you kind
of stop the person, right?

01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:25.689
And so you come,
and then you say

01:08:25.689 --> 01:08:30.279
you're creating an
atmosphere of a safe place.

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:32.290
And it's interesting,
because I'm

01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:35.200
curious about the correlation
with things like trust

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.779
and what you believe
engenders trust,

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:41.170
and what you believe
actually builds rapport.

01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:42.720
What are the human
things that you've

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:43.761
found that build rapport.

01:08:43.761 --> 01:08:45.700
Because Google knows
stuff about you--

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:47.399
DANIELLE KRETTEK: You're
teasing our next session.

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:48.024
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:08:48.024 --> 01:08:50.779
So why aren't you
creepy, essentially?

01:08:50.779 --> 01:08:55.092
And what makes your art form
of rapport-building essential?

01:08:55.092 --> 01:08:56.050
I'm curious about that.

01:08:56.050 --> 01:08:56.979
KRISTA TIPPETT: Oh,
that's so interesting.

01:08:56.979 --> 01:08:58.210
Well, yeah.

01:08:58.210 --> 01:09:03.609
I have actually thought
about how the internet has

01:09:03.609 --> 01:09:04.835
changed the work I do.

01:09:04.835 --> 01:09:06.460
Because actually,
when I first started,

01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:09.069
15 years ago, I was
spending a lot of time

01:09:09.069 --> 01:09:11.950
in libraries, just
public libraries.

01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:17.080
And honestly, I don't know
how else I was finding things.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.247
So it was possible.

01:09:18.247 --> 01:09:19.830
But of course, now,
it's just, there's

01:09:19.830 --> 01:09:23.523
an abundance of information
on anybody, as you say.

01:09:23.523 --> 01:09:25.689
And I can also find things--
which is sometimes fun.

01:09:25.689 --> 01:09:28.105
Like, I can find things people
said 20 years ago that they

01:09:28.105 --> 01:09:30.089
totally forgot that they said.

01:09:30.089 --> 01:09:32.380
And that is a really great
moment in an interview where

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:34.550
you take them to a
place in themselves

01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:36.791
they haven't been for a while.

01:09:36.791 --> 01:09:37.290
Yeah.

01:09:37.290 --> 01:09:39.069
Why does it not
feel like stalking?

01:09:39.069 --> 01:09:41.430
Because it's appreciative.

01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:48.834
It's appreciative and-- it's
such an interesting question.

01:09:53.100 --> 01:10:03.340
People often say, or sometimes
say after our interviews,

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:06.760
that it was kind of like I
gave them a gift of themselves.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:11.700
Like, I gave them an opportunity
to say things they'd never

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:14.230
even said to themselves before.

01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:21.480
But I do that by knowing
so well how they think

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:24.880
and honoring that,
that then we can

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:29.930
start in a really deep
place and go from there.

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:34.420
I think, maybe, the
honoring word is important.

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:36.580
DANIELLE KRETTEK:
And that deep place

01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:40.930
that you hold for them to
return to and share and open up

01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:41.810
themselves--

01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:47.050
I think that human quality
of creating that space,

01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:52.540
that genuine curiosity,
that authentic moment that's

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:56.080
being created out of
hospitality, like she said--

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.720
it would be curious
to see what changes

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.110
when those values come alive
in the space with technology.

01:11:02.110 --> 01:11:03.105
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

01:11:03.105 --> 01:11:04.480
DANIELLE KRETTEK:
So we will see.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:07.097
That is all of our work
to share here today.

01:11:07.097 --> 01:11:08.180
Thank you so much, Krista.

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:08.710
KRISTA TIPPETT: Thank you
so much for having me.

01:11:08.710 --> 01:11:09.820
DANIELLE KRETTEK: Thank
you, everyone, for coming.

01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:10.695
KRISTA TIPPETT: Yeah.

01:11:10.695 --> 01:11:12.870
