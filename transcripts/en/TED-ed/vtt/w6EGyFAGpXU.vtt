00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:10.777
Hendrix, Cobain and Page.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.354
They can all shred,

00:00:12.354 --> 00:00:16.235
but how exactly do the iconic 
contraptions in their hands

00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:21.694
produce notes, rhythm, melody and music.

00:00:21.694 --> 00:00:26.603
When you pluck a guitar string, you create
a vibration called a standing wave.

00:00:26.603 --> 00:00:30.530
Some points on the string, called nodes,
don't move at all,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.180
while other points, anti-nodes, 
oscillate back and forth.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.584
The vibration translates through the neck
and bridge to the guitar's body,

00:00:39.584 --> 00:00:42.432
where the thin and flexible wood vibrates,

00:00:42.432 --> 00:00:46.625
jostling the surrounding air molecules
together and apart.

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:49.730
These sequential compressions
create sound waves,

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.932
and the ones inside the guitar
mostly escape through the hole.

00:00:53.932 --> 00:00:56.221
They eventually propagate to your ear,

00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:58.790
which translates them into
electrical impulses

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.925
that your brain interprets as sound.

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:06.482
The pitch of that sound depends on
the frequency of the compressions.

00:01:06.482 --> 00:01:10.980
A quickly vibrating string will cause
a lot of compressions close together,

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.553
making a high-pitched sound,

00:01:12.553 --> 00:01:16.418
and a slow vibration 
produces a low-pitched sound.

00:01:16.418 --> 00:01:19.682
Four things affect the frequency
of a vibrating string:

00:01:19.682 --> 00:01:24.210
the length, the tension,
the density and the thickness.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.030
Typical guitar strings 
are all the same length,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.524
and have similar tension,
but vary in thickness and density.

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:35.991
Thicker strings vibrate more slowly,
producing lower notes.

00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:37.992
Each time you pluck a string,

00:01:37.992 --> 00:01:40.747
you actually create 
several standing waves.

00:01:40.747 --> 00:01:44.981
There's the first fundamental wave,
which determines the pitch of the note,

00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:47.528
but there are also waves
called overtones,

00:01:47.528 --> 00:01:51.339
whose frequencies 
are multiples of the first one.

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:57.055
All these standing waves combine
to form a complex wave with a rich sound.

00:01:57.055 --> 00:02:01.448
Changing the way you pluck the string
affects which overtones you get.

00:02:01.448 --> 00:02:03.185
If you pluck it near the middle,

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:07.103
you get mainly the fundamental
and the odd multiple overtones,

00:02:07.103 --> 00:02:10.076
which have anti-nodes
in the middle of the string.

00:02:10.076 --> 00:02:14.358
If you pluck it near the bridge,
you get mainly even multiple overtones

00:02:14.358 --> 00:02:16.410
and a twangier sound.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.257
The familiar Western scale is based on
the overtone series of a vibrating string.

00:02:22.257 --> 00:02:27.261
When we hear one note played with another
that has exactly twice its frequency,

00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:29.195
its first overtone,

00:02:29.195 --> 00:02:33.203
they sound so harmonious
that we assign them the same letter,

00:02:33.203 --> 00:02:36.930
and define the difference between them
as an octave.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.115
The rest of the scale 
is squeezed into that octave

00:02:40.115 --> 00:02:42.102
divided into twelve half steps

00:02:42.102 --> 00:02:48.039
whose frequency is each 2^(1/12)
higher than the one before.

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:51.290
That factor determines the fret spacing.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.115
Each fret divides the string's
remaining length by 2^(1/12),

00:02:57.115 --> 00:03:00.581
making the frequencies 
increase by half steps.

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:02.601
Fretless instruments, like violins,

00:03:02.601 --> 00:03:06.926
make it easier to produce the infinite
frequencies between each note,

00:03:06.926 --> 00:03:10.519
but add to the challenge 
of playing intune.

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.581
The number of strings and their tuning

00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:15.793
are custom tailored 
to the chords we like to play

00:03:15.793 --> 00:03:17.980
and the physiology of our hands.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.863
Guitar shapes and materials can also vary,

00:03:20.863 --> 00:03:24.527
and both change the nature 
and sound of the vibrations.

00:03:24.527 --> 00:03:27.206
Playing two or more 
strings at the same time

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:32.205
allows you to create new wave patterns
like chords and other sound effects.

00:03:32.205 --> 00:03:36.279
For example, when you play two notes
whose frequencies are close together,

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:41.605
they add together to create a sound wave
whose amplitude rises and falls,

00:03:41.605 --> 00:03:46.500
producing a throbbing effect,
which guitarists call the beats.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.506
And electric guitars give you 
even more to play with.

00:03:49.506 --> 00:03:51.692
The vibrations still start in the strings,

00:03:51.692 --> 00:03:55.931
but then they're translated 
into electrical signals by pickups

00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:59.084
and transmitted to speakers 
that create the sound waves.

00:03:59.084 --> 00:04:00.909
Between the pickups and speakers,

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:04.675
it's possible to process 
the wave in various ways,

00:04:04.675 --> 00:04:11.758
to create effects like distortion,
overdrive, wah-wah, delay and flanger.

00:04:11.758 --> 00:04:16.139
And lest you think that the physics 
of music is only useful for entertainment,

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.059
consider this.

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:20.822
Some physicists think that everything
in the universe

00:04:20.822 --> 00:04:26.892
is created by the harmonic series
of very tiny, very tense strings.

00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:29.468
So might our entire reality

00:04:29.468 --> 00:04:33.770
be the extended solo 
of some cosmic Jimi Hendrix?

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.125
Clearly, there's a lot more to strings
than meets the ear.
