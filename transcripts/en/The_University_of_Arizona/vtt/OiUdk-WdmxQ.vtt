00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:08.200
Aflatoxin has been implicated in
stunting of childrens' growth,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.390
in increasing the
incident of liver cancer,

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.430
and increasing
the susceptibility

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.270
to other secondary infections,
like HIV and malaria.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.000
So aflatoxin contamination
is prevalent in global crops.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.880
In this project, we expressed
a small RNA molecule

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.750
in corn kernels that
could successfully

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.680
transfer into a
contaminating fungal cell

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.740
and shut off the production
of the toxic compound.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.460
We would love to see
this aflatoxin free crop

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.000
in the hands of farmers where it
would really make a difference,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.660
in areas in developing countries
where food security is already

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.670
a big challenge.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.960
I remember the distinct moment
when I was in high school

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.390
genetics class where
we learned about Mendel

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.670
and the segregation
of genes, and I

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.610
felt as if I was hit over
the head with a frying pan.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.150
I knew, at that moment,
I had to be a geneticist

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.260
and that I wanted to use
it to make an impact.
