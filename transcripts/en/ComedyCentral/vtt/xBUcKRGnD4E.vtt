00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.170
It is time to play

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.239
Commercial Failure:
Tokyo Drift.

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:06.673
(cheering)

00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:09.843
Oh, wow.

00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:12.312
American celebrities
looking to cash in on their fame

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:14.681
will often head to Japan to
appear in bizarre TV commercials

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:16.750
without having to worry about it
devaluing their image

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:18.585
back home.
But thanks to YouTube,

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.356
we can revisit these cash grabs
and happily devalue away.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.491
I'm gonna show you
a Japanese advertisement

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:26.793
starring an American celebrity,
and for 250 points

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:29.062
I'm gonna need you to translate
a line from the commercial.

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:32.833
First up, smile enthusiast,
Tommy Lee Jones.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.801
(speaking Japanese)

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.116
Brendon.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.585
Suffering from
erectile dysfunction?

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:54.988
Ask your doctor if a teenage
Japanese girl is right for you.

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:05.065
It works.

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:09.002
Next one, how about this
little number from Nic Cage?

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:12.840
Oh, hi. I'm Nicolas Cage,
and this is a song for you.

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:15.709
♪ My favorite things,
my favorite things ♪

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.679
♪ Blue jeans,
seeing a red hair girl ♪

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:22.649
♪ Sweet peanut butter...

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:25.352
Just a... a little
back story on that--

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.654
uh, he ju... he had no idea
there was a commercial

00:01:27.688 --> 00:01:29.790
being filmed at the time.
Just, uh...

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:32.392
Just went to his house
and turned it into a commercial.

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:33.927
Brendon.

00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:37.164
If you have an erection that
lasts more than four hours

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.733
ask Nicolas Cage to play piano
and sing to it.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.235
All right, points.

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:43.904
And sing to it?
Sing to your erection.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:47.207
Right. Aah!

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:49.009
Uh, Carmen.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:52.246
Have you ever wished that
Billy Joel had brain damage?

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.451
God damn it.

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:59.486
That is a fantastic joke.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.555
Points, Carmen.
Doug Benson.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:04.892
Uh, throw me the beads,
I'll show you my dick.

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:06.860
-I don't... They're all gone.
-You're out of beads?

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:08.562
-I don't have any.
-They took the beads.

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.697
-No more beads.
-I don't have any that are out.

00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:12.666
Uh...

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.773
Next one, how about this creepy
encounter with Madonna's face?

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.609
(woman speaking Japanese)

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:24.077
MADONNA:
♪ Watch it throw

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:27.414
♪ Tears on my pillow

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:30.584
♪ And if there is a Christ...

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.320
Doug.

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:35.722
Madonna still dating
younger men.

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:39.726
Points.

00:02:43.297 --> 00:02:44.665
Uh, Carmen.

00:02:44.698 --> 00:02:46.066
The Madonna sex tape

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.903
-Peter Dinklage doesn't
want you to see. -Oh, (bleep).

00:02:49.937 --> 00:02:50.003
Aw.
