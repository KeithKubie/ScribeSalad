00:00:00.557 --> 00:00:02.140
In the last video,
we talked about how

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.690
we could create a voltaic cell
or galvanic cell or essentially

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.880
a battery by separating the
oxidation and the reduction

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.950
reactions and connecting
them with a wire, which

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.520
forces the electrons
that zinc is losing

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.330
to go through the wire
to go to the copper ions

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.219
so that they can get them, so
the copper ions can be reduced.

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:27.010
Now, that might have
raised some questions.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.751
If this is a battery, well,
what is the positive terminal?

00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:31.000
What is the negative terminal?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.615
If this is a battery, what is
the voltage of this battery?

00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:37.240
Well, I'll encourage
you, first of all,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.990
when you think about the
terminal, what's the positive

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.070
and what's the
negative terminal,

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.050
I encourage you to
pause this video

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.425
and think about
that on your own.

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:45.304
Where is the current coming
from and where is it going?

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:46.970
Well, the negative
terminal of a battery

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.450
is where the electrons
are coming from.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.590
So the electrons are coming from
the zinc bar right over here.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.205
So this is the
negative electrode

00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:57.740
of the battery that
right over there.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.100
Or the negative electrode
is often called the anode.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.450
That is the anode
of this battery.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.320
And on the other
side, the copper bar,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.710
this is where the
electrons are going to.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.300
This is the positive
electrode, or what

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.270
tends to be called the cathode.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.550
Now, the next question is
what is the voltage across?

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.310
This voltage is going
to depend on what's

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.430
the concentration of
zinc ions you have,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.610
the concentration of
copper ions you have.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.640
It'll depend on the pressure.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.860
It'll depend on the temperature.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.540
But all of that has
been standardized,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.970
and you could actually
look up "standard electrode

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.650
potentials."

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.620
And I encourage you, you
could do a web search

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.740
for "standard
electrode potentials,"

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.560
and you'll see a
bunch of voltages

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.860
for the different ions,
which is essentially

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.050
a measure of relative
to hydrogen--

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.810
and this is all
relative to hydrogen--

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.290
how much does this ion
want to grab its electrons?

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.900
And so, if you were
to look that up,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.640
you would get it for this
reaction right over here.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.220
For the copper ions, with an
oxidation number of positive 2

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.039
to grab these two electrons
and turn it into solid copper,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.750
relative to what they call the
standard hydrogen electrode,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.800
that has a 0.34
voltage, which means

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.850
that it's more likely to
happen than in the case

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.910
with a standard
hydrogen electrode.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.410
And don't worry too
much about that.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.368
We're really just going
to compare the voltages

00:02:33.368 --> 00:02:35.690
and seeing, well, what is
the total electromotive

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.340
force or the total voltage with
which this redox reaction is

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.430
going to happen or the
total electromotive

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.940
force with which
we're going to push

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.020
these electrons across the wire.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.810
If you were to look
up the zinc reaction

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.340
in a table of standard
electrode potentials,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.021
you might see negative 0.76.

00:02:58.021 --> 00:02:59.520
Now, you have to
be careful, though,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.440
because if they're
giving you this number,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.360
they're giving you the
opposite reaction here.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.920
They're giving the reaction
going from zinc ions,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.400
grabbing some electrons,
and becoming solid zinc.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.690
We want the other reaction.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.064
This is the reaction
that we need

00:03:14.064 --> 00:03:15.940
to occur for our galvanic cell.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.660
So this reaction
right over here is

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.110
going to be the
negative of that.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.750
So it's going to be
positive 0.76 volts.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.950
So one way to think
about it is this

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.990
wants to happen with
an electromotive force

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.397
or the energy per Coulomb
relatively of 0.76 volts.

00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:36.730
This wants to happen with--
the electromotive force here

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.340
is 0.34 volts.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.330
So combined, this
entire reaction

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.100
is going to happen with
an electromotive force,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.110
or you could say that
the potential per Coulomb

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.460
difference between
this side and that side

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.780
is going to be the sum
of these two things.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.220
And so, if we have the
standard concentration,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.440
which would be one molar--
which is one mole per liter--

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.930
of the ions in their
aqueous solution,

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.410
if we're at standard
temperature, standard pressure,

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.580
then we would have essentially
constructed a 1.1-volt battery.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.167
And I've just added these
two things together.

00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:18.250
And of course, there's
other ways you could do it.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.620
You could literally just
take a voltmeter and measure

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.352
what is the volt
without the current

00:04:23.352 --> 00:04:24.810
there, without the
current flowing?

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.351
You could literally
just measure what

00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:28.940
is the voltage difference
between these two terminals,

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.000
just as you would do in
a traditional battery.
