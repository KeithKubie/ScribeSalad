TAMMY STERN: Mitchel
Resnick is a Professor

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.930
of Learning Research at the MIT
Media Lab, where he develops

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.270
new technologies and
activities to engage

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.220
people, especially children, in
creative learning experiences.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.700
His research team, called the
Lifelong Kindergarten Group,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.540
develops the Scratch programming
software and online community,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.780
the world's largest
coding platform for kids.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.830
His group also collaborates
with the LEGO company

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.240
on the development of
new educational ideas

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.160
and products, including LEGO
MINDSTORMS robotics kits.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.980
Mitchel co-founded the
Computer Clubhouse Project,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.640
an international network of
100 after school centers,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.830
where youth from low
income communities

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.050
learn to express
themselves creatively

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.790
with new technologies.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.170
Mitchel and the
Scratch team have

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.330
partnered with
Google and Google.org

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.260
to increase youth coding efforts
through projects like CS First,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.530
Google's CS curriculum
for nine to 14-year-olds,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.940
and Blockly, which makes the
app development more accessible.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.450
On a personal note, I worked
with Mitchel to develop Scratch

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.180
and traveled around the
world doing Scratch workshops

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.930
with children and educators.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.440
I remember how exciting it was
for kids to build projects,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.600
bringing their
creations to life,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.940
and how enabling and
empowering these tools

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.310
can be for those who
might not otherwise

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.970
have found themselves coding.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.980
Working with Mitchel
and the Scratch team

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.710
helped me internalize
that coding did not

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.550
need to be an exclusive skill
restricted to engineers,

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.580
but rather a tool to
enable anyone to creatively

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.350
express themselves, or to tackle
personally meaningful projects.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.560
Mitchel's passion for people,
education, and empowerment

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.170
has inspired me and
countless others,

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.250
and I'm excited to introduce
him to speak with you all today.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:06.848 --> 00:02:08.889
MITCHEL RESNICK: OK, well,
thanks so much, Tammy.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.190
It's great to be talking here
at Google, because as Scratch

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.470
continues to grow,
we're forming stronger

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.690
and stronger
collaboration with Google,

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.235
as I'll be mentioning
in the talk.

00:02:18.235 --> 00:02:20.110
So it's great to be here
and to talk with you

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.540
and to share some of the work
we're doing now, and looking

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.790
ahead to some of the things
we're starting to work on,

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.206
many are projects
in collaboration

00:02:26.206 --> 00:02:28.225
with people here at Google.

00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:29.600
We've had lots of
different ways.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.420
We've also been
very fortunate to be

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.710
able to have people from Google
who then come and work with us.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.626
I'm here with my colleague,
Champika Fernando,

00:02:35.626 --> 00:02:37.690
who we stole from Google twice.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.510
She came to work with us and was
a student, went back to Google,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.430
and then recently came back
and started working with us.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.260
So there's been lots
of flow back and forth

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.080
of both people and ideas.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.560
And it's been great to have
the history with Tammy.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.260
So I even went back
into the archives

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.130
and found from when Scratch was
launched in 2007, 10 years ago,

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.692
this was the Scratch team.

00:02:55.692 --> 00:02:57.400
And you can see myself
there, and there's

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.790
Tammy as an MIT--
she was finishing up

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.260
at MIT at the time.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.970
I think shortly after this,
then started at Google.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.940
So it's great to
reconnect and be

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.830
able to have continued through
the years to share ideas.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.950
Since Tammy left the
Scratch team in 2007,

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.350
Scratch has continued
to grow and grow.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.360
Like, you know, over
the last decade,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.130
Scratch has really
grown, to where

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.570
there's a number
of people joining

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.940
the Scratch online community.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.130
So this past year, there
were 8 million young people

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.667
who registered on the
Scratch online community.

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:31.750
And you can just see it's
been growing and growing

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.840
over the years.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.110
But I think, for us, what's
most important is not

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.240
just the number of
people involved,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.375
but the creativity
expressed by them,

00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:41.500
and the way this is really
transforming their lives

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.380
and the way that they can create
things and express themselves.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.950
So I want to start
with a story of one

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.970
of those millions
of young people,

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.330
just to give a sense of
what the experience is

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.314
like for young people when they
join this Scratch community.

00:03:56.314 --> 00:03:58.480
So this is the story about
a young person-- everyone

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.190
starts with a user name.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.130
This is someone whose
username was Ipzy.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.280
And Ipzy described-- you know,
when Ipzy was growing up,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.870
one of their favorite
things to do was drawing.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.090
They loved to draw things.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.040
And Ipzy got
started with Scratch

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.830
when one of Ipzy's
friends explained

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.930
that Scratch was a way to
make her drawings come alive.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.860
And that was really
intriguing for Ipzy.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.760
So Ipzy tried out, Scratch.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.830
And this is one of
the first projects

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.842
that they worked on in Scratch.

00:04:25.842 --> 00:04:27.550
And what I like about
this is you can see

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.280
it's Ipzy's drawing, and there's
just a little bit of animation.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.810
You see the ears are wiggling
and the eyes are moving.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.060
And you can almost see here
Ipzy starting with something

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.280
that they're comfortable
with, and like dipping

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.230
their toe in the water
to try something new.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.217
So this is the
Scratch programming.

00:04:43.217 --> 00:04:45.050
For those who haven't
seen it, with Scratch,

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.810
you build up programs
by stacking together

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.760
graphical programming blocks.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.150
This is one of Ipzy's
first programs and project,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.450
as a way to start exploring
to testing something new.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.460
And Ipzy found that
they really enjoyed

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.080
working on these
types of projects,

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.750
so they started spending
more time on Scratch.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.330
A little while later,
this is a project

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.310
that really got Ipzy
known in the community.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.890
You can see Ipzy's projects got
more and more sophisticated.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.110
This is a project that Ipzy
worked on called Lemonade Time.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.790
And in this project, you
can use the arrow keys

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.230
to move the otter.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.970
And as the otter moves
around, the otter

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.150
gets tips from different
animals that the otter comes

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.800
across-- the bird, the frog.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.770
And the goal is to be able to
get all the ingredients to make

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.400
lemonade.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.975
So you have to
get the ideas, you

00:05:28.975 --> 00:05:31.630
have get instructions
and tips, on where

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.320
to get the water, the lemons,
the sugar to make lemonade.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.390
So Ipzy put this in
the online community

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.909
and it became really popular.

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.450
So if you go to the
online community,

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.455
you can still see this.

00:05:41.455 --> 00:05:43.810
This is the page
for Lemonade Time.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.140
And you can see it was
viewed 17,000 times.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.320
It was loved close
to 2,000 times.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.480
It was remixed 88 times.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.700
Because in Scratch,
anybody can take a project

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.780
and then make modifications
to it, changing the images,

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.110
changing the code.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.680
It's all sort of an open
source culture around Scratch.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.164
Everything that is shared is
covered by Creative Commons.

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:06.580
So as long as you
give credit, you

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.600
can remix other
people's projects.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.310
So 88 people made remixed
projects of Lemonade Time.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.130
Nearly 2,000 people--
1,830 people--

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.200
gave comments,
giving suggestions

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.120
or feedback or encouragement.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.871
And you can tell that Ipzy was
listening to these comments

00:06:21.871 --> 00:06:23.620
and reading them
carefully, because if you

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.260
look in the instructions
here, it says, "edit--

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.260
due to popular demand, the otter
walks a little faster now."

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.080
So like any good
designer, Ipzy's

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.250
listening to the audience
and making changes,

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.430
based on what comes across.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.310
A lot of the comments
we're about Ipzy's artwork.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.810
People really liked
Ipzy's artwork.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.374
And several people
said, we'd love

00:06:42.374 --> 00:06:43.540
to see more of your artwork.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.830
Can you share more
of your artwork?

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.790
So Ipzy started putting up some
projects like this one, branded

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.870
as Ipzy Studio.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.610
And it's a collection
of different artwork

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.020
that Ipzy's sharing with
the rest the community.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.440
And Ipzy wrote, "You can edit
them as much as you want,

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.100
but you must credit me if you
use any of these sprites."

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.580
Sprites are the
objects in Scratch.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.370
And this is a sign
that Ipzy was learning

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.680
how to be a good member
of the online community,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.530
and sort of understanding
this idea of sharing

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.554
under Creative Commons.

00:07:14.554 --> 00:07:16.470
And this was definitely
an evolution for Ipzy,

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.570
as it is for many
members of the community.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.090
At first, Ipzy was
upset when people

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.510
were taking their projects and
remixing them or using them

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.570
in different ways, or
taking characters, feeling

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.140
like, that's my character, they
shouldn't be able to do it.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.245
But over time, Ipzy
came to recognize that,

00:07:31.245 --> 00:07:33.690
when everyone shares,
everyone benefits.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.810
At this end, our team, we
were in constant communication

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.310
with people in the
community, trying

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.601
to help people understand this.

00:07:39.601 --> 00:07:40.942
But it's a constant--

00:07:40.942 --> 00:07:42.900
sometimes, we always say,
learning how to share

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.095
is even more difficult
than learning how to code.

00:07:45.095 --> 00:07:47.220
So that's the real thing
that I think a lot of kids

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.420
are learning.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.070
But you know, Ipzy
was doing this,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.730
but then, as they
continued to do it,

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.730
they came up with all
sorts of different things.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.010
Here was even a
tutorial that Ipzy

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.410
did showing how to make
scrolling backgrounds.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.470
You saw in the Lemonade
Time, that the background

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.720
was scrolling behind
the otter character,

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.040
as you moved the otter.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.060
It's not so easy to make
scrolling backgrounds

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:07.980
in Scratch.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.460
We're trying to figure
out how to make it easier,

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.470
but it's not so easy.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.510
But Ipzy figured
out how to do it,

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.390
and they made this tutorial
showing how to do it,

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.475
and then even commented the code
showing people how to do it.

00:08:18.475 --> 00:08:21.390
This, again, suddenly
took us by surprise.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.330
When we imagined that
we would do tutorials,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.420
and some teachers
would do tutorials,

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.770
what took us by surprise
is that so many kids

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.990
wanted to do tutorials.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.490
So if you go to the
Scratch website,

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.880
there are thousands
and thousands

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.980
of tutorials done by
kids-- how to do scrolling,

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.659
you know, how to use variables,
how to use the vector paint

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.400
editor, how to make your
projects popular on Scratch.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.824
People do tutorials
about everything.

00:08:43.824 --> 00:08:45.990
So we found that just people
are using the community

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.674
in so many different ways.

00:08:47.674 --> 00:08:49.590
So I think, just by
looking at these projects,

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.680
you can see what Ipzy is
taking away from participating

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.800
in the community.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.150
And I think what we see is
Ipzy is really developing

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.367
as a creative thinker.

00:08:58.367 --> 00:09:00.450
And we think that's more
important today than ever

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:00.950
before.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.960
For us, it's not just about
learning the coding skills,

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.510
although, clearly, if you
look at the scrolling back,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.945
Ipzy's clearly doing
learning some coding skills.

00:09:08.945 --> 00:09:10.320
But for us, what's
most important

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.109
is that Ipzy's really
learning to think creatively.

00:09:13.109 --> 00:09:15.150
And I think that's more
important today than ever

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.730
before.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.188
You know, we live
in a world that's

00:09:17.188 --> 00:09:20.370
changing so quickly that we
don't know exactly what skills

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.429
kids will need in the
future as they grow up,

00:09:22.429 --> 00:09:24.720
but we know they're going to
need to be able to come up

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.190
with creative solutions to
the unexpected things they

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.840
confront.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.589
Because they will be
confronting all sorts

00:09:29.589 --> 00:09:31.990
of unexpected and
new situations.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.690
And we think that's
what's happening

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.940
with young people like Ipzy.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.740
So to try to support
that development

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.260
of creative thinking,
we developed Scratch

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.230
with four guiding principles.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.170
We called them the four P's of
creative learning-- project,

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.767
passion, peers, and play.

00:09:47.767 --> 00:09:49.350
So with everything
we do, whether it's

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.840
developing Scratch,
or running a workshop,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.790
or giving advice to
parents about what toys

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.320
to get for their
kids, we're always

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.110
guided by thinking about
these four P's, because it's

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.360
a good framework for thinking
about how you can really

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.754
help support creative thinking.

00:10:02.754 --> 00:10:04.170
So if you look at
Scratch, you can

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:08.160
see that it really is aligned
and guided by these four P's

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.700
of creative learning.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.860
The first one-- projects.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.320
Well, you saw Ipzy was just
constantly making projects,

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.020
and the Scratch website
is based on projects.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.570
It's the core unit of
sharing on Scratch.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.054
There's 30 million projects
that kids have shared.

00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:22.470
Now, it might seem
obvious, if you

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.220
look at Scratch, you
say, well, of course,

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.600
they're working on projects.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.270
But that's not the way
most kids learn to code.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.920
Go to most coding
websites and kids

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.710
are given a puzzle or
a problem to solve.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.880
They get the answer.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.550
And then they're moved on
to a next puzzle or problem.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.230
And again, when I
was 10 years old,

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.563
I would have enjoyed doing that.

00:10:39.563 --> 00:10:40.810
A lot of kids enjoy doing it.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:42.700
And you can learn some
computational concepts

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.450
that way.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.350
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.824
But if you really want to
develop as a creative thinker,

00:10:47.824 --> 00:10:49.240
it's not just a
matter of learning

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.410
how to solve a certain puzzle,
but being able to do a project.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.570
And with a project, I mean,
to start with your own idea,

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.660
to develop some prototype
with it, to show it to others,

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.020
to experiment with it, to get
feedback, to keep revising it,

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.752
to have a way of expressing
your ideas to the world.

00:11:04.752 --> 00:11:06.460
So with a project,
kids, they aren't just

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.549
developing their thinking, but
also developing their voice,

00:11:09.549 --> 00:11:11.590
coming up with an idea
and expressing their ideas

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:12.710
to the world.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.400
So we really try to see Scratch
as it's like a type of writing.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.050
The same way when
you learn to write,

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.940
it's not just to get
tasks done, but it's

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.260
a way of expressing your ideas.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.130
We see Scratch the same way,
as kids work on projects.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.040
And this second P of
passion, I think we all

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.820
know that we're all willing
to work longer and harder

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.270
and persist in the
face of challenges,

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:37.010
where we're working on something
we really care deeply about.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.950
So for us, it's so
important to give kids

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.320
the opportunity to work on
things they really care about.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.870
So as we were
developing Scratch,

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.453
we wanted to make sure that you
could do many different things

00:11:46.453 --> 00:11:46.960
with it.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.950
Because we know
that different kids

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.212
have different interests
and different passions,

00:11:50.212 --> 00:11:51.670
and we wanted to
make sure to align

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.440
with the interests of
all different kids.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.940
I mean, some people
suggested, well,

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.640
why don't you do it so all
you do is to make games?

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.450
Kids like games.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.700
And it's true, a lot
of kids like games.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.320
But about kids who
don't like games?

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.150
Then they wouldn't
be interested in it.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.233
We wanted to make sure
that kids could make games,

00:12:06.233 --> 00:12:09.040
but they can also make
animations and simulations

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.280
and interactive stories.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.280
Because different kids
have different interests,

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.080
we wanted to let all
kids build on things

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.040
they really want to do.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.110
And you can see that in Ipzy's
case, where Ipzy was building

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.750
upon their interest in
drawing, and used that as a way

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.760
to get into coding.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.840
With peers, we saw
from the beginning

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.400
that we really wanted to make
sure that learning to code

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.930
was a social experience,
that too often,

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.420
when people think
of coding, they

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.270
think of the individual
sitting by themselves

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.380
looking at the screen.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.990
And of course, you spend some
time doing that and, you know,

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.600
sometimes that's an important
part of the process.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.100
But we know that
a lot of learning

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.050
happens in collaboration
with others.

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.160
So when we launched Scratch, we
launched the online community

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.240
at the same time, integrated
with the programming language.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.887
And to us, that was
really important.

00:12:56.887 --> 00:12:58.720
And a lot of people,
they weren't quite sure

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.137
what we were doing,
because why do

00:13:00.137 --> 00:13:02.386
you have to have an online
computer with a programming

00:13:02.386 --> 00:13:02.905
language?

00:13:02.905 --> 00:13:07.060
But for us, the online community
both served as a source of--

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.270
it was a way to have an
audience for what you'd created.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.710
Because when you
create something,

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.626
you want to be able to
share ideas with others

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:16.550
and get feedback, because we
saw Ipzy getting feedback.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.010
It also serves as a
source of inspiration.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.710
You can look at the
online community,

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:24.130
and you see, again, millions of
projects that gives you ideas

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.090
of what you want to create.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.180
So we wanted to have
a way that would have

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.450
kids connect with each other.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:30.910
They would learn
with and from one

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.550
another, both to get feedback
and inspiration from one

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.760
another.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.230
And then, finally, play, and
I sometimes call play the most

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.196
misunderstood of the P's.

00:13:40.196 --> 00:13:42.070
Because people here play
and they just think,

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.190
oh, it's about laughing
and having fun.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.794
And there's nothing wrong
with laughing and having fun.

00:13:46.794 --> 00:13:48.460
But we think of play
in a different way.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.000
We see it almost as an attitude,
or an approach, to the things

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.770
you're doing.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.460
When you have a
playful approach,

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.190
it means you're willing to
take risks, to try new things,

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.310
to test the boundaries,
to experiment.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.450
And we wanted to make
sure that was possible.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.830
So we've really set up Scratch
so it's easy to put things

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.030
together, take them apart.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.309
You can make your
programs sort of

00:14:09.309 --> 00:14:10.600
like building with LEGO bricks.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.970
LEGO bricks are so tinkerable,
and you can play with them,

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.053
try new things, take it
apart, try something else,

00:14:15.053 --> 00:14:16.252
continually iterate.

00:14:16.252 --> 00:14:18.710
And we wanted to make Scratch
really easy to iterate so you

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.215
could keep experimenting.

00:14:20.215 --> 00:14:22.090
So that's what we did,
and tried to make it--

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.830
and we also, in
moderating the committee,

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.980
to make sure the community
is a type of place

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.960
where you feel safe
experimenting and trying

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.070
new things.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:33.800
So these four P's have guided
the things that we're doing.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.440
And from this, I
think this really

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.760
underlies why Scratch has been
growing over the last 10 years.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.150
And it really has grown beyond
what we would have imagined.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:47.140
So last year, there were
200 million unique visitors

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:47.857
to Scratch.

00:14:47.857 --> 00:14:49.690
Now, not all of them
were creating projects.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.990
About 10%, about 20 million
people created projects.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.830
But people just
visiting and trying out

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.890
Scratch and its things,
there's about 200 million

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:58.540
unique visitors.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.480
You know, every
country in the world.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.230
From the beginning,
we wanted to translate

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:03.730
to many different
languages, so it's

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.800
easy to make the blocks switch
to whatever language you want.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.140
And even if you see
someone else's project--

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.210
a project that was
done in New York--

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.260
a child in Tokyo could look
at it and switch the blocks

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.060
to Japanese, make a change to
it, and a child in Buenos Aires

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.190
could then change the
blocks to Spanish.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.860
So it facilitates collaboration
by everyone changing it

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.320
to their own language.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.600
45% female, 100%--
everything is free.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.160
The software is free,
the community is free.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.650
It's also open source.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.330
So we've really
tried to build it

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.050
where all of that development
is done in an open source way.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:38.630
And we have people helping out.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:39.921
We've been really appreciative.

00:15:39.921 --> 00:15:41.765
A bunch of people of
Google have helped out.

00:15:41.765 --> 00:15:43.890
We did an initiative last
year through Google Serve

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:44.590
and people helped out.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.150
We hope, as we
continue to develop,

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.130
we'll have others
helping us out.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.650
And every day, there's
150,000 new projects

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.130
that kids are creating
in the Scratch community.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:55.270
Who's creating them?

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.336
This is a histogram of
the ages that people

00:15:57.336 --> 00:15:58.210
joined the community.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:00.070
The peak is at age 12.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.530
And this pretty much hits
what we had aimed for.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.530
When we developed Scratch,
we aimed at age 8 to 16,

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:09.670
and that's roughly where
the bulk of the people are.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.680
After Scratch came out,
we did another version

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.444
called ScratchJr, which is for
ages 5 to 7 at the lower end.

00:16:16.444 --> 00:16:17.860
One thing that
took us by surprise

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.800
is there's more use at the
higher end than we imagined.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.897
Because even though we
designed it for 8 to 16,

00:16:22.897 --> 00:16:25.480
it's getting used in a growing
number of introductory computer

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.450
science courses at universities,
sometimes for a whole semester,

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.300
sometimes just to get started.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.330
Like, at Harvard, they
use it as the first week

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.930
of the introductory computer
science course there--

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.350
CS50.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.180
And they found that,
when they shifted over

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.950
to doing Scratch
in the beginning,

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.990
the number of people
dropping the course

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.840
went down dramatically,
especially among women.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.510
They used to have huge
dropout rates of women.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.850
And at least, they speculate
that, with Scratch, people

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.082
were able to have
success very quickly,

00:16:54.082 --> 00:16:55.540
and get a sense of
what's possible,

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.666
and what type of things
they might do with Scratch.

00:16:57.666 --> 00:16:59.123
And then, after
it, in that course,

00:16:59.123 --> 00:17:00.910
they do shift to other
things, but Scratch

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:04.285
serves as a foundation for
getting people started.

00:17:04.285 --> 00:17:06.910
Within the use of Scratch,
when it started 10 years ago,

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.619
a lot of it was being used in
homes and after school centers.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:12.950
Right now, the fastest
growth is in schools.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.380
There's a lot of--

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.050
you know, and that's partly
it's a cultural phenomenon

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.480
that more schools are getting
interested in introducing

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.170
coding.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:22.540
So Scratch is being used
in many different schools.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.020
Here in New York, it's one of
the languages that's really

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.810
being used, especially
in elementary schools,

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.670
with the different
efforts and CS4--

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.642
all efforts-- really
supporting the use of Scratch

00:17:33.642 --> 00:17:34.600
going out into schools.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.890
I wanted to give you
some sense of how

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.614
it's being used in
schools, so I'll

00:17:37.614 --> 00:17:39.280
show a few examples
of things that we've

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.150
seen in different schools.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.910
The first one is from India.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.550
This one is from Bangalore,
where this was a--

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.430
I think it was a 13-year-old.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.980
It was in the science class,
where they were studying

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:52.750
the layers of the earth.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.164
So as their final project, they
were making a Scratch project

00:17:56.164 --> 00:17:58.330
about what they learned,
to share what they learned,

00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:59.620
about the layers of the earth.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.840
So the teacher explained
to us that this

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.360
dude-- he's speaking his
native language of Kannada,

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.610
and he's explaining the
different layers of the earth.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.507
And what he was
really excited about

00:18:09.507 --> 00:18:11.715
was the fact that things
are moving inside the earth.

00:18:11.715 --> 00:18:13.030
So he's explaining
things are moving.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:15.280
And you can see, he gets
down to the water table where

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.570
things are moving and puts in
sound effects for the water

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:20.445
table.

00:18:20.445 --> 00:18:23.780
So it's, again,
a way of sharing.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.780
So this was a case where
Scratch was actually

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.360
introduced at school and
everyone was using it.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.480
Sometimes kids learn Scratch at
home, but bring it into school.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.080
That's the next example.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.860
This is from a middle
school in the United States,

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.550
where they were studying, in
a social studies class, Rapa

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.140
Nui, or Easter Island.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.210
The island's off
of South America.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.795
And this student did something
sort of like "SimCity,"

00:18:45.795 --> 00:18:47.440
but Sim Rapa Nui.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.080
He had learned about the
economy and the culture.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.280
And you know, fishing is
important to the economy,

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.070
so to survive there,
you have to cut down

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.515
a branch to make a fishing
rod and go fishing.

00:18:56.515 --> 00:18:58.780
But if you take down
too many branches,

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:02.110
happiness goes down, because
there's a certain way that they

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:03.394
respect the environment.

00:19:03.394 --> 00:19:05.560
So it was a way for him to
show what he had learned,

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.750
but also to help other
people learn about Rapa Nui.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.320
I'll show one more example
from an elementary school.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.180
And this is an elementary
school, where--

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.888
I really like these
examples-- where it's

00:19:14.888 --> 00:19:16.050
used across the curriculum.

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.800
So this elementary
school teacher

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.020
introduces Scratch
and, in the same way

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.610
that if you learn
about-- you learn

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.860
how to write, you use writing
in all of your classes,

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.260
whether it's history
or science, you

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.810
use your writing everywhere--
they used Scratch everywhere.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.110
This is an example
from a book report.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.490
When they read
"Charlotte's Web,"

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.474
this was one of the
students book reports.

00:19:36.474 --> 00:19:38.140
And you can see,
they're using language.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.547
They'd read the book and
they're writing about the book.

00:19:40.547 --> 00:19:42.880
But one thing that caught my
attention with this example

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.250
is notice how the
pig gets smaller

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.140
as it goes further away.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.630
So this was also using what
they learned in art class

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.660
about perspective, that to make
something look further away,

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.970
you make it smaller.

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.080
But then, if you
look at the code,

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.600
in order to make it smaller,
what this student had to do

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.460
was multiply it by a fraction--

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.710
multiply the size by a
fraction-- less than 1

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:05.330
repeatedly to make it smaller
and smaller and smaller.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.500
So he was learning mathematical
ideas while doing that.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.307
But again, using mathematical
ideas with a purpose.

00:20:11.307 --> 00:20:12.640
So there was a reason, you know?

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.680
They knew why they were
multiplying fractions.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.080
Most kids, you're taught
multiplying fractions

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.347
and you think, why
am I learning this?

00:20:19.347 --> 00:20:21.430
But here, they were learning
multiplying fractions

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:22.240
for a purpose.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.948
There was a reason
for doing it, and they

00:20:23.948 --> 00:20:25.780
could make good use of it here.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.830
Actually, right before this
talk, I was talking to Max.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.190
I was very happy he came.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:32.116
He was telling me about,
in his third grade,

00:20:32.116 --> 00:20:33.490
they were making
games where they

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.640
had to show some things
about rocks and minerals,

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.169
so that other people
learn something

00:20:38.169 --> 00:20:40.210
they didn't know before
about rocks and minerals.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.670
So I think that's
another great example.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:44.740
I think it was just
recently he was doing that.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.330
And that's a way
of sort of using

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.700
Scratch as a way of
communicating and sharing

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.520
with one another.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.990
So I think we see more and
more of that happening.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.790
So in our collaboration
with Google,

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.010
we also are doing a lot
aiming at schools-- you know,

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.019
with Google CS First program.

00:20:59.019 --> 00:21:01.060
It's an after school
initiative, but increasingly

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.200
being focused on in school.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.360
So we see that as a
great collaboration.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.450
And we're really pleased
that, as CS First got started,

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.140
they chose Scratch as the
primary programming language.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.681
So we've worked with them, and
it's been great to see the way

00:21:12.681 --> 00:21:15.559
that they have built all sorts
of resources around Scratch.

00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:18.100
So those types of collaborations
are really important for us,

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.640
because we have a
relatively small team.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.490
We have the language out
there, but the CS First team

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.100
has done a great job of
creating all sorts of resources

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.580
around it and supporting both
the mentors and facilitators

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.160
running these sessions,
and also developing

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.200
the materials for
kids to use as well.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.740
So we're really look
forward to doing that.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.170
Let me give one more extended
example of one where--

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.160
and we see this
happening a lot, where--

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.920
of someone who starts to learn
Scratch in school, but then

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.320
continues doing things
outside of school.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.220
And that also makes
us really happy.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.680
Actually, I was at an event
in New York City-- actually,

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.820
it was during CS Ed Week in
December, I was down here.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.630
And the CSforALL people had
an event that I went to.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.757
And there, I met a couple
of high school students.

00:21:59.757 --> 00:22:00.840
And I was talking to them.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.640
And they weren't
using Scratch anymore.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.660
They'd used it in elementary
and middle school.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.540
But what I really liked is
they said what they liked

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.649
about Scratch was, they
said, it was the one thing

00:22:08.649 --> 00:22:11.190
they did at school they wanted
to continue to do on their own

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:12.570
after school.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.740
And for us, I think
everything should be that way.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.531
So everything we develop,
we try to make it

00:22:16.531 --> 00:22:18.370
that kids would want
to do on their own.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.911
And that was the case-- so this
is another member the scratch

00:22:20.911 --> 00:22:22.080
community.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.200
bubble103 is her user name.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.800
She's from South Africa.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.100
And she first learned
about Scratch in school,

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.780
where this is one
of the projects--

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:34.330
if you go to the profile,
you can see the water cycle

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:39.480
and it shows how the water
from the lake or the ocean

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.910
goes up and makes a cloud,
and then it goes and it rains.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:43.750
So it's talking about
the water cycle.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:44.730
But as she learned
that, she then

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.120
started making games on her own.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.510
There's a fabulous farming
game that she made.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.760
She made a presentation
about South Africa.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.530
She was really proud
of South Africa.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.440
And she wanted to share
her pride with other people

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.580
in the community.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:00.210
And she also made
tutorials, like Ipzy did.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:01.634
And bubble103 had
used variables,

00:23:01.634 --> 00:23:04.050
and she was excited about what
she could do with variables

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:06.130
and wanted to share
that with others.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.310
But the project that really
caught our attention,

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:10.560
and a lot of people's
attention, was a project

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.900
that she worked on
called Colour Divide.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.970
And this is a
collaborative project

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:17.291
that she did with five
or six other scratchers.

00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:19.290
They were like in three
or four other countries.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:24.000
So they started exchanging
ideas in the online community.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.570
And bubble103 had started this
role playing game with others,

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.270
and then decided to make
a trailer for a movie

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.790
that they wanted to make
about Colour Divide.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:36.270
So I'll show you now like a
one minute clip, this trailer

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:36.900
that they did.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.000
And this is, again, five
different scratchers

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.260
working together to put
together the trailer for "Colour

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:43.970
Divide."

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:44.636
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:44.636 --> 00:23:47.030
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.480
- Welcome to Aurora,
land of colour and magic.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.990
Every child at the age of 12
faces the Test to determine

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:57.290
their magical strength
and their colour rank.

00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:59.780
But all is not as it seems.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.770
- This test means
everything to me.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:02.773
I can't fail.

00:24:02.773 --> 00:24:05.140
- What if I don't get a colour?

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.100
- I don't want to
colour anyways.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.896
I'm going to fail the test.

00:24:09.896 --> 00:24:11.520
- But banishment.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.590
- Haven't you ever
wondered what's out there?

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.550
I mean, there's got
to be something.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.450
I got too close
to the gates once,

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.802
and I saw something-- a boy.

00:24:19.802 --> 00:24:21.570
I hate living in this place.

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:23.510
The magicians are dictators.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.550
They tore my family apart.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.364
They destroyed-- they destroyed
my home and burned my mother.

00:24:29.364 --> 00:24:32.190
- Together-- we'll fail
this test together.

00:24:35.016 --> 00:24:37.780
- Let's see what you're
made of then, shall we?

00:24:46.087 --> 00:24:46.670
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.050
MITCHEL RESNICK: I think one
thing that really struck us

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:49.840
with this is the fact--

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.880
obviously, it was a
big programming effort.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.880
They spent a lot
of time doing this.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.850
But you can really see
that, for bubble103, there

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:58.670
was sort of a deep
meaning behind this.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.560
You know, talking about
growing up in South Africa,

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.934
talking about this colour
divide and everyone being given

00:25:02.934 --> 00:25:05.090
a colour and being
ranked by your colour.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.642
So we, then, talked
to her-- oops.

00:25:07.642 --> 00:25:09.350
And she says, growing
up, I've definitely

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:10.970
seen the scars that
apartheid has left

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.179
on my country and the people.

00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:13.553
I'm really exploring
that through

00:25:13.553 --> 00:25:15.830
the different characters
that are part of this story.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.900
And again, we see
this over and over.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.750
A lot of the kids that
are using Scratch,

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.709
or oftentimes as they go
into their teen years,

00:25:21.709 --> 00:25:24.083
they're exploring things about
their own identity, things

00:25:24.083 --> 00:25:25.510
about the community around them.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:27.009
So you see them
tackling issues that

00:25:27.009 --> 00:25:28.295
are deeply important to them.

00:25:28.295 --> 00:25:30.170
Of course, there's a
lot of things on Scratch

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:31.822
that are just funny animations.

00:25:31.822 --> 00:25:33.530
But there also is an
opportunity for kids

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.200
to really develop their
own ideas, to share

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.200
ideas with others, and
use it as a way to sort

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.910
through important ideas.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.180
And also, to sort through ways
of engaging with the design

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.320
process and the
creative process.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.770
So bubble103 also said,
"Because of Scratch,

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:51.610
I've become more confident
to try new things

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:52.980
and express myself--

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.940
I'm more comfortable with taking
risks and making mistakes.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.320
Now, when something
goes wrong, I

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.869
see it as an opportunity
to learn something new."

00:25:59.869 --> 00:26:02.160
And again, that's what we
were hoping for with Scratch.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.640
When I talked about the
importance of play, in my mind,

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.400
there's a playful approach,
a willingness to take risks,

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.700
a willingness to
have things go wrong,

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:13.730
and then an ability to try to
iterate and to debug things

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.834
when things go wrong,
and to try new things.

00:26:15.834 --> 00:26:18.000
And that's exactly what she
was getting out of this.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.440
So we're really happy when we
hear scratchers talk this way.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.870
And bubble103 also talked
about the importance

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:25.690
of the online community for her.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.440
She said, "I've been
constantly blown away

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.350
by the kind of support and
collaboration and sharing

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.890
that happens in the community.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.181
That's one of the main things
that keeps me coming back

00:26:34.181 --> 00:26:35.820
to Scratch every day."

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.360
And we see that over and
over, that, for a lot of kids,

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.850
they come to Scratch
to create a project.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:42.345
They stay for the community.

00:26:42.345 --> 00:26:43.970
They connect with
other people, the way

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:45.095
they share with each other.

00:26:45.095 --> 00:26:49.370
In this case, collaborating
with others on projects,

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:52.650
interacting and getting
inspired by others.

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.340
And I think it's not an accident
that this example happens

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.010
to come from a young
woman in the community.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.652
Just last night-- this
is my freshest data--

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:03.110
just last night, one of the
graduate students in our group,

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.720
Shruti Dhariwal,
was showing some

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.990
of the last data she was
looking at about some gender

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.400
differences on Scratch.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:15.500
As I mentioned, it's about 45%
female, the Scratch population.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.020
One thing we'd already
seen was that, if you

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.840
look at the number of
projects that people create,

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.660
the boys and girls
on Scratch each

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.050
create roughly the same
number of projects.

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:29.120
But Shruti was just looking at
the data and saw the following,

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.010
as far as on the
social side of Scratch,

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:33.429
where if you like a project,
you can give it a love.

00:27:33.429 --> 00:27:35.220
And if you look on the
left hand side here,

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.320
you see that the female
participants on Scratch

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.520
are much more likely--

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.320
they give 50% more
loves than others.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.580
So on average, each female
participant gives 12 loves.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.500
Only 8 for male participants.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.050
As far as giving comments
on other projects,

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:53.630
female participants,
28; male, 16--

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:55.430
almost twice.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.860
And for me, I found
this really striking

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.085
because we'd already seen,
in looking at the community,

00:28:01.085 --> 00:28:03.320
that getting social
feedback on the community

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.060
is the most
important determinant

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.460
about whether someone
stays on Scratch.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.340
So when someone puts up
a project on Scratch,

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.130
how quickly they receive
some social feedback--

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:14.540
a comment or a love--

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.960
has a huge influence on whether
they make a second project.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.630
So the fact that the
young women on Scratch

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:23.210
are doing much more
commenting and loving really

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:26.330
shows the important role
they're playing to help continue

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:28.312
people working on Scratch.

00:28:28.312 --> 00:28:30.770
And it really shows how the
creative side and the community

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:32.570
side of Scratch really
are tightly linked

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:33.279
with one another.

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:35.319
So this is something that
we continue to look at.

00:28:35.319 --> 00:28:37.850
And I think, right now, we're
sitting on top this huge trove

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:41.370
of data, because there's 30
million projects on Scratch,

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:42.836
and we've saved everything.

00:28:42.836 --> 00:28:44.210
So we're still
sorting through it

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.520
to try to learn more
about the creative process

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:51.130
and the coding process, as we
sort through this on Scratch.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.500
I wanted to end by giving
some examples looking ahead,

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.040
about the next generation of
Scratch that we're working on.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.790
So we're now working
on a third generation

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:03.070
of Scratch called Scratch 3.0
that will launch this August.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:06.430
The first generation of
Scratch that came out in 2007

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:11.350
was a downloadable application
that you used locally.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.840
And then, you could
share on the website,

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.980
where the community was.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.330
If you saw something
in the community that

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.000
looked interesting, you had
to download it to see the code

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.990
and play with the code.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:24.160
The second generation
of Scratch, in 2013,

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.900
was all in the browser.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.360
So you could start
authoring in the browser.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.460
And that really led to a
real growth in Scratch.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:34.660
It really removed a
lot of the friction

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.389
between creating and sharing.

00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:38.430
So you could sort of see
things in the community,

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:43.030
go inside right away,
right online see the code,

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:45.197
manipulate the code,
try different things.

00:29:45.197 --> 00:29:46.780
So it really opened
up and really lead

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.390
to some of the recent
growth in Scratch.

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.500
The third generation
we're coming out now,

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.230
one of the motivations for
it is to make it much better

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:56.670
suited for mobile.

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:59.580
You know, back in
around 2010 or so,

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.770
as we started working
on Scratch 2.0,

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.270
we made the decision
to implement it

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:06.985
in Flash, which, at the time,
seemed like a good decision.

00:30:06.985 --> 00:30:08.610
Right now, that is
not looking so good,

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:10.990
so we really need to be moving
into a new infrastructure.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.800
So Scratch 3.0 will
be all HTML5-based.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.110
It will be much more
designed with mobile in mind.

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:19.230
So that's one thing
that we wanted to do,

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:20.810
and we sort of need to do.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:22.440
But we also wanted
to make it much more

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.889
of a basic platform
that can be extended

00:30:25.889 --> 00:30:27.180
in all sorts of different ways.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.679
And this is something, again,
we've done a lot collaboration

00:30:29.679 --> 00:30:30.630
with Google.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.940
For the programming
language itself,

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.160
we've been working
with the Blockly team,

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.740
and building on the
infrastructure of Blockly

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:38.984
from here.

00:30:38.984 --> 00:30:40.650
But then, using some
of the design ideas

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:43.025
we've had from Scratch, we've
had the great collaboration

00:30:43.025 --> 00:30:46.110
of working together on
the new set of blocks

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.540
that we were using for this.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.580
And these blocks,
again, are open source,

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.170
as Blockly has been.

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:55.840
So in addition to using these
blocks in our Scratch 3.0,

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.490
we want to have this
as a standard grammar

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.300
for a block-based
programming that anybody

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.790
can embed in their
own apps or toys

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.322
or whatever products they have.

00:31:04.322 --> 00:31:06.780
So we're trying to make this
sort of a standard programming

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.310
grammar for everybody.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.830
But then, we'll also use
it inside our own version

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.999
of Scratch 3.0.

00:31:13.999 --> 00:31:16.290
Another way in which we're
extending Scratch and making

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:20.670
it more modular is making it
much easier to extend Scratch.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:23.490
So in addition to the core
capabilities of Scratch,

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.680
we're having a whole, what
we call, the extension

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.850
mechanism to make
it easy for people

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.120
to add new Scratch blocks.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:34.380
So of course, we want to have it
so that we can extend Scratch,

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.780
but we also want to let
everybody else extend Scratch

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:37.740
as well.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.780
So now, this is
not necessarily--

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:40.921
most kids won't do this.

00:31:40.921 --> 00:31:41.670
But this is more--

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:44.610
developers can add their
own Scratch blocks.

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.070
And there's a way down
here, just in the interface,

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:49.080
if you just want to
add an extension,

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.794
you can go down to the bottom
left corner, add an extension.

00:31:51.794 --> 00:31:53.710
Let me give you some
examples of how to do it.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:55.793
So I'm actually going to
run some things live here

00:31:55.793 --> 00:32:08.500
from the prototype
of Scratch 3.0.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.850
Sorry, there it is.

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:13.881
So this is using the
extension with the micro:bit.

00:32:13.881 --> 00:32:16.130
A lot of you are probably
familiar with the micro:bit.

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.530
They're a very low
cost interface device.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.310
So here's the board.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:25.302
It's very-- the BBC
helped in developing this,

00:32:25.302 --> 00:32:27.510
so they've given it to every
school child in England.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:29.135
It's now spread into
the United States.

00:32:29.135 --> 00:32:33.030
It only costs like less
than $20 to get the board.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:36.110
And what we're doing now is-- so
we can do something like this.

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:37.550
[BELLS RINGING]

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:39.140
I know this is a--

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.741
so here, it's using these
extra blocks as just saying,

00:32:42.741 --> 00:32:44.740
this has an accelerometer,
so when it's tilted--

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:45.870
[BELLS RINGING]

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.960
--it's supposed make
the flowers spin,

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.530
and then it should have a little
smiley face show up on here.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:54.215
So you can see the code there.

00:32:54.215 --> 00:32:56.340
So again, we just want to
make it easy for anybody.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.173
So again, we worked
with the micro:bit team,

00:32:58.173 --> 00:33:01.010
but we wanted to let anybody who
is making new types of hardware

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.060
be able to extend it.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.990
So we're working with
the LEGO company,

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:06.280
so as they add
new robotics kits,

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.680
they'll be using Scratch and
just having extensions to--

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.617
they'll both use the Scratch
blocks in their own apps,

00:33:12.617 --> 00:33:14.450
but also will have
extensions in the Scratch

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:17.810
3.0, where you can control
your LEGO robotics.

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:21.020
We're also working on some of
our own hardware extensions.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.517
So this is one.

00:33:22.517 --> 00:33:24.350
Right now, we're calling
it the Scratch Bit.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:25.707
It's in development.

00:33:25.707 --> 00:33:28.040
One of the graduate students
in the group, Kreg Hanning,

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.330
is working with others,
including Andrew Sliwinski,

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.470
who's leading the whole
Scratch 3.0 development

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:36.260
process, and a bunch
of other people

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:40.120
on developing the Scratch Bit.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:44.640
So here-- actually, I'm going
to put this full screen.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.152
So hopefully if I--

00:33:46.152 --> 00:33:47.076
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:47.076 --> 00:33:50.380
So this also has
an accelerometer.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:54.560
And I'm trying to get the
balloons and the tacos.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.845
And I get different points.

00:33:55.845 --> 00:33:57.720
I get two points for
every taco and one point

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.980
for every balloon.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:02.040
And if want things
get out of the way--

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.730
I think if I cover--

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:05.390
I thought there was a horn that
sounds, but maybe that's not--

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:05.630
[HORN SOUNDING]

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:06.280
There it is.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:12.600
But the idea is trying to
make it so that it's very easy

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:16.020
to take different types of
physical devices like this,

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:19.139
and with different sensors--
accelerometers, light sensors,

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:21.227
whatever, you know,
buttons, knobs--

00:34:21.227 --> 00:34:22.810
and be able to
wirelessly communicate.

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:26.699
These are all Bluetooth
communication.

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:28.770
In addition to extending
it through hardware,

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:31.760
we're going to extend
things either to a web based

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.547
or software side.

00:34:34.547 --> 00:34:36.380
Here's an example that's
already in Scratch,

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.990
because of the spirit of the
type of things we're doing.

00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:40.365
This is one that
uses the camera.

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:43.860
And notice--

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:44.784
[SPLASHING SOUNDS]

00:34:44.784 --> 00:34:45.708
Whoops.

00:34:45.708 --> 00:34:47.350
It should be using the camera.

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:47.850
It's not.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:49.264
AUDIENCE: Hit I, I think.

00:34:49.264 --> 00:34:51.139
MITCHEL RESNICK: Oh,
did I hit the wrong one?

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:52.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.895
MITCHEL RESNICK: Let me try
it one more time and see if--

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:02.920
Thank you.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:08.860
So here, you see the
minifigs are falling, but--

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:09.756
[BOUNCY SOUND]

00:35:09.756 --> 00:35:10.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.218
[BOUNCY SOUNDS]

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:14.907
Or I can do it with my head.

00:35:14.907 --> 00:35:17.324
[BOUNCY SOUNDS]

00:35:17.324 --> 00:35:18.990
And you know, I think
a big part of what

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:22.650
we end up doing in our group--

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:25.830
if we see inside,
we can take a look.

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:30.710
And this is the key block.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:32.400
You have very few new blocks.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.760
This one just says, if there's
video motion on this sprite,

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.710
and it's grabbed by the
threshold, then do something.

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:41.280
So obviously, there's a
huge amount of information

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.390
coming from the camera.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:43.890
I think a big thing
about what we do

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.140
is how can we take
all that information,

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.000
put it into the right
building blocks,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.580
to let kids use it
in a meaningful way.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.830
So we just did it, so you
see how much motion there

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:54.260
is on your sprite.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:57.090
In this case, if the
minifig is falling,

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:58.740
it sees motion in
the background,

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.840
it then jumps upwards.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.090
We also have it that you can
see what direction it is.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:05.610
So you could also do it,
if I swat in one direction,

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:07.500
it can move one way
or the other way.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.140
But just a few simple
primitives is what we're doing.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.900
We're also, in 3.0, extending
this to do some things

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.180
with object detection.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:18.810
Let me show one other
thing that we're doing.

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:23.400
This is one that actually just
got added to the prototype

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.240
this week.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.656
This is one of the
ones that we're

00:36:25.656 --> 00:36:29.580
working with people at Google
on that has a translate feature.

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.650
So these are just
some of the extensions

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:32.733
that we're working on now.

00:36:32.733 --> 00:36:34.810
Some Division 1 is what
I was just talking about.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:37.154
Here's a translate one.

00:36:37.154 --> 00:36:38.445
And notice there's a new block.

00:36:38.445 --> 00:36:40.970
Let me make it bigger.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:44.460
So basically, you can translate
a word to any language,

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.470
or you could just have
it translate whatever

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:47.790
the web browser is set to.

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.070
So I can make this, and
then it would translate

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.580
things to whatever the person
using the project, whatever

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.100
their browser is set to.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.310
But if I just set it to
a particular language,

00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:00.820
so I could just, say, to French.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.990
So if I translate French
hello, it says bonjour.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:07.680
I can then put it inside a say
block to have the cat say--

00:37:10.279 --> 00:37:11.070
so normally-- oops.

00:37:14.718 --> 00:37:16.830
So there's the cat saying hello.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:20.660
But now, if I just
say, translate hello

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.970
to French for two seconds,
now the cat will say, bonjour.

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.470
And if instead of
saying to French,

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:27.600
I say, translate hello to
wherever the browser is

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.090
set to, well, then, the cat
will talk in whatever language

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:31.607
the browser is set to.

00:37:31.607 --> 00:37:32.940
So these are things we're doing.

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.440
So again, this is
a great thing that

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.050
came out of the collaboration.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:39.282
I'll show one more
sort of a fake example,

00:37:39.282 --> 00:37:41.490
because this isn't actually
running in the prototype.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:46.630
So it's a little bit of
a trick, just to show you

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:50.210
what we're aiming for.

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:54.140
Again, we're working with Google
on speech recognition blocks.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:56.390
We know that obviously
communicating with speech

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:59.300
is something that kids are
interacting with all the time

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.090
now.

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:01.465
But for us, it's
really important

00:38:01.465 --> 00:38:04.050
that kids don't just spend
their time feeling it's magical,

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:07.044
talking to something and
then it talks back to you.

00:38:07.044 --> 00:38:09.460
We want kids to feel that they
can create things this way.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.668
So we want kids to be able
to create their own speech

00:38:11.668 --> 00:38:12.560
interfaces.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.620
So we're having some new blocks
on the speech synthesis side,

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.230
where you'll actually
say the words out

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:20.030
loud with this
synthesized voice,

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:22.590
but also do some
speech recognition.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.580
So like here's one where, if you
see the key part here, it says,

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:28.670
when I hear what time is
it, it will then speak,

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:30.380
it's party time.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.150
And then, it'll play
a certain sound.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:33.496
So I say, what time is it?

00:38:33.496 --> 00:38:35.537
SYNTHESIZED VOICE (ON
COMPUTER): It's party time.

00:38:35.537 --> 00:38:37.922
[PARTY MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:43.494 --> 00:38:45.160
MITCHEL RESNICK: So
again, our real hope

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.520
is that it will let kids
create their own type of speech

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.289
interfaces and conversational
interfaces with these blocks.

00:38:51.289 --> 00:38:53.080
And again, we're still
trying to figure out

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.370
the exact right building blocks.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:56.203
Because I think the key
thing is making sure

00:38:56.203 --> 00:39:00.160
that we preserve what's
the core power of it,

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.944
but make it simple enough
and versatile enough

00:39:02.944 --> 00:39:04.610
that kids are going
to be able to use it

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:07.030
in many different ways.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:10.180
So just to wrap up, you
know, we see lots of ways

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:13.840
that Scratch is
going to continue

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.610
to get out to the world.

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:20.200
And for us, we do want to see
it is a new type of fluency.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.720
It's something that, when
we teach kids to write,

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.370
it's not just so that they
can use writing in their jobs,

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:27.460
although people do use
writing in their jobs,

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:30.110
but so that they can express
their ideas to the world.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:31.600
And we see Scratch the same way.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.370
We want to let all
kids grow up feeling

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.280
they can use the powerful
technology of their times

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.380
in a way that they can
express their voice,

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.670
express their
ideas, to the world.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:43.330
And to do that, we want to
keep on that focus of projects,

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:44.372
passion, peers, and play.

00:39:44.372 --> 00:39:46.538
Because there's always going
to be new technologies,

00:39:46.538 --> 00:39:48.820
whether it's object
recognition, speech recognition,

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:49.750
speech synthesis.

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:51.700
We want to keep integrating
new technologies,

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.130
but always in this
framework of providing kids

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:55.660
with creative
learning experiences

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.150
and leaving them in control,
so that it's not they're just

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:00.629
interacting with things, but
things where they can do it.

00:40:00.629 --> 00:40:02.920
Because I think that's going
to be the key to help kids

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.740
grow up to become full
and active contributors

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.630
in tomorrow's society.

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.130
If you want to read
more about this,

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:13.500
I did just finish a book that is
called "Lifelong Kindergarten."

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.159
We use the metaphor
of kindergarten,

00:40:15.159 --> 00:40:17.200
because I've been really
inspired by the way kids

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.340
learn in kindergarten.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:21.190
The idea of the four P's
came from observing kids

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.910
in kindergarten.

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.530
If you think of the
classic kindergarten,

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:28.330
that kids are building towers
with blocks, making pictures

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:30.049
with finger paints and crayons.

00:40:30.049 --> 00:40:31.840
In the process, they
learn important ideas.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.342
They build a tower, they learn
about structure stability.

00:40:34.342 --> 00:40:35.800
But even more
important, they learn

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.550
about the creative process.

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:39.550
You know, they learn how
to put things together,

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:42.460
to experiment, to iterate.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.560
Too often, when they
leave kindergarten,

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.900
they end up sitting in
desks, listening to lectures,

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:47.967
filling out worksheets.

00:40:47.967 --> 00:40:50.050
And that doesn't provide
them with the opportunity

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:52.329
to continue to develop
as creative thinkers.

00:40:52.329 --> 00:40:54.370
So they really aren't
getting prepared for what's

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:56.290
needed in today's society.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:59.620
And to make matters worse, you
know, a lot of kindergartens

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:03.130
today, you go in there and kids
are drilling on math flashcards

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.080
and doing phonics worksheets.

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.364
Kindergarten is becoming
more like the rest of school.

00:41:07.364 --> 00:41:09.780
And what we want to do, and
what I talk about in the book,

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:12.010
is to make the rest of
school, the rest of life, more

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:13.060
like kindergarten.

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.190
And that really inspired
us with Scratch.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:17.992
So from kindergarten, we got the
four P's that inspired Scratch.

00:41:17.992 --> 00:41:20.200
So the book tells you more
about the underlying ideas

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.985
for Scratch, to do it.

00:41:21.985 --> 00:41:25.270
I may just end with
one final thing.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.030
Every year, we do
have an annual dinner

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:30.550
in New York City that's
organized by the Scratch

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.150
Foundation.

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.080
Lisa O'Brien's here,
the executive director

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:37.790
of the Scratch Foundation
that helps support Scratch.

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:41.026
And this year-- we honor
two people each year--

00:41:41.026 --> 00:41:43.150
and this year, one of the
two people we're honoring

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:47.260
is Maggie Johnson from
Google, the great way

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:49.677
that she serves as a champion
for so many of these causes.

00:41:49.677 --> 00:41:51.968
So it's been great collaborating
with Maggie and others

00:41:51.968 --> 00:41:54.340
at Google, and we have
such admiration and respect

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.330
for what she's doing.

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:57.040
So we're honoring Maggie,
along with David Siegel,

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.390
who's been a great partner.

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:00.880
He leads a company here called
Two Sigma that is, again,

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.970
a great champion for
supporting kids and coding

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:05.490
and creative thinking.

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:06.490
But thank you very much.

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.156
I'd be happy to take
some questions now.

00:42:08.156 --> 00:42:10.215
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:15.085 --> 00:42:15.980
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.479
Thanks so much for
the presentation.

00:42:17.479 --> 00:42:18.380
Very exciting.

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.796
I was wondering
if you can clarify

00:42:19.796 --> 00:42:24.580
the associations between
Scratch, Blockly, and Code.org,

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.719
or any other associations
we may have heard about,

00:42:26.719 --> 00:42:28.510
but are a little
confusing, at least to me.

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:29.426
MITCHEL RESNICK: Yeah.

00:42:29.426 --> 00:42:34.750
So here's-- I'll give a
little bit of history.

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:37.620
So Scratch got
started around 2007.

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.270
And there were some other
people, based on Scratch,

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:42.660
that started working on other
blocks related languages.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.270
And in fact, some of the other
things that got done then

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:46.060
inspired Blockly.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.950
Another MIT professor,
named Hal Abelson,

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.730
spent a sabbatical at Google,
worked with others at Google,

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:56.190
and started the Blockly project.

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:58.730
Or at least he started
App Inventor, which

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:00.350
was making use of Blockly.

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.030
So it's sort of
using together some

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:04.210
of these same block-based
programming ideas.

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:07.400
But Blockly was being developed
separately from Scratch.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.140
But it was in the same spirit.

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.140
As we started working on Scratch
3.0, we decided to join forces,

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:13.640
because we saw that
each of us could

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.320
gain from working together.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:20.030
We had lots of experience of
how to make these blocks really

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:22.670
work well with kids, so we had
a lot more experience working

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:26.390
with kids, where the Blockly
group had a great experience,

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:29.090
and great expertise, in
making a great infrastructure

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:30.789
for these blocks-based
languages.

00:43:30.789 --> 00:43:32.330
So we saw what each
of us had to gain

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:33.620
from working with one another.

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:34.920
So we've joined forces.

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:38.420
So basically, our new
version of Scratch blocks

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:40.174
is building on top of Blockly.

00:43:40.174 --> 00:43:42.590
So our Scratch that we're using
are now on top of Blockly.

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:44.060
It's a fork off a Blockly.

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:45.740
Blockly continues
to be developed,

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:48.170
and we're sort of
building on top of that

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:52.370
and making it specialized
especially for kids.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:54.350
Code.org, which is a
separate organization,

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:57.560
has a separate site, is
focused on getting kids engaged

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.900
with coding and CS Education.

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.834
They have used Blockly in
a lot of their activities.

00:44:02.834 --> 00:44:04.250
So they've put a
lot of activities

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:08.500
online of their own, some
of which used Blockly.

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:12.110
So Blockly gets used
by many other sites.

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:15.230
Code.org also features many
other types of activities

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.730
by others.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:17.270
So our work with
Scratch sometimes

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:19.730
will get featured on
the Code.org site.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:22.190
So Code.org is sort of
this general site that

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:25.070
has their own activities,
some of them based on Blockly,

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:27.590
but also they feature,
especially at CS Ed Week

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:29.667
other coding activities.

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:31.000
Hopefully, that gave some sense.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:31.833
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:34.289 --> 00:44:34.830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:36.132
Thanks a lot for being here.

00:44:36.132 --> 00:44:37.590
My previous job,
before I was here,

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:39.721
was as a K-12 math
and coding teacher.

00:44:39.721 --> 00:44:41.220
And I used Scratch
in the classroom,

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.750
but this was right
around when 2.0 came out,

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:45.000
before you had a lot of the
classroom management tools

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
that I think you've had
in the past few years.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.666
And I'm just curious, as Scratch
moves into a lot of classrooms,

00:44:49.666 --> 00:44:51.450
as you noted, with CS4
and other programs,

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:52.590
I'm curious how you
feel about-- like,

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:53.910
you mentioned the
projects on the one hand,

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:55.290
and sort of the flash
cards and the drilling

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:56.700
on the other hand--
like, how do you

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.200
feel about Scratch
being sort of molded

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.420
to fit into a mandatory
classroom environment, where

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:02.825
people are interested in
defined learning metrics,

00:45:02.825 --> 00:45:04.950
seeing progress, assessments,
and things like that?

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:05.520
MITCHEL RESNICK: Yeah.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:06.340
That's a good question.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.840
And I mean, I do think we want
to make sure that, as Scratch

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:12.050
moves into schools, that what
we love most about Scratch

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:13.600
doesn't get squeezed out of it.

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.530
And I think there are
ways of doing that.

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:18.429
But I think we are constantly
working on, and working

00:45:18.429 --> 00:45:20.970
with educators, to feel what
are the best ways of introducing

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:23.610
Scratch into classrooms
and maintaining

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:25.050
the spirit of Scratch.

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:27.134
One of my former
students, who's now

00:45:27.134 --> 00:45:29.550
a professor at Harvard Graduate
School of Education, Karen

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:31.500
Brennan, has done a
great job of this.

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:34.350
She's made a curriculum
called the Creative Computing

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:35.490
Curriculum Guide.

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:37.950
It's based on Scratch,
but it is very--

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:41.140
it's shown how to make use
of it in classroom settings.

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:45.210
So that's one example of trying
to take this Scratch program

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:46.687
language, but
introduced in a way

00:45:46.687 --> 00:45:48.270
that we feel stays
true to the values,

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:51.810
but still is aligned with
the needs of classrooms.

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:52.740
So there are many--

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.130
others work on that as well.

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:56.010
So I think Scratch,
and other languages,

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.170
are getting introduced
in many different ways.

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:00.780
Our hope is to try to
make sure that it gets out

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:03.840
to the world in a way that
stays true to those values.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.324
But there are tensions there.

00:46:05.324 --> 00:46:07.740
I think some of the tensions
come about because the things

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:08.940
that we care about most--

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.590
I talked earlier
about the importance

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:13.230
of helping kids learn
to think creatively--

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:15.840
it's not easy to get a
quantitative measure of how

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.360
you've advanced in
your creative thinking.

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:21.030
It's much easier to get
a quantitative measure

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:24.529
of how often do you use
conditional statements.

00:46:24.529 --> 00:46:26.070
So you can look at
someone's projects

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:27.736
and see they're using
conditionals more,

00:46:27.736 --> 00:46:29.910
and grade them based on that.

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:33.020
We hope that that's not the way
kids end up being evaluated,

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:34.770
because that'll sort
of distort, we think,

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:36.140
what is going to
be most important.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:37.240
They'll be learning
something that way.

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.370
It's not saying that
there's no value in that.

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:41.910
But I think we want to make
sure that kids continue

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:44.520
to have this learning, not
just the core computational

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:47.190
concepts, but also
design strategies

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:48.840
and creative ways of thinking.

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.690
So we're constantly
working with educators

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:53.550
trying to feel the
best way of doing that.

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:54.880
It's an ongoing process.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.789
I think a lot of people are
continuing to work on it.

00:46:57.789 --> 00:46:58.330
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:02.200
I have a question about the
design of the Scratch language.

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:04.300
I think, in a lot of
other languages, some

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:05.940
of those complicated
things that you

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:10.120
were talking about, like playing
audio, might be part of an SDK,

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.790
or a standard
library, or something.

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:15.820
Whereas, in Scratch,
maybe those are

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.590
more like keywords
or blocks that

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:18.760
are built into the language.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.860
So I was just wondering
what you thought about that?

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:21.776
MITCHEL RESNICK: Yeah.

00:47:21.776 --> 00:47:23.680
Well, we wanted to--
as we started Scratch,

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.840
we wanted to have
a relatively-- we

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.580
wanted to make it
easy for everyone

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:30.500
to have sort of of this
consistent collection that

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.380
was going to be used.

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:35.397
And we worried that there are
too many different things.

00:47:35.397 --> 00:47:37.480
If you have to go and
search for different things,

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:38.860
it was going to make it
more challenging for people

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:39.485
to get started.

00:47:39.485 --> 00:47:40.943
So we tried to
figure out what were

00:47:40.943 --> 00:47:43.030
the core things we felt
was most important,

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:45.850
and there's 100 or so
core blocks in Scratch.

00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:47.809
And we tried to think,
what are the things that

00:47:47.809 --> 00:47:49.974
are going to be most important
for the way kids want

00:47:49.974 --> 00:47:51.040
to express themselves.

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.590
Before we started
Scratch, Tammy had

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:56.560
mentioned we had developed
these network of after school

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:59.170
centers called Computer
Clubhouses for young people

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:00.660
in low income communities.

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:02.950
And we saw that kids
at these clubhouses,

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:06.040
they wanted to create their own
interactive stories and games,

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.002
and they loved
manipulating media.

00:48:08.002 --> 00:48:09.460
But there weren't
good tools to let

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.460
them create their interactive
stories and games.

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.240
So we definitely
had them in mind.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.531
So we wanted to make sure
they were the right primitive

00:48:15.531 --> 00:48:19.000
building blocks to let you
manipulate sound, music,

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.740
images, you know, photos.

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.519
Make it easy to bring in your
own and also to personalize it,

00:48:23.519 --> 00:48:25.810
to bring in your own voice,
to bring in your own songs,

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:27.410
bring your own images.

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:31.450
So we put a priority on that to
making our core set of things.

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:34.000
And we found you could
go pretty far with that.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.520
As you can see now, we are
having these extensions.

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.010
We're trying to see how we
can keep with that core set,

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:43.070
but still make it possible
to extend in different ways.

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:46.720
There's still challenges
that we have to think about.

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.820
By having an online
community, that's

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.720
one reason we wanted
to keep it consistent.

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.720
So if you saw something
on the online community,

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:55.354
it was clear that you had
all the tools to make it.

00:48:55.354 --> 00:48:57.520
So now, if you see something
on the online community

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.507
that's using the micro:bit, but
you don't have the micro:bit,

00:49:00.507 --> 00:49:01.340
what does that mean?

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:02.140
Is it confusing?

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.662
So we're trying to figure how
to keep the community done

00:49:04.662 --> 00:49:06.370
in a way that you
could filter out things

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:07.830
that aren't relevant for you.

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:10.330
So those are still things that
we're trying to work through.

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:16.480
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned that you've

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.090
worked a little bit
with LEGO and Scratch,

00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:23.680
and I was wondering
if you guys were

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:29.500
working on kind of bringing
Scratch to MINDSTORMS?

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.160
And you know, if you've
thought about the differences

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:38.230
between LEGO's approach to
a programming environment,

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:40.600
where it's all
image-based and you

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:45.610
have blocks that are just
pictures, and your approach,

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:50.244
where you have blocks that have
words on them, or like that?

00:49:50.244 --> 00:49:51.160
MITCHEL RESNICK: Yeah.

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.900
And there's also some
other differences

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:57.190
in the program language
that comes with MINDSTORMS.

00:49:57.190 --> 00:50:00.080
It also uses some different
programming paradigms as well.

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.777
It's just the
icons versus words.

00:50:02.777 --> 00:50:05.110
It sort of grew out of a
dataflow tradition, rather than

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:06.310
a controlled flow tradition.

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:08.350
So there's some differences
in some of the ways

00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:11.150
that the languages
are structured.

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:14.290
We continue work
closely with LEGO.

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:16.600
LEGO's working on the next
generation of MINDSTORMS.

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:18.550
We're working closely
with them and trying

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:21.220
to influence some of
the ways that they'll

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:22.570
be doing this in the future.

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:23.944
Obviously, we're
deeply committed

00:50:23.944 --> 00:50:25.720
to the Scratch approach.

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:26.860
I do see that--

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:31.060
we're committed to the Scratch
approach of the basic grammar,

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:36.340
but for ScratchJr, we do use
icons, rather than words.

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.950
And we think, in some
situations, partly based on age

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:41.050
or partly on other
factors, we think

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:43.169
some of this using
the icons can be fine.

00:50:43.169 --> 00:50:44.710
If people haven't
seen, on ScratchJr,

00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:46.410
we use icons and
use it horizontally.

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:48.700
You snap blocks
together horizontally,

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:49.804
as opposed to vertically.

00:50:49.804 --> 00:50:51.970
Because when you're using
icons, it makes more sense

00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:53.180
doing it that way.

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.750
So we do see a place
for both word-based,

00:50:55.750 --> 00:51:00.100
text-based on the blocks,
and icons on the blocks,

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:01.700
based on different situations.

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:03.340
So we're working together.

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:05.169
In fact, on Scratch
3.0, we're building it

00:51:05.169 --> 00:51:06.710
all on the same
infrastructure, so it

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:09.119
will be easier to switch
back and forth between them.

00:51:09.119 --> 00:51:11.410
And we think there's a role
for both, based on what age

00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:14.779
you're aiming for, the
type of applications.

00:51:14.779 --> 00:51:16.070
AUDIENCE: Can I just follow up?

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:21.379
Do you have an idea of what
that age switchover is between--

00:51:21.379 --> 00:51:22.295
MITCHEL RESNICK: Yeah.

00:51:22.295 --> 00:51:26.270
Well, what we chose for--
like, ScratchJr, we say 5 to 7,

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:27.980
Scratch is 8 and up.

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:29.930
But it's not that
they're hard boundaries.

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:31.310
We're also still exploring.

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:33.890
I think, on different devices,
as we do more things with

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:37.430
coding on mobile phones, we
think there might be some

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:39.740
advantage-- if you're doing
small programs on phones--

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.617
there might be some
advantages for all ages,

00:51:41.617 --> 00:51:43.700
starting with icon-based
blocks, where you're just

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.290
doing small programs.

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:48.840
If you're doing longer programs,
going to text makes more sense.

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.949
So I think we're still
exploring some of the ways

00:51:50.949 --> 00:51:51.740
to go between them.

00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:53.240
It's not just age-based.

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.591
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:51:54.591 --> 00:51:56.996
I just want to be
respectful of people's time.

00:51:56.996 --> 00:51:59.401
It's 1 o'clock now and I
think we're officially done.

00:51:59.401 --> 00:52:00.459
But Mitchel, you're--

00:52:00.459 --> 00:52:02.000
MITCHEL RESNICK:
Yeah, I'm happy to--

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.500
we could just maybe
call it an end,

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:04.760
but I'm happy to stay
around and people can just

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:05.960
come up and talk informally.

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.070
Maybe that makes sense?

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:07.970
TAMMY STERN: Sure.

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:08.270
MITCHEL RESNICK: OK.

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:09.478
TAMMY STERN: Thank you again.

00:52:09.478 --> 00:52:11.920
[APPLAUSE]
