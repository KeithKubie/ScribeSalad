00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.951
For 50 years, the identity of HM was hidden. However, after his passing, and

00:00:05.951 --> 00:00:11.723
agreed by his family, his name was revealed, and he was Henry Molaison. Now

00:00:11.723 --> 00:00:15.749
Henry started experiencing epileptic seizures when he was a child, and in fact

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:21.904
these grew in both duration and frequency. In fact they were debilitating. He

00:00:21.904 --> 00:00:25.232
could lose consciousness and have a seizure weekly, and sometime have minor

00:00:25.232 --> 00:00:30.230
attacks up to ten times a day. Now as you can imagine, these seizures greatly

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.900
interfered with his daily living. So much so that he wasn't able to get his

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.690
high school diploma until age 21. By then, unfortunately, the seizures were so

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.760
bad it was difficult for him to even hold down a job.
