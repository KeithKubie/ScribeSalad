00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, we're going to follow the same recursive procedure to get every answer,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
check and see if we have it, and if not, call our parents.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So, a--I don't know what it is. How about you?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I don't know what it is. Oh, it's 99.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
B--I don't know what it is. Do you? Oh, it's 88.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
C--I don't know. Don't know. Don't know.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Looks like it's 3.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
D--looks like it's 77.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And this last one requires you to remember a bit about the corner case

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in our environment lookup.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I don't know what it is. Do you? No, do you?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
No, do you? No, do you?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And my parent pointer is none, so we'll just return none.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We don't have a value for this variable.

00:00:34.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We could also have raised some sort of exception.
