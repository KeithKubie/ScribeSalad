From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.420
Hello, I'm Anya Creightney
and this is the Letters

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.870
About Literature video series.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.490
Today we are going to
discuss letter writing.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.820
In this video, we are going
to learn what a letter is,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.910
different types of letters,
and the parts of a letter.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.590
But, first of all, you may be
wondering: what is a letter?

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.100
Well, a letter is a written,
typed, or printed message.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.560
Back in the day, letters
were usually mailed.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.130
Now, with the presence of online
platforms, letters can be sent

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.260
by email or uploaded
to online applications.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.020
Although we may be
used to writing quick,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.420
informal messages, not
all messages are letters.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.050
Let's see some examples
of other media

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.890
that are not considered
letters: emails,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.870
text messages, social
media posts.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.620
To summarize, we can
conclude the items

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.800
on the left are letters because
they are written materials

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.960
that is usually sent by mail
and require a structure.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.050
While the items on the
right are not letters

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.440
because they are sent instantly
and do not require a structure.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.430
Now, we are going to discuss
different types of letters.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.660
Formal letters are
those that are written

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.250
in official language,
have a specific purpose,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.950
and are written for
professional communication.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.150
Informal letters,
on the other hand,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.350
are written in a friendly manner

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.130
to someone you are
familiar with,

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.990
and is used for personal
communication.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.150
For the Letters About Literature
program, you are going

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.140
to be writing an
informal letter,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.680
one that is personal
and sincere.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.670
It should feel like a private
conversation with the author,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.570
rather than a book
report or a fan letter.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.080
Now that we know what a letter
is, and the different types

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.730
of letters, why don't we
learn how to write one?

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.050
A letter is a type of
writing that has five parts.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.490
Let's think of it as the parts
of your favorite superhero!

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.140
Starting with the first part of
the letter, we have the heading.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.720
It is placed at the
top of the letter

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.790
and it usually includes the
date and sometimes your address.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.330
The heading would be like
the head of your hero

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.410
because it goes on the top!

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.710
For the Letters About Literature
program, you don't need

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.730
to put your address
on the letter.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.010
Following the heading,
we have the greeting.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.050
The greeting is like saying hi,

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.640
and it addresses the
person you are writing to.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.010
In our superheroes,
this would be the mouth

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.600
where they communicate
with others!

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.230
Going a little farther
down, we have the body.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.110
This is where you write the
main message of the letter,

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.110
and where the most
information is found.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.420
After the body, we
have the closing.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.360
It's an expression
that closes the letter

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.190
and it is usually
followed by a comma.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.660
In your favorite superheroes,

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.330
this would be the cape usually
hanging from their backs.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.260
Finally, we have the signature.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.320
This is where you
write your name.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.890
Your signature tells the
reader who the letter is from.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.360
In a superhero, this can
be found in their logo.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.340
Now we know what a letter is,
including all of its parts!

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.010
Hope you found this short,
and instructive, video fun,

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.440
and remember: if you
have any questions,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.340
feel free to ask your
teachers and librarians.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.430
