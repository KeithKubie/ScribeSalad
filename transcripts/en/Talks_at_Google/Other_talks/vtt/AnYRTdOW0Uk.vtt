DAVID SUMPTER:
Thank you very much.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.830
It's a real pleasure to be here.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.790
So, as Paul said, I work in a
collective behavior research

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.550
group, and we're
interested in all forms

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.670
of collective behavior--
how individuals

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.470
interact with each other
to produce patterns.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.630
So a lot of our research
is about animal groups.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.670
It's about fish
and ants and birds.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.230
But we're also
interested in humans

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.790
who have interesting
collective behavior too.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.540
And even things down
at the cellular level,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.830
how cells interact to
produce different patterns.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.870
And what I really like about
coming here and speaking

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.180
at Google is that a few years
ago I got really inspired

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.380
by your 20% idea, that
you should do something

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.870
else with your research
time other than the stuff

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.515
that you're doing.

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:52.890
And, of course,
I mean, I already

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.660
look at like animal groups
and so that's a load of fun.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.120
But I thought what could we do?

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.450
And so in our research group
we started to try and do

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.950
a bit of this 20% thing.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.129
We had a fun Friday,
we called it,

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.870
where we tried to do some
other type of research.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.400
And connected to all of that,
I came up with the idea,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.660
wouldn't it be fun
to try and apply

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.870
how I look at collective
behavior of animals

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.860
to looking at collective
behavior in football?

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.790
And that's really where
the origin of the idea

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.400
of soccermatics came from.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.380
To give you an idea of the
sorts of things I study,

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.630
here are three videos.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.670
At the bottom, this
is some clapping

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.760
undergraduate students.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.050
We did a study on how
applause starts and stops

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.720
after people have
listened to a talk,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.610
a bit like this type of talk.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.850
On the top is the
formation of ant trails.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.330
It's a bit faint
there, but what's shown

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.360
is-- in the little
pinkish color-- is

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.790
where the ants have
been and where they're

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.980
leaving pheromone trails.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.330
Ants communicate with chemicals
and they build up trails

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.760
between their nests and food.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.130
And at the top right there,
that is tracks of fish movement.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.840
So that's a small
group of eight fish,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.310
how they're moving around.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.740
And we can work out how they
interact with each other.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.730
So that's really the everyday
type of research we do.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.420
I'm going to go into a
little bit of more details

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.400
of these things later on.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.600
But that's to give you
an idea of the types

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.312
of collective behavior
that we study.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.520
So coming to soccermatics.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.910
So soccermatics has a lot of
chapters about different ideas

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.860
from biology where we
can apply it to football.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.940
And one of the first
ones I came up with

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.860
was slime molds from Barcelona.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.080
So the title of
the chapter is How

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.011
Slime Molds Built Barcelona.

00:02:57.011 --> 00:02:59.010
First I should introduce
you to the slime molds.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.770
Some of you might have
seen slime molds before.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.850
Here is a slime mold.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.560
And what we can see here, this
is a particular experiment

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.800
done by Toshi Nakagaki
and his colleagues.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.850
And the slime mold is the
yellow thing in the middle.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.890
On the white things
are oat flakes

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.860
that he's left lying out.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.390
He's actually left
them lying out

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.410
in the shape of Tokyo suburbs.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.470
So this is the airport in Tokyo,
this is the center of Tokyo,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.330
this is Yokohama down here,
and all of the suburbs of Tokyo

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.160
have been left
out as cornflakes.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.260
And what the slime mold does is
it spreads out and connects up

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.160
all of these different suburbs.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.520
And it does so in a
very nice, optimal way.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.360
It makes these nice
triangulation patterns

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.390
where it can transport all
the nutrients backwards

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.700
and forwards between
the center of it

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.530
and all of these
different areas.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.950
So slime molds are singular
cellular organisms yet

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.300
they can solve these quite
difficult transportation

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.107
problems.

00:04:05.107 --> 00:04:06.940
The nice thing that
Toshi and his colleagues

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.310
did is that they
said, well, can we

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.920
compare how the humans
solve this problem

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.680
and how the slime
molds solved it?

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.709
And it turns out that
the slime molds came up

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.700
with pretty much a smart
solution to the Tokyo network

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.690
problem as the humans did.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.540
And so they were able
to solve it and produce

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.760
these minimal spanning trees or
these connecting networks that

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.752
were somehow very close to
what the humans managed to do.

00:04:34.752 --> 00:04:36.460
They also tested this--
I like this story

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.857
because they also
tested this for Germany

00:04:38.857 --> 00:04:40.940
and it was the same result.
It was very efficient.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.850
And France, they
connected up the network.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.520
Then they looked at
the British Rail system

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.360
and how the slime mold
compared to the humans

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.560
and it came up with a
much better solution.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.020
The slime mold was much better
than the British Rail solution.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.140
OK.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.610
So how do slime molds
connect to Barcelona, right?

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.000
Well, let's start by
looking at a goal.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.600
This is one of the greatest
football teams of all time.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.090
This is the Barcelona
team of 2010-2011,

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.770
which won the Champions League.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.530
And this, of course,
is Lionel Messi.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.630
One pass, two pass,
and into goal.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.010
It's just an amazing run
where he basically goes

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:26.030
past eight players and gets the
ball into the back of the net.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.366
It's just wonderful to watch.

00:05:28.366 --> 00:05:29.740
But what I wanted
to do is, well,

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.650
think about what's
actually going on there.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.150
I mean, when you're
looking at this,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.540
you're probably looking
mostly at Messi.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.040
But there's a very
interesting thing

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.290
if we look at some
of the other players.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.750
So now I've taken-- I've
tracked the positions of all

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.260
of the players and I've put them
down onto the football pitch.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.390
And we can see that
Messi is over there

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.940
and Xavi is over here.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.000
And then we have Iniesta here.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.220
And what I've done is
made a triangulation,

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.990
very similar to what happens
with the slime molds,

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.590
connecting all of these players.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.670
And you see this really lovely
triangulation between Xavi here

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.910
and Iniesta and you have
the opposing players

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.530
are sort of caught
in the middle.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.810
And Xavi is perfectly placed
between these one, two, three,

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.630
four, five other players.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.420
He's right in the
middle of them.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.900
And by moving into the
middle at the same time

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.870
he produces a triangle
where he can then

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.610
take the ball from Messi and
pass it on to the next player.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.940
So we can actually break this
down as a Voronoi diagram

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.400
and see that the
opposing players are

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.030
stuck on the line
between Xavi and Messi,

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.610
which makes it very easy
for him to do the pass.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.210
Then what does Messi do next?

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.900
Well, this is Pedro.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.750
Just now he's standing
marked by another player.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.970
But one second later, when
Messi has moved forward,

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.700
you see suddenly that Pedro is
standing in the middle of one,

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.930
two, three, four.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.210
It's just a subtle movement,
just one meter away,

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.050
produces the same
triangular effect again.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.130
And this is what Barcelona do
time after time after time.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.130
They create space and
through creating space,

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.250
they create these triangles
which they can pass.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.640
Once Pedro has done that,
the ball goes to Pedro.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.900
This is just in a
one-meter space.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.130
And Messi is through.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.160
And so when we watch it
again, we see pass one.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.450
Pass two, Pedro
moved into space.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.050
And the goal goes in.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.030
So that was the whole
structure between

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.470
that particular Barcelona team.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.660
Now I've been
working with data--

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.310
I've been writing articles
for "FourFourTwo" magazine

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.260
and working with data from Opta.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.320
And now we can actually
look at the whole passing

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.420
network throughout the match.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.740
So this is Barcelona
versus Arsenal.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.730
This is now
modern-day Barcelona.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.670
This was the season match
where they knocked Arsenal out

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.260
of the Champions League.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.720
And again we can see
very nice selection

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.670
of triangles between Messi
on this side and Dani Alves

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.070
and Rakitic.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:09.407
And then up at the top, we
have Neymar, Iniesta, and Alba.

00:08:09.407 --> 00:08:11.240
And what I love about
the Barcelona network,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.640
it just has this sort
of perfect symmetry.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.560
You basically have
Messi and two players,

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.570
you have Neymar and
two players, you

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.794
have Busquets which
you can go back to,

00:08:19.794 --> 00:08:21.710
and then you have Suarez
at the tip of it all.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.060
And there's a sort of
symmetry down the middle.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.670
And by looking at the passes
that all of the players made,

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.270
you can identify what are the
key components of Barcelona.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.169
What makes them such
a successful team?

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.330
And I've been doing--
I got really into this.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.756
When I got hold
of this Opta data,

00:08:37.756 --> 00:08:40.130
it was so much fun to make
all of these different passing

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.629
networks.

00:08:40.629 --> 00:08:45.060
This is a different type of
passing network I've made.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.440
This is from earlier in
the season, Manchester City

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.970
versus Leicester.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.560
And this is a
passing network which

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.640
shows the average pass position
between different players.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.210
So up here is the average
place that Sterling

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.560
passed to Kolarov.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.370
This is the average place
Kolarov passed off to Sterling.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.850
And then we can build up a
convex hull which connects

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.320
all of these passing points.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.500
And you get an idea of
where is the territory

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.814
for these different places.

00:09:12.814 --> 00:09:15.230
And it's interesting to see
that Sterling placed basically

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.470
across the two wings,
and this is something

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:18.470
that Manchester City do.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.460
So you can get a
very nice idea, which

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.660
goes above the normal
formations of a football match,

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.868
of how a team works together.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.287
So that's the basic network
connection, and the starting

00:09:34.287 --> 00:09:35.120
with the slime mold.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.770
The next thing that
I wanted to look at

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.690
was the flow of the game.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.270
So there's a chapter in the
book called Check My Flow.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.680
And the starting point
for this was an experiment

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.830
done by Messi Moussaid.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.390
He did a very simple experiment,
but it's a very nice and useful

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.420
experiment.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.200
He placed-- he did it in France.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.990
And he placed-- had
had two students.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:03.150
So one of them stood here
and the other student

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.090
was walking towards
the stationary student.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.810
And what this vector
field shows you,

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.380
what all the arrows
show you, is the effect

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.800
that a stationary student
has on a moving student.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.740
And so he's taken away-- they've
always got forward motion,

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.237
but you can see they've slowed
down when they're in this area.

00:10:20.237 --> 00:10:22.570
And if they're off to the
left, they go off to the left,

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.550
and if they're off to the
right, they go off to the right.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.900
And he actually found that there
was a small, small bias-- maybe

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.760
a sort of 60-40 bias--
that these arrows are just

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.170
a bit stronger off to the right.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.770
So there's a sort
of bigger tendency

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.172
to go off to the right.

00:10:36.172 --> 00:10:38.380
And this means when you have
two walking students who

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.190
meet each other,
they end up passing

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.650
each other on the right.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.150
And so this is a
nice example of how

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.840
you can model individual
interactions in humans

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.500
and work out what's going on.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.270
So what I wanted to
do was use this type

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.520
of vector field, this type
of flow field approach,

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.090
in order to understand what's
going on in a football match.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:06.380
This is another one of
my very favorite players.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.940
Up here is Andrea Pirlo.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.580
He's just got the ball
here and he puts it across.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.087
So watch what Pirlo does now.

00:11:14.087 --> 00:11:15.170
He sort of strolls around.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.295
He has this beautiful style
of just he doesn't even

00:11:17.295 --> 00:11:18.684
look like he can run properly.

00:11:18.684 --> 00:11:20.100
He kind of moves
there over there,

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.880
he sort of strolls around
with the ball a little bit

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.380
like this.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.752
Oh, I've fallen over.

00:11:24.752 --> 00:11:26.710
Yeah, I'm not really
going to do anything here.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.001
I'll just stand here for a bit.

00:11:28.001 --> 00:11:28.960
And then pang!

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.380
He just places this
beautiful pass out

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:36.510
to a free player, one more pass,
and then the ball is suddenly

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.190
in the middle and it's a goal.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:43.170
This was the semifinal
of the Euro 2012.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.930
And that's really Pirlo's
mode of operation.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.490
He was one of the key
players in that game.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.890
Time and time again, he was
in the middle of the field

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:54.680
standing there and
then putting out

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.360
these passes in
different directions.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.890
And what I can do is I can
produce the same type of flow

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.607
field for Pirlo.

00:12:02.607 --> 00:12:05.190
And I like to call him the eye
of the storm, because basically

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:08.730
he has this operation area.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.202
This is a heat map of where
he's most often passing from.

00:12:12.202 --> 00:12:13.660
And if he's on the
right-hand side,

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.870
he tends to pass out to the
left, which he did in the video

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:17.650
we saw.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.909
If he's on the left, he
passes out to the right.

00:12:19.909 --> 00:12:20.950
And that's his operation.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.760
He's really tightly constrained
to a particular point

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.390
and making these passes
out in different direction.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:32.230
This is the average data-- well,
I've fitted a model to this,

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.710
but it's the average
data taken over a match.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.700
And then you can compare
to other players.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.570
So Schweinsteiger
plays for Germany.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.770
And he would actually say
that he-- in that match,

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:45.700
he played the same
midfield position as Pirlo,

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.050
but he has a completely
different vector

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.970
field or flow field.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.150
He is moving everywhere
around the pitch.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.940
He has these long passes in this
direction and some going out

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.480
that direction, and he
moves much more around.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.550
So I think if Pirlo is
the eye of the storm,

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.690
then Schweinsteiger
is a tornado that

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:07.690
just engulfs the whole pitch.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.847
And what I like about this is
it's sort of like an analogy

00:13:10.847 --> 00:13:12.430
here, or there's a
sort of prediction.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.610
It's like a weather
forecast prediction.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:16.390
If we look at that,
well, now we've

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.410
got a forecast of
how Schweinsteiger

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.630
is going to play.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.570
And this is exactly how he
played in the World Cup final.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.680
He was everywhere in the World
Cup final two years later.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.972
And I don't think
he single-handedly

00:13:27.972 --> 00:13:29.430
won the World Cup
final, but he was

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.420
one of the absolute key
players in doing it.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.440
So you sort of have
a weather forecast

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.780
which predicts how a player
will play in future matches.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:43.850
And what's been nice to do
now looking at this Opta data

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.750
is to do this for players.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.820
So this is Riyad
Mahrez, who's been

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.530
one of the successful players
for Leicester this season.

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:56.130
He plays out on
the right midfield.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.220
And you can see exactly
where Mahrez is.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.070
You know this is where he's
going to be, that black thing,

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.730
and you can also see where
he's passing the ball.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.370
This shows why
it's so effective.

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.270
The ball keeps flowing
in, in this direction.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.570
This is where Vardy
is, for example.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:13.960
All of his passes
are creating chances

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.270
going in that direction.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:20.870
And you can use this technique
to compare different players.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:24.347
Because we're in London,
I mean-- actually

00:14:24.347 --> 00:14:26.930
because we're in London, you're
probably all Manchester United

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:27.750
fans.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.170
But I thought I'd show you
some of the leading attacking

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:36.000
midfielders for the London team.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.340
So Eden Hazard for Chelsea up
there, Mesut Ozil for Arsenal,

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:44.160
Christian Eriksen for Spurs,
and Dimitri Payet for West Ham.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.180
And ostensibly
these players play

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.500
in round about
the same position,

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.280
but they have very
different attacking arrows.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.100
Eden Hazard has had
a really bad season,

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.570
and you can sort of see why.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:00.300
If you compare to Ozil
on the right here,

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.840
Ozil's passes are always moving
forward in this direction

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.420
while Eden Hazard is passing
more into the middle.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.657
So he's not making
the ball move forward.

00:15:08.657 --> 00:15:10.490
Christian Eriksen is
doing a pretty good job

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.730
of making the ball move forward.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.070
And Payet is doing
very long passes.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.900
These are crosses into the box.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.120
And so he's moving the
ball in a good direction.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.150
So you can get an idea
of the style of play

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.290
of the different players
and whether they're

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.710
effective in this play.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.860
OK.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.600
So up to now I've been
looking at on-the-ball data.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.400
I've been looking at when the
player has the ball, where

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.540
is the player moving
to the ball to.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.920
But there's more and more
technology available now

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.610
to actually track all of the
movement of all of the players.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.410
This data is collected
by individuals,

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.970
by people watching the match
and saying who's got the ball

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.260
and tracking the
positions on the pitch.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.150
But it is actually possible
to automate it, automatically

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.580
track all of the
positions of the players.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.160
This is the kind of
interesting problem

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.230
that I'm sure you guys are
interested in at Google.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:12.790
And so I have a chapter on the
World in Motion, I call it,

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.360
and that's where I really
like to think about what we've

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.790
done in our own fish research.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.230
So-- OK.

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:24.750
So this is a film from a BBC
documentary showing really

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.730
some of the most beautiful
patterns that fish

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.146
create, and I
thought I'd give you

00:16:28.146 --> 00:16:30.820
an idea about how
they work in the wild

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.240
before we move into the lab.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.180
So these are sort of balls
of mackerel and other fish

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:40.110
you see if you go diving, and
they create these massive balls

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:41.000
of movement.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.640
And the point is that
no individual fish

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.199
has any idea of the pattern
that it's creating as a whole.

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:48.740
They're just moving
around, following

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.560
their local
neighbors, yet they're

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:56.310
producing these incredibly
intricate and complicated

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:57.760
patterns.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.140
One of the big
steps forward when

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.620
we wanted to model these
things mathematically

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.329
was just the simple idea
of looking at what we call

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:06.530
self-propelled particle models.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.089
The idea is that you
have this particle here,

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.130
and it just follows
the direction

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.510
of the other
particles around it.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:17.060
So if I allow this--
this red particle

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.869
would just follow the
direction of the black particle

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:22.500
and it just starts to
move forward in this.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.270
And then I can take and
simulate the whole thing.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.695
So now I'm just
running this on--

00:17:29.695 --> 00:17:32.320
so if they go off one boundary,
they come back on to the other.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.280
And you can see
our red focal fish.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.430
But what is really cool here
is you've just got this local

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:42.260
interaction that's shown by the
grey area and quite quickly you

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.530
get a sort of something that
doesn't look so different from

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:46.120
a fish school.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.480
You have movement in
the same direction,

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.660
you have groups moving around,
and it has that same kind

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.730
of complex motion.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.130
So just from a few--
a very simple rule

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.180
of following your neighbors, you
can create a fish school that

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.320
moves in the same direction.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:06.160
And when we do this in the
lab, we study exactly this.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.140
We, as I showed the
film before, we're

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.270
tracking the
individual fish and we

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.770
want to work out what
are the rules of motion

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.320
that these fish are following.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.930
Another example is here.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.460
This is an escape experiment.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.860
We frighten the fish
and we can see--

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.060
we can watch a wave of
escape going through them.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.031
We can't do these
massive experiments

00:18:28.031 --> 00:18:29.530
like they do in the
wild, but we can

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:33.060
get a nice idea of how
the fish are interacting.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.560
And for quite a few
years now, we've

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.530
been doing what we call
rules of motion experiments.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:42.600
We look at how fish--
this focal fish--

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.630
interacts with its neighbors.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:47.440
This is an example of
how a fish accelerates

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.660
depending on the position
of its neighbors.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.110
This is a similar thing
done with pigeons.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.850
How does a pigeon
change direction

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.980
as a function of the
position of its neighbors?

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.830
And we can get a
really good idea

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:00.490
of how these fish and how
these pigeons interact

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.200
with each other.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.140
And recently to try and prove
how good we were at this,

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.260
we did what we call
the fish Turing test.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.870
The job for you now is
to spot the real fish

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:16.910
and the non-real fish as they
swim around in this arena.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:20.580
And actually I think-- I have
to confess that I have forgotten

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.560
the answer to which is the
real fish and which is the--

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.330
And so we actually-- we did an
experiment and the real fish

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.820
experts could tell
slightly better than random

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.866
between simulated
fish and real fish.

00:19:32.866 --> 00:19:34.490
But we found that
members of the public

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:38.160
were unable to distinguish
real fish and simulated fish.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:42.010
So we're pretty close
to solve-- yeah.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.180
There's always more
interesting problems with fish,

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:48.120
but there's-- we're pretty
close to having a nice solution

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.879
of how fish interact
with each other.

00:19:50.879 --> 00:19:53.170
But that gives the nice thing
of having a new challenge

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:54.560
and that's football.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.252
So this is a
eight-against-eight match.

00:19:58.252 --> 00:19:59.710
The pitch is a bit
complicated here

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.470
because they're playing
on half a pitch.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.880
So they've got the goal
here and the goal there.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.407
And so these pitch
markings are just

00:20:05.407 --> 00:20:07.240
because they're playing
a part of the pitch.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.150
They're playing
from left to right.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.730
And if you look
to the green team,

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.860
that shows the correlations
between the players,

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.640
how closely they're
moving together.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.650
When they're green
they correlated well.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.630
And suddenly when the
yellow team get the ball,

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.410
they switch from being highly
correlated to blue, which is

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.670
what happens when you attack.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.480
Then you become unsynchronized.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.420
They've lost the
ball again and then

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.080
they become green, which means
that they're highly correlated.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.770
And you can actually look to see
which player is following which

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:35.600
in these systems.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.270
That's the pointiness
of the arrows.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.400
And what we've
identified there is

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.860
defense is a
synchronized movement,

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.510
and attack is basically
about making more

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:50.230
random, unexpected movements.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.080
This is kind of
preliminary work.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.250
This is a particular test
data set that we have.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.020
And this is really
the stuff that

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.240
will be being done over
the next five or 10

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.140
years is trying to
understand this type of data

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.680
and to see if you can understand
the basics of what happens

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.400
in a football
match and if we can

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.699
think about how to improve it.

00:21:10.699 --> 00:21:11.990
We have a few ideas about this.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.531
One experiment we've
done on the fish

00:21:13.531 --> 00:21:16.550
is we're interested in this
idea of collective vision.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:20.290
What the color here shows
is what-- the white areas is

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.840
things that all of
the fish can see,

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.680
the red areas are things that
only one or two of the fish

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.220
can see areas of this thing.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.510
So we can get an idea about
what the fish group can see.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.990
And that's exactly what
we are interested in doing

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:34.120
in a football match.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:41.800
This is another situation from
Barcelona and over on this side

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.820
I've tried to plot where are the
possible passes that Busquets

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.720
can make over to Messi.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.450
And the red areas show
things which are blocked

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:55.420
and the green areas
show possible passes.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.195
And you can take-- this was a
student of mine, [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:59.195 --> 00:22:00.200
who did this work.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.980
And what you can do is you can
take different match situations

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.690
and you can say--
this is James Milner

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:07.950
in a match for Liverpool.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.860
And he basically has
two passing options.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:13.110
He has, one, to try and get the
ball through to Sturridge there

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:16.530
which is a much narrower chance,
or he can play the ball out

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:17.340
to the wing.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.240
And so you can evaluate these
different match situations

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.140
and say when should you decide
to make these certain things.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.390
It's much more valuable
to make this type of pass

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.050
because it's much
more dangerous,

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.850
but what's the
probability of success.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.170
And you can show that to
the players after the match

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.510
and say, well, you
decided to do that here.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:37.230
Maybe you should make a
different decision last time

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.234
based on statistics.

00:22:39.234 --> 00:22:40.650
And that's where
I think you can--

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:44.160
this is where you have these
beautifully big data sets which

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.050
you can kind of
learn on and decide,

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.310
make good decision
rules for football.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:52.130
Good.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.980
So that's the collective motion.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.080
The last thing I'm going to
just touch on for five minutes

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.170
is what I call the Tactical Map.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.280
So this uses some of the
ideas we've looked at so far

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.260
and some extra things.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.650
And this one is not
in the book because I

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.670
wrote the book before the whole
Leicester City phenomenon.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.930
But I decided
quite early on that

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.010
I had to look at this
Leicester City thing

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:18.700
and work out what was going on.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:22.220
And this is a nice picture
of the defensive zones

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.820
that Leicester City create.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.890
So they basically have two areas
where they defend the ball.

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:32.370
These shapes are the typical
areas where Leicester City

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.260
players recover the ball.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.320
They of course have a back
four, a very traditional

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.440
back four-- Fuchs, Huth,
Morgan, and Simpson

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.021
playing in the back four.

00:23:43.021 --> 00:23:44.520
But he's a bit faint
in the picture,

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.340
but Kante has been one
of their star players.

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.800
He defends in front of the
back four, picking up the ball

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.110
and then shooting
it up to either

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:56.030
to Mahrez or Vardy or
Albrighton, who are then

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.400
very effective in striking.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.540
But you see this
territory at the back,

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.150
and what Leicester have also
been extremely good in doing

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:06.360
is that they own this territory
further up at the front

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.880
and they're often getting the
ball back up here, which allows

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.730
them to do very fast attacks.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:13.550
Or if the ball
comes up from Kante,

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.100
maybe Vardy doesn't
get it first time

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.240
but he recovers it
very quickly and then

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.870
he can continue
to attack on goal.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.720
So you can see where the
defensive territories are.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.880
And I did a study
back in February

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.310
looking at what is it
that makes Leicester

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.560
different from the other teams.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.470
And it turned out that if
you break the pitch into x-y

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:39.100
coordinates and you look
each pass, how far does it

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.530
travel across the pitch
and how far does it

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:45.210
travel up the pitch during
the time that they're passing.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:49.040
And this is across the pitch
and this is up the pitch.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.540
Leicester City are off
the charts with passes

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.680
directly up the pitch.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.930
There are other teams which
we call long-ball teams

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:00.750
like West Ham United, Crystal
Palace, and Southampton.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.030
They're doing
crosses into the box.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:07.060
But Leicester are playing
directly up the pitch.

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.310
Before Leicester
City, this was what

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.020
was considered to
be good quality

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.737
football that Arsenal,
Manchester City, Liverpool

00:25:14.737 --> 00:25:15.570
are trying to do it.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:16.880
Chelsea.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.660
Manchester United, what they're
doing is they've got the ball,

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.830
they're passing very short
passes to one another.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:24.704
They think that they've
got the best players

00:25:24.704 --> 00:25:26.870
and so they try and control
with a lot of possession

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:28.940
and a lot of fast
passing to each other.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.360
And they did that this season.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.810
In previous seasons, it's been
these teams that have won.

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.270
But this season by stepping
exactly into this area,

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.890
Leicester City seem to
be much more effective.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.710
One last thing I didn't
say about this plot

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:44.420
is that the size of the circle
is the number of chances

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.930
generated by the teams.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.992
So Arsenal had an
incredible number of chances

00:25:48.992 --> 00:25:50.950
but unfortunately they
didn't have the strikers

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.890
to score any of the goals.

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:57.079
And Leicester City
had less chances

00:25:57.079 --> 00:25:59.078
but they were very effective
in converting them.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:06.669
Then lastly, this is now a
season network of-- Leicester

00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:09.210
were very nice because they have
pretty much the same players

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.410
on the pitch
throughout the season

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:14.550
and so you can get a good
idea of who was passing who.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:18.390
So the circle here
is how many shots

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:20.140
from the danger zone
in front of goal

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:21.520
were done by a
particular player.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.120
So Vardy is this
massive circle here,

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.127
but even Huth is a
pretty big circle.

00:26:26.127 --> 00:26:27.460
Doesn't mean he shot from there.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.740
He shot closer in.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.490
But this is the typical
position that they pass from.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:36.050
And you can get an idea of how
Leicester move the ball around.

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:40.066
Kante is the central point
that's connecting up everybody.

00:26:40.066 --> 00:26:41.690
So, again, you've
got some sort of tool

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:42.895
for analyzing performance.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:49.920
I've been talking to a few
different football clubs

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.385
and people who are
doing this type of data

00:26:52.385 --> 00:26:54.230
and what's
increasingly being done

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:56.180
is that there's
this integration.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.090
There will be an
opposition analyst who

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:02.710
look at the passing,
this type of data,

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:05.220
then they'll try and compare
it to their own knowledge.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.180
And then this should go
into-- player has an iPad

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.870
and is looking at
the data and trying

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:15.210
to improve their own play for
these training sessions which

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.150
can be based on preparing
for particular tactics

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.590
that the team you're meeting
is going to play against.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.048
And then the manager
is, of course,

00:27:22.048 --> 00:27:24.980
doing their traditional
presentation of the results.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.170
So I think this type
of data is going

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:34.400
to be more and more integrated
into how football clubs work.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.310
Good.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.020
That was the main
things I wanted to say,

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.520
and so I'll just
finish with-- that's

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.810
three chapters of the book.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:43.620
So I'll just finish
with a little plug

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.420
for some of the other things.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.770
Some of the other
chapters in the book.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:52.190
So I live in Sweden and
there Zlatan Ibrahimovic

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:55.410
is the big hero so I had
to do an analysis of Zlatan

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:56.580
Ibrahimovic.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:01.800
And I analyzed the trajectory
of his overhead lob goal

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.740
kick against England from
a couple of years ago.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:10.210
So that was a lot of
fun to do that analysis.

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:14.280
Then I have a little bit on
game theory and strategy.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.510
My point there is
that by-- like birds

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:21.110
are able to evolve to
have particular strategies

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:25.280
and managers are also
able to evolve and have

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.610
optimal strategies, possibly
not by being the smartest people

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:31.890
but just by watching each other
and adopting their strategies.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.440
And I talk about why you should
have three points for a win,

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.148
because it makes more
attacking football.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.330
You'll Never Walk Alone
is about crowd movement.

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:46.120
And I look at applause and
how applause is infectious,

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.250
a bit like the
clapping study we did.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:50.900
But also thinking
about how songs

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.360
start in a football ground.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.960
You have this
really rapid spread

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.280
of particular songs
between people

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.550
and it's really to do
with exponential growth

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:01.510
and infection.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.510
Then I have a bit on
collective wisdom.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:08.390
So how betting provides some
form of collective wisdom.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.900
There was this lovely book,
"This Wisdom of Crowds,"

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.510
and so I look a
bit deeper at some

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.180
of the assumptions in "This
Wisdom of Crowds" in that.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.840
And then I end the book
by putting my money

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.490
where my mouth is
and try and beat

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:26.860
the betting market
using some of the things

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.400
that I've learned
about football.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.370
And I did actually manage to
make a little bit of money.

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:33.030
You can read about
it in the book.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.090
But it turned out that,
yeah, there was two things.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:40.040
It turned out that I had-- it
was a very boring strategy that

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.110
made me lots of money.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:45.910
It was just to bet on draws.

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:47.850
So that wasn't so much fun.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:50.820
And also I challenged my
wife, who is sitting here,

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.400
to the betting
thing, and she claims

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:59.100
that she had a deep and
sophisticated system.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.550
I'm not too convinced
of that, but in the end

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.310
she did actually win
more money than me.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:04.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:08.150
So we're still looking into
the science behind that.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:09.960
I'm not sure what it is.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.140
But, anyway, so there's
a bit on betting.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.990
And actually at the
end of it, I conclude

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:20.020
that instead of becoming
a professional gambler,

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.439
you should probably come and
work for Google or something

00:30:22.439 --> 00:30:24.480
like that where you actually
get a regular salary

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.670
and can use the same
types of skills.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:28.360
And that's it.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.120
Yeah, I think you've
all-- lots of you

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.510
have got copies of the book.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.482
And, yeah, it was out yesterday.

00:30:33.482 --> 00:30:34.440
So thank you very much.

00:30:41.034 --> 00:30:45.400
So now we'll open the
floor to questions.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.190
Got one already.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.980
AUDIENCE: Thanks very
much for the talk.

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.650
How many clubs have
offered you a job?

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:55.270
DAVID SUMPTER: Oh, none of them.

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:55.860
No.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.940
It's not-- I mean,
I've talked to clubs.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.320
It's very interesting
about that actually

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:06.140
because mainly I've
met some analysts

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.030
and they do complain
a little bit

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:10.690
about trying to get that
cycle that I described right.

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:12.100
That it really isn't like that.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.039
The lifetime of a
manager just now is-- you

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:16.330
know, it's a year or something.

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:18.040
So it's very difficult
to get that sort

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.270
of thing going in a club.

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:24.320
Just now they use a lot of
stuff for scouting and so on.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:29.530
But, yeah, the answer to
your question is none as yet.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:30.650
I'm open to offers.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.490
AUDIENCE: Have you looked--
you did a lot of this

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:40.390
produce as a result like
this, and this looks similar.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:42.340
And but have you
actually investigated

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.270
how predictive it is?

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:47.010
So where a scientific
experiment would be done,

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:48.920
do it on some
training data and then

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.300
see if it predicts the future?

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:50.670
DAVID SUMPTER: Yeah.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:52.910
That's a really-- I mean,
in the betting thing I did.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:58.000
I used those types of predictive
approaches to fit the data.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.840
But actually it's
quite interesting

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.490
because I know
that you guys here,

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:04.000
or some of you
guys who'll be here

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.430
are very into this sort of
machine learning type of stuff.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.840
And we do a lot of that
machine learning type of stuff

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.040
as well in developing
the models of the fish

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.950
and then you do
predictive things.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:18.790
But it tends to be in science
that you get more understanding

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:22.570
from sort of messing around
with different types of models

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:25.170
trying to see which
reproduce the behavior,

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:27.500
trying to work out if it's
consistent at an individual

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.310
level and a collective level.

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:31.970
And it isn't always
predictive in that way.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:34.360
It's more of a trying to
create models to create

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.870
some sort of understanding.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.650
And I suppose I'm doing that
in the football as well.

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:42.520
That it's not that I
can take those networks,

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.230
put them against each
other and predict

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:46.620
the result of the next match.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.770
That just-- we're
not really there yet.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.080
It's more about understanding
where things are working

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.121
and where things are not
working within the club.

00:32:58.927 --> 00:32:59.760
AUDIENCE: Hi, David.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.386
Thanks for coming.

00:33:01.386 --> 00:33:02.010
Two quick ones.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:04.015
So the first one is where
do you get the data.

00:33:04.015 --> 00:33:05.840
Is it some kind of
public repository?

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.673
DAVID SUMPTER: Yeah.

00:33:06.673 --> 00:33:10.700
So I've had a-- no,
the data is from Opta,

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.400
the on-the-ball data.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.140
And that's a private company.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.710
And they collect in this data.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:21.080
I've been very lucky to have
a good relationship with them

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.450
because I wrote for
"FourFourTwo" magazine.

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:24.950
They have a thing
called Stats Zone.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:28.575
So you can go in
and see all the data

00:33:28.575 --> 00:33:31.350
and I'm sure very
clever people like

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:33.930
you could scrape the data
in about five minutes,

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.320
but so it's all there.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.470
But it's owned by
this company Opta.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.280
And but they're very good.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.700
They like to encourage this type
of blog academic type of thing.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.870
So they've shared it
with me and there's

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:48.990
a website called Stats Bomb
where they use this data

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:51.770
just for nonprofit,
analyzing and having fun

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:52.770
playing around with it.

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:54.450
But otherwise, they
sell it to clubs

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:57.209
and they sell it to
the media and so on.

00:33:57.209 --> 00:33:58.250
AUDIENCE: And second one.

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:00.200
Was your kind of
mathematical prediction

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.520
for the next Champions League--

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.650
DAVID SUMPTER: For the next--
for the Champions League final?

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:06.108
AUDIENCE: No, not necessarily
of the outcome, but how the--

00:34:06.108 --> 00:34:08.192
DAVID SUMPTER: I
have to-- I'm going

00:34:08.192 --> 00:34:10.150
to write an article about
this for "The Mirror"

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:11.719
and I haven't started
looking at it.

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:14.650
But I was very disappointed
because of-- it's much more fun

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:19.269
to do an analysis of
Bayern Munich than it is--

00:34:19.269 --> 00:34:20.810
and Barcelona is
one of my favorites.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.679
So I was at least hoping
to have Bayern in the final

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.770
before I start my analysis.

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:28.970
So just now I don't
have a prediction

00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:31.489
and I'm just trying to get
over the disappointment

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:34.000
of not having the most
mathematically beautiful team

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:34.945
in the final.

00:34:34.945 --> 00:34:36.320
AUDIENCE: And
you're saying that.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.469
I'm from Madrid, so I'm--

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:39.170
DAVID SUMPTER: Oh, OK.

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:39.960
Yeah.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.840
Yeah, OK, so-- OK,
well you-- which

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.230
side are you on then in this?

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:45.120
AUDIENCE: Real.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:45.409
DAVID SUMPTER: OK.

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:46.020
They're going to win.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:46.520
Yeah.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:55.139
AUDIENCE: Can you see
the effect of managers?

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:57.610
So if someone
changes team, can you

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.550
see after a few
weeks, a few months,

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:01.780
that the influence they
bring to those players

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.559
changes the tactics of
the individual players?

00:35:04.559 --> 00:35:05.350
DAVID SUMPTER: Yes.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:08.760
I did an analysis on Klopp
when he came to Liverpool.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.860
So Liverpool's my
club, and I looked

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.730
to see what-- is he doing
this counter pressing thing

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:19.030
more effectively than when
Rodgers was in charge?

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:21.170
And it turned out that
in the first six weeks

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.126
he wasn't doing more
counter pressing.

00:35:23.126 --> 00:35:25.250
This counter pressing is
where you run, try and get

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:26.708
the ball immediately
back if you've

00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:28.600
lost it in the opponent's half.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.090
Leicester are pretty good at it.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:34.790
And he wasn't doing
this to start with.

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:37.506
But then after about 12 weeks,
he'd actually got that working.

00:35:37.506 --> 00:35:39.380
And you could see a
statistically significant

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.890
difference between his press
and the pressing under Klopp

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.050
and the pressing under Rodgers.

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:49.370
So that-- yeah, that's the sort
of thing that you can analyze.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:52.580
Because the managers have
such short lifetimes,

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.940
they often get sacked for
unfortunate statistical

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.280
anomalies really, like they just
lost three matches in a row.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:03.506
And so that's a big problem.

00:36:03.506 --> 00:36:04.880
One thing you do
know is that you

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.963
would need to assess these
things for longer times

00:36:06.963 --> 00:36:08.992
normally than the
lifetimes of managers.

00:36:08.992 --> 00:36:09.825
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.990
AUDIENCE: So it
seems from your graph

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:26.820
like Leicester are playing
quite a different style to sort

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.720
of most of the other top teams.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:32.460
Do you think that that is
them having sort of broken out

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.210
of the little
tactical local minimum

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:37.694
and that's why they've
been so successful?

00:36:37.694 --> 00:36:42.190
Or more like they've just been
successful in the short term

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.940
because they're doing
something different?

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:45.648
Do you think other
teams could copy that?

00:36:45.648 --> 00:36:48.330
Or is it just like a
temporary flash in the pan?

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:49.640
DAVID SUMPTER: Yeah.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:53.590
I mean, that's the big
question, isn't it?

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:56.620
I think there is something
to learn in there, because we

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:59.330
can see there is a statistical
difference between them.

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:02.440
So and what you see in football
is this constant evolution.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.330
So the Barcelona
team of 2010-11,

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:08.000
there were lots of teams
which tried to copy that.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.190
Like, Swansea tried to do this,
and Arsenal to some degree

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.520
have tried to play like this.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.970
And now it doesn't work anymore.

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:18.950
You can't attack through the
D because-- I think really

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:20.470
Mourinho is credited with this.

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:23.010
He came up with, well, you just
pack everyone in the middle

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.005
and only Messi is going to
get through that and not

00:37:26.005 --> 00:37:28.130
even Messi is going to get
through it all the time.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:30.586
So he came up with a defense
which counteracted that.

00:37:30.586 --> 00:37:31.960
When he played
against Barcelona,

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.684
he let them go out to the
edges as much as they wanted

00:37:34.684 --> 00:37:36.100
because they were
all tiny so they

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.440
couldn't cross in to the
players in the middle.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:42.370
So that's one thing where you
see this tactical evolution.

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:46.265
And Leicester seem to
have evolved a system

00:37:46.265 --> 00:37:48.770
that the others weren't
ready to handle.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:52.550
And the problem with
Arsenal is possibly

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:54.410
they were actually
maximizing something.

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:57.800
They were maximizing-- we
often call this expected goals.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.760
They were maximizing
that shots should

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.380
come from a certain area,
and the other teams knew

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.810
that they were
maximizing that and then

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:05.920
they started blocking it.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.440
And then Arsenal didn't do well.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.840
But they had no strategy
for dealing with Leicester.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.980
So there's this constant
evolution and feedback.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.950
And, yeah, you will see teams
copying Leicester next season,

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:18.340
but it's not a guarantee
that it will work.

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.970
Something else might come along.

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:22.345
AUDIENCE: So you don't think
Leicester will be successful

00:38:22.345 --> 00:38:23.067
next season?

00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:24.400
That's your official prediction?

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.358
DAVID SUMPTER: You're
filming this, aren't you?

00:38:26.358 --> 00:38:31.700
I mean, they could very well
be successful next season.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.116
I thought that the
5,000 to 1 odds on them

00:38:34.116 --> 00:38:35.740
this season-- not at
the time, but when

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.090
I found out afterwards.

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:38.660
I mean, that's ridiculous odds.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.810
That means like 1 in 5,000 years
that they would win the League

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:44.367
and, like, it's only
20, 30 years ago

00:38:44.367 --> 00:38:45.825
since, like,
Nottingham Forest were

00:38:45.825 --> 00:38:48.850
winning the League and other
teams in Ipswich and so on.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:50.507
So, no, it's not impossible.

00:38:50.507 --> 00:38:52.090
I don't think that
Leicester will win,

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:53.620
but I don't actually
know who will win.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.036
I've done it in
the book, and I do

00:38:55.036 --> 00:38:57.410
this study is when
experts predict who's

00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:59.870
going to win the
next season, experts

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:03.420
are-- their guesses are worse
than just writing the League

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.500
table from the season
before on average.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:10.360
They always, like, have small
biases where they get it wrong.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.820
So I can tell-- yeah.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.310
So my prediction
for next season is

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:17.215
that Leicester will win
the League, that Spurs

00:39:17.215 --> 00:39:18.840
will be second,
because that's the best

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.820
prediction we know of making
a whole League season.

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.760
AUDIENCE: So did you
also do some sort

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.690
of comparative
analysis of Leicester

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:38.696
before they became
quite so successful?

00:39:38.696 --> 00:39:40.570
I think they were in
real trouble last season

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:44.910
and then maybe the last eight
or nine games they won a lot of.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:47.651
Have you sort of done the
graphs and pinpointed the place

00:39:47.651 --> 00:39:48.650
where the style changed?

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:49.290
DAVID SUMPTER:
That's a good point.

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:50.123
I haven't done that.

00:39:50.123 --> 00:39:51.830
I did last season
vs this season,

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:55.720
and they weren't doing these
longer passes in that way

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.380
last season.

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.370
So there was a change.

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:59.580
But what I didn't account
for is, as you were saying,

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.814
is if there might be a time
point during last season

00:40:02.814 --> 00:40:03.980
that they made a transition.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.770
So over the whole
season, they weren't

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:08.330
doing what they did this
season, but possibly at the end

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:08.896
they were.

00:40:16.531 --> 00:40:18.030
AUDIENCE: Did you
take a look at how

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:21.300
single player behaves under,
like, different managers?

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.010
So let's say, for
example, in the club

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:25.220
versus like national team.

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:28.520
So, like, Vardy is
waiting for long balls

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.490
basically and scores a
lot of goals in League.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.980
But perhaps he's not the
best choice for England

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:35.720
because the tactics
are different,

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.390
so they can use the strength.

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:41.897
Whereas with Pirlo you
get always the same--

00:40:41.897 --> 00:40:42.730
DAVID SUMPTER: Yeah.

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:43.380
It's true.

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:46.070
So I've got--
yeah, one example I

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:49.180
think is nice about that is
this Schweinsteiger thing.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.230
So when he was signed
for-- he wasn't really

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:53.980
allowed to play like
that at Bayern Munich

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.530
like he played for
the German team.

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:57.155
And he certainly
wasn't allowed to play

00:40:57.155 --> 00:40:58.530
like that at Manchester United.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.360
So I did some heat
maps for Schweinsteiger

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.980
at Manchester United and
he had to stay-- this is

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.300
your position, Schweinsteiger.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.091
You stay here and pass
the ball over there,

00:41:06.091 --> 00:41:09.420
because that's the
structure that van Gaal has.

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:12.790
So you definitely see changes
in where they're allowed to do,

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:14.545
and those tend to
be instructions

00:41:14.545 --> 00:41:15.670
that come from the manager.

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:18.380
I think, rather than them
being confined to not being

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.109
able to play in the same way.

00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:20.650
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:24.150
AUDIENCE: Well, I
will ask one more.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:27.616
The weather, how much does that
play and effect different teams

00:41:27.616 --> 00:41:28.490
or different players?

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:29.280
Did you look at that?

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:29.433
DAVID SUMPTER: That's
a good question.

00:41:29.433 --> 00:41:30.820
No, I haven't looked at
that, have to be honest.

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:31.050
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:31.770
Next book.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:32.936
DAVID SUMPTER: Yes, exactly.

00:41:35.277 --> 00:41:36.485
AUDIENCE: Any more questions?

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:41.490
Yes.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:43.914
AUDIENCE: You know of the
Football Manager game?

00:41:43.914 --> 00:41:45.080
DAVID SUMPTER: I know of it.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:49.056
I started playing it, but
it was so incredibly boring.

00:41:49.056 --> 00:41:49.899
Sorry.

00:41:49.899 --> 00:41:50.440
I don't know.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.080
I had to, like-- I
started, I thought, ah,

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.140
I really have to get into this.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.340
And then it said, you
know, the youth team coach

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.350
wants to know this.

00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:00.562
It was like running
a real foot-- I mean,

00:42:00.562 --> 00:42:03.020
yeah if you played it, it was
like running a football team.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:06.230
Which is brilliant, but, you
know, I have a full-time job.

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:07.860
I'm trying to write
a football book,

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:09.844
going around, talking
to people like you.

00:42:09.844 --> 00:42:11.510
Unfortunately, I
didn't have enough time

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.170
to really sit down and play it.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:15.540
But it looks very realistic.

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:17.442
And I know-- yeah, I
mean to answer-- well,

00:42:17.442 --> 00:42:19.900
that wasn't your question, but
one really interesting thing

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.941
about "Football Manager"
is that it was bought up

00:42:21.941 --> 00:42:24.480
by Prozone or their
scouting system

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:30.010
because they send
people out to collect

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:31.010
in all this information.

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:33.860
So when you look at the
Liverpool under-15s team,

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.170
it is the Liverpool
under-15s team.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:38.897
They've collected them in
and somebody-- some amateurs

00:42:38.897 --> 00:42:40.230
have gone and watched the teams.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:43.250
There's an incredible data
collection network that

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:44.690
is inside "Football Manager."

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:47.170
It's really realistic
at that level.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.248
AUDIENCE: Just picking up
on Rob's question just now.

00:42:57.248 --> 00:43:00.920
Have you done any analysis on
home versus away advantages?

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:05.170
DAVID SUMPTER: There is home
versus away advantages still.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:09.200
It's been decreasing for
the last, like, 10 years,

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.200
but there still is.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:14.010
And there's not actually
a really solid explanation

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:14.730
of why it is.

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:18.250
One of it is pitch size,
for example, if you

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:19.420
train on a certain pitch.

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:22.780
There was this lovely thing
where Real Madrid went

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.550
through in the
Champions League-- I

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:27.569
can't remember who they had,
but they were two-nil down.

00:43:27.569 --> 00:43:28.610
It was Wolfsburg I think.

00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:30.790
They were two-nil
down on aggregate.

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:35.170
And they just made their
pitch 60 centimeters wider

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:37.310
on both sides, which,
when you do the maths,

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:40.110
is a lot wider in square meters.

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:42.120
And then they won three-nil
on the return visit.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:46.630
So you can make those small
adjustments to your tactics

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:48.600
based on the pitch you play in.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.488
And, yeah.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:57.640
AUDIENCE: So you coach your
son's football team, I believe.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.877
Has any of your research made
it into the tactics used there?

00:44:00.877 --> 00:44:01.710
DAVID SUMPTER: Yeah.

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:02.790
It has to some degree.

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:05.264
I mean, we're a bunch of
dads who do the coaching,

00:44:05.264 --> 00:44:06.430
and so I'm not the only one.

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:10.230
And they kind of-- but I do the
passing network stuff, and any

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:12.220
of you who coach kids
teams or anything,

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.210
you just need a piece of
paper with a formation

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:16.620
of the team written
on it and you can just

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.260
draw a line between
all the players

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.610
who are passing each other.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:22.430
And you can immediately-- and
then some things with shots

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:23.270
and so on.

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:25.926
This is statistics I
collect during the matches

00:44:25.926 --> 00:44:27.050
and then I show it to them.

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:30.370
I mean, OK, they're only 9 or
10, but they really love it.

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:35.070
And we do things like instead
of who scored the most goals,

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:38.070
it's like which pair of players
made the most successful passes

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:39.330
between the two of them.

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:41.020
And it's a great
way of encouraging

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.070
them to do teamwork.

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:43.320
And, I don't know.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.028
I don't like to boast,
but we're actually

00:44:45.028 --> 00:44:47.980
a very successful team.

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:53.750
And we won the district
championships last year.

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:57.480
So and that's-- I don't think
that's down to my soccermatical

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.330
skills, but it's a lot of
fun to try and put that stuff

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:03.460
into the game.

00:45:11.099 --> 00:45:11.640
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:12.436
Thanks.

00:45:12.436 --> 00:45:14.210
So tournaments
like the FA Cup are

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:17.570
known for being very surprising
and having a lot of shocks.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:20.984
How much of that do you think
is because premiership teams

00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:22.400
are playing lower
league teams who

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.920
have like incompatible networks
that they don't see often.

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:29.190
Or how much of it is just
due to some kind of magic

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:32.250
that you'll never be able
to statistically predict?

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:33.650
DAVID SUMPTER: Yeah.

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:36.000
Some of it is going to be
down to that sort of thing.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.130
But the thing you have
to start off remembering

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:40.490
is that 2/3 of
everything that happens

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:43.740
in a football match is
random in the outcome and 1/3

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:44.604
is down to skill.

00:45:44.604 --> 00:45:46.020
And you can think
of it like this.

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.980
So you have three goals
in the football match.

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:51.170
One of them goes to the best
team and then two of them

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:53.460
are spread randomly
between the two teams.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.910
And it's maybe it's
a bit more than one

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:58.100
maybe in an FA Cup
match, but there's always

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.990
that sort of random
chance that the teams are

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.980
going to go through.

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:04.150
So you're always going to have
one of those dream stories,

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:06.800
you know, the giant
killers or whatever.

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:09.120
And probably the
first thing to look at

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.870
is the random
explanation before you

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:14.140
start to look at any tactical
genius of these division

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:18.070
two trainers who have got
them up to that level.

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:19.934
But that's why you
want to have cups

00:46:19.934 --> 00:46:21.600
and you don't just
want to have leagues.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.570
But apart from this
season, leagues

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:26.190
have been extremely
predictable and cups always

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:28.310
throw up a bit
more of excitement

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:31.030
due to the randomness.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:32.246
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:46:32.246 --> 00:46:34.340
There is a chapter
on Ibrahimovic,

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:38.673
and did you find
an answer why he's

00:46:38.673 --> 00:46:40.420
so successful in
national leagues

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:44.150
and doesn't win anything in the
European level, even the club?

00:46:47.407 --> 00:46:48.990
DAVID SUMPTER: That's
a good question.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.650
No, I don't know
the answer to why.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:55.840
I mean, it might just be--
it's harder in the cups.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.070
I mean, it's the same with,
like, Pep Guardiola has

00:46:58.070 --> 00:46:59.640
got to the semifinal
of-- yeah, it's

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.620
this thing about Bayern
Munich, that he's

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:03.810
got to the semifinal
three times now

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:05.590
and hasn't won the
Champions League.

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:07.150
There is that
random factor which

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:09.020
just means that you
don't always go through.

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:13.500
So, yeah, Zlatan has gone
to the quarterfinals eight

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.980
times or something and
then not gone through.

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:17.870
So I don't know.

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:22.450
I wouldn't read
too much into that.

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:24.682
Well, I'm not a Swede but
I'm still proud of Zlatan,

00:47:24.682 --> 00:47:26.640
so I'm not going to say
anything bad about him.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.306
I would be very scared in case I
might meet him one day as well.

00:47:35.672 --> 00:47:37.380
AUDIENCE: I guess this
is kind of related

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:41.310
to your [INAUDIBLE] statistics
about your child's team.

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:46.580
But you showed an
eight-on-eight passing network

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:47.530
kind of real time.

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:49.987
How was that data collected
and could you kind of

00:47:49.987 --> 00:47:51.070
do that for your own team?

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:52.737
Is that professionally done?

00:47:52.737 --> 00:47:53.570
DAVID SUMPTER: Yeah.

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.790
So that was professionally done.

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:58.390
That was like
17-year-olds playing

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:00.890
and they were basically
collecting that data in order

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:02.350
to test the system.

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:08.500
And they put two or
three local GPSs on them

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.550
that can collect data very
locally and very accurately

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:14.250
on their feet and on
their body as well.

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:15.750
And so that technology exists.

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:17.590
It's not yet used in
the Premier League.

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:19.673
It was used in the Women's
World Cup, for example.

00:48:19.673 --> 00:48:24.230
They all had a very
accurate GPS on them.

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:26.860
And, yeah, so I did actually
try it with my son's team,

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:27.720
I have to admit.

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:31.542
We got some GPSs and
put them onto them

00:48:31.542 --> 00:48:32.750
and measured their movements.

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:34.660
But they weren't
accurate enough.

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:38.570
So if Google are interested
in funding a research project

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:41.750
on looking at player
movements, then I

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:44.380
have some very
willing volunteers

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:45.464
who'd like to be involved.

00:48:45.464 --> 00:48:47.338
SPEAKER 1: A 20% project
for someone perhaps.

00:48:47.338 --> 00:48:48.370
DAVID SUMPTER: Exactly.

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:50.760
SPEAKER 1: Please join me
and Peter in thanking David

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.510
very much.
