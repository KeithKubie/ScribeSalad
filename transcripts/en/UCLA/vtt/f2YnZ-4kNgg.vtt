I was born and raised in Torrance.
Yeah, my whole family's from Torrance.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.960
So it's the kind of a hometown feel and I
knew Torrance needed something like this.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.560
I was a sociology major but I got
into the entrepreneurship minor at Anderson.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.400
The entire program really
helped me develop something

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.400
that I wanted to build and make my own.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.320
A lot of people have never seen the
concept of rolled ice cream.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.720
Being able to watch your ice cream being made right
in front of you.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.320
It's really fun and they're excited so it makes me happy.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.960
UCLA has been a huge influence on me
and the fellow Bruins that come in here

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.400
is absolutely amazing and the love they
share for it.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.800
UCLA has played a huge part in creating
such an amazing shop and environment.
