a mind is a brain that's conscious

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949
a mind is a brain that's conscious
 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.590
a mind is a brain that's conscious
consciousness is a synonym for

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600
consciousness is a synonym for
 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.289
consciousness is a synonym for
subjectivity and there's a conceptual

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299
subjectivity and there's a conceptual
 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.960
subjectivity and there's a conceptual
gap between subjectivity and objective

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970
gap between subjectivity and objective
 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.000
gap between subjectivity and objective
observation which is what science is

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010
observation which is what science is
 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.770
observation which is what science is
I would actually maintain that there is

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780
I would actually maintain that there is
 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.049
I would actually maintain that there is
no scientific way to demonstrate that an

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059
no scientific way to demonstrate that an
 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.750
no scientific way to demonstrate that an
entity is conscious it's only apparent

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
entity is conscious it's only apparent
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.900
entity is conscious it's only apparent
to itself and my prediction is that we

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910
to itself and my prediction is that we
 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.410
to itself and my prediction is that we
will this is an objective prediction we

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420
will this is an objective prediction we
 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.900
will this is an objective prediction we
will come to accept entities that are

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910
will come to accept entities that are
 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.320
will come to accept entities that are
not biological as conscious it's not

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330
not biological as conscious it's not
 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.269
not biological as conscious it's not
going to be okay machines on the right

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
going to be okay machines on the right
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.670

side around humans on the left if you

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680
side around humans on the left if you
 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.560
side around humans on the left if you
talk to a biological human they're good

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570
talk to a biological human they're good
 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.840
talk to a biological human they're good
they will have lots of non-biological

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850
they will have lots of non-biological
 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.819
they will have lots of non-biological
processes going on in their body and

brain those computers will be out on the

brain those computers will be out on the
 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.830
brain those computers will be out on the
clouds so the thinking of that code

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
clouds so the thinking of that code
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.860

person isn't even just in their body and

it's out on the cloud so it's going to

it's out on the cloud so it's going to
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.860
it's out on the cloud so it's going to
be all mixed up it's not going to be
