1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,010
As a leader of a team, our business has
decided to terminate one of my people.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,850
I disagree with their logic, but I'm not
in a position to change the decision.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,110
What should I do to retain my influence
to support the rest of my team yet not

4
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:17,850
compromise my values? That's a good
question. That's a solid question.

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,530
That's a tough question.

6
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:24,460
It's a little bit tricky without the
details of the situation. But you know, I,

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,920
I wonder what kind of relationship that
did the person that asks a question,

8
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:32,010
I wonder what kind of relationship you
have with the senior leadership that

9
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:32,970
makes those decisions.

10
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:36,180
Cause you got to remember that our goal
is to always have the relationships up

11
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:39,210
the chain of command so that you
can influence those decisions.

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,640
And if you have that kind of relationship,

13
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,710
then you can find out why
that decision got made.

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,060
And there might be things
that you didn't know about,

15
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:53,061
some kind of strategic outcome that the
decision has had an out packed an impact

16
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,200
on. Right? So if you didn't know it,

17
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:59,370
but this guy had some kind of criminal
situation going on and you didn't know it,

18
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,030
then they can't talk about it cause he's
in legal cases. Okay. If you don't know,

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,730
don't speculate,
just go and ask.

20
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,120
And then you can take whatever those
reasons are and you can articulate them.

21
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,480
You know, down the chain of
command. And again, you want to,

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,620
you want to ask this question in a smart
way, university, why did bill get fired?

23
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:19,470
Hey, why did bill get fired?
No, you at, hey, you know,

24
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:21,900
from my perspective it seemed
like bill was doing a good job.

25
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:25,140
I want to kind of understand what you
were seeing so that I can lead people

26
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:27,360
better. If there's anything
that I could make up for,

27
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:29,880
I want to make sure I'm leading. You
know, like all those things you want to,

28
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,420
you want to help their ego and make
them feel good and make them feel like

29
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:35,640
you're on board with the program and not
make them feel like you're going there

30
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:38,290
and questioning their call because
that's just an attack on their ego.

31
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,540
So this is all these things. It's a
basic things, right? The fundamental,

32
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,600
he called it basic. These are the
fundamental things, right? This is the,

33
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,180
this is the way it is standard.
I should just say standard.

34
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:50,460
That's what I should
say. Standard stuff. You,

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,900
you're trying to build a relationship.

36
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,570
You don't want to go in but
your head up against their ego.

37
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,150
Then they get more defensive and next
thing you know they're going to fire

38
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,220
another one of your guys on
your team just to prove a point.

39
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,660
You can get yourself, you can dig yourself
that hole. But if you make your goal,

40
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:05,550
Hey, I'm going to build the
relationship with my boss,

41
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,670
that's what you are trying to do.
Now

42
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,040
if you find out why, then
you can articulate that to
the rest of the team and,

43
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,130
and the way that you maintain your values
is by maintaining your values. Okay,

44
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:24,180
so just because there's a situation
that a decision that gets made that you

45
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:27,360
don't agree with doesn't mean
that you compromise your values.

46
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,470
Like your boss can make a decision and
that does that, that you don't agree with.

47
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:34,800
That doesn't mean that your values are
compromised unless it's like an illegal

48
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:38,730
or it's an immoral or unethical situation,

49
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,910
which by the way of firing could
be one of those things, right?

50
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,560
The guy could be firing because he wasn't,
you know what wouldn't hae,

51
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:50,820
he wouldn't give me the
keys to the vehicle for the
weekend so I could use it on

52
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:55,470
my private time and I'm going to fire
him now, like that's unethical, right?

53
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,890
There's a problem there. So now your
values, definitely if you just silent Lee,

54
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,140
you're kind of compromising your values.

55
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,770
So there are times when you may have
to stand up, but bosses make decisions.

56
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:08,890
That's what they do and we do
our best to influence them.

57
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,890
Now if they decide something
we don't like, then yes,

58
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,620
we ask why and if we don't like it,
their explanation,

59
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:16,780
then we try and explain our case.

60
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:21,781
We try and explain why we thought
bill should have been not been fired.

61
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,320
Now you're not always going to be right.
You're not always going to be right.

62
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,340
And let me tell you something else.
Don't argue about six and one half dozen.

63
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:33,130
The other bill might've been on the
fence and they decided, you know what,

64
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,720
we've had enough trouble with bill.
We're getting rid of them.

65
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,600
And maybe there's valid reasons
why bill should have said,

66
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,730
but it's like it could have gone 60 40.

67
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,850
Are you going to put your reputation and
your relationship with your boss on the

68
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:46,810
line for over that little thing.
Now again,

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,440
I understand firing people is a big deal.
It's not small. It's not a little thing.

70
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,130
Especially you have a good relationship.
He's on your team, he's got kids,

71
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:58,270
you know, like all these things are there.
So what are you going to do about it?

72
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,640
Are you going to break down and,

73
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,700
and negatively impact your relationship
with your boss over this so that in the

74
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:07,930
future you have even less influence.

75
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,740
What happens when they go to fire Mike
and you haven't, and all you did was go,

76
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:13,000
hey, why'd you do this? This was stupid.

77
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,710
They're going to fire Mike and they're
not gonna listen to a damn thing.

78
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:18,730
You said you want to build a
relationship with them. Um,

79
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,510
you can,
you can explain what your viewpoint is.

80
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,900
And what you would have done.
Now this is like doubt.

81
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,260
This is talking to your team.

82
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:31,290
You can explain what your viewpoint
was and what you would have done,

83
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,210
but you also, you don't want to, you don't
want to, you want to be gentle, right?

84
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,010
As long as you explain,
if you explain that, hey,

85
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,440
I would've done something different.
And you also explained that the boss,

86
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:43,800
it was a tough decision and the boss made
the call and that the best thing that

87
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:48,360
we can do as a team is support the boss
so we can garner more influence over

88
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:50,700
these situations in the future.
That's good.

89
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:53,600
Yeah.

90
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,231
And you know what,

91
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:58,100
one of the best things you could do here
with your team is you can even explain

92
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:02,330
that it's your fault. The decision
got made, right? You say, look,

93
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,870
I haven't built a good enough
relationship with the boss.

94
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,720
That's why he fired bill. I'm working
on it. I'm going to do it better.

95
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,810
We're going to give them the support
that he needs so we can stop this thing

96
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,850
from half of this type of thing
from happening in the future.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,510
So you don't want to throw your
boss under the bus. It's much,

98
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:21,170
much better to take ownership
of it all day, all day.

99
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,500
If you throw your boss under the bus and
you create an antagonistic relationship,

100
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:25,430
it's bad for you.

101
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,250
It's bad for your boss and it's bad for
your team and it's bad for your whole

102
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:29,084
organization.

103
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,473
I get it.

104
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,510
And there's a dichotomy here because if
your boss totally fired someone with not

105
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:43,140
good reason and it was a great guy,
and if you just jump on board with a boss,

106
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,970
you're going to look weak. So do
you have to balance that? Yes.

107
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:50,500
You have to be honest with your people.
You have to explain what's going on.

108
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,620
And that's why I think taking ownership
is one of the best things to do.

109
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,650
Your boss does something that's
totally out of line. Hey look,

110
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,880
here's what the boss did.

111
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,620
This is my fault and here's
what I'm gonna do to fix it.

112
00:05:58,621 --> 00:06:00,560
I'm gonna build a better relationship.
I'm going to get more influence.

113
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,330
That's what I need to do.
I obviously let you guys down.

114
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:07,130
I'm not going to let it happen again.
That brings your team closer to you.

115
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,590
Yeah.

116
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,670
Rather than saying, Hey, the boss
was Boston idiot, he doesn't get it.

117
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,000
You gotta be, people don't actually
even respect that, by the way.

118
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,740
They don't actually even respect that.
Yeah. I'm not saying they say, hey,

119
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:23,470
that's the boss's decision, and that's,
you know what? We just support the boss.

120
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:26,920
I'm not saying that it's a dichotomy.
It's a balance that you have to,

121
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,810
you have to carefully walk,
compromise,

122
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,640
compromise on decisions and directions
in plants doesn't hurt. You know,

123
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:39,880
he's talking about compromising.
It's like you compromise is okay.

124
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,470
That's what it is. It's
compromise. Okay. Again,

125
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:48,910
as long as you're not compromising
your personal values, your ethics,

126
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,180
but compromising about a decision.
That's the way the world works.

127
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:57,430
Don't let your ego get into it.
Don't let your ego, so keep building,

128
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,630
keep building relationships.

129
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:01,510
Take ownership of the
decisions and support the team.

130
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,070
Keep building relationships,
not just up the chain of command,

131
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,330
but down so that you can
bring it all to gather.
