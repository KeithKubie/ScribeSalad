00:00:00.203 --> 00:00:01.381
- [Voiceover] g is a function

00:00:01.381 --> 00:00:03.873
that describes an arithmetic sequence.

00:00:03.873 --> 00:00:06.997
Here are the first few
terms of the sequence.

00:00:06.997 --> 00:00:08.589
So let's say the first term is four,

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:10.924
second term is 3 4/5,

00:00:10.924 --> 00:00:12.479
third term is 3 3/5,

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.587
fourth term is 3 2/5.

00:00:14.587 --> 00:00:17.674
Find the values of the
missing parameters A and B

00:00:17.674 --> 00:00:21.137
in the following recursive
definition of the sequence.

00:00:21.137 --> 00:00:22.469
So they say the nth term

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:24.444
is going to be equal to A

00:00:24.444 --> 00:00:26.245
if n is equal to one

00:00:26.245 --> 00:00:30.804
and it's going to be
equal to g of n minus one

00:00:30.804 --> 00:00:33.990
plus B if n is greater than one.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.199
And so I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:37.183
and see if you could figure out

00:00:37.183 --> 00:00:40.337
what A and B are going to be.

00:00:40.337 --> 00:00:41.509
Well, the first one to figure out,

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:44.041
A is actually pretty straightforward.

00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:45.732
If n is equal to one,

00:00:45.732 --> 00:00:47.183
if n is equal to one,

00:00:47.183 --> 00:00:50.457
the first term when n equals one is four.

00:00:50.457 --> 00:00:53.242
So A is equal to four.

00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:56.122
So we could write this as g of n

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:59.559
is equal to four

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.589
if n is equal to one.

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.532
And now let's think about the second line.

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:06.946
The second line is interesting.

00:01:06.946 --> 00:01:09.833
It's saying it's going to be
equal to the previous term,

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:11.511
g of n minus one.

00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:15.635
This means the n minus oneth term, plus B,

00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:17.937
will give you the nth term.

00:01:17.937 --> 00:01:18.979
Let's just think about what's happening

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.270
with this arithmetic sequence.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.892
When I go from the first
term to the second term,

00:01:22.892 --> 00:01:25.023
what have I done?

00:01:25.023 --> 00:01:27.720
Looks like I have subtracted 1/5,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.472
so minus 1/5,

00:01:29.472 --> 00:01:30.984
and then it's an arithmetic sequence

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:34.460
so I should subtract or add
the same amount to every time,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.127
and I am, I'm subtracting 1/5,

00:01:37.127 --> 00:01:40.964
and so I am subtracting 1/5.

00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:42.296
And so one way to think about it,

00:01:42.296 --> 00:01:43.937
if we were to go the other way,

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:48.365
we could say, for example, that g of four

00:01:48.365 --> 00:01:52.999
is equal to g of three

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:55.215
minus 1/5,

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:57.246
minus 1/5.

00:01:57.246 --> 00:01:58.485
You see that right over here.

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.593
g of three is this.

00:02:00.593 --> 00:02:04.512
You subtract 1/5, you get g of four.

00:02:04.512 --> 00:02:05.731
You see that right over there

00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:06.841
and of course I could have written this

00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:09.235
like g of four

00:02:09.235 --> 00:02:11.728
is equal to g of four

00:02:11.728 --> 00:02:14.998
minus one minus 1/5.

00:02:14.998 --> 00:02:16.016
So if you look at this way,

00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:18.651
you could see that if I'm
trying to find the nth term,

00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:21.153
it's gonna be the n minus oneth term

00:02:21.153 --> 00:02:23.534
plus negative 1/5,

00:02:23.534 --> 00:02:25.880
so B is negative 1/5.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.747
Once again, if I'm trying
to find the fourth term,

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:29.636
if n is equal to four,

00:02:29.636 --> 00:02:30.884
I'm not gonna use this first case

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.603
'cause this has to be for n equals one,

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:36.079
so if n equals four, I
would use the second case,

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.348
so then it would be g of four minus one,

00:02:38.348 --> 00:02:41.760
it would be g of three minus 1/5.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.373
And so we could say g of n

00:02:43.373 --> 00:02:46.873
is equal to g of n minus one,

00:02:46.873 --> 00:02:50.537
so the term right before that minus 1/5

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:53.506
if n is greater than one.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.138
But for the sake of this problem,

00:02:55.138 --> 00:02:59.993
we see that A is equal to four

00:02:59.993 --> 00:03:04.132
and B is equal to negative 1/5.
