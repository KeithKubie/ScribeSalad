00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.810
Cats.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.270
You know them, you love them.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.850
Or at least, I do.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.110
But whatever you feel about cats, they’re
a bit of a scientific mystery.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.340
No one is totally sure whether the common
house cat is really a domestic breed distinct

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.610
from its wild ancestors.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.249
Since the cat genome was first sequenced,
albeit incompletely, in 2007, we know all

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:29.330
cats can be traced back to the Near Eastern
wildcat that still lives in Israel, Saudi

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.289
Arabia, and other Middle Eastern countries.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.370
Now, a team of geneticists have taken their
love of cats to a whole new level.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.360
They studied DNA found in the remains of 209
ancient cats that lived between 15,000 years

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.470
ago and the 18th century.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.180
The results give some insight into how cats
conquered the world… before the Internet.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.020
Right off the bat, the team knew they had
something interesting on their hands.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.960
They found a 9,500 year old tomb in Cyprus
that contained cat remains alongside human

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.759
remains, and they also found remains in Egyptian
tombs from 6,000 years ago -- because those

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.560
Egyptians were really fond of felines!

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.760
The researchers expanded their study to include
cat remains found in burial sites across Europe,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.810
the Middle East and Africa.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.780
They focused specifically on mitochondrial
DNA.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.009
Unlike nuclear DNA that is found in the nucleus
of most cells, mitochondrial DNA is found

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.799
in sub-compartments outside the nucleus.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.060
And this type of DNA only contains genetic
information passed down from momma.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.069
In cats, the team found a mitochondrial lineage
between Middle Eastern wild cats and early

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.990
farming communities in the eastern Mediterranean,
so it looks like cats spread pretty easily

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.439
among early farming communities.

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.060
The team suspects they were probably drawn
by the mice who were in turn drawn to the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.689
farms by grain stores, and the humans probably
kept them around to manage the rodent population.

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.140
The same mitochondrial strain was also found
linking cats from Egypt between the 4th century

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.350
BCE and 4th century CE to cats in Bulgaria,
Turkey, and sub-Saharan Africa.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.069
So farm-based was one wave of cat expansion.

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:08.470
The second was by boat.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.739
Again, the mitochondrial DNA connection was
found in analyzed cat remains from a Viking

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.080
site in northern Germany.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.520
This suggests cats traveled the world with
sailors and Vikings for the same reason farmers

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.150
kept them around: to help keep rodent populations
in check.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.349
The full cat genome was only mapped in 2014,
and this study is the largest yet on ancient

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.750
cat DNA.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.379
Cat geneticists want to do further testing
with nuclear DNA to answer the lingering question

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.959
of cat domestic and wild cat interbreeding,
all in the name of helping us understand our

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:49.900
favourite furry friends.
