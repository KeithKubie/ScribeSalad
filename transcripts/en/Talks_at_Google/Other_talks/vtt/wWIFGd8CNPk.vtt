00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:07.120
Commentator: David is a world-renowned journalist
who started his career at the Washington Post,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.969
spending 4 years in Russia.

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:16.580
And since 1998, David has been the editor
of the New Yorker Magazine, and he has led

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.760
the New Yorker to receive more than 24 national
or international awards for excellence in

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.410
journalism, including Advertising Age's editor
of the year, which has been awarded to him.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.740
He has written a number of books. He is a
Pulitzer Prize winner; Polk award winner for

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.590
his book "Lenin's Tomb". He's also written
books known as "The Resurrection", "The Devil's

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.800
Problem: And Other True Stories", as well
as reporting, and King Of the World, about

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.720
Muhammad Ali. And his latest book is called
"The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barak Obama".

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.390
And David has put together here one of the
most comprehensive biographies and stories

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.670
of the rise of how this historic election
happened by really drawing on hundreds of

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.650
interviews of people who have been close colleagues
of the President's, who worked to get him

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.409
elected, and actually the President himself.
We're going to end the talk a little early

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.280
at 1:50. So there will be a little time for
book signings, and you can interact personally

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.280
with David afterwards. And for the Q&amp;A, at
the end, we'd like to ask everyone to use

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.060
the microphones so the Youtube and VC audiences
can participate. Please, help me welcome David

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.600
Remnick.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.140
[Applause]

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.980
David Remnick: Good afternoon. You in the
back.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.409
[Laughter]
Don't hit the doors, okay. Here's what I think

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.460
we should do. I'll talk about the book for
a while, but I swear to God I'm not going

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.670
to go on for half an hour. That seems a fruitless
enterprise, but I'd like to give you a sense

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.950
of what this book is because there's a book
that looms next to my book, it is called "Dreams

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.900
from My Father". And it's a reasonable question
to ask why somebody would attempt to write

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.009
a book about Barak Obama, very briefly into
his presidency, where, after all, we are only

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:19.110
about 15, 16 months into the presidency. What's
this all about? Well, the historical dimension

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.260
of Barak Obama's presidency, the most radical
thing about Barak Obama, is very simply something

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.230
we don't talk a hell of a lot about much anymore,
is the fact that he is the first African-American

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.510
president. And it is a remarkable fact of
history, a remarkable phenomenon in history

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.510
that we have a kind of mechanism of forgetting
some of the landmarks that have occurred very

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.690
quickly because we're so immersed in the subjects
of the here and the now. The subjects of health

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.550
care, the subjects of foreign affairs, the
subjects of financial regulation, and all

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.209
the things we're reading about on the front
pages of the newspaper. It's very hard to

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.069
live in the now and in history at the same
time and be very conscious of it.

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:09.210
Why is it called "The Bridge"? The Bridge
is the opening scene of the book, and it's

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.370
something that introduces the themes of Barak
Obama's career, and the themes of the candidacy

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:25.410
for the presidency. In 1965, very few will
remember necessarily, in 1965 in March there

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:33.019
was an enormously important landmark in the
civil rights movement. People in Selma, Alabama,

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:40.440
marched for voting rights or attempted to,
led by SNCC. John Lewis, who is now a congressman

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.620
in Georgia, and other leaders of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference tried to begin

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:54.930
a march across the state of Alabama from Selma,
which had been a real seat of the Confederacy,

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.780
to the state capital, Montgomery, where the
governor sits, and the governor of that time,

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.129
if you remember, was George Wallace. And on
the first attempt to make this march, the

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:12.580
demonstrators were met by a battalion of vigilantes
and police. And they were beaten near to death,

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.469
some of them. John Lewis' head was bashed
in from the instant they started the march

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:23.069
and many others were beaten and gassed and
hit by dogs, and all the rest of the iconic

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:29.910
and very real incidence of the civil rights
movement and moments of nonviolent resistance

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:40.789
met by violent actions of the police. Several
days later, the attempt to march from Selma

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:46.180
to Montgomery was successful. It was led by
Martin Luther King and other civil rights

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.249
leaders, including again John Lewis. And Lyndon
Johnson witnessed these spectacles -- both

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:56.781
of the violent ones and of the march itself
and enacted what we now know as the "Voting

00:04:56.781 --> 00:05:04.069
Rights Act". Remember, African-Americans in
the South, in places like Selma, Alabama,

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:09.400
in places in Georgia and Mississippi and all
the rest, effectively de facto did not have

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:17.619
the right to vote. They were thwarted by exams,
all kinds of poll taxes, all of sort of preventative

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:24.399
measures taken by the Southern leadership
in the aftermath of reconstruction that lasted

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:30.960
until the mid-60s. So that moment in our history,
now it seems to have receded in the past and

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:38.150
receded in memory, was enormously and powerfully
received by African-Americans in the mid-60s

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:45.050
and became a vital part of our history. And
every year since 1965, there's been a reenactment

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:54.999
of, a celebration of both the "Bloody Sunday",
the march, voting rights, and every year people

00:05:54.999 --> 00:06:00.249
gather led by John Lewis and other members
of the civil rights movement to commemorate

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:11.540
this incident. In March 2007, at yet another
annual convening of this movement, Barak Obama,

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.999
a newly minted presidential candidate, having
just announced in Springfield maybe 6 weeks

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:23.789
before came to Selma. In Springfield, he had
spoken to the entire nation, the metaphor

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:29.809
that he used was Abraham Lincoln. When he
came to Selma, the intention was to speak

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:36.460
directly to the African-American community.
He did not have the black vote by any means

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.969
wrapped up; in fact he was being outdistanced
by Hillary Clinton of course.

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:47.699
The Clintons have deep relations with the
black vote, with black leaders, with people

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.849
like John Lewis, and many, many other black
leaders throughout the country and for good

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:58.080
reason. Do you remember in the New Yorker
magazine, Toni Morrison had written many years

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.479
before that the first black president was,
in fact, Bill Clinton. She was kind of joking

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:08.270
around, but she kind of wasn't. She kind of
wasn't. That she thought, here was this guy

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.789
who was a white Southerner who, when it concerned
race, he got it.

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:20.139
And so Obama gave this incredibly adroit speech.
He gets up in front of-in Brown Chapel, which

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:27.240
is "the" Church where all the great civil
rights leaders including Malcolm X had spoken

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.929
the resonant place and behind him was John
Lewis, C. T. Vivian, Joseph Lowery, and any

00:07:32.929 --> 00:07:37.369
number of elders of the civil rights movement.
And he essentially turned to them and said,

00:07:37.369 --> 00:07:46.789
"I stand on the shoulders of giants. I am
here because of you. You are the great members

00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:50.849
of the Moses generation, and I pay tribute
to you and all of my generation of people

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:59.599
in their 30s and 40s and 50s pay tribute to
you. But you remember from your biblical history

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:04.219
that Moses doesn't get to see the Promised
Land. Moses gets to approach the Promised

00:08:04.219 --> 00:08:09.520
Land, look over and see the Promised Land,
but he is prevented from getting there. I,

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.750
Barak Obama, and the leader of the Joshua
Generation, and I am here because of you",

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:20.509
and it's an incredibly galling thing to do.
It's an incredibly ballsy thing to do, for

00:08:20.509 --> 00:08:25.889
a political candidate to do. And Barak Obama
among his many attributes, positive attributes,

00:08:25.889 --> 00:08:28.479
is not lacking for considerable sense of self.

00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:30.289
[Laughter]

00:08:30.289 --> 00:08:37.029
You don't run for president, and basically
say, I am the ideal person to lead the United

00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:42.310
States of America if not the free world and
lack for ego. And anybody who does and tries

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:47.540
to attempt it gets eaten up alive. In fact,
the presidents that we seem to have the most

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.850
contempt for sometimes are the ones that do
not have sufficient ego rather than too much

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:58.800
of it. Anyway, so he gives this speech. He
takes some poetic license with his own past.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.649
He suggests that somehow his own father got
to the United States, and received an American

00:09:03.649 --> 00:09:08.720
education, thanks to the Kennedys and tries
to draw a line between the Kennedy funding

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:15.290
of an airlift of Kenyan scholars and students.
Not quite true. The Kennedys kicked in money

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:20.529
after Obama had gotten to the United States.
But okay. But he tries to say to the black

00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:28.940
community, "It is true that my father is African,
and is not in the normal or normative line

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:34.560
from the slave generations. He is African
and my mother is white and I was raised in

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.430
a very particular and peculiar way, but I
am here for the same reason you are here.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:44.680
I am here and I'm an African American and
I'm here because of what these people sitting

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:50.810
behind me did. What they suffered, what they
went through, and all the rest." And the battle

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.240
commenced.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.490
The battle commenced -- the battle for the
black vote, because in this country in order

00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:04.100
to get the Democratic nomination for president,
the African-American vote is crucial. So on

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:11.920
the one hand, this book, "The Bridge", is
about Obama's thrust towards the presidency.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.240
On the other hand, it's about the social forces,
the historical forces that allowed him to

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:23.120
get there that made it possible. Things like
the history of Chicago politics. The history

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:29.889
of African American politics in this country.
Things like Jesse Jackson's campaign in 1984

00:10:29.889 --> 00:10:33.170
and 1988. There is no Barak Obama without
Jesse Jackson no matter what you may think

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:37.691
of Jesse Jackson, and some of you may have
clear memories of those campaigns and some

00:10:37.691 --> 00:10:44.079
foggier memories. There is no Barak Obama
without Jesse Jackson. In fact, Barak Obama

00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:47.620
is a Columbia University student who went
to see Jesse Jackson debate Mondale and the

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:54.329
rest in the campaign. And it's also about
Obama's uncanny ability to present himself

00:10:54.329 --> 00:11:02.339
as a bridge between and among groups of peoples
in this patchwork quilt of a country in a

00:11:02.339 --> 00:11:07.490
way that was absolutely unique. Barak Obama
did not become president because of his vast

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:13.949
legislative experience. Barak Obama did not
become president because of his uniqueness

00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:19.620
ideologically. His politics with the exception
of a couple of issues particularly Iraq was

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:25.629
almost indistinguishable from his opponents
in the Democratic ledger particularly Hillary

00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:31.001
Clinton. He did not become president of the
United States because he beat Hillary Clinton

00:11:31.001 --> 00:11:35.759
in the debates. Arguably, Hillary Clinton
probably won as many as 17 out of 18 of those

00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:43.620
debates depending on who's doing the watching.
He became President in some part because of

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:48.790
his ability to tell the story of his life
and his family's life and his view of the

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:54.990
world and make it emblematic of something
new. Emblematic of the urge for change that

00:11:54.990 --> 00:12:03.029
people were feeling out of what a lot of people
saw as the wreckage of the Bush presidency.

00:12:03.029 --> 00:12:08.620
So the book is very much a deeply reported
biography of Obama, which I'll talk about

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:15.222
in a second, but it's also the history of
the analysis of a storyteller. I don't mean

00:12:15.222 --> 00:12:22.389
a bullshit artist. But someone who's able
to tell his story and make it larger. And

00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:26.770
one of the ways that he was able to do this
before he ever entered big-time political

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:32.939
life was to write a memoir. And anybody here
read the memoir, "Dreams from My Father"?

00:12:32.939 --> 00:12:36.550
I mean it certainly sold a lot of copies,
and if we don't by reading whole, then we

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:42.819
know it by the way was filtered down into
speeches, campaign interviews, rhetoric, and

00:12:42.819 --> 00:12:50.050
all the rest. That "Dreams from My Father",
in a way, is the lodestar and the, the, the

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:55.410
raw materials of what we know is the Barak
Obama story. And it's told in a particular

00:12:55.410 --> 00:13:00.620
way. He's a young man. Here's the background
of this book. It's very interesting.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:07.790
Barak Obama is not a great high school student.
He's okay. He gets to Occidental, which is

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:15.019
a very good college. He does fine. He's a
"B" student. He transfers to Columbia he gets

00:13:15.019 --> 00:13:19.770
more serious, a little bit more monastic about
his life. A lot of long runs, this kind of

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:27.660
lonely life. Or a more serious life, say.
He's not a, he's not a monk by any stretch

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:33.800
of the imagination, but he gets more serious.
But still, he is not summa cum laude, all

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:40.899
star student. He becomes a community organizer
and he learns a lot from it. He certainly

00:13:40.899 --> 00:13:48.430
finds a home there. He finds a community.
He finds a greater sense of his depth as an

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:52.759
African-American, because in Hawaii you don't
get that because what few blacks live in Hawaii

00:13:52.759 --> 00:14:02.339
live on military bases, right. So where he
really gets a sense of himself in terms of

00:14:02.339 --> 00:14:09.939
ambition is at Harvard Law school. He becomes
the student of and the mentee of Laurence

00:14:09.939 --> 00:14:15.249
Tribe, a great constitutional scholar, of
Martha Minot is the kind of democratic legal

00:14:15.249 --> 00:14:22.999
scholar. He gets a lot more serious. It's
at that point in his life, and you've all

00:14:22.999 --> 00:14:28.819
experienced it, where you find your, if you
are lucky, you find your groove intellectually.

00:14:28.819 --> 00:14:36.569
And he finds it beyond measure. He becomes
a candidate for the Harvard Law Review presidency,

00:14:36.569 --> 00:14:41.760
and because he's not only a liberal and attracts
liberal votes, but because he seems like the

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.850
kind of person who listens to people with
opposing views, he attracts conservative votes

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:52.680
and he wins. It's not a liberal versus conservative
election for the Harvard Law Review presidency.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:58.059
It's one in which he faces another liberal
but the conservatives put him over the top.

00:14:58.059 --> 00:15:03.139
So, if you ever wonder why he has that habit
of mind and that sense of himself, as somebody

00:15:03.139 --> 00:15:09.019
who can do that, however impossible in the
United States Senate, that's partly where

00:15:09.019 --> 00:15:14.699
it comes from. So he becomes the first African-American
president of the Harvard Law Review, and the

00:15:14.699 --> 00:15:20.040
next morning there's a story in the New York
Times, there's a story in various other newspapers,

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.809
on the wire services, on television.

00:15:21.809 --> 00:15:27.740
He becomes a little bit of a star and he gets
a phone call from "big bad New York" from

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:32.809
a literary agent. "Why don't you write a book?"
And some of the publishers are intrigued,

00:15:32.809 --> 00:15:36.980
but they think, well, it must be the story
of somebody up from the ghetto, which Obama

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:41.369
had to laugh at, since he went to the fanciest
private school west of the Rocky Mountains

00:15:41.369 --> 00:15:49.620
at Punahou School in Honolulu. I mean he himself
was not rich but he certainly went to an incredibly,

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:59.180
let's just say, well-equipped and pretty fancy
prep school in Hawaii. No, he decides to write

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:05.050
a memoir not about civil rights law or about
anything academic he decides to write a memoir

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:11.779
of himself. Remember this is the 90s when
in American writing, the memoir exploded.

00:16:11.779 --> 00:16:19.749
There are all kinds of memoirs about being
one ethnic group or another. Memoirs about

00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:25.819
addiction and recovery. Memoirs about all
kinds of experiences, and the memoir even

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:33.589
more than the novel dominated at least a novelty
aspect of American literature. And Obama joins

00:16:33.589 --> 00:16:39.779
this stream. And he writes a young man's book
about becoming himself, about his absent father,

00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:45.440
coming to terms with this father who is far
less of a wonderful personality than he ever

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:53.339
would have imagined. This book is the rough
materials of what becomes the political narrative

00:16:53.339 --> 00:17:00.839
of Barak Obama. So that, at one point as I'm
telling the story of Obama's life and digging

00:17:00.839 --> 00:17:05.949
more deeply into it in a reportorial way than
anybody writing a memoir could, I stopped

00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:11.470
the narrative at that point and tried to analyze
what this book actually is. This book comes

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:19.750
out at the tradition of African-American memoir
writing that began in this country with 6000

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:26.199
slave narratives. You know, Frederick Douglas
and all the rest. It becomes in the tradition

00:17:26.199 --> 00:17:31.690
of the autobiography of Malcolm X, which Obama
read very, very carefully as a teenager or

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:37.161
Richard Wright or James Baldwin or Maya Angelou
or all these books that we know a lot about.

00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:46.570
Brent Staples for example. And the book is
a story about one's self. It's not fake but

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.730
it's crafted.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:52.230
He tells you the conditions of his book. "I'm
going to make up some names here and there;

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.280
I'm going to fool around with the story to
give it some shape." And it's written in 3

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:02.750
parts, and each part ends with Barak Obama
in tears. It's not something we usually associate

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:07.351
with Barak Obama. He's not usually the most
emotive guy in the history of American politics.

00:18:07.351 --> 00:18:12.390
He's known for his cool, more than he is for
his heat. But in this book, each part ends

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:17.750
with him in tears, whether it's because of
his coming to the church of Jeremiah Wright,

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:22.260
or because of his resolution about his feelings
about his father, or his wedding to Michelle

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:29.150
Obama on the south side of Chicago. It is
an emotional book far more than it is a political

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:38.590
book. It's a book about the, that very American
phenomenon of creating one's self, all right.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:47.120
I wrote a book about Bob Dylan about 10 years
ago, 12 years ago called "King of the World".

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.840
Not Bob Dylan about Muhammad Ali, excuse me.
[Laughter]

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:56.580
The future is now. Although Bob Dylan is an
even better example of this, or just as good

00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:00.990
of an example.
Muhammad Ali is a kid from segregated Louisville,

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:07.220
who's a good athlete. That's who he is. But
in order to create this thing called "Muhammad

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:12.020
Ali", he was Cassius Clay of course, he plucks
all sorts of things out of the cultural air,

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:17.929
and creates an identity for himself. He takes
the braggadocio of the professional wrestler

00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:24.070
Gorgeous George, the speed and style of Sugar
Ray Robinson, and on and on and on. And he

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:28.890
creates the Malcom X and Elijah Muhammad,
and he creates the thing called "Muhammad

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.731
Ali". This happens in American popular culture
all the time.

00:19:31.731 --> 00:19:38.570
Bob Dylan is a Jewish kid from the iron range
of Minnesota, named Robert Zimmerman. And

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:45.440
he takes what he's hearing on the radio Gene
Vincent, Hank Williams. I mean. Jewish kids

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.470
from Minnesota don't normally talk like this
[raspy voice.] They don't normally talk like

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:55.399
Muddy Waters crossed with Hank Williams. He
creates himself. He hitchhikes a ride to New

00:19:55.399 --> 00:20:01.059
York City, and he enters the bloodstream of
Gerde's Folk City. That's the story you know

00:20:01.059 --> 00:20:02.059
about him.

00:20:02.059 --> 00:20:10.649
Barak Obama, in a very similar American sense,
does a bit of self-creating himself. Sometimes

00:20:10.649 --> 00:20:16.960
when we hear him speaking, it sounds like
he's channeling the great black preachers

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:23.360
of mid-century. How did that happen via Honolulu
and Harvard Law school? He learned how to

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:28.620
do it. In other words, he is a shape shifter.
We all are in some ways, right. We talk a

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:34.280
certain way when we're with this group, and
a little bit different with this group. The

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:40.909
greatest orator in American history did it.
Martin Luther King Jr., easily the greatest

00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:47.070
orator that we can certainly in memory, would
go into one kind of audience and make reference

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:54.140
to Paul Tillich and Karl Barth and all the
great tradition of European theologians, and

00:20:54.140 --> 00:21:00.950
he'd go to a very different audience and it
was pretty down and dirty. Right? It was like

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:09.200
a small southern church, and he'd speak in
a different way but he was genuine. The reason

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.360
he was successful is that he was always himself.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:16.899
Barak Obama had to learn how to do that. This
is not anything natural; anymore than it's

00:21:16.899 --> 00:21:22.500
natural to become a great musician or great
athlete or great writer. Politics too has

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:33.080
its skill sets. And so Obama runs for State
Senate in 1996. That's the opening he finds,

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:38.860
and he's not very good at it. He's just okay.
But he's not running against anybody, and

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:43.720
he succeeds, and he gets into the State Senate.
And when he decides to run for Congress in

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:52.460
2000, he runs against a great active impiety.
He runs against Bobby Rush, former Black Panther

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:57.769
leader in the state of Illinois. Very popular,
not a great congressman, but very popular

00:21:57.769 --> 00:22:06.440
and Barak Obama gets his butt kicked. He is
beaten by more than two to one. And his wife

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:13.090
and his friends, many of them say to him,
"You know, enough. You are a very talented

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:17.929
guy, you could do well and good," which means
you could make some dough, "please thank you

00:22:17.929 --> 00:22:25.990
very much [laughter] and do good for the community".
He interviews to maybe lead one of the big

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:31.850
foundations in Chicago which had a salary
of $1 million in memberships and this, that,

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:34.970
and the other thing. It would have been a
pretty good life for Barak Obama, and he could

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:39.929
give away lots of money to kind of do good
organizations, the Woods Foundation. And he's

00:22:39.929 --> 00:22:44.580
in the interview and his hands start to shake.
He comes out of the interview and the head

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:49.780
of the board says, "You know, of course you
can have this job but you don't want to do

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.640
this."
And he said, "Thank God." His hands were shaking,

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:58.179
not because he was worried "if" he would get
it; he was worried "that" he would get it,

00:22:58.179 --> 00:23:02.340
and that he would quash his dreams forever
in politics.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:09.340
So, he gets a kind of promissory note from
his wife. One more chance, you can run for

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:17.580
Senate in 2004, and here's where every big
life in American politics, or any other realm,

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:22.789
that skill is involved, intelligence is involved,
timing is involved, but sometimes luck is

00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:31.300
really involved. And in the, try to look back
in this -- we look at this as if it were a

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:36.700
great political triumph that he wins the Senate
seat in 2004, but never forget the role of

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:43.970
good fortune, too. He runs in a crowded field
in the Democratic primary race. The leading

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:48.909
candidate, certainly the richest candidate,
is a guy who made a fortune in the financial

00:23:48.909 --> 00:23:55.470
services initially on blackjack named Blair
Hull. Blair Hull is kind of an empty suit

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:59.261
in terms of politics. He doesn't have much
to say about the issues. He's got a lot of

00:23:59.261 --> 00:24:04.389
dough, and he's spending it on buses and airplanes
and signs and commercials and he's in the

00:24:04.389 --> 00:24:10.039
lead. I mean, who's Barak Obama? He's a state
senator; nobody knows who he is, and he lost

00:24:10.039 --> 00:24:16.559
terribly in a congressional race. And it gets
down and dirty to the end. The Obama team

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:22.059
has not yet spent its money on media and what
happens? Blair Hull's divorce records are

00:24:22.059 --> 00:24:26.700
open, and let's just say that they're filled
with things that you would not want to have

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:33.880
aired in public. Namely, that he had hit his
wife, and threatened her and all kinds of

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.090
things that are disqualifying in American
politics, if we're lucky. And he just goes

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.159
down in flames.

00:24:39.159 --> 00:24:44.590
Obama wins the Democratic nomination. Now
he's going to a face a Republican that looks

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:50.519
very attractive. A kind of very good-looking
Kennedyesque, conservative named Jack Ryan,

00:24:50.519 --> 00:24:57.450
who made a fortune at Goldman Sachs. And he
is married or had been married to an actress

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:03.160
named Jeri Ryan. Wait for it... who's on...
you all know what she's on, right. She's on

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:08.950
Star Trek, wearing a Lycra suit. She's a cyborg,
is she? I think it's something like that.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:15.400
I knew you'd know. I knew you'd know. And
their divorce records get opened up, and that's

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:20.909
the end of Jack Ryan's campaign. Mention of
French sex clubs is not something that's going

00:25:20.909 --> 00:25:27.429
to lead you to a great Republican Party career.
So, Obama is now two sex scandals ahead in

00:25:27.429 --> 00:25:34.260
this Senate race, and he faces, who do the
Republicans come up with, does anybody remember

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:43.399
to face him? Alan Keyes, okay, who could not
beat a door if it were open. So by the time

00:25:43.399 --> 00:25:48.250
that candidacy was over and -- oh, I forgot
the other stroke of good luck.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:55.019
As he's campaigning, he gets a phone call
from Boston. "This is the John Kerry campaign.

00:25:55.019 --> 00:26:00.380
Would you like to give the keynote address
at the Democratic Convention in Boston? We

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.880
hear you are very good speaker, and we're
looking out to give the speech to somebody

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.190
young and upcoming." "Sure I'd like to give
that speech," and he gives the speech of a

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:14.350
lifetime that you, my guess is, everybody
in this room first heard of Barak Obama, unless

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:19.880
you are from Illinois, that night as you were
watching the convention. And he gave the speech

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:26.429
that made his career; it certainly launched
his career. So, good luck is also part of

00:26:26.429 --> 00:26:27.470
it.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:32.470
And finally, I'll just say this. In trying
to write a biography about Barak Obama, one

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:42.179
has to be careful of mythologies. Mythologies.
And right now mythology is about who Obama

00:26:42.179 --> 00:26:49.880
is, was, has been incredibly persists in American
life despite the best efforts of accurate

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:55.880
reporting. One of them I just got; I couldn't
believe it. I was speaking to another audience

00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:03.059
and the first question from the crowd was,
"Was Barak Obama really born in Honolulu?"

00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:09.960
So in modern politics, in modern campaigning,
and in the modern presidency there's no escaping

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:19.039
the persistence of rumor. There's no escaping
the persistence of scandalous insinuation,

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:25.580
especially when we live in an age of pervasive
media of the kind of media that we have, which

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:31.519
is all for the good, but it also has its flip
sides and when it comes to politics, this

00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:33.799
is one of the symptoms of the flip side of
it.

00:27:33.799 --> 00:27:39.590
So, I'll stop there. It gives you a very sketchy
view of what this book is which I hope is

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:46.909
a very deep biography that takes you from
birth in Honolulu, by the way, exactly as

00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:52.289
advertised, to the door of the White House.
After talking to hundreds of people around

00:27:52.289 --> 00:27:58.519
Obama, his friends, his enemies, his family
members, to Obama himself, and I hope you

00:27:58.519 --> 00:27:59.690
get a chance to take a peek at it.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:05.450
So if anybody has some questions or we can
have a conversation about him, I would be

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.270
thrilled to entertain it.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.289
[Inaudible]

00:28:08.289 --> 00:28:11.341
Sure, oh, that's right. There's a microphone
right there.

00:28:11.341 --> 00:28:15.580
Female Audience Member: So I understand you
spoke to Obama as part of your research.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.580
David: Mmm hmm.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.570
Female Audience Member: What kinds of things
did you ask him about or look for clarity

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:20.570
about when you spoke to him?

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:26.880
David: Well, the final interview was in the
Oval Office. And as you can imagine, interviews

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:34.460
in the Oval Office are-they have a more formal
feel than an interview on the fly in a hallway

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:41.159
over cup of coffee on the road. You are in
the Oval Office, which is a striking feeling.

00:28:41.159 --> 00:28:44.730
I'd never I'd never had... well I think maybe
I was on a tour once and saw it for 3 1/2

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:54.600
seconds, and it's like an Edgar Allan Poe
story. It's so quiet, you can hear the click-click-click

00:28:54.600 --> 00:29:01.409
of a grandfather clock and you've got a limited
time. And we talked in particular about the

00:29:01.409 --> 00:29:06.789
role of race in the campaign, which is a very
complicated subject. And all this is in the

00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:12.320
epilogue of the book. And we also talked about
some of what I was getting at the very end

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:18.899
here -- the persistence of ugliness of things
on the fringes. And Obama is, you know, he,

00:29:18.899 --> 00:29:24.559
he, both good, bad, and indifferent; he's
a very cool customer. He said, 'Look, I am

00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:31.990
perfectly aware,' and I'm paraphrasing here,
'that the combination of economic insecurity

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:38.279
for a lot of people, unemployment, all the
rest, coupled with the advent of a historical

00:29:38.279 --> 00:29:43.950
presidency -- the first African-American in
the presidency -- is going to create a lot

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:49.680
of anxiety and some other combustible especially
at its fringes. And this is the way he is

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:56.460
with everything. There's a certain kind of
almost preternatural unflappability, which

00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:00.600
he can, seems to confront everything at least
that's his public face. That's what it felt

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.690
like to me. I don't think, in other words,
if I were interviewing Bill Clinton in the

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:07.450
Oval Office, I would not have heard the grandfather
clock.

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:08.530
[Quiet laughter]

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:14.890
Female Audience Member #2: I was wondering
how one launches oneself out into this sort

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:19.620
of project. That is, I mean, your name is
already well known. So that would give you

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:25.360
some entrée with this project that might
not have been the case in your early projects,

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:31.690
but there are already a lot of... there's
books that Obama has written and there's all

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:35.010
this stuff on him. How did it come to be that
you put this…

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:39.681
David: You know what, it's a great question,
and I needed to prove that for myself. I was

00:30:39.681 --> 00:30:44.480
not actually, weirdly, I was not given pause
by the autobiography, because I know – Look,

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.530
there is an autobiography of Benjamin Franklin
and then there is Walter Isaacson's Benjamin

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:53.210
Franklin. They're entirely two different animals.
Autobiography is the story that you tell about

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:57.039
yourself and it's quite limited and his book
stops at politics. And after all why are we

00:30:57.039 --> 00:31:02.379
interested in him? In large measure because
of politics. There's no political races – there's

00:31:02.379 --> 00:31:08.400
no anything like that. It stops at him getting
married. Although we learn something about

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:14.309
his political instincts when he discusses
his career as a community organizer for example.

00:31:14.309 --> 00:31:17.870
But I had written a long piece for the New
Yorker that came out just after the election,

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:21.690
called "The Joshua Generation" that hit some
of the themes that I began with today. It

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:25.580
was very particularly about race in the election.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:31.279
Not long after, John Updike died, an important
writer not only in America but for our magazine,

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:35.320
and somebody I felt close to, and I felt enormous
gratitude toward, and there was no way I wasn't

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:40.750
going to go to this funeral which was in a
small town north of Boston. I went to the

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:45.110
funeral, and afterwards stayed in Cambridge
for a few days and talked with some of the

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:51.960
professors and colleagues that Obama had had
at Harvard University just to see what some

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:58.970
intensive interviewing and talking and feeling
around would yield. And if I felt that well

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:03.240
in fact, I already know this stuff, this sounds
very familiar, I'm not interested in pursuing

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:08.960
it, because a book is an investment of time,
energy, and all the rest. And I've got a day

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:13.620
job. I'm editing a magazine. And I need to
keep my eyes on that. So if I'm going to do

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.910
this, and I'm going to do very late nights
and very very early mornings and all the weekends

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:24.580
imaginable, I gotta want to do it. Books that
don't really want being done inevitably are

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:28.789
terrible books. They're dull books. They're
listless books. They reflect the disinterest

00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:33.270
of the author. And I wouldn't put myself in
that position, and ultimately I don't want

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:37.639
to put the reader in that position. And those
few days, followed up by some more interviewing,

00:32:37.639 --> 00:32:42.639
and the experiment of writing the chapter
or the early draft on the Harvard Law School

00:32:42.639 --> 00:32:45.870
business gave me the idea that, you know what,
I think I'm going to do this.

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:54.559
Male Audience Member: So Obama was raised
by a white mother and white grandparents and

00:32:54.559 --> 00:33:00.980
in generally very white areas in white schools.
And somewhere down the line became very involved

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:07.929
in black civil rights kinds of movements.
What do you think triggered that? From college

00:33:07.929 --> 00:33:09.140
or was it political expediency?

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:14.039
David: I don't think it was political expediency.
I think it's partly looking in the mirror;

00:33:14.039 --> 00:33:18.700
it's partly a search for who you are, and
this is why the father is such a haunting

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:24.790
figure to him, because he provides part of
his genetics. And whether he liked it or not,

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:29.711
part of the legacy that he had to struggle
to understand. And you know identity is a

00:33:29.711 --> 00:33:36.559
funny thing. Identity is partly given to you
by birth, by chromosomes. It's also something

00:33:36.559 --> 00:33:46.539
that you have a say in, right? Your parents
can be Orthodox Jews -- you can choose to

00:33:46.539 --> 00:33:52.179
not be that. You can't choose to be other
things, necessarily, very easily. You can't

00:33:52.179 --> 00:33:58.460
choose to be Japanese if you're an Orthodox
European Jew. But there's a range in which

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:03.090
you do have -- an identity, at least in part,
is something that you have a say in. And in

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:10.560
so far that he had a say in it, he pursued
an identity as an African-American. Now, a

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.670
lot of a -- most African-Americans don't have
to pursue anything. It's right there at the

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:19.020
kitchen table as well as right there genetically.
It's right there in the neighborhood. It's

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:24.760
right there in school. And so on. With Obama,
he had to go out and pursue it, and so he

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.760
did.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:30.810
Male Audience Member #2: You mentioned, rightly
so, that Obama was largely elected not on

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:33.140
a legislative background or at least a long
legislative background

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:34.140
David: Not very much.

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:38.780
Male Audience Member #2: But, so he was largely
elected then on his personal qualities and

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.050
visibility to shape the story as you put it.

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:46.570
David: And many other things. And certain
other talents, look he's not without, he was

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:52.700
in the U.S. Senate. He was a state senator.
There have been other presidents, previously,

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:57.450
that did not exactly have unbelievably long
careers. John Kennedy's one.

00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:01.870
Male Audience Member #2: I was just wondering
in your kind of...

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:05.860
David: I will say that I did reject, even
though I voted for him, and the magazine endorsed

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:10.810
him. I thought it was unfair for people to
dismiss the experience question as not on.

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:11.910
I think it was very much on.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:13.100
Male Audience Member #2: That wasn't what
I was trying to get at.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.100
David: Yeah.

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:18.290
Male Audience Member #2: What are the qualities
that served him so well in the campaign? His

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:21.440
ability to tell his story? And exhibit, uh,

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.540
David: I think also campaigning discipline.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.400
Male Audience Member #2: Male#2: But let what
were those qualities that maybe have not served

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.400
him so well as president?

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:39.020
David: Well, I think that he has to his chagrin
discovered that this habit of mind and emotions

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:45.160
and his belief in his capacity to reconcile
and square the circle all the time, comes

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:51.340
up against the hard reality of the nature
of the Senate and the Congress, the nature

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:56.220
foreign leaders who are not to be reconciled,
necessarily. I don't think he is naïve about

00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:00.470
this. I just think it's very different from
running a Harvard Law Review presidency than

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:07.180
it is to deal with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. But
I'm not suggesting that I knew it and he didn't.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:13.820
I'm just suggesting that it's, you know, and
also the old saying about politics is you

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:19.600
run in poetry and you govern in prose. And
this disappoints a lot of people, especially

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.750
a lot of young people whose first political
investment in their lives was an enthusiasm

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:30.980
for Obama and now they're sometimes disappointed
in this issue or that or one that compromise

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:34.120
or the other. Yes. We should take these two
and maybe wrap it up. Yeah.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.880
Male Audience Member #3: I want to first thank
you for coming,

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.880
David: My pleasure

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:43.190
Male Audience Member #3: and for writing this
book. And I wanted to ask you if your perception

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:50.860
of the Republican Party's reaction to Obama
and their obstructionism is in some way related

00:36:50.860 --> 00:37:00.370
to his ability to bridge gaps and to bridge
different groups together? And if it is something

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:07.280
that they really can't find a good way in
ideologically so they're finding different,

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.280
a more...

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:13.140
David: I think it's a variety. I think you
shouldn't make a cartoon of Republicans anymore

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:20.690
and then we make a cartoon of people maybe
you feel closer to politically. I think there's

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:31.200
sincere, earnest avenues of disagreement with
Obama on any number, all issues. I mean that's,

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:37.440
that's good, however you may disagree with
it. For example, on health care it is completely

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:42.800
legitimate to raise the issue of cost; it
is not legitimate to raise the issue of death

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:49.130
panels. So one thing does not always equal
the other. Okay?

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:52.150
Male Audience Member #3: Yes.

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:54.930
David: Alright. Listen, thank you for having
me. This was a great pleasure.

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:55.030
[Applause]
