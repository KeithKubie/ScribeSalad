00:00:00.602 --> 00:00:02.535
Voiceover: In all of our conversations

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.012
about demand curves so far,

00:00:04.012 --> 00:00:05.832
I've been generally talking about

00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:08.395
price driving quantities.

00:00:08.395 --> 00:00:10.267
So for example, we've been saying,

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:12.936
using say this demand curve right here

00:00:12.936 --> 00:00:14.607
for a new car in terms of how many

00:00:14.607 --> 00:00:16.562
would be sold per day,

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:18.422
we would say things like,

00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:21.342
"Well look, if we price
it at $60,000 per car,"

00:00:21.342 --> 00:00:22.671
this is in thousands of dollars.

00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:25.548
"If we price it at $60,000 per car,

00:00:25.548 --> 00:00:28.150
"we are going to sell one car.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.541
"If we price it at $50,000 a car,

00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:32.871
"we are going to sell two cars."

00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:34.711
The way that I've been talking about

00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:36.497
it is given a price,

00:00:36.497 --> 00:00:38.898
how many are we actually going to sell?

00:00:38.898 --> 00:00:40.390
What I want to do in this video

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.084
is think about it the other way around.

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:44.113
We're going to look at the
exact same demand curve,

00:00:44.113 --> 00:00:46.486
the exact same relationship
between price and quantity,

00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:47.967
but we're going to conceptualize

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:50.049
it in our heads in a
slightly different way.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:51.655
We're going to think about it in terms

00:00:51.655 --> 00:00:55.805
of quantity driving price.

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.055
To think of it that way,

00:00:57.055 --> 00:00:58.563
imagine that we are the producers

00:00:58.563 --> 00:01:01.403
of this given model of a new car.

00:01:01.403 --> 00:01:03.219
We go the other way.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.744
We don't say, "How many will we sell

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:06.266
"at a price of $60,000?"

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.398
Or, "How much will we sell
at a price of $50,000?"

00:01:08.398 --> 00:01:09.808
We'll go from the point of view

00:01:09.808 --> 00:01:12.000
of what if we only produce one car a week?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.001
If we only produced one car a week,

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.545
how much could we get for that car?

00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:18.943
Let's say somehow you're
able to figure that out.

00:01:18.943 --> 00:01:20.363
You're able to read people's minds

00:01:20.363 --> 00:01:22.030
or you have some type of a market study.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.601
When you ask that question you're like,

00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:26.977
"Look if you only allowed
one car to be sold each week,

00:01:26.977 --> 00:01:29.639
"you determine that in that week there

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:31.614
"is going to be somebody,

00:01:31.614 --> 00:01:32.920
"somebody's going to think that it's worth

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.488
"$60,000 to buy that car."

00:01:35.488 --> 00:01:37.489
That person, they're willingness to pay,

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:42.620
that person is going to be
willing to trade $60,000.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.030
They're going to be willing to forego

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.031
what else they could have bought

00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:50.271
for that $60,000 and
instead they want that car.

00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:53.494
Then you would plot that
point right over there.

00:01:53.494 --> 00:01:56.619
If you only had one unit, you
could sell it for $60,000.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.274
Now let's go, let's keeping
asking ourselves for more units.

00:02:00.274 --> 00:02:02.408
Let's say, what if we
wanted to sell two units?

00:02:02.408 --> 00:02:04.912
Well, if you wanted to sell two units,

00:02:04.912 --> 00:02:09.668
you could definitely sell
one unit for $60,000,

00:02:09.668 --> 00:02:11.741
assuming that you could
get that first person,

00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:14.153
but that second person,

00:02:14.153 --> 00:02:15.532
this might have been the person that

00:02:15.532 --> 00:02:17.236
just wants a car so
badly it just resonated

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:19.002
with them in some way.

00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:20.563
For that second unit,

00:02:20.563 --> 00:02:22.382
the second person who is
going to need to buy your car,

00:02:22.382 --> 00:02:25.079
might not be as excited about it.

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.082
That second person will only be willing

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:31.666
to forego $50,000.

00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:34.002
That second person would
be willing to forego 50.

00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:35.644
So if you wanted to sell two units,

00:02:35.644 --> 00:02:38.005
if you insist on selling two units,

00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:39.668
and if you're assuming you're going

00:02:39.668 --> 00:02:41.080
to give the same price for everyone.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.332
We'll talk about in the future

00:02:42.332 --> 00:02:43.206
how you might give different prices

00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:44.793
to different people.

00:02:44.793 --> 00:02:47.249
Assuming you want to give
the same price to everyone,

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:50.070
you're going to have to
sell your car for $50,000.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.401
Now clearly that first
person is definitely

00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:52.436
going to jump at it.

00:02:52.436 --> 00:02:54.398
They're going to be able
to get the car for more

00:02:54.398 --> 00:02:55.283
than they were willing to pay.

00:02:55.283 --> 00:02:57.558
More than what it was worth to them.

00:02:57.558 --> 00:03:00.068
More than the benefit for them,

00:03:00.068 --> 00:03:01.614
but if you want two people,

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:03.798
now you're going to have
to set this up for $50,000.

00:03:03.798 --> 00:03:05.135
Now the same logic.

00:03:05.135 --> 00:03:06.931
Now what if we want to sell three cars?

00:03:06.931 --> 00:03:09.295
What if we want to sell three cars a week?

00:03:09.295 --> 00:03:11.675
Well, if we price it at $50,000,

00:03:11.675 --> 00:03:13.464
we'll definitely get those first two,

00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:16.449
but the third person might not jump.

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:18.616
The third person isn't
going to be as excited

00:03:18.616 --> 00:03:21.498
about it or need it as
much as these first two.

00:03:21.498 --> 00:03:23.392
So you do a market study
or you're able to read

00:03:23.392 --> 00:03:24.798
people's minds.

00:03:24.798 --> 00:03:26.467
You're like, "Look the third person,

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:28.291
"for the market, the marginal benefit."

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:30.009
Let me write this word down.

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:32.081
The marginal benefit.

00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:35.673
The marginal benefit for the next unit,

00:03:35.673 --> 00:03:40.135
the next unit is going to be $40,000.

00:03:40.135 --> 00:03:41.618
To get that next buyer,

00:03:41.618 --> 00:03:42.663
and it could be multiple buyers

00:03:42.663 --> 00:03:43.735
buying each unit or it could be one buyer

00:03:43.735 --> 00:03:45.538
buying all of the units.

00:03:45.538 --> 00:03:47.777
Maybe it's some type of a
car rental company saying,

00:03:47.777 --> 00:03:49.782
"Oh, we don't need to get ... For three

00:03:49.782 --> 00:03:51.933
"of these cars I'm not as
excited about it anymore.

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:54.204
"My marginal benefit is lower."

00:03:54.204 --> 00:03:56.003
This is really the same marginal benefit

00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:58.991
that we talked about when
we talked about the PPF,

00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:00.599
the Production Possibilities Frontier.

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.900
In that, we talked
about it very explicitly

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.216
in terms of trade off,

00:04:04.216 --> 00:04:05.544
in terms of opportunity cost.

00:04:05.544 --> 00:04:07.534
Here we're measuring the marginal benefit

00:04:07.534 --> 00:04:09.414
in terms of price,

00:04:09.414 --> 00:04:12.163
but price really can be viewed
as a foregone opportunity.

00:04:12.163 --> 00:04:14.555
If you spend $40,000 on this car,

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:16.551
you're making the decision
not to spend $40,000

00:04:16.551 --> 00:04:18.332
on something else.

00:04:18.332 --> 00:04:20.277
A down payment on a house or a nice boat,

00:04:20.277 --> 00:04:21.960
or whatever else it might be.

00:04:22.007 --> 00:04:23.880
So really what we're doing,

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.968
is at any point in this curve,

00:04:24.968 --> 00:04:26.736
this really is the marginal benefit

00:04:26.736 --> 00:04:28.313
for that next buyer.

00:04:28.313 --> 00:04:30.534
That marginal benefit to the market

00:04:30.534 --> 00:04:35.353
of that next unit of
whatever you are producing.

00:04:35.353 --> 00:04:38.537
This is a very different way of viewing

00:04:38.537 --> 00:04:39.789
the exact same demand curve.

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.685
Before we said, "Okay, if we want to price

00:04:41.685 --> 00:04:44.000
"it at $50,000, how many
are we going to sell?"

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.935
Now we're saying, "If we
want to sell only two units,

00:04:46.935 --> 00:04:48.686
"where can we price it?"

00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:50.761
We can price it at $50,000.

00:04:50.761 --> 00:04:53.004
If we want to go from two to three units,

00:04:53.004 --> 00:04:54.489
we're going to have to price it

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:57.609
at the marginal benefit of that third unit

00:04:57.609 --> 00:04:59.465
to the market and it could be the marginal

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:01.272
benefit to that next consumer.

00:05:01.272 --> 00:05:02.744
Convincing that next consumer to say,

00:05:02.744 --> 00:05:04.333
"Hey it is worth it to buy this car.

00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:06.557
"Let's price it at $40,000."

00:05:06.557 --> 00:05:08.664
I'm going to leave you
there in this video,

00:05:08.664 --> 00:05:10.074
but what I'm going to think about

00:05:10.074 --> 00:05:11.836
is depending on where you price it,

00:05:11.836 --> 00:05:14.641
let's say that we decide that we
want to sell four units every week.

00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:16.950
So we say, "Well look, to get that fourth

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.546
"person to buy this car,
we have to price the car

00:05:20.546 --> 00:05:22.809
"at $30,000."

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:23.971
What we're going to talk about in the next

00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:25.445
video is if you did that,

00:05:25.445 --> 00:05:26.761
if this is where you decide to price it

00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:28.764
so that you can sell four units,

00:05:28.764 --> 00:05:31.077
these other people got really good deals.

00:05:31.077 --> 00:05:33.236
The first unit could
have gone for much more.

00:05:33.236 --> 00:05:34.580
The second unit could have still also

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.951
gone for a good bit,

00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:37.157
not as much as the first unit.

00:05:37.157 --> 00:05:38.521
The third unit could
have gone for a little

00:05:38.521 --> 00:05:39.589
bit less than the second unit,

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.575
but still more than what you
ended up selling things for.

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:44.692
We're going to talk about this idea

00:05:44.692 --> 00:05:46.534
right over here that some of these

00:05:46.534 --> 00:05:48.864
consumers are getting more for their money

00:05:48.864 --> 00:05:50.233
than what they have to pay,

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:53.000
or at least in their own minds they are.
