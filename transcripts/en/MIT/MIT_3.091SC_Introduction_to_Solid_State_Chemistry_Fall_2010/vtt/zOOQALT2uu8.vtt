00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.980
PROFESSOR: OK, OK.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.810
Settle down, settle down.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.310
All right.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.480
Today is the last lecture.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.240
You think you're happy?

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.780
I'm happy.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.700
So what I'm going to do, I'm
going to teach for a little

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.890
bit, wrap it up, and then I've
got some comments about the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.070
final exam, and then some
personal observations,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.120
reflections on the class.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.290
So of course, the main
announcement is the upcoming

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.450
celebration of celebrations,
a week from yesterday.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.860
The final exam will
be Tuesday, 15

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.390
December, 9:00 to noon.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.140
I know 9:00 a.m. is kind of
early for some of you.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.460
Use the buddy system.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.010
Get to that room on time.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.030
9:00 to noon in the Johnson
Athletic Center.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.880
I'll have office hours on
Monday, 3:00 to 5:00, and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.940
Hilary will find a room.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.950
We'll post it, and you can
swing by, if you want.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.510
I guess the other thing I should
say is just a reminder

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.010
about the course evals.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.250
Please take a few minutes and
fill out the course evals, if

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.600
not for me and for your
successors, but certainly for

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.570
our TAs, so that I can write
nice things about them when

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.070
the time comes.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.150
So last day we looked at
binary phase diagrams.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.560
And we looked at two
different types of

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.910
binary phase diagrams.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.190
Type one, which is the
lenticular, and type two,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.100
which is synclinal, and in both
instances, we came upon

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.410
two-phase regimes, and when p
equals 2, that causes you to

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.200
start thinking along the lines
of phase separation.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.840
Phase separation then
invokes a tie line.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.910
The tie line tells you the
composition of the two phases

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.920
present, and the lever rule
tells you the relative

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.510
quantities, the relative
amounts, of

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.740
the two phases present.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.290
What I want to do today is talk
about the last type of

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.290
phase diagram that we'll speak
about in 3091, and that's

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.220
called type three.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.000
I came up with these
very original,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.860
easy to remember labels.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.600
So type three.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.870
What characterizes type
three phase diagrams?

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:43.980
Well, we have partial solubility
of A and B. We're

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.700
doing all of this.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.950
A is one of the components, and
B is the other component.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.600
So partial solubility of A and
B, and change of state.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.730
And the result of this set of
characteristics is freezing

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.510
point depression of
both components.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.570
And that's different from the
situation in type one.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:27.950
In type one, you see, if we
have B on the right, then

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.980
adding at A to B, if this is
pure B over here, and this is

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.270
pure A over here, adding A
to B causes the freezing

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.510
point of B to fall.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.790
But adding B to A causes the
freezing point of A to rise.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.870
In this type three, we're going
to have freezing point

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.820
depression of both B and A.
That's the difference between

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.780
the type one and type three.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.970
And actually, I'm going
to approach this by a

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.230
hybridization of sorts.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.260
So I'm going to consider
type three a hybrid.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.910
It's a hybrid diagram of the
lens and the syncline.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.400
I'm going to blend the lens and
the syncline, and show you

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.250
how to do that.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.470
So let me get one of those
up here, so that

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.970
we can look at it.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.990
So what I'm going to do
here, this is a great

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.990
diagram to look at.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.110
It's gold nickel.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.340
And at the top, we have a type
one, and at the bottom, we

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.220
have a type two.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.460
And what I'm going to do, is
I'm going to mix them.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.690
I'm going to hybridize them.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.710
I'm going to bring this
bottom one up and have

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.650
it touch the lens.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.886
And so we get is something
that looks like this.

00:04:41.886 --> 00:04:46.690
We'll plot temperature
versus composition.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.450
Left--

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.960
so here's temperature.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.140
Composition.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.450
On the left I have pure A and
on the right I have pure B.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:00.540
And we'll start here with the
melting point of pure B. And

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.400
when I add A to B, I'm going to
get the depression that we

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.420
see in the type one diagram.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.820
We want to start off like this,
and use everything we've

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.910
learned up until now.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.640
So up here, we have
all liquid.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.430
This is all liquid.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.770
And over here, this is
a solid solution.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.560
This is pure B, and this
is B that has a

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.980
little bit of A in it.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.190
So we're going to use the old
metallurgical definition and

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.570
call this beta.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.940
Beta meaning, beta is a solution
of A and B, but it's

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.980
very rich in B. It's almost pure
B. So I'm going to call

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:46.700
this a B-rich solid solution
of A and B.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.490
And we know from last day, you
can't go from p equals 1,

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.380
let's get those labels up here,
you can't go from p

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.870
equals 1 to another p equals
1 without going

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.080
through a p equals 2.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.610
So this is single phase and this
is single phase, and that

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.410
means this one here must
be two phrase.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.730
And what are the two phases?

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.490
The two phases are the phases
that are on either side.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.630
So this must be liquid
plus beta in here.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.400
And that means--

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.610
phase rule-- p equals 2,
tie line, lever rule.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.000
So that's what's going
on in there.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.020
And then the difference is,
on this side, if this is t

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.140
melting point of A we're going
to start off with the same

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.380
concept here.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.090
That we're going to get freezing
point depression of

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.620
A, as well.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.500
So we'll have the liquid.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.580
Over here we'll have
an A-rich solution.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.300
So then I'm going to
call that alpha.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:51.140
So alpha is an A-rich solid
solution of A and B. And then

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.080
that must mean that in
between here, we

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.460
have liquid plus alpha.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.865
And these keep going.

00:06:57.865 --> 00:07:00.640
And in addition, down at the
low end, I'm going to start

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.480
with a syncline.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.220
I'm going to start with a
syncline, coming up like so,

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.650
and coming up like so.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.550
See what I'm doing?

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.610
I'm taking the lens.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.260
I'm going to meet
the syncline.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.990
So what's here?

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.160
This is alpha, this is beta.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.660
What's inside the syncline?

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.780
This is miscibility gap, so
this is alpha plus beta.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.860
So let's keep the phase
labeling here.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.910
This is p equals 2.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.850
And look at how things have
worked out so nicely.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:40.040
p equals 1, p equals 2, p equals
1, p equals 2, p equals

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.240
1, p equals 2.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.895
So nice.

00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:45.420
And what happens when
all this intersects?

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.790
It intersects like so.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.790
Try to do this, stretch
it a little bit.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.390
So these two lines connect.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.370
They cross at this point.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.000
They touch at this point,
the don't cross.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.100
They just touch.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.430
And then this arc comes up like
so, this comes down like

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:09.923
so, and now we have a line
across here, and this comes

00:08:09.923 --> 00:08:11.400
down like so.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:11.820
OK?

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:18.970
So the syncline stops at this
value, which is the minimum

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.330
temperature dictated by
the two liquidus.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.900
We have a liquidus here and a
liquidus here, and this gets

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.060
you down to the lowest
temperature.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:32.090
And let's look at the phase mix
going in this direction.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:38.430
p equals 1, p equals 2, p
equals 1, p equals 2.

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:40.730
What's happening at
this point here?

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.320
This point, we have three
phases in equilibrium.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.910
We have liquid, alpha,
and beta.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.510
And this is the special
point here.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.080
This is called the eutectic.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.080
This is the eutectic, which is
the temperature at which we

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.480
get liquid, all liquid,
at the lowest value.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.570
So I'm going to call this here,
I'm going to call this

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.020
point e, and e is
the eutectic.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.610
Lowest melting point
on the diagram.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:17.480
Comes from the Greek, meaning
easy melting.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.120
And at the eutectic, eutectic
is special.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.170
Here we have p equals 3.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.040
It's a triple point.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.290
The eutectic is a
triple point.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.740
OK.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.550
So now let's take a look
at some of the

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.830
examples of such diagrams.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.320
All right?

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.510
This is a good one now that
winter is upon us.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.640
This is the antifreeze
diagram.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.970
So on the left, I have pure
water, and on the right, I

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.840
have pure ethylene glycol.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.550
And as you can see, if you add
glycol to water, you get

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.010
freezing point depression.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.430
If you add water to glycol,
you get freezing point

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.990
depression with a eutectic here
at roughly two-thirds.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.480
This is in volume percent,
because that's practical unit.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.300
When you mix glycol with water,
you do so by volume,

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.830
not by mass, or certainly
not by moles.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:12.310
So if you mix two glycol with
one part water, you'll end up

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.040
with a eutectic of minus 69
degrees C, or minus 92

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.050
Fahrenheit.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.250
So that ought to take care
of your driving needs.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.260
All right?

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.230
Now practically speaking, we
put an equal volume mix.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.110
So it's about a 50-50
glycol-water mix.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:31.420
And that gives you liquidus
depression down to about not

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.370
quite minus 40.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.940
It's about minus 35 Fahrenheit,
which ought to

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.630
take care of most peoples'
driving needs.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:41.340
Remember, what we're trying to
do is to prevent the liquid in

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.280
the engine block
from freezing.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.860
because if it does freeze, you
know that ice has a larger

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.950
volume than water, and that
energy is so great that you'll

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.880
crack the engine block.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.100
So you have to prevent it from
freezing, the water from

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.160
freezing, and so you
add the glycol.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.730
If, by chance, the temperature
dropped to minus 50, you'd

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.550
still be OK, because you'd
be in the slush

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.240
zone, two-phase regime.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.610
You'd have some water
ice forming, but

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.010
you'd still have slush.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.370
And by the way, why does this
not look like this?

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:16.450
It turns out that the amount of
solid solution behavior of

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.020
a glycol in water is
vanishingly small.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.990
So this point is slammed
up over here.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:24.790
So that's why you don't see the
right side of the lens.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.950
And likewise, on the other
side, the amount of water

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.870
that's soluble in glycol
is vanishingly small.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.350
So according to this scale, you
don't see the beta or the

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:36.530
alpha phases here.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:40.100
It looks like it's pure, but
it can't be, because of the

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.290
phase rule here.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:47.490
Now, you might say, well, why
don't we run pure glycol?

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.700
Because somebody might say,
I'll just run pure glycol.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.020
Well, here's the problem with
running pure glycol.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.710
First of all, if you get beyond
two-thirds, the melting

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:56.980
point rises.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.740
But then you could say, well,
but pure glycol, the solid

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.220
glycol, has a smaller volume
than liquid glycol, so it

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.730
wouldn't freeze and crack
the engine block.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.910
But there's another problem
here, and that is that the

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.500
viscosity of water is 1 in these
units, centipoise, and

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.950
glycol is 21.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.050
So you'd probably burn out your
water pump by running

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.230
pure glycol, because it's so
viscous, the water pump is

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.480
going to be fatigued
by running.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.530
And here's the point.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:31.330
This is the 50-50, minus
37 degrees Celsius.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.080
OK.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.940
And so what I've done, is I've
superimposed the solid-liquid

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.870
diagrams with the liquid
vapor diagram.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.190
And this is one of the times
when nature is kind.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:43.220
So when you add glycol to water,
water is on the left

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.590
here, as you add glycol to
water, you get freezing point

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.010
depression, and you get boiling
point elevation.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:54.470
So adding glycol to water opens
up the liquid range.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.810
You want to stave off boiling,
because boiling will cause

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.760
lousy cooling, and the engine
will overheat, and you want to

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.730
stave off freezing, which will
cause the ice to form and

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.720
crack the engine block,
and you get both.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.250
Then you put the pressure cap,
and then jump this up to about

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.530
265 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.370
So this is a very good example
of management of the

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.040
properties of the coolant
through chemical change.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.810
And the binary phase diagram
eutectic type is a critical

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.580
piece here.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.410
Again, apropos of the weather,
if you get ice on the

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.210
sidewalks, if this rain freezes,
it's terrible here.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.110
Those of you who are in the
Northeast for the first time,

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.930
this is bad.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.910
Not with what you see now, but
when this freezes, it's a

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.580
skating rink, and you
can't see it.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.220
It's black ice.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.190
You're walking along, next
thing you're on your--

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.960
you're in the horizontal
position, all right?

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.250
So we can add sodium chloride
to water, and when we do, we

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.580
cause this, a eutectic type
diagram, which can give you

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.460
freezing point depression and
prevent ice formation, and if

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.680
you get enough sodium chloride
in, you can get the

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.290
temperature down to minus
21 degrees Celsius.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:01.650
And I've color coded
all of these.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.790
This is the liquidus, this is
the solidus, and then this

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.570
line here, I can't remember if
we gave it a name last day,

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.540
this is called solvus.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:11.630
This is the solvus.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.940
This is, we know, liquidus.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:20.530
This is liquidus, and this
one here is solidus.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:21.700
Yeah.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.420
OK.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.900
So this is all color coded.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.730
And notice that minus 21 Celsius
is not too different

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.790
from 0 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.410
Turns out, that's how the
Fahrenheit scale was born.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.620
Daniel Fahrenheit was a
glassblower in Leyden who also

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:41.410
made exquisitely accurate
mercury thermometers.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.800
And he used ammonium chloride,
not sodium chloride.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.190
And the lowest temperature he
could get for all liquid with

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:53.900
ammonium chloride, he pegged
as 0 on his scale.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.220
And it's roughly this.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.090
It's a little bit different,
but you can see the

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:58.210
similarity.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.600
Now, you need two points
to define a scale.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.860
So he took this mercury in bulb
thermometer, put it in

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.270
the eutectic mixture of ammonium
chloride and water,

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:10.670
said, that's zero, calls in his
wife, tucks the mercury in

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:15.290
bulb thermometer under her
armpit, and says, that's 96.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.130
And that's the birth of
the Fahrenheit scale.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:21.100
And that's why we have water
freezes at 32, and it boils at

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.780
212, and all the
other nonsense.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.860
You know, it's 98.6, but here
it's a little bit colder.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.630
Now, why he chose 96 and 100
instead of 100 or something,

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.060
you know, you could read
in the history.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.630
Maybe he wanted something
that was a power of two.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.520
I don't know what the reason for
it was, but that's why we

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.540
have the Fahrenheit scale.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.270
OK.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.650
Now, maybe you're a little bit
hypertensive, so you don't

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.190
want to throw sodium chloride
on your walk, so you can put

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:47.180
potassium chloride.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.660
But you won't get much of a
freezing point depression, And

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.110
point of fact, we usually salt
our roads with calcium

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.930
chloride, which gives
you two advantages.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.380
Number one, very, very
low eutectic.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.480
Number two, it's a lot cheaper
than anything else.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.110
So it's the cheapest one to use,
and that's why we use it.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.120
Christmas is coming, and I told
you that phase diagrams

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.970
would save the day.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:12.180
We saw that the cubic zirconia
was stable in pure zirconia

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.710
only at temperatures above
2000 centigrade, which is

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:20.240
useless for a ring, or other
such pieces of jewelry.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:25.270
But by the addition of calcium
oxide, we stabilize the cubic

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:29.110
form of zirconia all the way
down to room temperature.

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.130
And now we've got the high index
of refraction, clear,

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.890
colorless gemstone that
passes for diamond.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.010
Poor man's diamond.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.430
Cubic zirconia.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.870
And you can see in
this regime here.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.220
And notice that cubic
zirconia--

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.440
here's a eutectic.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.880
Why I'm showing you this is
that the zirconia- calcia

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.230
system ultimately becomes
eutectic.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:53.390
And the eutectic is at about
2300 degrees C. But over here

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.610
is the solid solution.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.510
Notice, if it's a solid
solution, that means

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:58.800
it's p equals 1.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.890
Single phase.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:00.620
As it must be.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.580
If it were two phase,
the gemstone

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.540
would be frosty, right?

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.460
You'd have all those internal
surfaces, and they'd be

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.700
reflecting.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.520
So this is clear
and colorless.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.960
And what's it bounded
by, this region?

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.830
Cubic zirconia plus
calcium zirconate.

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:20.890
So p equals 1, single-phase
field, p equals

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.700
2, dual-phase field.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.170
And what's on the other side?

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:28.410
Over here it's tetragonal solid
solution, single phase.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:31.270
Here's tetragonal solid
solution with cubic

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.710
zirconia, two phase.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:34.960
Here's cubic zirconia,
one phase.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.440
Here's cubic zirconia with
calcium zirconate.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.180
Two phase.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.300
Same concept here. p equals
1, p equals 2. p

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.140
equals 1, p equals 2.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:43.690
OK.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:44.290
So now you know.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:45.920
When you go in jewelry
store, ask the guy,

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.310
is it single phase?

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.660
He'll say, get out of here.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.110
Actually, you know
how they test?

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:54.220
The index of refraction is
so high with zirconia.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.680
It's a little bit less
than diamond.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.260
Diamond's up around three.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.640
Cubic zirconia is over two.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.820
One of the ways they test is,
diamond has a very high band

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.840
gap, about 5.5 electron volts.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.560
But it's got the remarkable
property, even though it's an

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:14.000
electronic insulator, it's a
very good thermal conductor.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.970
Most materials that are poor
conductors of electricity are

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.410
poor conductors of heat.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.270
But diamond, for reasons I can't
explain with just the

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:26.810
utility of a 3091 education, has
a good phonon transmission

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:27.750
properties.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.440
And the way they tell cubic
zirconia from diamond, is they

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.000
actually put a couple of tips
on either side of the stone,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.040
and they heat one tip, and
measure the time lag for the

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.510
thermal wave to get
to the other tip.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.290
And if it's cubic zirconia, it
takes a long time, because

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:46.890
cubic zirconia is
an insulator.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.430
If it's diamond, it's almost
like metallic conduction.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.230
And that's how they
can tell a fake

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.480
diamond from a real diamond.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.420
Here's, you know, I've
been drinking from

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.230
these cans all semester.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:03.270
And this is the alloy system,
aluminum magnesium.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.430
So we put about 1% magnesium
into the aluminum.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.070
So here's pure aluminum
over here.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.170
It goes down to eutectic.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:11.410
This is pure magnesium
over here.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.530
They both melt at roughly
the same temperature.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.920
And by putting about 1%
magnesium in here, it changes

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.980
the metallurgical properties
favorably.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.200
Notice we don't want to put 4%
or 5% magnesium in here.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.730
Otherwise, as we get down to
room temperature, we'll enter

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.290
a two-phase regime,
and that means we

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:28.320
won't be able to process.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:33.310
Because this can is made from
a single sheet of aluminum.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.370
The body of the can.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.140
There's two pieces, the
top and the body.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.510
There's no third bottom here.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:41.990
Start with a flat sheet of
aluminum and it's punched

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.530
deep, drawn down, up,
down, and it gives

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:45.950
you the whole shape.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.080
And you have to have, you
know, this is FCC.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.070
You have to have the glide.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.280
Dislocations are gliding, the
slip systems are operative,

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.630
and the magnesium gives you just
a little bit of strength.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.190
But if you get into the
two-phase regime, the punch,

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:03.540
instead of making deep
drawing metal, will

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.360
end up punching holes.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.130
So what's the difference
between drawing

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:08.060
and punching holes?

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.100
It's all in the metallurgy.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.010
So you can see, this
is where we are.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:13.820
OK.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.790
Ah!

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.040
Microelectronic devices.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.720
How do we hold all those
wires together?

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.460
With solder.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.510
And this is the phase
diagram for solder.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.840
It's made of lead and tin.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.900
And we use eutectic.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:30.800
The eutectic here is about 62
weight percent tin at 183

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.500
degrees Celsius.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.390
I took a class in high school
called Industrial Arts.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.930
It was shop.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.550
We had it drilled into us, the
eutectic point of soft solder

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.580
is 374 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:43.960
I will know that
on my deathbed.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.480
Plus the wavelength of copper
K-alpha radiation.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.112
1.5418 angstroms.

00:20:50.112 --> 00:20:51.380
Yeah.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:52.890
So what's the magic here?

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:57.400
The magic here is, the solder
must be low-melting enough

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.560
that when you're-- remember,
you've got your

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.720
microelectronic device.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.090
You've already got your chip,
and you're putting wires.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:06.170
You want to put enough heat in
to solder the wires, but you

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.790
don't want to have to raise the
temperature so much that

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.020
you can damage the rest
of the device.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.280
So you say, well, why don't
you get something

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.650
that's lower melting?

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.390
Well, if it's lower melting,
you know from running your

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:19.290
laptops and charging your cell
phones, they get warm.

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:20.900
So it's a Goldilocks problem.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.620
If the melting point of the
solder is too low, you might

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.910
encounter that temperature
in service, and

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.460
pop all of the joints.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.040
If the melting point of the
solder is too high, then you

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.730
have to use so much energy to
make the joints that you

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.580
damage some of the
microelectronic componentry.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.190
So this has to be in the right
temperature range.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.930
The problem with this excellent,
excellent solder is

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.660
that it contains lead.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.590
No one's going to get lead
poisoning from using a device.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.160
But the disposal of the device
ends up introducing the lead

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.200
into the landfill, and then
if it soaks in an aqueous

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.030
solution, you could get
leeching, et cetera.

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:59.570
So there's a lot of research
right now on trying to find

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.680
other solders that operate.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.600
And there are other solders,
but they're very expensive.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.260
So that, how do you find
something that's functional

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.960
the way this is, nontoxic,
and cheap?

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.440
They can give you any two of
those, but to get all three of

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.030
them to line up?

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:15.940
Requires research.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.535
You see the alpha phase, beta
phase, everything there.

00:22:18.535 --> 00:22:19.690
All right.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:22.795
And here's the lead
tin system.

00:22:22.795 --> 00:22:26.390
And let's just take this one
that happens to be 40%, and

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:27.700
let's see what happens.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.710
We'll go through in time.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.120
So we start here, all
liquid regime.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.880
And so this bubble shows
what you might see on

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.170
a microscope slide.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.910
So it's all white here, meaning
that it's homogeneous

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:38.900
single phase.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.560
And then you drop into the
two-phase regime, just below

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.150
the liquidus, and you start
seeing these blobs.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:47.030
Those little blobs are
the primary alpha.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.740
That's the solid solution,
right?

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.320
Because we're in the two-phase
regime, so we've

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.860
got a tie line here.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.920
We get down to a lower
temperature, there's more of

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.510
this stuff.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.640
There's more of this stuff
forming , because

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.140
it's forming in time.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.510
It takes you time to
traverse this.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:01.980
This isn't parking
and waiting.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.660
This is just cooling
something.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.540
Imagine you're soldering, so you
took the temperature up to

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.810
here, now you're going
to let it cool.

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.810
Once you cross the eutectic
temperature, now

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.240
it's alpha plus beta.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.950
So now you get this lamellar
structure.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:20.360
Stripes of alpha,
stripes of beta.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.060
But the previous blobs that
formed the primary alpha, they

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.190
don't disappear.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:26.530
The only way they
can disappear is

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:27.860
by solid state diffusion.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.390
That's going to take
a long time.

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:31.690
So I can look at the
microstructure

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.560
here, and I can predict--

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.140
not predict--

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.930
I can go back and calculate
what the cooling

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.270
rate must have been.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:42.090
If I cool very slowly,
I will have nearly

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.240
the equilibrium structure.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.080
And so that's why, when I told
you about, say, analyzing the

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.930
records from the World Trade
Center, I can look at the

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.970
metal, and look at the phase
distribution, and tell you

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.110
what the thermal history was.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:59.000
And so for example, there was
some cock-eyed theory saying

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.890
that the steel was burning.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:05.380
Somebody said that the steel
melted, and so on.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.890
You can look and you say,
that did not happen.

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.800
Temperatures went fairly high,
crossed into some different

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.790
solid phases, went from BCC
to FCC and then back.

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:16.540
But didn't melt.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.870
Because if it melted,
we would have seen

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.690
this kind of structure.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:20.670
So this is--

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:23.970
every time a plane crashes,
this is the metallurgical

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.540
investigation that
is taking place.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:31.740
The history is written in
the microstructure.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.850
So this is a micrograph
that's actually

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.780
taken from some solder.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.240
This is 50 weight percent.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.310
The slide was 40, but this
happened to be 50.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.850
It's the one I could
find easily.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:45.680
So 50 tin, 50 lead, and these
dark zones are the primary

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.090
lead-rich alpha.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:48.380
And it's all metal.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.380
So how do I get the dark
and the light?

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.820
First we polish, because it's
an optical microscope, which

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.380
has a really crummy
depth of field.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.650
So you've got to make it flat,
and you polish it, and now

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:57.940
you've got a mirror, and
you look, and all

00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:58.835
you see is your eyeball.

00:24:58.835 --> 00:25:01.950
So what you do then, is you
etch it with some acid.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:06.590
And the lead will etch at a
different rate from the tin.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.650
And the contrast, then,
is what you see here.

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:10.810
So this is all the blobs
of primary alpha.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.550
Then you go below the eutectic,
and, you know, this

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.790
cute little schematic
of stripes--

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:18.320
this is the textbook version
of it, but this is the real

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:18.720
version of it.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.760
And you see, it's a distorted
lamellar structure.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.920
Alternating stripes.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.240
Because you're trying to
make alpha and beta.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.190
And so you're making alpha and
beta, and the system's trying

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:29.590
to make both of it.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:32.040
So it makes it in striped
form called lamellar

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.470
microstructure.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.150
So I can look at that
and I can say, wow.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.440
That must have been cooled at
a fairly rapid rate, because

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.890
you've got a large amounts
of primary alpha.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.230
If it were cooled at a very slow
rate, the thing should be

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.110
all lamellar structure, right?

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.200
If you're down here, there
should be no alpha.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.240
This is not the equilibrium
phase.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.110
So this alpha is
trapped there.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.360
It's a victim of its history.

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:56.190
So there it is.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:56.900
That's cute.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.543
That's a nice, it's a
beautiful graphic.

00:25:58.543 --> 00:25:59.350
See?

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:00.640
There it is.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.630
All right.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.170
So I'm going to show you some
phase diagrams from hell.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:06.230
This is, you're going
to be on airplanes.

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:08.790
The airplane alloy is
aluminum copper.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.380
It's about 4% copper
and aluminum.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.090
Now remember, I just told you
about 1% magnesium and

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:15.750
aluminum to give you
single phase.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:16.920
In the case of the airplane,
we want to

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.800
make the wings strong.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.590
So what we do, is we come down
into here, which is a

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:22.820
two-phase regime.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.240
And if we're clever about it,
we can control the particle

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.080
size of that second phase.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.400
And by controlling the particle
size, we can cause

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.880
grain boundaries, which can
arrest the dislocations and

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.130
make sure the wings
don't fall off.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.160
This is aluminum manganese.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.620
This is the one that Danny
Schechtman worked with to get

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.130
the quasicrystals.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.040
Look at all the phases.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.360
He's running out of Greek
letters by the time you get

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.820
across this diagram.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.060
Look at it.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.470
But one thing holds.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.090
The two-phase regimes are
always bounded by

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:54.030
single-phase regimes.

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:54.160
Look.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.270
Here's liquid, here's a two
phases, there's a single

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:57.910
phase, two phase, single
phase, two phase.

00:26:57.910 --> 00:26:58.880
Beautiful.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.130
All makes sense.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:05.140
Now, what happens if you try
to take a metal and mix it

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.100
with a nonmetal?

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:06.870
They don't want to mix.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.700
Look at the big miscibility
gap here.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.670
Molten iron doesn't want to
mix with molten sulfur.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.350
This is a liquid-liquid
miscibility gap.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.360
Over here, you can add some
sulfur to iron, you get a

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.310
eutectic, get a line compound.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.260
And then over here, no dice.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.900
Does not want to mix.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.280
And look at all the
solid phases.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.030
Why do we have all these
solid phases?

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.300
Different crystal structures.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:28.500
OK.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.890
So now what we're going to do,
is I'm going to talk about

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:34.640
application of phase diagrams
to the making of champagne.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.400
Because champagne relies
on phase diagrams.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.540
And then I'm going to make
some general comments.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.760
But I'm going to actually
show you some champagne.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:46.340
So before I get into my
commentary, I'm going to get

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.360
some champagne chilling.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.510
So first I have to show you
how to chill champagne.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.625
First I will show you how
not to chill champagne.

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.000
This is how not to
chill champagne.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.070
And it's not because, OK,
we can put it in there.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.710
Why?

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:09.200
Because, as I showed you last
day, with respect to the

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:16.380
cooling of the engine coolant by
the radiator, if you have--

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:21.512
if this a bottle here,
here's the contents,

00:28:21.512 --> 00:28:23.610
the precious contents.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:26.820
And I have this with
blocks of ice.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:32.680
The contact between the ice and
the bottle is sporadic,

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.270
and I've got air in between, so
the quality of the cooling

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:37.580
is very poor.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:40.876
So instead, what I do is I rely
on the phase diagram.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.970
So what do I do?

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:47.580
What do I know about
the phase diagram?

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:51.460
if I pour water in here, I will
thermostat the entire

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.940
system, liquid plus solid,
at 0 degrees.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.350
Because the ice is probably,
I don't know,

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:58.730
minus 3, minus 4 Celsius?

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:01.420
But the air is 20, and
it gets in there, and

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.970
it's very few atoms.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:04.060
It's crummy heat transfer.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.720
Instead, if I flood this with
water, the whole thing is

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.890
thermostatted at 0 degrees C.

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:11.050
So now I've got a good delta t,
because I started here at

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:14.590
about 22 degrees C. I've
got a delta t, and it's

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:15.730
a fixed law, right?

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.140
It's going to be what?

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.270
It's going to be the flux.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.840
The heat flux is going
to be minus thermal

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.510
conductivity, dt by dx.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:27.470
It's Fickian type motion
of the thing.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.460
So let's do it.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.430
This is how you properly
chill--

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:38.730
I'm told it also works for
sodas and fruit juices.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.240
This technique, I mean.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.290
But I do know that it works
with champagne.

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:46.290
Now that's working
beautifully.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:49.130
I can just feel the heat
being extracted.

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:49.410
OK.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.800
So now let's talk
about champagne.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.110
All right.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.320
So we're going to talk about
champagne and a great

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.190
inventor, and the inventor
is the Widow Clicquot.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:00.250
This is the Veuve Clicquot
champagne.

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.880
And veuve is the French
for widow.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.710
So Veuve Clicquot,
her real name was

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:06.690
Nicole-Barbe Ponsardin.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.610
And in 1798, she married
Francois Clicquot.

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:12.550
This is a big French
winemaking family.

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:15.620
And he died and left her a
widow at the age of 27.

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.470
She was very unusual for a
French woman in the 18th

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.240
century, because they were
not involved in society.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.860
They were certainly not
involved in business.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.260
This woman was different.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.430
She decided to get under the
hood, and she took control of

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:29.800
the winery.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:33.630
And I've written here, bold,
imaginative management.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:35.190
There's a fantastic
book about her.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:39.880
It's actually a very good book
portraying late 18th century,

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.950
early 19th century France.

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:43.530
And these are among her
accomplishments.

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:46.150
Marketed champagne to all the
great courts of Europe.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.370
Champagne was a regional
beverage, drunk only in the

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:49.770
Champagne region.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.500
And she created the myth,

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.940
propagated the myth of champagne.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.970
You use it for festive
occasions, bought land in the

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.010
best vineyards, quality
control.

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.200
It's about the chemistry.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.870
Fought fiercely against
counterfeiting.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.570
As she started getting champagne
more recognition,

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.980
people started making sparkling
wine and labeling it

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:08.560
as champagne.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.500
She used the court system
to take them down.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.510
Established strict quality
control procedures.

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.840
That's all about defending
the brand, and

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.880
what's the quality control?

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.460
It's the chemistry.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.010
Produced the first
rose champagne.

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:24.400
The Pinot Noir grape
has a black skin.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.930
Depress, and then take the
juice, and away you go.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:30.340
What she did, is she let the
skin sit with the juice for

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.980
long enough to give a
just a rose tinge.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.230
And then oversaw the invention
of new technology.

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:37.180
Remouillage.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.100
And that's where the phase
diagrams come into play.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.920
Phase diagrams give us champagne
we enjoy today.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.970
So what's the problem?

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:46.420
Champagne is cloudy.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.590
Why is it cloudy?

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:48.580
Well, here's the chemistry.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.180
Here's how you make, this is
how you make all wine.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.640
It's one-stop shopping.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.440
You take the grape.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.200
The grape has sugar in
the grape juice.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.380
And yeast that attacks the
sugar is in the skin.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:03.830
So the yeast attacks the sugar
to make alcohol and CO2.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:08.500
So ethyl alcohol and CO2,
plus some insolubles.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.730
There are some insoluble
products of that reaction.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:13.340
And there's two types
of insolubles.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.700
Those that will settle, they're
called sedimentary,

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.710
and those that won't settle.

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:18.370
They're called suspended.

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:21.450
And how do you get rid of
the sedimentary stuff?

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:22.820
By mechanical separation.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:29.690
You let the juice sit, this
reaction is taking place, and

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:32.580
the sedimentary stuff is turning
into gunk, and it sits

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.930
at the bottom.

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:35.880
And then periodically
you siphon.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.080
You siphon the juice off, and
you leave all the crud at the

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.870
bottom of the barrel, and then
you go for a few more months,

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:42.510
and then you siphon again.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:46.680
Well, that works for the
sedimentary stuff, but it

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.890
won't work for champagne,
because as you're siphoning,

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:50.530
you're letting out
all the gas.

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:52.490
You see, you're trapping
this gas.

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:55.500
The champagne has CO2 that's
naturally occurring.

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.070
It's not carbonated.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:59.170
It's carbonated naturally.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:00.740
Not carbonated, man-made
carbonation.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.230
It's natural carbonation.

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:05.160
So how do you separate the juice
from the crud without

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.150
losing the gas?

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:07.970
That's the problem.

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:11.440
And by the way, the other stuff
that's suspended, they

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.090
use tricks.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.570
You know, here's the
free body diagram.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:15.310
Remember, I showed you
this for milk.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:17.500
So what they do, is they add
things like eggshell, and the

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.390
eggshell acts as a coagulant,
so the tiny particles that

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:24.620
will float agglomerate to become
big enough that then

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.530
they'll settle.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:28.670
Tiny particles of a given
density will float, large

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.250
particles of the same
density will sink.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:33.700
So you need to coagulate,
and do that without

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.880
spoiling the taste.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.390
Fantastic chemistry.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:38.270
So she comes along
with the answer.

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.540
By the way, the early
champagne glasses

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:41.820
were all cut crystal.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.080
Why were they cut crystal?

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.470
Because the champagne
was cloudy.

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:50.520
It tasted fantastic, but who
wanted-- it looked like swill!

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.630
So how to make it clear?

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:54.620
So what they did, is they made
champagne bottles with the

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.090
deep ruts, and they still
do to this day.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.770
They have a deep rut here,
because the idea was, if you

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:01.950
opened it carefully, you
wouldn't disturb

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:03.030
so much of the crud.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:07.560
But it gets churned
up by the gas.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:11.060
So what she reasoned was, let's
turn him upside down,

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:14.370
and let's have the crud settle
on the underside of the cork.

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:16.980
And furthermore, 45 degrees
is the optimal angle.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.430
You know this from your
Newtonian mechanics.

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:23.280
And then you turn them, so
you spiral the bottle.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.120
Turn them, and have all the crud
collect on the underside

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:26.600
of the cork.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.630
I know what you're thinking.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.200
How are you going to
get the cork out?

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.630
Now you take the cork out,
you're going to lose

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:31.185
not just the gas.

00:34:31.185 --> 00:34:32.940
You're going to lose
the liquid, too.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.850
Ah, that's where the phase
diagrams come in.

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:37.360
So here's a phase diagram
of ethanol water.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.610
And it's eutectic.

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:41.990
Look at, way down here.

00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:44.930
In fact, ethanol makes a
really good antifreeze.

00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:45.260
Look!

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.350
A little bit of-- go
way down here.

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:51.980
Now, most wines are somewhere
between 10% and 15% alcohol,

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.330
that gives you very modest
freezing point depression.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.360
Maybe about minus 5 Celsius.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.690
Which is why if you forget, you
put a wine bottle in the

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:00.630
freezer and you forget about
it, and you've got your

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:03.310
freezer really cranked to,
say, minus 5 Fahrenheit,

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:07.110
you'll freeze the wine, and
it'll expand, because it's 90%

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:10.980
water, and push the cork
out, make a mess.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:15.480
But remember, you only get
down to about minus 5.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.590
Remember, I showed
you this one?

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.680
It gets down to minus 21.

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.450
So what she reasoned was,
what if you took the

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:24.400
bottle upside down?

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.610
You've got all the crud on the
underside of the cork.

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:33.090
What if you took the bottle and
put it into not water, but

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:35.890
what if I put sodium
chloride in here?

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:37.760
I still have my ice cubes,
only the temperature

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.010
is now minus 21.

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:43.440
And that's below the freezing
point of the alcohol, and now

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.670
I've frozen an ice
plug in the neck.

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:50.720
So now there's an ice plug
between the crud and the cork.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.590
So now I can turn the bottle
like this, just melt ever so

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:57.570
slightly, and the pressure in
the bottle will blow the ice

00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:00.080
plug, take with it the crud out,
and then I quickly put

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.590
the cork on top.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:05.576
And that's how every bottle
of champagne is made.

00:36:05.576 --> 00:36:08.530
And it all comes from these
phase diagrams.

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:09.040
See?

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.590
So you put it in brine.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:12.540
Minus 21.

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.050
But this thing is
frozen already.

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.640
That red is frozen.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.220
And now I've turned it right
side up, out it goes, takes

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.070
the crud with it, put
the cork back on.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:22.640
So it's a combination
of this phase

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.900
diagram, this phase diagram.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:28.410
Both eutectic phase diagrams
would give us clear champagne.

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:31.450
Positively brilliant.

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:32.780
So there it is.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:36.430
The invention and--

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:38.050
oh, by the way.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:39.450
They call this--

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:42.620
the English word remouillage
is riddling.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.100
So they have people that
actually go, and they, these

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:49.550
wooden racks with the slots in
them at 45 degree angles, and

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:52.620
all these bottles are pointed
downward, 45 degree angle.

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.060
Guys come in every day, quarter
turn, quarter turn,

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:55.830
quarter turn.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.370
French are very traditional.

00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:59.910
Few champagne wineries have
motorized, so they have this

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:02.120
thing called giropalette.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.920
Gyrating pallet.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.720
The California champagne
wineries call it VLM.

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.920
Very Large Machine.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:11.800
I kid you not.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.960
I didn't make that up.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.000
In California, the giropalette
is called VLM, which is Very

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.530
Large Machine, dude.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:19.020
I guess.

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.220
That's what they say.

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.720
California.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:22.480
All right.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:27.390
So let's have a few words now
about the final exam.

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.600
So you know, it's going
to be Tuesday, 9:00 to

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.610
noon, Johnson Athletic.

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:31.450
Three hours.

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:33.750
You have three full hours, not
three times 50 minutes.

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:35.710
Three full hours.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.350
But I'm not going to give you
three times the work.

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:41.535
It's sort of a hybrid between
intensive coverage since T3,

00:37:41.535 --> 00:37:46.100
so sort of like a T4 and
a redemptory part.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.110
It'll go back, extensive
coverage of everything.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:50.340
One aid sheet.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.760
One aid sheet.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.940
I'm saying it three times.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:53.970
One aid sheet.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.030
Do not come in there with
a bunch of aid sheets.

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.730
Well, I didn't know!

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:57.660
I thought we could have--

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.050
no!

00:37:58.050 --> 00:37:58.830
One aid sheet.

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.350
That's all you need.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:01.690
And the TAs are smart.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:04.760
You know, every year somebody
tries to bring the origami and

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.440
all that stuff.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.690
And they get caught, and
then-- you know.

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:10.510
Bring your periodic table,
table of contents,

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:11.340
calculator, a pen.

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.920
No headphones, no audio.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:13.580
Please.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.170
Because people are writing,
they're trying to concentrate.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.430
I don't want to get into a
dispute over whether your

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:20.240
music is too loud for
your neighbor.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.750
So let's just, out of
courtesy, no audio.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.900
You can go three hours
without your music.

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.150
All right?

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.730
What else.

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:33.035
This is going to be comparable
difficulty

00:38:33.035 --> 00:38:34.710
to the monthly tests.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:36.250
Of course, read the
entire exam.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:37.890
You've got plenty of time.

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:40.710
Most people are leaving
11:15, 11:30.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:43.330
It's not a race against
the clock.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:45.310
And make sure you show your
work, justify your

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:48.300
conclusions, solve
algebraically.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.130
Stay confident.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.715
Do your own work, academic
honesty, all that applies.

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:58.200
Now, your overall grade is
going to be based on many

00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.590
factors, including the trend.

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:01.050
So we're going to look
at how you performed

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:02.250
throughout the semester.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:04.820
You started off really strong,
and you crash and burn on the

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.460
final, or you've done the math
and you say, I only need a 37

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:10.280
on the final, and you go in
there, shooting for a 37, and

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:15.460
you miss and you get a 35, and
your total average is 49.5?

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.500
You go down.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.480
Because you've got a 49.5 and
you wrote a 35 on the final.

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:23.710
I'm just telling you.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:26.410
Claim, you can have your
exam papers back.

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:29.420
But don't come and see
us before Christmas.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.280
You can have them back
starting IAP.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.395
So starting January 4, you
can have your exams

00:39:33.395 --> 00:39:34.920
back, if you want them.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.770
And there's no time limit for
appeal, so you don't have to

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:42.290
be bursting into your TA's
office on January 4 if you see

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:43.620
that we've misgraded
something.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.670
You can come and see us.

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:48.330
There will be some security
measures in place.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.830
It has not escaped my notice
that some people have

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:55.120
attempted to erase answers that
were written in pencil,

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.510
and then bring in this
newly brilliantly

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.850
solved problem for regrading.

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:03.620
And that's, of course,
qualifies as academic

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:05.800
dishonesty, and I'll take you to
the committee on discipline

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.410
if you try it.

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:12.280
But just to inspire honesty
on a random basis, we'll

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.270
photocopy about 5%
of the exams.

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:16.810
So if you want to try this, the
question you've got to ask

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.160
yourself is do you feel lucky?

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:23.240
Do you?

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:25.460
All right.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.360
So now it's time for some
personal observations.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.370
So I wrote them down.

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:29.590
OK.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:32.550
So first thing is, you've
come a long way.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:33.620
Syllabus is full.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.520
You think about where we were
on day 1, you know, this is

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.900
equations, stoichiometry,
all that baby stuff.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.120
And you know, look.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.330
So be proud of what
you've learned.

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:44.260
Number two.

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.030
I wish you much success
on the final.

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:50.160
Remember, no grade that I assign
to you, or any of my

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.440
colleagues assigns to you has
any relevance to your value as

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.090
a human being.

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:56.660
It's just a grade
in a subject.

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:00.100
That's all it is.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.250
What's the worst thing
that can happen?

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:04.210
Suppose you get all Fs, and
you're required to withdraw

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:05.450
from the Institute.

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:06.920
So what?

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.380
So what?

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:09.110
You know?

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:10.500
You're all smart people.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:11.340
I know you're smart.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.020
I used to chair the Admissions
Committee.

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:14.040
I know how smart you are.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.410
If you're getting all F's, this
is not the right place,

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:18.220
it's not the right time
for you to be here.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.940
Look, I have no degrees
from this place.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:21.190
I feel great.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:31.330
I've been teaching here at MIT
for 32 years, and I've never

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:33.450
enjoyed teaching as much as
I have this semester.

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:36.520
This has been really a blast
to teach, really.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:40.240
I can't believe I said that
with a straight face.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.490
So of course it's not true.

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:45.130
I want to think my staff.

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:47.280
My TAs, sitting here.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.990
The tutors who helped out.

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:52.480
Professor Demkowicz, who subbed
for me that time, when

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:56.710
I had the visit of
President Obama.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:59.990
Administrators, the
audiovisual techs.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:03.720
Dave Broderick, who's done a
great job of making sure that

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.350
we have sound and light.

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:08.080
And the academic media
production services people,

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.030
who have recorded the lectures
so that on the rare occasion

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.990
that you didn't make it
the class, you're

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:18.050
able to catch up.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:21.720
And the last thing is that,
I've got here, there's one

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.740
more chemistry lesson.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.430
You know, we've learned about
the four different types of

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:26.890
primary bonding.

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:29.520
Covalent, ionic, metallic,
and in some

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.570
instances, van der Waals.

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:32.310
But there's a fifth
type of bond.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:34.660
The fifth type of bond that I
haven't talked about yet.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.970
And it's the type of bond that's
been forming in this

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:40.390
room over the last 14 weeks.

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.840
Yeah, I know.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:41.600
It's kind of sappy.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.950
I didn't come up with this.

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:46.690
It came from a student.

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:49.760
So the fifth type of bond is--

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:50.837
it's not this one.

00:42:50.837 --> 00:42:53.460
[MUSIC PLAYBACK]

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:55.640
No, it's not this one.

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.300
It's a bond that's formed
between people, and this bond

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.500
has a very special property.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.820
It can never be broken.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:04.330
I know!

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:05.270
It came from a student.

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:06.170
It's very sappy.

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:07.190
I'll tell you the story.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:08.530
I'll tell you the story
how it happened.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:10.610
I used to teach 321,
which is a core

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:12.570
graduate class in kinetics.

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:13.870
And I'd been teaching
it for, I don't

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:14.900
know, five, seven years.

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.710
And I was at a conference, and
there's these two people

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:17.540
standing there talking.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:18.640
And I know both them.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.750
One was from industry, and
one of them was an alum.

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.420
So I go up, and the fellow in
industry, says, hi, how are

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.590
you doing, do you
know so and so?

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:26.400
And I said, yeah.

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.010
He was at MIT.

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:29.910
I was his kinetics professor

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:33.010
And the student, the alum,
he says, excuse

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.240
me, Professor Sadoway.

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:39.650
It's true that I was at MIT, but
please do not say that you

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:41.280
were my kinetics professor.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.070
You will always be my
kinetics professor.

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:46.630
I went, oh, man.

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:47.690
This is really something.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:49.500
So now the tables are turned.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.600
And, and, you know, I know
you're going to go go on and

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.470
do something remarkable in your
life, and I hope it's

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:57.740
remarkably wonderful and
not remarkably stupid.

00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:02.590
But you know, at some point,
somebody may say to you, where

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:03.595
did you learn your chemistry?

00:44:03.595 --> 00:44:05.810
And you'll have to say,
Sadoway at MIT.

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:09.810
So whether you like it or not,
I will always be your

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:11.550
chemistry professor.

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:13.560
So now, let's see.

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:17.520
I think it's time to open
up the champagne.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:18.850
So first thing, we
have to teach

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:19.900
you how to open champagne.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.840
So there's the foil here.

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.090
So we'll take the foil off.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:31.320
Take the foil off,
very carefully.

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:35.220
And then there's the wire basket
that keeps the cork on.

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.880
How many turns on
the wire basket?

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.830
Everyone in 3091 knows.

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:42.150
Six turns.

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:47.560
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:50.570
Six turns.

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:52.680
And so now, I don't want to
point that at anybody, because

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.710
the only thing between me
and six atmospheres of

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:58.170
pressure is that cork.

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:02.230
And Dave, if we can cut to
the document camera.

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:07.220
The cover, the metal cover on
this, has the image of the

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:07.920
Widow Clicquot.

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.360
This is Veuve Clicquot, and
this is the image of the

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.560
Veuve, and she's on
every bottle.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.630
She was the one that gave us
clarified champagne, so you

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:17.750
thank her very much.

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:19.590
All right.

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:20.635
So now what we're going
to do, is we're going

00:45:20.635 --> 00:45:21.495
to open this thing.

00:45:21.495 --> 00:45:23.990
To open it, we point
it 45 degrees and

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:25.600
turn it ever so slightly.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.430
Never point it at people.

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:28.960
No, really, point it away.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.480
You'll put an eye out
with this thing.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.610
You turn it very slightly.

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:36.840
Actually, my hands are wet now,
so I'm going to use a

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.090
towel here.

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.626
Oh yeah.

00:45:49.626 --> 00:45:51.040
Go like this.

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.300
You like the suspense, huh?

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.610
See that?

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:05.450
No pfff!

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:07.010
That's for football
locker rooms.

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:09.010
It's very declasse.

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:09.930
OK.

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:12.090
Now we have to have a glass.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:14.690
So since we have clarified
champagne, we're not going to

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:15.490
use cut crystal.

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:20.130
We're going to use Baccarat,
French crystal that's not cut.

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:23.650
Because we've got nothing
to hide, right?

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:24.710
So now we're going
to pour this.

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:27.350
And the rut now has
some value.

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:31.310
The rut has value, because
now what you can do is to

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:32.770
pour it like so.

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:42.752
I've been waiting fourteen
weeks for this.

00:46:42.752 --> 00:46:43.280
All right.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.240
So the surface tension, you
see the carbon dioxide

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.970
outgassing, because it's
supersaturated.

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:50.500
Six atmospheres, not
one atmosphere.

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:55.560
The bubbles are nucleating on
the defects in the glass.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.296
It's all about chemistry.

00:46:57.296 --> 00:46:58.546
So there we go.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:01.400
OK.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:06.480
So I'm going to propose a toast
to the class, to the

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:11.820
3091 class of Fall 2009, to wish
you much success in your

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:15.230
academic pursues, and
much happiness in

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:16.990
your personal lives.

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:22.470
And with that, I'm
going to find out

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:23.720
what's going on inside.

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:27.690
Look at those bubbles!

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:32.240
You know, the legend is, the
blind monk, Dom Perignon, when

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.870
he first drank champagne, said,
I feel as though I'm

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:36.120
drinking stars.

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:41.820
He's right.

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:42.540
Drinking stars.

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:42.810
OK.

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:44.460
This is to you.
