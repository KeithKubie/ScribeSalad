00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.960
Ural Mountains are
very old mountains

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.460
stretching from the Russian
north to the Russian south.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.040
It kind of splitting
Russia into two parts--

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.170
Europe and Asia.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.580
Indeed, people living
in the Ural Mountains

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.670
witness some strange phenomena
in the air and on the ground.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.420
NARRATOR: Dozens of visitors
to the Ural Mountains

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.250
have reported strange sightings
of fireballs and cigar shaped

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.880
crafts, but even
stranger is what has

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.750
been found in the earth here.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.880
In 1991, geologists
led an expedition

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.250
into the mineral
rich Urals in hopes

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.170
of locating gold deposits.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.420
While excavating sites near the
Kozhim, Narada, and Balbanyu

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.920
rivers, just 600
miles north of Arkaim

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.290
the scientists discovered
something unexpected.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.620
At depths of over 30
feet, they unearthed

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.920
a scattering of tiny
metal coils and springs.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.790
That soil was untouched
for hundreds of thousands

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.210
or more years.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.540
The area where it was found
was probably tens of kilometers

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.120
around.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.460
It's as if something exploded
thousands of years ago

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.290
and the fragments were
lying all over the place.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.620
NARRATOR: The metal fragments,
some as small as 1/10,000

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.170
of an inch, were sent to the
Russian Academy of Sciences

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.790
in St. Petersburg for analysis.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.170
Their shape resembled
manufactured technology

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.000
rather than naturally
occurring minerals.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.580
The smallest pieces were
found to be tungsten,

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.670
a metal used in
spacecrafts and missiles

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.670
due to its ability to
withstand high temperatures.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.960
They are these metal
spirals that consist of copper

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.170
but also tungsten
and molybdenum, which

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.330
are both very rare metals.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.290
We're looking at nanotechnology.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.540
DAVID WILCOCK: When you look
down at them in a microscope,

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.880
they're extremely regular
in their structure.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.460
They're very nice coils.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.710
The only way we
could make them even

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.290
now is with machine
guided technology.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.380
You could not do this by hand.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.670
What we're seeing here
is proof that someone

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.790
had advanced technology
sufficient to build

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.790
the type of circuitry
that we normally

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.880
only see in semiconductors--

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.620
computer chips, high technology
equipment using metals

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.540
that are not commonly known.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.290
So these spirals
are clear evidence

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.170
that someone had a very
advanced civilization right

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.080
here on Earth near Arkaim.
