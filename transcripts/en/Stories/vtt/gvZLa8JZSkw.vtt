[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.260
SUBJECT: The internet
dubbed this the hottest kiss

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.180
in the world, and
it's easy to see why.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.630
The couple locked
in a passionate kiss

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.430
are standing right next
to a field of molten lava

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.050
in the pouring rain.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.200
This is what it looks like when
two daredevil photographers

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.320
decide to take a
romantic selfie.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.810

00:00:23.187 --> 00:00:25.520
DALLAS NAGATA WHITE: Hi, my
name is Dallas Nagata White.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.890
ED WHITE: And I'm Ed White.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.540
DALLAS NAGATA WHITE: And we
are professional photographers

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.854
living in Honalulu, Hawaii.

00:00:29.854 --> 00:00:31.770
ED WHITE: This photo was
taken in the Kalapana

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.110
area of the big island Hawaii.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.869
Ironically, it's not the
photo we set out to take.

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:40.160
SUBJECT: The duo wanted to
capture an image that showed

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.700
off Kalapana's fiery landscape.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.390
Though first, that involved
walking directly into

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.246
said fiery landscape.

00:00:48.246 --> 00:00:50.870
ED WHITE: The hike to the actual
flow was a surreal experience,

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.840
and lava is nothing
like what you think.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.340
The cool rock is actually
really, really fluffy

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.510
because of all the
dissolved gases.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.270
So the landscape itself
dampens all the sound around,

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.140
and the only thing you can
here are your companions

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.220
and the crunch crunch crunch
of the soft rock giving away

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.670
beneath your feet
as you hike over it.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.750
SUBJECT: Finally, after three
hours of hiking, Dallas and Ed

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.970
made it to this is spot, only
the shot they had in mind

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.275
wasn't going to be possible as
it suddenly started to rain.

00:01:20.275 --> 00:01:22.150
ED WHITE: Luckily I had
hiked in some strobes

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.350
and some wireless
triggers, and we

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.532
decide to try to trick that we
had used several times before.

00:01:27.532 --> 00:01:28.990
Our friends insisted
that we should

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.520
have our photos taken too.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.160
So we posed in
front of the strobe

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.460
and put our hands on our hips.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.330
And I felt like I needed a
little bit something more.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.870
So I whisper into Dallas' ear,
like, hey, let's do one more.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.030
And without telling her, I
dipped her and kissed her,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.990
and then the strobe went off.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.800
And that picture
came into existence.

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:48.950
SUBJECT: For Dallas
and Ed, this image

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.004
is the most epic reminder
of a unique place.

00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:53.920
ED WHITE: In many ways,
hiking out to Kalapana

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.670
was a very humbling experience.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.840
You just can't help but respect
the Earth's awesome power

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.445
at just moves along
whether or not

00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:03.540
humanity is moving
along with it.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.600
And you just come
away with a sense

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.100
of just how everything
is so temporary

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.816
and how the Earth is
always renewing itself

00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:16.060
whether we're coming
along for the ride or not.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.510
