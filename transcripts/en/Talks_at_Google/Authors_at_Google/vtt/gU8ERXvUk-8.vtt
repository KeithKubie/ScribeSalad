[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:06.550
SPEAKER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.420
Welcome to Talks at Google
here in the Kirkland campus.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.432
Thank you all for
coming out today.

00:00:11.432 --> 00:00:13.140
Today, we've got a
really exciting author

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.340
here to talk to you.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.560
We have Andy Weir, author
of "The Martian," here

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.240
to talk about his
new book, "Artemis."

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.704
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.490
ANDY WEIR: Thank you.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.480
Wow.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.550
This is my first trip to
the Pacific Northwest.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.440
I've literally never been
up here before in my life.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.930
I live in northern California.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.450
I live in Sunnyvale, so not
too far from the Googleplex.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.340
But yeah, so
basically, I'll talk

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.380
about my extremely unlikely
and bizarre trip to success.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.780
Basically, I always
wanted to be a writer

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.280
ever since I was a little kid.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.780
I think the first
thing I ever wrote

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.590
was a Henry Higgins fan fiction,
the Beverly Cleary books,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.700
children's books.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.320
I think I was eight.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.840
It lacked depth, but
I had fun with it.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.770
And growing up, I had my dad's
inexhaustible science fiction

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.820
collection to work with.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.650
He had a bookshelf that's about
six feet tall, three feet wide,

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.630
and a foot deep, and
it was jam-packed

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.990
full of old sci-fi books that
he'd collected over his life.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.010
So strangely, I grew up reading
kind of baby boomer era sci-fi,

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.979
despite being Gen X. I'm 45.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.520
But I was reading
books that came out

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.150
in the '50s, '60s, and
'70s, which is interesting,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.580
because I'd be like
halfway through a book,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.275
and then there'd be those
glossy ad for Kent cigarettes.

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:39.400
That's what books are like.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.800
My dad also had this
cool map of the moon,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.189
but it only showed
the near side.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.730
I'm like, well, why doesn't it
show the far side of the moon?

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.990
He's like, check the date.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.800
And the date on the map
that was printed was 1959.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.670
So that was at the
time they printed

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.200
that map, that's literally
all they knew about the moon.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.730
Like, weird, huh?

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.200
So for me, when I was growing
up, my holy trinity of authors

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.470
was Asimov,
Heinlein, and Clarke.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.805
Those are the guys that--

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:10.509
so I ended up weirdly
being one generation off.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.380
And a lot of that stuff
doesn't stand up too well

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.730
to modern morals, especially
with the role of women in space

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.970
travel and stuff like that.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.930
But a lot of it does, the
hard sci-fi aspects of it

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.820
like the actually
paying attention

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.520
to the details of
orbital mechanics

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.880
or the complexities of living
in space or the effects

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.700
on the human body of long
term Zero-G habitation.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.140
Like they did a lot of
really good work on that.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.580
So those were
inspirations for me.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.160
Anyway, when I was
15 years old, I

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.406
got hired to work for Sandia
National Labs in Livermore,

00:02:45.406 --> 00:02:46.780
which is where I
was growing up--

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.940
Livermore, California.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.170
It's about 30 miles
east of San Francisco,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.320
if you don't mind swimming
directly across the Bay.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.466
And that makes me sound like I
was some sort of genius child

00:02:57.466 --> 00:02:59.340
that, oh, a national
lab is hiring him at 15.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.660
No, it was like a
community program,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.370
where they hired local
teenagers to clean

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.590
test tubes, that sort of thing.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.900
But the lab I ended up
in, they're like, well,

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.850
we don't really need
a gopher, but what

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.100
we do need is some method of
analyzing large data sets.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.380
Basically, what they
needed was Microsoft Excel,

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.360
but it didn't exist yet.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.760
So they said, all right,
well, we have our data sets

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.970
in these files.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.950
There's a computer.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.440
Here's a book on how
to program computers.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.970
Work that out, and
then come back to us,

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.220
and we'll tell you some
software we want you to write.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.830
Thus began a 25-year career
as a software engineer for me.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.810
When it came time
to go to college,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.940
I'd always wanted
to be a writer.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.880
And so I considered going
into being a lit major,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.170
but I also decided
that I really,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.590
really like eating
regular meals.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.890
So I went into CSE, computer
science and engineering,

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.990
for those of you here
at Google who don't

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.440
know what that stands for.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.090
And that was fine.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.260
I went to college
for four years,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.190
and then like many in
my generation, promptly

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.390
ran out of money.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.880
And I didn't finish
college, because my options

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.450
at that time-- now at this
point, it's about 1994.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.450
My options at this point
were either finish college,

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.720
and go deeply into debt, or go
into the now developer-hungry

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.190
tech industry, and get paid.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.090
Back then in '94, I mean
the tech industry was just

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.440
starting to blossom.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.094
And it was like, they figured
if you were clever enough

00:04:32.094 --> 00:04:34.510
to open the door, you were
clever enough to work for them.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.940
I mean it was really easy
to get a job back then.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.170
And so I'm like, OK.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.090
So I entered the workforce.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.310
And let's see.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.990
I worked for a bunch of places.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.880
In 1995, I worked for Blizzard.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.720
I was one of the
programmers on Warcraft 2.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.790
That's a long time ago.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.220
Very, very, very long time ago.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.600
And if you're curious,
working at Blizzard

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.890
was a miserable experience.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.840
It was back before kind of
some of the unwritten rules

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.820
of the engineering
industry came into play.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.320
That was back
when, oh, if you're

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.170
a software engineer, if
you're awake, you're at work.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.690
Like basically, I
remember when I was there,

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.590
I had to tell people
weeks and weeks and weeks

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.620
in advance that I was going to
take a Saturday and a Sunday

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.630
off to go hang out
with my friends.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.940
And even then, they
called me about 20 times

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.720
during that weekend
with questions.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.061
And I was not a senior engineer.

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:28.810
I was entry level.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.430
I was like low man
on the totem pole.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.245
So it's not like I
was super important,

00:05:33.245 --> 00:05:34.870
and they couldn't do
things without me.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.020
That was just the
atmosphere of engineering

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.530
at the time was very
different than it is now.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.800
So anyway, I ended up staying
in the engineering industry.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.480
And then in 1999, I was
working for America Online.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.710
Yes.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.010
And I got laid off along with
800 of my closest friends

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.310
when they merged with Netscape,
which kind of shows you--

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.140
gives you a time
reference there.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.310
The Macarena was popular.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.130
And so I ended up with
a fair amount of money

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.800
in stock options, because I
hadn't been paying attention

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.270
to them, because
I'm an engineer.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.100
We don't pay attention anything.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.252
And I'm like, oh,
I've got enough money,

00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:19.960
where I can actually
live for a few years

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.330
without going back
into the workforce.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.070
So I'm going to take
a sabbatical, which

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.400
is a fancy word for staying
unemployed for a long time.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.651
And I'm going to write a book.

00:06:28.651 --> 00:06:30.650
I'm going to break into
the publishing industry.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.200
It's what I've
always wanted to do.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.490
So I took three years off.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.569
I wrote a book.

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:35.860
That book is not "The Martian."

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.901
You've never heard of it.

00:06:36.901 --> 00:06:39.230
It didn't get published.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.480
Standard tale of woe that
every author will tell you.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.550
I couldn't get an
agent, couldn't

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.284
get any publishers interested,
just couldn't get any traction.

00:06:48.284 --> 00:06:50.200
And that was actually
the second book I wrote.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.690
The first book I wrote
was when I was in college,

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.270
and that was really bad.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.440
That one I don't let anyone see.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.400
I think I wrote it in
WordPerfect, Perfect

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.880
and there are no
surviving copies.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.630
Well, there's one.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.490
My mother has it, and she
won't tell me where it is.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.280
So there is, I suppose,
some evidence remaining.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.056
But other than that, the second
book was actually decent,

00:07:15.056 --> 00:07:16.930
but I still had a lot
to learn about writing.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.370
And so it's painful to read.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.110
The plot flow is pretty good.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.270
If I rewrote it from
scratch, it might be good.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.500
But anyway, like I said,
standard tale of woe.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.110
After three years of not being
able to get an agent, not

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.150
being able to get a
publisher interested,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.280
just not being able to
get any traction at all,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.210
I went back into
the tech industry.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.990
And this was not some sad
Charlie Brown music, hang

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.190
your head, shuffle forward.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.180
I like programming.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.140
I like being a
software engineer.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.114
It's a job I enjoy.

00:07:43.114 --> 00:07:44.530
It's one I always
found rewarding.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.940
I'm pretty good at it.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.890
And so I was like, OK,
this is not a bad thing.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.230
I took that time off.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.710
I followed my dream.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.680
I never have to wonder
what might have been.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.670
Now I've done it.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.160
Now I can move on with life
and get back into programming,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.450
which I enjoy.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.250
So then around
this time, though,

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.800
is this newfangled
internet thing

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.690
was starting to get popular.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.360
And I realized, oh, I can
just write as a hobby,

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.790
and I can post things online,
and people can read it.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:16.621
Why not?

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:17.620
So I started doing that.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.505
I made a website, and I
posted short stories and web

00:08:21.505 --> 00:08:23.740
comics and serial fiction.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.870
And I did that
for like 10 years,

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.440
and very slowly built
up a mailing list

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.090
of about 3,000 people.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.610
Now, that sounds like a lot,
but 10 years is also a lot.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.470
So this isn't some
fantastic performance here.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.909
And it was my hobby.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:47.379
Around 2009, I started
one of three serials

00:08:47.379 --> 00:08:49.420
that I had going on on my
site at the same time I

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.680
started writing "The Martian."

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.859
And it was just another serial.

00:08:52.859 --> 00:08:54.400
The idea of "The
Martian" came about,

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.380
because I was sitting
around one day thinking,

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.360
how could we do a
manned mission to Mars?

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.560
I'm going to work out
the details of that,

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.309
not for a fiction
story, not for anything.

00:09:01.309 --> 00:09:02.690
Just how would we do it?

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.149
How do we get the
astronauts there?

00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:06.023
How do we keep them
alive when they're there?

00:09:06.023 --> 00:09:07.150
How do we get them back?

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.920
What do we do, if
this thing breaks?

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.480
What do we do if
that thing breaks?

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.610
What if these two
things both break?

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.860
How do we build redundancy
into the mission, such

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.956
that the people don't just die
at the first sign of trouble?

00:09:17.956 --> 00:09:20.080
And I'm like, well, what
if all these things break?

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.880
What if all these
things go wrong?

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.280
And the kind of increasingly
desperate things

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.920
that the crew would have
to do to stay alive,

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.390
I was like, this might
make an interesting story.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.990
So I created an
unfortunate protagonist

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.890
and subjected him
to all of them.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.090
For I am a small,
petty little god.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.812
So anyway, I started
writing that as a serial,

00:09:42.812 --> 00:09:44.020
and it was doing really well.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.170
I'd get a lot of feedback from
my readers and science and math

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.480
corrections from my
readers, because my readers

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.830
are all dorks like me.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.410
And there's nothing a dork
likes doing better than double

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:57.040
checking the math in
a fictional story.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.070
Dear Sir, I noticed on page 14--

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:01.570
yeah.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.190
But that was great,
because it was

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.590
like unintentional
crowdsourced fact-checking,

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:06.880
and it was fantastic.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.885
It helped me make "The
Martian" accurate.

00:10:08.885 --> 00:10:11.260
And while I was writing it,
accuracy was really important

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.180
to me, because I'm
a science dork,

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:17.240
and I love scientific accuracy.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.960
But actually, it's not
a requirement for me.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.780
What is a requirement for me to
enjoy a science fiction or even

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.570
fantasy story is consistency.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.344
If you set up the
rules of a universe,

00:10:27.344 --> 00:10:29.260
I want you to follow the
rules of the universe

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.460
that you set up.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.350
You've got a spaceship
that can go Warp 9.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.046
No problem.

00:10:33.046 --> 00:10:34.420
You can go way
faster than light?

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.170
No problem.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.210
Those are the rules of
the universe you set up.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.932
But then later on,
there's an episode

00:10:38.932 --> 00:10:40.390
of "Star Trek,"
classic Trek, where

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.030
they got to go from Mercury to
Earth, and it takes a while.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.470
I'm like, no.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.860
Mercury's eight light
minutes away from Earth.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.220
If you can go Warp 9, it's
not going to take a while.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.612
Dear Sirs.

00:10:52.612 --> 00:10:56.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.800
So for me, it's all
about consistency,

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.540
and I've found that the
easiest way to be consistent

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.690
is just to follow all the laws
of physics in the first place,

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:09.320
because physics is very
good at being consistent,

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.350
rather aggressively so.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:13.982
So I did a bunch
of research, and I

00:11:13.982 --> 00:11:16.190
made sure all the science
was accurate or as accurate

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.330
as I could make it.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.880
I did make a few concessions.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.620
For starters, it is
now rather famous.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.590
The sandstorm at
the beginning that

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.630
causes all the problems
in "The Martian"

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.460
could not actually happen.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.180
On Mars, they do get sandstorms
of 150 kilometers an hour,

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:36.290
but the density of the
atmosphere is less than 1%

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:37.040
of Earth's.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.890
So if you were standing
out in a sandstorm on Mars,

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.767
it would feel like a
very gentle breeze.

00:11:42.767 --> 00:11:44.600
It would have a difficult
time knocking over

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.400
just a folded piece of paper,
let alone a 27-ton spacecraft.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.290
And I knew that when
I was writing it

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:52.310
that that was bullshit.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.240
I knew it.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.450
But I'm like, I had another
idea for a beginning.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.150
I considered, oh, they're
going to do an MAV engine test,

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.205
and then something goes wrong,
and then they have to launch,

00:12:02.205 --> 00:12:03.830
and it's kind of like
space camp, where

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.870
they have a thermal curtain
failure or something like that.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:06.680
I don't know.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.850
But I could have come
up with some equipment

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.700
failure that caused the problem,
rather than a natural event.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.580
But it's a survival story.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.470
It's a person
versus nature story,

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.600
and I wanted nature to
get the first punch in.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.940
So I just said, eh, I'm going
to be inaccurate on this.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.800
Most people don't
know this anyway.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.530
It's not really going
to affect anything.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.610
So yeah, and then later,
the book got really popular,

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.530
got made into a movie,
and now everybody knows

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.970
that that's really unrealistic.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.860
So I kind of shot myself in
the foot there, but that's OK.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.550
I'll take it.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:39.050
Let's see.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.630
Other things in the
book are inaccurate,

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:46.719
because they became
inaccurate after I wrote them.

00:12:46.719 --> 00:12:47.760
So I wrote "The Martian."

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.540
It was already in the
production pipeline,

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.440
and only when it was actually
at the printers at Random House

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.430
were they--

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.490
did JPL land Curiosity on Mars.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:02.020
And in "The Martian," he's like,
oh, at the time I wrote it,

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.576
it was believed that Mars
was almost completely arid,

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:06.200
that there would be
no water available,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.420
except maybe a little
bit at the poles.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.860
And so in the story, Mark
has to do chemical reduction

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.510
of hydrazine to
liberate the hydrogen,

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.480
then collect carbon dioxide
from the Martian atmosphere,

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.890
separate out the
carbon, and he's

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:21.110
got the hydrogen and the oxygen,
and he carefully put them

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.443
together and accidentally
blows himself up a little bit.

00:13:23.443 --> 00:13:24.680
But then we have water.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.380
Yay.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.050
He grows crops.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.300
So then Curiosity landed
on Mars and took one scoop

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.633
and went, hey, there's a
shitload of water in this soil.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.970
Turns out for every cubic
meter of Martian regolith,

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.970
there's about 35
liters of water in it.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.430
So if you filled your
refrigerator with Martian soil,

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.730
and then pulled all
the water out of it,

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.040
you'd have 35 two-liter
bottles full of water.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.690
So all you had to do
is heat up some dirt.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.934
But that's not my
fault, because that

00:13:57.934 --> 00:14:00.350
was the prevailing knowledge
at the time I wrote the book.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.930
However, I will
say that Curiosity

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.900
is running around in
Gale Crater right now

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.310
at the base of
Mount Sharp, which

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.726
is on the other
side of the planet

00:14:08.726 --> 00:14:11.780
from Acidalia Planitia, which
is where Mark Watney was.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.450
And so I can just say
that just as Earth

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:18.260
has various different tropical
and climatological zones,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.670
I can claim that
Mars does as well.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.040
So I can say that Acidalia
Planitia is a desert.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.123
No one can prove me wrong
until they send a probe.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.470
They also almost
landed Curiosity right

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.110
in Mawrth Vallis.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.120
When they narrowed down
Curiosity's landing site

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.270
to one of four spots,
one of the four finalists

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.200
was Mawrth Vallis.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.650
They eventually chose Gale
Crater, where it is now.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.939
But Mawrth Vallis was
one of the things.

00:14:45.939 --> 00:14:48.480
And I'm like, oh, god, please
don't land it in Mawrth Vallis,

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.030
because Mark goes right
through Mawrth Vallis.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.580
I would have to explain why
he went around Curiosity

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.040
and continued on
his isolated quest.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.420
Fortunately, they didn't.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.580
Anyway, going back
to where I was,

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.790
I was writing "The Martian"
as a serial, and it came out.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:09.664
I post a new chapter maybe
once every six to eight weeks,

00:15:09.664 --> 00:15:11.580
and I'd get a lot of
feedback from my readers.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.250
And I could tell that was the
serial they liked the most.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.550
And being the
external validation

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.950
junkie that I am, that
encouraged me to write more

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.260
of "The Martian" more quickly.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.842
Eventually, I finished it,
and I posted the last chapter

00:15:24.842 --> 00:15:27.300
and said, hey, everybody, I
hope you enjoyed "The Martian."

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.330
I'm just going to continue
working on my other serials

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.380
or whatever.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.330
And then I started to
get email from folks

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.180
that say like, hey, Andy,
I loved "The Martian,"

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.894
but I hate your
website, which is fair.

00:15:39.894 --> 00:15:41.310
If you've ever
been to my website,

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.570
I made it all by myself.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.202
And it's just like a white
background with blue hyperlinks

00:15:47.202 --> 00:15:48.660
that are left
justified, literally.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.474
That's it.

00:15:49.474 --> 00:15:50.890
And it's like you
click a chapter,

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.390
and it's like, here
is wall of text.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.100
Enjoy.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.210
There's nothing.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.820
It's like no decor, no nothing.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.710
It's really an
unpleasant experience.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.990
And so they said,
so I don't really

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.060
like reading it on a webpage.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.520
Can you make an
e-reader version?

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.789
Can you just do that?

00:16:06.789 --> 00:16:09.080
And so I'm like, sure, so I
figured out how to do that.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.100
And I made an EPUB
and a MOBI version.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.200
And I posted them on my website,
and I'm like, there you go,

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.567
folks.

00:16:16.567 --> 00:16:18.150
You can read it in
the website, or you

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.130
can download an
e-reader version,

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.660
and knock yourself out.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:22.680
OK.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.690
So then I got other
email from people saying,

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:29.070
hey, Andy, I love "The
Martian," hate your site.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.750
I'm not very
technically savvy, and I

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:33.180
don't know how to download
a thing from the internet

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.190
and put it on my e-reader.

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.530
Can you just post it to Amazon?

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.330
Can you just put it up
so that I can get it

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.250
through Kindle's stuff?

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.520
And then I can do that.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.790
I'm like, OK.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.350
So I figured out how to do that.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:47.520
Isn't that hard.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.680
Put it up on Kindle
Direct Publishing,

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.880
but they do make you charge.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.910
You can't give
things away for free.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:56.220
Amazon actually loses money
on every Kindle they sell.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.479
They make their money off of the
book sales, the e-book sales,

00:16:59.479 --> 00:17:01.770
so they don't want people
giving away content for free.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.150
You're not allowed to.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:07.230
So I set the price to a minimum
99-- the minimum of 99 cents,

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:12.599
which earned to me a cool $0.30
a copy I'll have you know.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:17.099
And then I posted it to Kindle.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:20.880
And then nothing happens
for about 48 hours.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.441
Amazon would have a human-- has
a human scan through what you

00:17:24.441 --> 00:17:26.940
post real quickly just to make
sure it's not a bunch of goat

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.060
porn or something.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.680
Well, don't judge.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.640
But then when they're done,
then when they're done,

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.530
just making sure it's
correctly categorized,

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.090
if it does have goat porn.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.390
Then they'll post it
up there for sale.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:44.190
And so then I'm
like, OK, everybody,

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.470
now you can read "The Martian"
for free on my website,

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.830
or you can download the
e-reader and side load it

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.080
onto your Kindle, or
you can pay Amazon

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.390
a buck to put it on
your Kindle for you.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.190
And people paid the buck.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.770
It's just like, I
guess, first off,

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.630
99 cents is not a lot of money.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.180
And second off,
it's just people are

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.246
much more willing to
part with 99 cents

00:18:05.246 --> 00:18:06.870
than they are to
figure out how to side

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.540
load things onto a Kindle.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:14.010
So it started selling well,
got around good word of mouth.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.124
People started giving
it really good reviews,

00:18:16.124 --> 00:18:17.790
and it started climbing
up into the best

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.290
sellers of science
fiction, and then

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.420
the best sellers on all Kindle.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:25.440
And then that started to get
the attention of the big shots

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.450
in New York in the
publishing industry,

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.690
and I got an email from a guy
named David Fugate, who said,

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:33.540
hey, do you have an agent?

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.672
And I'm like, no, I don't.

00:18:34.672 --> 00:18:35.880
I was never able to find one.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.879
He's like, I'm an agent.

00:18:36.879 --> 00:18:39.210
You want one?

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.920
I'm like, sure.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.410
And then I got contacted by
Penguin Random House saying

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:44.760
like, hey, we're
interested in maybe doing

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.968
a print edition of your book.

00:18:45.968 --> 00:18:49.290
And I'm like, talk to my agent.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:50.891
So everything went
backwards for me.

00:18:50.891 --> 00:18:52.890
I mean usually an author
has to work his ass off

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.590
to get those things, and then
I have them coming and knocking

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.640
at my door.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.440
And those two
started negotiating.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.910
My agent and Random
House started

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:03.222
negotiating the deal
for the print edition,

00:19:03.222 --> 00:19:05.430
because I can see from the
publisher's point of view,

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.410
it's like, well, this
is a proven seller.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.300
We're not taking a
risk on a new author.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.150
We see that this
is going to sell.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.240
So it was a safe bet for them.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.257
Then 20th Century
Fox came and said,

00:19:17.257 --> 00:19:18.340
we'd like the film rights.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.660
And I'm like, cool,
talk to my agent.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.390
And my agent said, talk
to my colleague, who

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.370
is a film agent specialist.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.722
So now I've got people.

00:19:28.722 --> 00:19:30.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:34.860
And they're all working on
this, and so my literary agent

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.810
is talking to Random
House about my book deal.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:41.010
My film agent is talking to
Fox about the movie deal,

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.380
and I am sitting in
my cubicle at work

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.570
fixing bugs, because
that's what I still

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:47.121
do for a living at this point.

00:19:47.121 --> 00:19:48.870
I'm in my cubicle
fixing bugs, running off

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.520
to take a call
about my movie deal,

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.200
then back to fixing bugs--

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.970
very surreal experience.

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:58.030
And those two deals came
together four days apart.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.320
Yes.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.740
Everyone told me, don't get
excited about the movie deal.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.080
The movie studios come and
option pretty much any book

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.850
that they think is
going to do well.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.725
They're probably never
going to make a movie.

00:20:08.725 --> 00:20:10.550
Don't worry about it.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.040
So anyway, the book--

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.530
we went through an editing
process that was fairly simple.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.900
It wasn't that complicated.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.130
Got through all the edits.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.310
The editor was really cool.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.100
It was a neat process,
although kind of

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.570
frustrating at the time.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:27.610
But most of the editing
notes are like, OK,

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.380
you can't just have
a conversation--

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.090
you can't just have a scene
be nothing but a conversation.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:34.040
You've got to tell
me where they are.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.660
You've got to tell me, are
they in a meeting room?

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.770
Are they walking down a hall?

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:36.830
What?

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.130
Give me some context.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.810
So just kind of rookie
writing errors here and there.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:45.770
But got it cleaned up a bit,
and then it went off to print.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.260
And then I had to wait
a year, which is just--

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.700
oh, the publishing industry.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.970
It just moves like
snail snot in September.

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:57.932
It's just painfully slow, but
then it eventually came out.

00:20:57.932 --> 00:20:59.390
During this time,
the film industry

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.990
is like, yeah, "The
Martian," whatever.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:06.830
We have a film option, if
we care, which we don't.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.830
So anyway, the book came
out, and it sold really well.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.770
It climbed up the New York
Times bestseller list.

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:15.830
It started doing really, really
well and getting a lot of press

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.060
and a lot of attention.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.710
That made the film
industry's start

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.660
to pay more attention as well.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:25.350
They got the lovely and
talented Drew Goddard in,

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.550
who's a veteran Hollywood
writer and director.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.220
He directed "Cabin
in the Woods."

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.740
He wrote chunks
of "Cloverfield."

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.870
He was one of the staff writers
on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.860
He's like kind of in
Joss Whedon's orbit,

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.680
partially, ends up working
on a lot of stuff that--

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.800
for those of you, who saw "Dr.
Horrible's Sing-Along Blog,"

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.850
he was one of the evil
League of Evil members.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.970
He was fake Thomas
Jefferson, so yeah.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:54.890
That, I told him,
was what I considered

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:59.800
his true seminal
role, and he agreed.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:04.490
But yeah, so he wrote he
wrote a fantastic screenplay

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.980
for "The Martian," and he
was set to direct it, too.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.520
He was going to
direct, and everything

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.950
is subject to getting
greenlighted by the studio.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.840
But you're basically--
the way things work

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.060
is they kind of work on
the movie half-assedly

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.115
until the studio says,
OK, we're doing this.

00:22:19.115 --> 00:22:20.240
Here's a big pile of money.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.190
Actually, make it happen.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.330
So he wrote the screenplay.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:25.730
He was going to
direct it, and then

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.180
they were also shipping
the screenplay out

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:34.010
to big name actors to be the
lead, because the studio said,

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.410
look, this is such
a one-man show,

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:40.280
like "The Martian" is so
heavily focused on one character

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.869
that we need a big
name to be that guy.

00:22:43.869 --> 00:22:46.160
There's no way we can do this
unless we have a big name

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.490
actor in that spot.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.970
So they sent him out
to these A-list actors,

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:52.580
and Matt Damon said,
yeah, that sounds cool.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.660
I'll play that role.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.940
And the studio's
like, OK, fantastic.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.100
And then Drew Goddard left the
project, because he had to go--

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.100
because he had been offered
the director's chair

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.410
for the next "Spider
Man" movie by Sony.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:05.800
So now we went from having
a director and no star

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.674
to having a star
and no director.

00:23:07.674 --> 00:23:09.590
And so the studio said,
all right, well, we're

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.548
looking for a director.

00:23:10.548 --> 00:23:14.990
And Ridley Scott said, I'll
direct, and they're like, OK.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.940
So then they had Ridley Scott
and Matt Damon attached,

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.360
and that's when they really
started to take it seriously.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.390
All these other major names
started taking an interest

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:24.320
in the project.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.750
We got an unbelievable,
fantastic cast.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.700
And at some point in
there, there's never

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.241
like a point where
they're just like,

00:23:30.241 --> 00:23:31.460
this movie is greenlighted.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.674
It's just you keep
edging toward it.

00:23:33.674 --> 00:23:35.090
There's no point
where you realize

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:36.836
that you pop the champagne.

00:23:36.836 --> 00:23:38.460
There's just a point
where you realize,

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.665
oh, yeah, they apparently made
this decision a few weeks ago

00:23:41.665 --> 00:23:43.790
that we're doing this,
because eventually, one day,

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.217
they're like, oh, they're
building sets now.

00:23:46.217 --> 00:23:47.300
I'm like, OK, that's good.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:47.800
That's good.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.090
And it's like, OK.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:52.190
But when it's really
kind of officially

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:53.875
in progress is when
they start shooting,

00:23:53.875 --> 00:23:55.250
because once they
start shooting,

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.930
all the contracts activate.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:58.430
So once they shoot
that first scene,

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:01.581
they're on the hook to pay
the actors for all their--

00:24:01.581 --> 00:24:03.080
through the whole
project and stuff.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.210
And at that point, they're
pretty much committed.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:08.030
And so finally, I was just
waiting on the phone for them

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.550
to tell me that they shot that
first scene, and they did.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.120
And I was like, yeah, yeah.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.740
They shot the
whole film in Bud--

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:20.090
well, they shot all the studio
work in Budapest, Hungary

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:25.460
at this huge, huge soundstage
called Korda Studios.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.970
It's in Budapest, and it's
like one of the biggest

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:30.050
soundstages in the world.

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:32.480
A lot of the shots that
you probably thought

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.970
were done outdoors were indoors.

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:38.240
So the whole HAB, the
exterior of the HAB

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.150
and the surrounding area
was all inside of a studio.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.880
It was really incredible.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.470
And Ridley is such a fan of
practical effects that a lot

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.680
of that stuff that you
think is CGI isn't.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.130
So the astronauts walking
through the sandstorm

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.440
and stumbling around
and stuff like that--

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.480
they were stumbling
around, because they

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.230
had these huge freaking fans
pointed at them blowing sand

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.277
in their faces.

00:25:05.277 --> 00:25:06.860
And the only reason
they could breathe

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.900
was because they
were in spacesuits,

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.190
which was kind of cool.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:13.760
And everyone in the cast and
crew had these breather masks

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.595
and goggles on,
and all the cameras

00:25:15.595 --> 00:25:17.720
had to have all these
baggies all over them to keep

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.370
them protected from the sand.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:22.190
That's how Ridley rolls.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:24.770
So anyway, yeah, you
kind of know the rest.

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:25.730
The movie came out.

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:27.830
It was a huge success.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:31.880
Oh, they shot the
location work in a desert

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.850
called Wadi Rum in
Jordan, northern Jordan.

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:36.950
And so those exteriors--

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:39.440
those mostly are not CGI.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.060
Those are just-- that's what
Wadi Rum, Jordan looks like.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:44.960
It's awesome.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.530
They did CGI the sky to
make it red like Mars

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:51.560
is supposed to be, and get
rid of the clouds and stuff.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.351
And they add a few like
kind of craggy mountains

00:25:54.351 --> 00:25:55.100
in the background.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.516
But for the most
part, it was just

00:25:56.516 --> 00:26:01.610
straight up shooting
in Wadi Rum.

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:03.140
I did not go to the set.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.400
They invited me to go.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.257
I'm afraid of flying, and I
didn't want to go to Budapest.

00:26:07.257 --> 00:26:08.090
So how'd I get here?

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:09.260
I flew.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.850
My buddy Valium.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:12.190
Valium's my friend.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:17.629
I pop Valium like Pez now to
do these freaking book tours.

00:26:17.629 --> 00:26:18.920
I've been all over the country.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.490
I'm one of the most
well-traveled aviophobes

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.410
you'll ever meet.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:28.394
But yeah, so I did get to meet
all the famous people, though,

00:26:28.394 --> 00:26:29.060
at the premiere.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.990
I got to go to the premiere,
and so I got to meet Matt Damon.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.130
I got to meet Ridley
Scott, Jessica Chastain.

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:35.450
It was really cool.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:36.590
And you kind of--

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.190
you fantasize
about these things,

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:40.790
but you never really think
they're going to come true.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.135
It just seems like--

00:26:42.135 --> 00:26:43.760
now it just seems
like a dream, like it

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.430
was some weird thing
I daydreamed about,

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:50.300
and then just kind
of-- then it passed.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.630
The movie finished.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:52.460
It left theaters.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.210
"The Martian" went back
down to like nominal sales

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:59.450
in the great hockey
stick that is book sales,

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.270
and then everything kind
of returned to normalcy.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.730
And it was like, did
that even happen?

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:06.620
And according to
my bank account,

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:07.850
yeah, it really happened.

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:14.417
So then, of course,
the publisher

00:27:14.417 --> 00:27:15.500
is like, all right, great.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.190
Good job.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:17.180
What's next?

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.830
I'm like, hm?

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:19.800
And they're like, yeah.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.900
So write another book.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.280
I'm like, oh, yeah, no,
definitely not a case

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.990
for me to get really
nervous and suffer

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.900
through a year of
imposter syndrome.

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.740
And yeah, there's a saying
in the writing world, which

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:37.107
is, "Give a man a book, and
you entertain him for a night.

00:27:37.107 --> 00:27:38.690
Teach a man to write,
and you give him

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.010
crippling self-doubt for life."

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:47.110
And so I spent a year
working on another book,

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.900
and this one was called "Zhek."

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:49.980
It wasn't "Artemis".

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:54.510
This was called "Zhek," Z-H-E-K.
And I got 70,000 words into it

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.190
over the course of a year.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:59.820
For reference, "The Martian"
is 105,000 words long, so about

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.290
like 3/4 of a book, 2/3.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:07.260
And at about the 70,000-word
mark, I was like, oh,

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.180
this sucks.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.310
I mean I was like, I can't--

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.060
it's fighting me.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.650
It wasn't fun to read.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.540
It wasn't fun to think about.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.580
The plots weren't
coming together right.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.560
The characters were
not interesting,

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.830
and it broke my cardinal rule,
which is, if you're writing,

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.950
you should always write
a book that you yourself

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:27.240
would enjoy reading.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.790
And I'm like, I would've
put this book down 50 pages

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:31.860
ago and never
picked it up again.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.092
And I could not figure
out how to fix it.

00:28:34.092 --> 00:28:35.550
So I went to the
publisher, and I'd

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.008
been kind of in
the back of my mind

00:28:37.008 --> 00:28:39.510
thinking up "Artemis",
how the city would work.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.990
I didn't have characters or
story or plot, but I was like,

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.990
what will humanity--

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.010
and the same way
with "The Martian."

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.290
It started out with me
daydreaming about how

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:50.890
to do a manned mission to Mars.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:53.220
Well, "Artemis," I was like,
how does humanity build

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.482
its first city on the moon?

00:28:55.482 --> 00:28:56.940
And I thought about
all the details

00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.360
of how to get there,
how you build your city.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.160
You'd need nuclear
reactors, because you

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.720
need to smelt anorthite.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.180
Anorthite is a mineral that's
extremely common on the moon,

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:10.500
and it gives you aluminum and
oxygen when you break it apart.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.740
So it gives you aluminum to
build your moon city and oxygen

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.490
to fill it.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:16.980
It's like the moon is
just saying, come on.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.270
Colonize me.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.760
You know you want to.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.819
And so I was working
on all that stuff when

00:29:22.819 --> 00:29:24.360
I should have been
working on "Zhek,"

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.943
and it was way more
interesting to me.

00:29:25.943 --> 00:29:28.260
And I called the publisher,
and I'd been feeding them

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.940
chapters of "Zhek."

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.240
And I called them
up, and I said, look,

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.160
I want to hit the
big red reset button.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.236
I want to put "Zhek"
on a back burner,

00:29:38.236 --> 00:29:40.360
and I want to work on a
completely different story.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.100
And I want you to add a year
to the deadline, if that's OK.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.910
And they said, yeah, sure,
way more quickly than I feel

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:49.781
was comfortable.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.862
They wholeheartedly
agreed that "Zhek"

00:29:54.862 --> 00:29:57.070
should be put on a back
burner and that I should work

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.860
on literally anything else.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.049
So I feel like it was
really a good decision.

00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:04.090
And so that's what I did.

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.548
I put "Zhek" on a
back burner, then

00:30:05.548 --> 00:30:10.800
turned off the back burner,
and then I worked on "Artemis".

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.550
So for "Artemis", like
I said, I started--

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.360
I defined the entire
city in advance.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.570
I worked out-- first thing I had
to do was work out its economy.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:22.090
I'm like, OK, why build
a city on the moon?

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:23.150
What are you doing?

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.630
Why the hell would
anybody move to the moon?

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.970
Cities don't get built
just because it's awesome.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.400
Cities get built for
economic reasons.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.380
So what is the
economy of "Artemis?"

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.899
Why does it exist?

00:30:33.899 --> 00:30:36.190
And you go through the standard
science fiction tropes,

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:37.674
and they don't really fit.

00:30:37.674 --> 00:30:40.090
You're like, oh, well, because
we needed to mine the moon.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:41.980
It's like, well,
then send robots.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.420
Nobody cares if your robot dies.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.000
People do care if
Uncle Hank dies.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.380
So send robots.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.810
Or well, the Earth
is overpopulated.

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.760
Then colonize the ocean.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.410
Any part of this
planet is easier

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:55.750
to colonize than any part of
the moon, I guarantee you.

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.750
It's like, oh, there's
political oppression.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.800
Well, if you can
get to the moon,

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.250
if you can afford to
build a city on the moon,

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.220
you're not the oppressed.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:09.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:13.170
And so on, all these ideas like,
oh, the environment of Earth--

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.120
oh, fuck you.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.150
It is so much easy--

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:17.920
whatever our problems
may be on Earth,

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.300
however bad the
environment gets,

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.508
it's always going to be
easier to fix the environment

00:31:21.508 --> 00:31:24.490
than it is to colonize
another planet.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:26.669
If nothing else, you
could colonize Earth.

00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:28.210
I mean you could
literally-- whatever

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.730
you're going to make on the
moon, make it on Earth, right?

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.600
So I decided the only
plausible explanation

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.822
for Artemis's economy
would be tourism,

00:31:39.822 --> 00:31:41.530
because tourism is,
by definition, humans

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:42.677
being somewhere.

00:31:42.677 --> 00:31:45.010
So I said, how do you get a
tourist economy on the moon?

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:46.900
Well, the only explanation
is that the price

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.240
to low-Earth orbit
has been driven down

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.760
by competition in the
commercial space industry.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.970
And so I did this whole
economic analysis.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.770
There's a 3,000-word essay I
wrote that "Business Insider"

00:31:57.770 --> 00:31:58.270
has.

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.228
You can find it on their
website, if you like--

00:32:00.228 --> 00:32:02.620
about what I think the
price to low-Earth orbit

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.530
could get driven down to
if the commercial space

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:09.370
industry got as efficient as
the commercial airline industry.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:11.410
And I define
"efficient" as being

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:14.410
they spend the same percentage
of their revenue on fuel

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.810
as the commercial
airline industry.

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:18.520
And I also assume
that technically,

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.990
that a profit-hungry
industry would

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:23.020
solve all the technical
and engineering challenges

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.450
of making the reusable
rockets, making

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:28.294
full use of the specific impulse
of a hydrogen oxygen fuel,

00:32:28.294 --> 00:32:29.710
and all the other
fun stuff that's

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:31.418
going on in the space
industry right now,

00:32:31.418 --> 00:32:33.610
all the other
unsolved questions.

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:36.610
And I came up with it actually
doesn't cost that much.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:39.940
It would end up-- if it followed
the model of the airline

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.550
industry, it would end up
costing you about 7,000 bucks

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:46.090
to put a human into low-Earth
orbit and about 35 bucks

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.575
per kilogram, which
is about 1/100

00:32:48.575 --> 00:32:50.200
of what it costs
right now, by the way.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.320
So huge room for improvement.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.310
Of course, this is
amateur hour economics.

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:59.561
But I'm not-- an
entire country isn't

00:32:59.561 --> 00:33:01.810
going to go into a decade-long
recession if I'm wrong.

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:05.530
I'm just trying to make the
basis of a fiction story.

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:07.540
But with that, you
have an opportunity

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:11.260
for the middle class to
afford vacations to the moon.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.250
It's a lot.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:14.020
It's not casual.

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:16.600
Grand total I worked out
that in 2015 dollars, which

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:20.170
is when I did the math, you
could take a lunar vacation.

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:23.770
You could go there, spend two
weeks there, then come back,

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:27.960
and it would cost you about
$70,000 in 2015 dollars.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.780
Now, that's a lot of money.

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.710
But a lot of people would get a
second mortgage on their house

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:36.080
if it meant they could go to
the moon for two weeks, I think.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.490
And so that's the
economy of Artemis.

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:42.310
And it wasn't until I
worked out the entire city--

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:44.050
I'm like, OK,
that's the economy.

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:45.910
To build it, you need
to smelt anorthite,

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:48.534
which is a mineral that's found
all over the place in the lunar

00:33:48.534 --> 00:33:49.690
highlands.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:52.390
Smelting anorthite takes
a ludicrously huge amount

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:53.570
of energy.

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:56.400
So you have to have
nuclear reactors.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.270
Give up on doing this
with solar power.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:00.610
You would need to ship
so many solar panels

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.940
to the moon to power
an aluminum smelting

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:05.710
facility that it
would be cheaper

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:09.340
to ship the city to the moon.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:12.850
And OK, so now I know I'm
going to need nuclear reactors.

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:15.340
And I'm going to want to
protect the people inside

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.130
from radiation and
hole punctures,

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.560
so Artemis's holes
are six centimeters

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.449
of aluminum followed by
a meter of crushed lunar

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:26.560
regolith followed by another
six centimeters of aluminum.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.090
And that's mainly
to protect Artemis

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:30.280
from the people who live
inside, because some idiot

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.170
with a rivet gun
can pop your hole.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:36.520
Well, he can only
pop one of them.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.130
Anyway, so only
once I'd designed

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.380
the entire city did
I start thinking

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:42.489
about plots and stories.

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:44.364
And I went through a
whole bunch of revisions

00:34:44.364 --> 00:34:47.770
before I finally landed on
the one that I have there.

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.263
So now, it's just released.

00:34:50.263 --> 00:34:52.679
And I just found out it's going
to be, I think, number six

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:55.739
on the New York Times bestseller
list this upcoming week.

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:56.885
This is when you clap.

00:34:56.885 --> 00:35:00.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.550
OK, so that's kind of the
end of my prepared bit.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:07.670
I'll take questions
until about 1:45 or so.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:10.520
AUDIENCE: So you described
the whole process of a week

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.470
at a time, a week
at a time, and then

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:16.970
realizing that it was happening.

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:21.140
At what point did you say,
OK, now I can quit my day job?

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.130
ANDY WEIR: Yeah, well,
that's a good question.

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:25.213
So at the time, I was
working for a company called

00:35:25.213 --> 00:35:26.612
MobileIron, and we did--

00:35:26.612 --> 00:35:28.070
I mean I could tell
you what we do,

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:29.320
but it would put you to sleep.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.960
But basically, B2B mobile
phone security stuff.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.960
But I really liked my job, so I
actually hung on to my day job

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.490
a lot longer than I needed to.

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:40.760
"The Martian" was already out
in bookstores on the New York

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.710
Times best seller
list before I finally

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:46.260
quit my day job to go full time
on writing, because I liked it.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.540
I liked being a programmer.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.040
And that's one of
the biggest things

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.490
I miss about being an engineer
is being part of a team.

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:54.770
I miss an office atmosphere.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:55.980
I'm an extroverted guy.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.914
I like to come into
work in the morning

00:35:57.914 --> 00:35:59.080
and say, hey, how you doing?

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.350
Hey, let's get some coffee.

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:01.231
Hey, how's your dog?

00:36:01.231 --> 00:36:01.730
He was sick.

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:02.271
Is he better?

00:36:02.271 --> 00:36:06.249
You know, just that part of
life and that social experience

00:36:06.249 --> 00:36:08.540
of being part of a team, and
we're all working together

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.670
on a project, that's gone now.

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:12.200
I'm just by myself in my office.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.130
I mean it's not--

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:14.690
I'm not in a little
basement with

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:16.070
a flickering fluorescent light.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:18.110
I live with my girlfriend
and stuff like that.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:23.390
But it's still I miss having
that kind of work life

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:24.110
social group.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.280
And it's gone now.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.500
And so I didn't
want to let that go,

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.507
and so I hung onto the
job way beyond where

00:36:29.507 --> 00:36:30.590
I needed it to make money.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:33.740
I was just hanging on.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:37.760
But I did finally leave about
two months after the book came

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.180
out, because I needed to
work full time on-- well,

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.120
at the time, "Zhek," because I
had signed a deal with Random

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.350
House.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:48.100
So that was my job now.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.885
AUDIENCE: About a year ago,
Sam Ramji joined Google.

00:36:50.885 --> 00:36:51.510
ANDY WEIR: Hey.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:52.940
Yes, Sam Ramji.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.310
AUDIENCE: As a VP, which
makes him my boss's boss,

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:56.170
and he sent me with a question.

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:57.320
ANDY WEIR: Your grand boss.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.105
AUDIENCE: Yes, exactly right.

00:36:59.105 --> 00:37:00.230
He sent me with a question.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:02.889
He wants to know if
you polished his dice.

00:37:02.889 --> 00:37:03.680
ANDY WEIR: Oh, yes.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.670
Absolutely.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:06.920
So Sam Ramji and I--

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.010
Sam Ramji is one of
my closest friends.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:13.190
He's one of my college buddies,
and we've been together,

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:15.800
we've been buddies ever since.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:20.480
He was our GM when we
played D&amp;D. And so one time

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:25.910
he went away for like a
couple weeks, and he had--

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.320
we were really into
this D&amp;D campaign.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.450
He's a fantastic GM.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:31.140
He's the best GM I've ever had.

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.900
And we were really
into this campaign,

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.550
and we didn't want
to stop playing.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:36.384
But he was going to
like the Netherlands

00:37:36.384 --> 00:37:37.300
for a couple of weeks.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.900
This is when we were in college.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:42.080
And so he basically,
he had his friend,

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.580
Aaron, be the GM for us.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.360
And so we all played
with Aaron as the GM.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.370
And Aaron was a terrible GM.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.110
He was just this
confrontational,

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:56.810
like actively wanting to kill
the players kind of thing.

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:58.680
And so he was just terrible.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.050
We had a terrible time with him.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:02.330
And so when he came
back, when Sam came back,

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:03.830
we were making all
these jokes like,

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:06.050
hey, we polished
your dice for you.

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:08.120
We can get you all
nice and set up.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.930
So that's what
he's talking about.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:11.690
AUDIENCE: So he actually--

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:16.010
he also said that you had 90%
of his embarrassing stories.

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:17.727
And reviews are
coming up, and I was

00:38:17.727 --> 00:38:19.560
curious if you'd like
to share any of those.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:24.230
ANDY WEIR: Oh, boy.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:27.203
Yeah, I could really do some
damage to him right now.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.017
And I think I shouldn't.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.620
Just at some point,
tell him Schrodinger,

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.600
you must be kidding.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.220
He'll know.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:47.840
AUDIENCE: So you said that you
evaluated [INAUDIBLE] "Zhek"

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.750
and decided it's not
good, but usually it's

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:54.120
really hard for people to look
critically at their own work.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.310
And so what was the process?

00:38:56.310 --> 00:39:01.354
How can you be able to make
this decision by yourself?

00:39:01.354 --> 00:39:03.770
ANDY WEIR: Well, it turns out
I'm very good at self-doubt.

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:08.840
Arrogance and overconfidence--
I don't think anyone

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.890
will accuse me of those traits.

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:13.550
So if anything,
I'm usually way too

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:17.090
critical on my work and kind
of like frozen in analysis

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:21.350
paralysis without being able
to kind of move forward.

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:21.980
It's hard.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:25.550
I guess it's just you put
yourself in a mindset of OK,

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:28.190
clear your mind, and pretend
I have never read this.

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:31.130
Just make believe that this
is brand new material to me.

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:34.000
And I read it, and that's how
I try to analyze the book.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.190
And one of the
tricks I do is when

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:38.690
I'm reading my own
work, as I say,

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:41.300
like, I want to imagine that
it's 2:00 in the morning.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.120
And I'm laying in bed, reading
a bit before I go to sleep,

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:47.510
and I'm like, at what point
do I put the book down

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:48.110
for the night?

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:50.804
Like at what point do I go, OK,
I'm tired, I've got to sleep?

00:39:50.804 --> 00:39:52.220
This is getting a
little slow now,

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.720
so I'm going to put it down.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:57.080
If that's the point where I put
it down, why is it in the book?

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.770
I want to keep you
bastards up all night.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:03.080
So if there's like a
long bit of exposition,

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.630
I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:07.920
No nappy for you.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.390
So I may use parts of "Zhek"
at some point in the future.

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:14.690
I may harvest-- there are
certain plot elements that

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:17.990
were actually really clever, I
feel, that are really usable.

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:19.640
And there was one
character, just one,

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.856
but one character in
there that's really cool.

00:40:21.856 --> 00:40:23.730
And I would love to use
her in another story.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:25.310
So I probably will.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:28.565
Side story-- last night I was
at an event in Bellingham.

00:40:28.565 --> 00:40:30.800
Oh, sorry-- Bellingham.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:36.860
And for some reason, when
talking to the audience,

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.562
the metaphor for "Zhek" being
my baby, and it's like, oh,

00:40:39.562 --> 00:40:41.895
you had to give up on your
baby, and that's been so hard

00:40:41.895 --> 00:40:42.530
and everything like that.

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:43.490
I'm like, we're
really going to want

00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:45.380
to give up on the
baby metaphor here,

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:47.296
because the next thing
I have to tell you is I

00:40:47.296 --> 00:40:48.644
might use "Zhek" for parts.

00:40:48.644 --> 00:40:52.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.150
Also, I aborted "Zhek"
about 3/4 of the way.

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:57.437
Anyway, there you go.

00:40:57.437 --> 00:40:58.270
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:59.569
ANDY WEIR: Sure thing.

00:40:59.569 --> 00:41:01.360
AUDIENCE: Did they do
anything in the movie

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.907
that you found
particularly annoying or?

00:41:03.907 --> 00:41:05.740
ANDY WEIR: Did they do
anything in the film,

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.900
"The Martian," that I found
particularly annoying?

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.070
Somebody clapped at that?

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:11.085
I don't know.

00:41:11.085 --> 00:41:13.210
The only thing I didn't
like was that they left out

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.040
the Aquaman joke.

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.300
That's not in the movie.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.790
My beloved Aquaman joke--
there's a joke in the book,

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:23.170
where Venkat Kapoor-- he's
named Venkat in the book,

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:24.784
not Vincent--

00:41:24.784 --> 00:41:26.200
he looks up at the
stars and goes,

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.430
oh, he's stranded up there.

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:28.750
What must he be thinking?

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.250
What must be going
through his mind?

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:33.100
And then in the book, the
log entry, Watney says like,

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.984
how come Aquaman
can control whales?

00:41:34.984 --> 00:41:35.650
They're mammals.

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:38.510
It makes no sense.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:40.300
And I thought that was funny.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:42.872
But in the movie, they
had that exact scene,

00:41:42.872 --> 00:41:44.080
but they change what he says.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.496
He says, I'm going
to die up here,

00:41:45.496 --> 00:41:47.038
if I have to listen
to anymore disco.

00:41:47.038 --> 00:41:48.121
And I'm like, ah, come on.

00:41:48.121 --> 00:41:48.720
You had it.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:49.350
You had it.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:50.141
It was right there.

00:41:50.141 --> 00:41:52.420
Just do the damn Aquaman joke.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:56.090
So that's really the only
thing that irritated me.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:57.612
The omission.

00:41:57.612 --> 00:42:00.070
AUDIENCE: So your newest book
is about Earth's first colony

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:01.165
being up on the moon.

00:42:01.165 --> 00:42:03.460
It seems like there's a
lot of popular fascination

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:07.210
lately with Mars kind of being
the first [INAUDIBLE] colony.

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:10.050
So why do you think
that's the case?

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:12.550
ANDY WEIR: I thought-- well, I
started off with just saying,

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:14.674
I want to write a story
about humanity's first city

00:42:14.674 --> 00:42:15.790
that's not on Earth.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:18.310
I hadn't specifically
chosen the moon yet.

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:20.030
But I considered some options.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.484
Option number one,
low-Earth orbit.

00:42:22.484 --> 00:42:23.650
Option number two, the moon.

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:24.850
Option number three, Mars.

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:28.210
Those are really the
only viable options.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:30.860
I mean I suppose solar
orbit is one possibility,

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.980
but it doesn't seem likely.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:35.120
So I looked at
those possibilities.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.780
Well, the closest and easiest
to do is low-Earth orbit,

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.600
but there are no natural
resources at all.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.580
So literally, every
gram of that city

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:45.730
would have to be lifted off
of Earth and put into space

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:48.970
and put into low-Earth
orbit and station kept.

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:51.100
The orbit would decay
over time, and that

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.040
means your entire city
could plummet to its doom

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.020
if you didn't
properly maintain it.

00:42:56.020 --> 00:43:00.730
A city sitting on the ground
on a planet or planetary object

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:02.270
doesn't have that problem.

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:04.030
But the main issue
on that is mass.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:06.550
Getting all the mass of a
city up into low-Earth orbit

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.800
is unreasonably expensive.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.102
So you're going to want to
build on the moon or Mars,

00:43:12.102 --> 00:43:13.810
because then you can
use local materials.

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:14.680
You can smelt it.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:18.400
The vast, vast, vast majority
of the mass of Artemis

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.400
is just stuff they
got from the moon--

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.770
aluminum that they
harvested from the moon.

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:26.620
The inside is full of oxygen
that they got from the moon.

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:31.090
They use rock to do masonry
and stuff on the inside,

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:32.710
for the decorations
on the inside.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.600
They can make glass.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.669
Anorthite is aluminum,
silicon, calcium, and oxygen.

00:43:37.669 --> 00:43:40.210
You break those apart, you've
got aluminum to build the base,

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.280
oxygen to breathe-- a lot
of oxygen, by the way,

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.340
so much that the city cannot
possibly breathe it as fast

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:46.600
as you're smelting it.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.790
And so you mix some of that
oxygen with the silicon.

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:50.230
Now you've got glass.

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:55.210
And so you have to do it
on either the moon or Mars.

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:57.480
So now between those
two candidates,

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.340
I want you to imagine you're
standing on a football field,

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.380
and you're at one
goal line, and you're

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:04.990
looking at the other goal line.

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:07.534
I want you to imagine Mars
is at the other goal line.

00:44:07.534 --> 00:44:08.950
If that's the
scale, then the moon

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:11.170
is four inches in front of you.

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:13.600
So it's ludicrously closer.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.150
The idea of colonizing Mars
before we colonize the moon

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:18.910
would be like if the ancient
Britons colonized North America

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:20.095
before they colonized Wales.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.534
It does not make sense.

00:44:25.534 --> 00:44:26.950
That was a "South
Park" reference.

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:30.110
What are you--
frickin' millennials.

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:32.240
All right.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.580
AUDIENCE: So kind of a corollary
to a previous question,

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.050
I'm curious what
your interaction was

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:38.360
with the screenwriters and
the development of the movie

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.580
version of "The Martian" like?

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:43.100
ANDY WEIR: Well, my only
real job on the film

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:45.662
was to cash the check.

00:44:45.662 --> 00:44:47.870
I didn't have any authority
or any say over anything.

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:51.320
I was just an excited guy
peeking in through the window,

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.900
while there were--
but Drew did call me

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.420
almost every day with
technical questions,

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:57.890
because he's a
great writer, but he

00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:59.930
had a lot of questions about the
math and science and physics.

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:01.805
And he wanted it all to
be true and accurate.

00:45:01.805 --> 00:45:03.221
So he called me
with a lot of that

00:45:03.221 --> 00:45:05.960
and the occasional creative
question, but mostly technical

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:06.807
questions.

00:45:06.807 --> 00:45:08.390
And then, while they
were shooting it,

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:11.210
occasionally, Ridley
would call or email

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:14.175
with other technical
questions, like, oh, we

00:45:14.175 --> 00:45:16.550
want to have a scene where
we're showing Mark do this out

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:17.290
on the surface of Mars.

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:17.960
Does that work?

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:18.750
Could you do that?

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:19.850
Is that realistic?

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:23.890
Ridley Scott definitely does
not need my creative advice.

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:25.620
But so I was
included in that way.

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.470
So I guess you could
say they utilized me

00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:31.640
as a resource for
fact-checking, kind of.

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:36.400
But yeah, for the most
part, I was just, hi, guys.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.500
What you doing over there?

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:40.850
Sure thing.

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:41.420
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:44.172
I was just wondering, as a
fan of hard science fiction,

00:45:44.172 --> 00:45:46.130
when you were trying to
get the book published,

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:48.189
are there pressures
to sort of try

00:45:48.189 --> 00:45:50.480
and make it more accessible
to a more general audience?

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.229
Or do they just sort
of give you free rein

00:45:52.229 --> 00:45:54.620
and say, write what you
want, and we'll publish it?

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:56.570
ANDY WEIR: Are we talking
about "Artemis" now?

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:57.206
AUDIENCE: Both.

00:45:57.206 --> 00:45:59.330
ANDY WEIR: Well, in "The
Martian," they came to me.

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:01.330
You know, they're
like, we like it as is.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:03.080
So they didn't have
any pressure to change

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.850
it to make it more accessible.

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:08.870
For "Artemis," they
also, no pressure,

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:11.960
I guess "The Martian" proved
to them that a hard sci-fi

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.310
novel could sell.

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:15.320
One thing I will
say is that I had

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:18.260
hoped, after "The Martian"
did so well, I'm like awesome.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.840
Now, other authors are going
to start writing hard sci-fi,

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.060
and I will get to
read hard sci-fi.

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.070
And they didn't.

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:27.200
Where are my frickin' copycats?

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.460
I've got nothing.

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.152
So I still don't
get to read any.

00:46:30.152 --> 00:46:31.610
I'm the one person
in the world who

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:36.130
doesn't get to read this
stuff, which is-- it's nice.

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:37.940
I'm in an economic
niche all by myself,

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.231
and I make a big pile of money.

00:46:39.231 --> 00:46:43.580
But I want other hard
sci-fi books to get written.

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:44.130
Yeah.

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:46.550
Is that it for the
questions, looks like?

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:47.120
OK.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.490
Well, I only ran
five minutes over.

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:50.360
That's pretty good.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.620
So thank you, everybody.

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:55.870
