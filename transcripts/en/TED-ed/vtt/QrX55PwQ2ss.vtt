00:00:05.527 --> 00:00:07.442
If I had one piece of advice

00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:09.384
for my 16-year-old self,

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:11.014
it would probably be

00:00:11.014 --> 00:00:14.558
to go out and see the world at that age.

00:00:14.558 --> 00:00:15.693
I didn't leave the United States

00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:18.865
until I was 22 for the first time,

00:00:18.865 --> 00:00:21.695
and, you know, I'd already been working

00:00:21.695 --> 00:00:24.021
and starting to develop my career.

00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:25.192
It wasn't until I left

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:28.857
and I could see the world sort of as a whole

00:00:28.857 --> 00:00:32.902
that I really could get a sense

00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:34.774
for where my place in it was

00:00:34.774 --> 00:00:36.795
and what I wanted to do

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:38.048
because, you know, you grow up

00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:39.576
and you're sort of in this narrow bubble

00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:41.778
and it's very easy to stay in that bubble

00:00:41.778 --> 00:00:43.204
and to get stuck in that bubble.

00:00:43.204 --> 00:00:44.197
And I think it's very important

00:00:44.197 --> 00:00:48.785
to expand the ideas that reach your mind

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:50.361
and the people that you meet

00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:52.195
because it really helps you develop

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:54.199
who you want to be as you get older,

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.992
so that's what I would tell myself

00:00:55.992 --> 00:00:58.859
when I, if I could, when I was 16.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.422
I would say go out and see the world

00:01:00.422 --> 00:01:02.116
as soon as possible.
