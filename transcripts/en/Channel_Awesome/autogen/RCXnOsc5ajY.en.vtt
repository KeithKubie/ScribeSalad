Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it....

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.600
I fucking hate Bio-Dome!

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.360
I fucking hate Bio-Dome!!

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.500
I fucking hate Bio-Dome!!!

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.080
I fucking hate it!!!!!

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.680
I hate it!

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.180
I hate it!!

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.820
I HATE IT!!!

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.340
I HATE IT!!!!!!

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.500
AYAYAYAYAYAYA–

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.700
*splash*

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.840
Thank you.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:24.540
Anyway,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.880
I fucking hate Bio-Dome.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.960
♪ ["Adirectional" by Fourth Grade Nothing] ♪

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.600
I mean, I don't think I've seen a more annoying and obnoxious piece of cancerous ass!

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.580
It's so grating and ear-rapingly bad,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.200
that I'm surprised the movie itself hasn't been arrested for indecent exposure!

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.940
It may not be the worst movie,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.760
but trust me, it's in the top five.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.040
This is the movie,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.800
these are my WRISTS after watching the movie,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.180
and these are the notes I took during watching the movie.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.820
I never been so happy to get something over with,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.280
so let's just go ahead and get this over with.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.280
So, the film starts appropriately enough by throwing its garbage at us.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.660
A fitting metaphor.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.280
We see our main stars listed,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.200
Pauly Shore and Stephen Baldwin,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.500
which honestly begs the question, how bad do you have to be to be listed UNDER Pauly Shore?

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.500
The credits roll on like a cinematic ransom letter,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.360
until the story finally begins.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.760
Narrator: The place is the Arizona desert.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.820
Here, a team of scientists and investors has come together to create the first space station on Earth.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.820
A self contained world. A pure environment.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.180
Their mission will be: to sustain life for one year while living in harmony with nature.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.000
NC (as narrator): They're co-naming it "The Really Stupid Experiment".

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.880
Narrator: Congratulations, Bio-Dome Five, and good luck!

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.720
NC: So while THAT waste of time is going on,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.200
we cut to an even BIGGER waste of time!

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.280
This playful scamp is named Squirrel,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.260
played by the Devil's pubic hair himself, Pauly Shore.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.140
Squirrel: Paper covers rooock! You loooose! *laughs* Buckwheat!

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.860
[weird noises and sounds]

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.760
NC: That was the first line.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.500
Literally, the first line he says makes me want to lobotomize myself.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.720
We have to watch a whole MOVIE with this anus!

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.300
Now for those of you who are young, and have no idea who Pauly Shore is...

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.960
good.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.500
[high-pitched squealing]

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.120
Doyle: Stubby, Squirrelly TRIBALLL!

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.620
[don't ask]

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.520
NC: So Shore is joined by his good buddy, Stephen Baldwin,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.940
who plays another idiot named Doyle [AKA "Stubs"].

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.060
They live in that wonderful time of the '90s, where stupid guys didn't really HAVE to have jobs,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.840
and yet somehow, they live in relatively nice places.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.440
Oh, and they also somehow date really hot chicks as well.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.940
Come on, are we REALLY supposed to believe the '90s were like that?

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.100
90s Kid: DUUUUUDE! The '90s are like that, man!

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.840
People like us don't NEED jobs because we're delightfully quirky!

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.760
Houses and babes just drop into our laps!

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.180
NC: But 90s Kid, there's got to be SOME reason why lazy morons keep getting good stuff back then!

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.620
90s Kid: Nope, that's just how we roll.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.900
What you see is what you–

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.980
[knock on the door]

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.680
NC: What was that?

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.820
90s Kid: Oh, it's probably just my landlord with another eviction notice.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.700
[bashing sound]

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.260
A-and a battering ram.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.220
[gun cocking]

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.000
And a... sawed-off shotgun. Gotta go!

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.840
[gunshot]

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.140
NC: Anyway, back to the review.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.000
So Squirrel and Doyle spend most of their time hitting each other with books and explaining why it's smart.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.300
Monique: I can't believe you'd crack Doyle's skull just to get out of this!

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.900
Squirrel: You don't understand. The book fell on him. I mean, well, he fell on the book. They collided.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.880
Monique: Bullshit!

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.080
NC (mocking Monique): Bullshit!

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.700
Monique: God, it is JUST like you two to try and weasel out of your responsibilities on Earth Day.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.200
NC: Oh, and by the way... YES, that is the lesbian with the funny voice from Chasing Amy.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.000
The only thing that gives me hope for all of this is that she CASTRATES Pauly Shore and starts making out with the brunette!

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.400
Buuut I don't think the writers are smart enough to do something so stupid.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.300
Jen: Well, they're getting better. They're taking yoga.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.000
And you're the one that keeps on raving about how flexible Bud [Squirrel] is getting.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.900
Monique: There is something about a man who can lick his own back.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.520
NC: What am I supposed to say to that?

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.240
So it turns out these two are super-environmental bimbos, and want to help clean the environment for Earth Day.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.500
But their dumbass boyfriends have even more important things to do:

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.280
like...

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.100
being dumbass boyfriends!

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.500
Monique: We met these guys from Arizona Tech, and they're taking us out to this kegger at Vasquez Lake.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.700
Squirrel: WHAT?! You met MEN?!

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.960
Monique: Oh, and they're on the swim team.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.980
Squirrel: Our girls have been seduced by breaststrokers.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.820
Monique: *giggles* They bought it!

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.820
NC: So they set out to find their girlfriends, because they're afraid that they're gonna sleep with some breaststroke swimmers.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.320
They should just retitle this movie "Stupid White People Doing Stupider White Things!"!

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.780
Squirrel: Oh, check out that mall, man.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.380
Doyle: Oh, must be the grand opening.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.380
[reading]: "Bio-Dome"
[Squirrel chuckles]

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.380
Think that means it goes both ways?

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.760
Squirrel: I don't know, but we do.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.040
[both wagging their tongues and vocalizing like morons]

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.200
NC: Never do that again, for the love of GOD!

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.500
So they get to the spot, only to find out that the ladies tricked them.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.500
Doyle: There used to be fish here, remember?

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.620
Squirrel: Yes I do, Doyle.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.900
A long time ago when we were kids, right?

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.800
*gurgling*

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.560
Kid Doyle: Leave Bud alone, Mom!

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.500
Bud's Mom: l'm teaching Bud how to hold his breath underwater.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.700
Much better, Bud. Now let's try for three minutes.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.900
NC (childish tone): YAAAAYY! YOU TRIED TO TELL A JOKE!!

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.880
(normally): You get a vast, empty void of SILENCE!

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.760
[vast, empty void of silence]

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.640
So as they start to head back, they come across the Bio-Dome,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.900
which looks more like Bio-Pringles-Cans,

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.620
as the five scientists get ready to head inside.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.580
Dr. Noah Faulkner: Please, I would like to introduce my team.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.500
Mr. T.C. Romulus, our entomologist...

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.680
Ms. Petra Von Kant, our oceanographer...

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.760
and Ms. Mimi Simkins, our agriculturalist.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.200
NC: That's not an agriculturalist, that's Miss October!

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.400
In fact, only TWO of these people look like real scientists!

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.600
The rest look like fashion models! How phony is that?

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.000
Haven't you SEEN any movie scientists? They got white lab coats and messed up hair?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.520
Like Doc Brown! Played by Christopher Lloyd! THAT was a scientist!

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.500
THESE guys are GQ covers! They're an insult to movie scientists everywhere!

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.300
What would Christopher Lloyd say?

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.400
NC: Oh, that's good to know. Thanks, Christopher Lloyd!

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.960
Oh, by the by, does this head scientist look familiar to you at all?

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.700
Walter Peck: Oh, I'll tell you what's hazardous! You're facing Federal prosecution for at least a half a dozen environmental violations.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.700
NC: That's right! It's Walter Peck from Ghostbusters! And yes, he's an environmental douche in this movie too.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.180
Dr. Faulkner: But one day, to sustain life... on new worlds far, far away.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.720
So Squirrel and Doyle sneak their way in to take a piss,

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.400
while the Nazi from Blues Brothers seals the Bio-Dome up with the scientists inside.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.180
But... wait a minute...

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.320
(fake surprise) OH NO! THEY'RE not supposed to be in THERE!

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.320
I smell shenanigans!

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.320
Or in their case, SHIT-nanigans!

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.700
Dr. Leaky: Get! Them! Out! NOW!!!

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.000
Dr. Faulkner: The doors are sealed for one year. I can't open the doors.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.500
Because if I open the doors, the integrity of all the scientific data is compromised!

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.200
Mayor from Ghostbusters: Is this true?

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.340
Dr. Peter Venkman: Yes, it's true.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.180
This man has no dick.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.900
Petra Von Kant: Adding two more at this stage will throw the whole system off balance.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.240
Dr. Faulkner: Then the system...

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.100
...will adapt.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.100
NC: Ah, yes, let's go over this again:

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.600
They can either just open the door up and let them out, simply starting the countdown over again,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.000
or they can let these idiotic timebombs stay inside, and most likely destroy everything.

What did these morons study BEFORE this?! The Environmental Impact Of BIGFOOT?!?!

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.380
So because space is tight, they have to have them stay in the janitor's closet,

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.880
where the idea for this movie probably should've stayed.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.960
