00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.960
PROFESSOR: All right,
let's get started.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.420
Today is all about
Lagrange method.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.200
We will talk a lot
about what we really

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.100
mean by generalized coordinates
and generalized forces

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.220
and then do a number of
application examples.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.215
There's a set of notes on
Stellar on the Lagrange method.

00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:54.340
It's about 10 pages long and I
highly recommend you read them.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.590
They're not somehow
up with the notes

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.240
associated with lecture
notes or [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.210
way down at the bottom.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.670
So you have to scroll all the
way down in the Stellar website

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.211
to find them.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.260
Our second quiz is November 8.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.467
That's a week from next Tuesday.

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:14.750
OK.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.960
Pretty much same format
as the first one.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.570
OK.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.985
So let's talk about how
to use Lagrange equations.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.200
So I defined what's called
the Lagrangian last time.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.180
t minus v. The kinetic energy
minus the potential energy

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.870
of the entire system.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.940
Total kinetic and total
potential energy expressions.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.770
Then we have some quantities.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.540
qj's.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.050
These are defined as
the generalized forces.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.920
Generalized coordinates,
I should say.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.150
And the capital Q sub j's
are the generalized forces.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.550
And the Lagrange
equation says that d

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:32.130
by dt the time derivative of
the partial of l with respect

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:45.990
to the qj dots, the velocities,
minus the partial derivative

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.910
of l with respect to the
generalized displacements

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.670
equals the generalized forces.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.820
And for a typical system,
you'll have a number of degrees

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.812
of freedom, like say three.

00:03:02.812 --> 00:03:04.520
And if you have three
degrees of freedom,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.700
you need three
equations of motion.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.520
And so the j's will go from
one to three in that case.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.470
So the j's here refer
to an [? index ?]

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.470
that gives you the number
of equations that you need.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.840
So you do this calculation
for coordinate one,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.610
again for coordinate two,
again for coordinate three,

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.060
and you get then three
equations of motion.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.050
OK

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:34.260
So this is a little obscure.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.520
Let's just plug in.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.680
For l equals t minus v.
And just put it in here

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.630
and see what happens.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:02.290
You get d by dt of the
partial of t with respect

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:11.600
to qj dot minus d by
dt of the partial of v

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:27.975
with respect to qj dot plus--
I'll organize it this way.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.770
Minus the partial
of t with respect

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:43.320
to qj plus the partial
of v with respect to qj

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.400
equals capital Qj.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.200
Now when we first talked
about potential energy

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.840
a few days ago, we said
that for mechanical systems,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.070
the potential energy is not a
function of time or-- anybody

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.730
remember?

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.200
Velocity.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.660
So if the potential
energy is not

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.420
a function of time nor velocity,
what will happen to this term?

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.830
This goes away.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:25.370
So this is 0 for
mechanical systems.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.190
If you start getting
into electrons moving

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.550
and magnetic fields, then you
start have a potential energies

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.290
involving velocities.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.190
But for mechanical
systems, this term's 0.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.120
And I think the bookkeeping.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.915
So this is the form of
a Lagrange equations

00:05:41.915 --> 00:05:44.120
that I write down when
I'm doing problems.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.960
I don't write this.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.530
Mathematicians like elegance.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.470
And this comes down to this
is beautifully elegant simple

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.730
looking formula.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.670
But I'm an engineer
and I like it to be

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.710
efficient and practical useful.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.360
This is the practical useful
form of Lagrange equations.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.310
So you just use what you need.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.592
Kinetic energy here,
kinetic energy there,

00:06:08.592 --> 00:06:09.550
potential energy there.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.360
And I number these.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.870
There's a lot of
bookkeeping in Lagrange.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.045
So I call it term one, term
two, term three, and term four.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.420
Because you have to grind
through this quite a few times.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.480
And so when you
do, basically you

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:29.820
take one of the results of
1 plus 2 plus 3 equals 4.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:38.968
And you do that j times to get
the equations you're after.

00:06:38.968 --> 00:06:39.468
OK.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.450
So now we need to
talk a little bit

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:55.391
about what we mean by
generalized coordinates.

00:06:55.391 --> 00:06:55.890
qj.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.270
What's this word
generalized mean?

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.865
Generalized just means it
doesn't have to be Cartesian.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:28.280
Not necessarily
Cartesian as in xyz.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.910
You got a lot of liberty and
how you choose coordinates.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.660
Not necessarily Cartesian.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:43.050
Not even inertial.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.110
They do have to satisfy
certain requirements.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:02.106
The coordinates, they must
be what we call independent.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.803
They must be complete.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.800
So it must be
independent and complete

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:31.820
and the system
must be holonomic.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.600
I'll get to that in a minute.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.330
So you need to understand what
it means to be independent,

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.350
complete, and holonomic.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.740
So what do we mean
by independent?

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.150
So if you have a multiple
degree of freedom system

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.370
and you fix all but
one of the coordinates,

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:18.810
say the system can't move in
all but one of its coordinates.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.980
That last degree
of freedom still

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.760
has to have a complete
range of motion.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.310
So if you have a double pendulum
and you grab the first mask,

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.050
the second mask can still move.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:33.705
It takes two angles to
define your double pendulum.

00:09:33.705 --> 00:09:34.330
So independent.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:58.600
When you fix all
but one coordinate,

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:17.470
still have a continuous
range of movement

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.890
essentially in the
free coordinate.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.190
And that's independent.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:35.040
And we'll do this
by example mostly.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.240
And complete.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.250
The complete really means it's
capable of locating all parts

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.385
of the system at all times.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.875
So let's look at a system here.

00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:15.840
It's a double pendulum.

00:11:28.535 --> 00:11:35.240
It's a simple one just made out
of two particles and strings.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.340
I didn't bring one today.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:43.700
And I need to pick some
coordinates to describe this.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:49.040
And we'll use some
Cartesian coordinates.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.950
Here's an x and a y.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.030
And here's particle one.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:01.640
And I could choose to describe
this system xy coordinates.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.900
And I'll specify the location in
the system with coordinates x1

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.050
and y1.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.290
Two values to specify
the location of that.

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:16.350
And down here I'm going to pick
two more values, x2 and y2,

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:22.170
just to describe the-- so x1 is
a different coordinate from x2.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.380
x1 is the exposition
of particle one.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:31.150
x2 is the x position of
particle two. y1 and y2.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.670
So how many coordinates do I
have to describe the system?

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.330
How many have I used?

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.530
Four, right?

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.680
How many degrees of freedom
do you think this problem has?

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.297
Two.

00:12:46.297 --> 00:12:48.630
So there's something already
a little out of whack here.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:55.930
But the point is these aren't
independent, you'll find.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:56.961
You just do a test.

00:12:56.961 --> 00:12:58.710
You'll find that these
aren't independent.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:03.330
If I fix x1 and x2,
systems doesn't move.

00:13:07.066 --> 00:13:12.110
If I say this is going to be one
and this has got to be three,

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.330
this system is now frozen.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.530
So this system of core
coordinates is not independent.

00:13:21.054 --> 00:13:21.720
What did we say?

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.420
Independent.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.240
When you fix all
but one coordinate,

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.280
you still have continuous range
of movement of the final one.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.960
I could fix only
just two of these

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.610
and I've frozen the system.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:36.390
I don't even have to go to
the extent of fixing three.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.760
I'm assuming the strings
are of fixed length.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.540
You can't change
the string length.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.610
So this is not a very good
choice of coordinates.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.510
And we had a hint
that it might not be,

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.590
because it's more
than we ought to use.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.090
We only really need two.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:58.240
So and then if we choose
these angles, v1 and v2,

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.720
let's do the test with that.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.929
Are those independent?

00:14:01.929 --> 00:14:03.720
So those are the
coordinates of the system.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.880
If you fix v1, is there still
free and continuous movement

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.880
of v2 of the system?

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.540
Sure.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.680
And if you fixed v2, it means
you can require this angle stay

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.600
rigid like that, and move
v2, well, the whole system

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.820
will still move.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:24.160
So v1 and v2 are a system which
satisfies the independence

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.280
requirement.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.270
Complete.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:28.410
They're both systems
that are complete.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.110
They're both capable locating
all points at all times.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:39.400
But only the pair v1
and v2 in this example

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.880
are both independent
and complete.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:52.060
Now, the third requirement is
a thing called holonomicity.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:56.360
And what it means
to be holonomic

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:01.860
is that the system, the number
of degrees of freedom required

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:07.170
is equal to the
number of coordinates

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.560
required to completely
describe the motion.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.320
Now, every example we've ever
done so far in this class

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.570
satisfies that.

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:21.470
We picked v1 and v2 and
that's all the coordinates

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.400
that we need to completely
to describe the motion.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.495
Let me see if I can figure
out a counter example.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.279
I didn't write down
this definition.

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:36.820
So holonomic.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.480
And if the answer to
this question is no,

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.330
you cannot use
Lagrange equations.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:28.410
So let's see if I can show you
an example of a system in which

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:33.070
you need more coordinates than
you have degrees of freedom.

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.960
I've got a ball.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.740
This is an xy plane.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:44.744
And I'm not going to allow
it to translate in z.

00:16:44.744 --> 00:16:49.910
And I'm not going to allow it
to rotate about the z-axis.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.140
So those are two constraints.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.430
So this is one rigid body.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.720
In general how many degrees
of freedom does it have?

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.360
Six.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.040
I'm going to constrain
it so no z motion.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.250
Five.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.020
No z rotation.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.710
Four.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.800
It's not going to
allow it to slip.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.609
This is x and that's y.

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:16.910
I'm not going to allow
it to slip in the x.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.140
So now I've got another.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.520
Now I'm down to three.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.500
And I'm not going to
allow it to slip in the y.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.520
Two.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.060
So by our calculus of how many
degrees of freedom you need,

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.600
we're down to two.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.720
We should be able to
completely describe

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.870
the motion of this system
with two coordinates.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:37.650
OK.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:41.230
So I've put this piece
of tape on the top.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.060
And it's pointing diagonally.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.490
That way.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:51.900
And I'm going to roll
this ball like this

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.104
until it shows up again.

00:17:53.104 --> 00:17:55.020
So it's right on top,
just the way it started.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.540
Now start off same way again.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.580
I'm going to roll
first this way.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.900
And then I'm going to roll
this way to the same place.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.815
Where's the stripe?

00:18:14.815 --> 00:18:15.800
It's in the back.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.760
So I've gone to
the same position

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.550
but I've ended up with the ball
not in the same orientation

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:26.380
as it was.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.770
I went by two different paths.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.400
And the ball comes up over
here rather than up there

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.351
where it started.

00:18:40.351 --> 00:18:40.850
OK

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:46.050
So to actually describe where
the ball is at any place

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.890
out here, having gotten
there by rolling around,

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:56.095
without slipping and without z
rotation, how many coordinates

00:18:56.095 --> 00:18:59.290
do you think it'll take
to actually specify where

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:03.366
that stripe is at
any arbitrary place

00:19:03.366 --> 00:19:04.740
that it's gotten
to on the plane?

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:10.558
Name them.

00:19:10.558 --> 00:19:11.474
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.220
PROFESSOR: So.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.980
In order to actually
fully describe it,

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.670
you've got to say
where it is x and y

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.570
and you actually have to say
some kind of theta and phi

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.140
rotations that it's gone through
so that you know where this is.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.750
So this system is not holonomic.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:38.167
And it has to be
holonomic in order

00:19:38.167 --> 00:19:39.250
to use Lagrange equations.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.170
So when you go to do
Lagrange problems,

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:48.080
you need to test for
your coordinates.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.100
Complete, independent,
and holonomic.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.350
And you get pretty good at it.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.850
So here's my Lagrange equations.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:20.150
And I have itemized these four
calculations you have to do.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:23.620
Call them one, two,
three, and four.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.930
And what I'm going
to write out is just

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:30.540
to get you to adopt a systematic
approach to doing Lagrange.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.670
Left hand side.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.780
To the left hand side of
your equations of motion

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.010
is everything with t and
v. The right hand side

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:52.480
has these generalized forces
that you have to deal with.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.740
And generalized forces are
the non conservative forces

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.194
in the system.

00:20:57.194 --> 00:20:59.110
So this is going to get
a little bit cookbook,

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:02.900
but it's, I think, appropriate
for the moment here.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:03.810
So step one.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:14.940
Determine the number of degrees
of freedom that you need.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:26.960
And choose your delta j's.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.620
Not deltas, excuse me.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.640
qj's.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.880
Choose your coordinates.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.210
You find the number
of degrees of freedom

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:38.050
and choose the coordinates
you're going to use, basically.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:57.010
Verify complete,
independent, holonomic.

00:22:03.811 --> 00:22:04.310
Three.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:14.090
Compute t and v for every
rigid body in the system.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.965
Compute your kinetic
and potential energies.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:40.616
One, two, three for each qj.

00:22:40.616 --> 00:22:41.990
So for every
coordinate you have,

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:43.550
you have to go through
these computations.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:45.383
One, two, three, four,
for every coordinate.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.500
And this is your left hand side.

00:22:52.511 --> 00:22:54.760
And if you don't have any
external forces and your non

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:59.400
conservative external forces,
then 1 plus 2 plus 3 equals 0.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.930
But if you have non
conservative forces,

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.330
then you have to compute
the right hand side.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:05.480
So the right hand side.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:21.560
So for each qj, each
generalized coordinate,

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:31.920
you need to find the
generalized force that

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.120
potentially goes with it.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:24:00.450
And you do this by computing
the virtual work delta w.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.360
I'll put the little nc
up here to remind you

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.430
these are for the non
conservative forces.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:30.770
The delta w associated with the
virtual displacement delta qj.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:33.710
So for every generalized
coordinate you have,

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:39.320
you're going to try out
this little delta of motion

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:47.040
in that coordinate and
figure out how much virtual

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.320
work you've done.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:56.950
So delta wj is going
to be qj delta k.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:01.390
So this is the thing
you're looking for.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:05.820
And it's going to be a function
of all those external non

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.940
conservative forces acting
through a little virtual

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.310
displacement, a little
bit of work will be done.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.140
Mostly I'm going to teach you
how to do this by example.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:43.120
So let's quickly do a really
simple trivial system.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:49.880
Our mass spring dashpot system,
single agree freedom mkb.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.520
It's going to take
one coordinate

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.840
to describe the motion.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.590
X happens to be Cartesian.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:04.580
There'll be one
generalized coordinate.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:13.470
So qj equals q1 equals
qx in this case.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.205
It's our x-coordinate.

00:26:15.205 --> 00:26:18.030
Actually I should
just call it x.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:21.060
That's our generalized
coordinates for this problem.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.190
Is it complete?

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:23.100
Yeah.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.291
Is it independent?

00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:24.790
Yes.

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:25.670
Is it holonomic?

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:26.420
No problem.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:36.010
We need t 1/2 mx dot squared.

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:42.920
We need v. And we
have 1/2 kx squared

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:53.490
for the spring minus mgx for the
gravitational potential energy.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:55.880
And now we can start.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.587
And we have some external
non conservative forces.

00:26:59.587 --> 00:27:00.170
What are they?

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.060
fi non conservative.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.370
And I think I'm going
to put an excitation up

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:14.180
here too, some f of t.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:18.340
So what are the non
conservative forces?

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.380
Pardon?

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.630
AUDIENCE: k x dot.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:22.970
PROFESSOR: It's not k.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:28.410
My mistake.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.190
You're correct.

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.870
My brain is getting
ahead of my writing here.

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:35.663
That's normally b
and this would be k.

00:27:35.663 --> 00:27:37.530
I'm not trying to really
mess you up there.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:41.010
So would be bx dot, right.

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:43.670
And is there anything else?

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.900
Are there any other non
conservative forces,

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.762
things that could put energy
into or out of the system?

00:27:48.762 --> 00:27:49.678
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.015
PROFESSOR: So the damper can
certainly extract energy.

00:27:58.015 --> 00:27:58.952
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:58.952 --> 00:28:00.160
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the force f.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.420
That external, it might
be something that's

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.670
making it vibrate or whatever.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.520
But it's an external force, and
it could do work on the system.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.750
And it's not a potential.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:15.115
It's not a spring
and it's not gravity.

00:28:15.115 --> 00:28:16.910
It's coming up and
somebody's shaking

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:18.330
it or something like that.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.960
So f is also non conservative.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.290
So the non conservative
forces in this thing

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:31.580
are f in the i direction
and minus vx dot

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.790
in the i direction.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.350
And we could, in our normal
approach using Newton,

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:39.080
we draw a free body
diagram and we identify

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:43.260
a bx dot on it and an f on it.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:47.710
But we'd also have our kx on it.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:50.480
That would be what our free
body diagram would look like.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.830
That's a conservative force.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:55.580
Oops, and we need an mg.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:59.350
So we have two conservative
forces, kx and mg,

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:03.760
and we have two non conservative
forces, bx dot and f.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.160
So in this case, some of
the non conservative forces

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.710
is that f in the i
direction minus bx in the x

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:14.990
dot in the i direction.

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:19.940
So let's do our calculus here.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:25.520
So 1 d by dt of the
partial of the t, which

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:33.520
is 1/2 mx dot squared
with respect to x dot.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.970
So that gives me the derivative
of x dot squared with respect

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:40.320
to x dot gives me 2 mx dot.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:45.690
So this is d by dt of mx dot.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:48.250
But that's mx double dot.

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:49.942
And as you might
expect when you're

00:29:49.942 --> 00:29:51.400
trying to drive
equation of motion,

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.608
you're probably going to
end up with an mx double dot

00:29:53.608 --> 00:29:55.480
in the result. And
it always comes out

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.830
of these d by dt expressions.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.180
OK, so that's term one.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:04.190
Term two in this problem.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:09.690
Minus t with respect
to x in this case.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.210
Is t a function of x?

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.040
It's 1/2 mx dot squared.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.160
So is t a function
of displacement x?

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.170
It's a function of velocity
in the x direction,

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:28.940
but is it a function
of displacement?

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:29.490
No.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:34.850
So this term is 0.

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:35.610
Three.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.090
Our third term.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:45.200
Partial of v with respect to x.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.640
Well, where's v 1/2 kx squared.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.075
The derivative of
this is kx minus mg.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.595
And we sum those.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:17.620
So we get mx double dot
plus kx minus mg equals.

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:21.490
And on the right
hand side this is 4.

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:25.600
Now we need to do four
for the right hand side.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:36.110
And four is really the
summation of the fi's,

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:43.880
the individual forces,
dotted with dr.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.856
These are both vectors.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.226
dr is the movement.

00:31:50.226 --> 00:31:52.600
Little bit of work and it's
going to be a delta quantity,

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.390
like delta x.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:56.800
And f are the applied forces.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.010
And you need to sum these up.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:04.540
So this dr in general is going
to be a function of the delta

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:05.260
j's.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:08.780
The virtual displacements in all
the possible degrees of freedom

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.000
of the system.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.302
We do them one at a time.

00:32:11.302 --> 00:32:13.260
This case we'll only have
one, so it's trivial.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.720
But this could be delta
one, two, three, four.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:20.710
And each one of them
might do some work

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:24.470
when f moves through it.

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:28.200
But work is f dot
the displacement.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.770
So it's the component
of the force

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:34.360
in the direction of the
movement, the dot product, that

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.870
gives you this little
bit of virtual work.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:43.740
OK, so in this problem, this
is going to be equal to-- we

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:47.570
actually have an f of t of
some function of time in the i

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:58.930
direction minus bx dot in the
i direction dotted width delta

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:01.070
x, which is our
virtual displacement

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.420
in our single
generalized coordinate.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:10.130
And this whole thing is going
to be equal to Qx delta x.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:18.160
So you figure out the
virtual work that's done.

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:23.390
So if you do this
dot product, this

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:25.020
is also in the i hat direction.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:27.090
So i dot i, i dot i.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:28.480
You just get ones.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.890
Because the forces are
in the same direction

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:34.340
as the displacement.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.500
You're going to get an ft.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:40.320
f of t delta x is one of the
little bits of virtual work.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:44.870
And you'll get a
minus bx dot delta x.

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:48.800
And that together, those
two pieces added together,

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.800
are the generalized
force times delta x.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:58.950
This total here
gives you delta w non

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:05.460
conservative for in
this case coordinate x.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:10.909
So we're trying
to solve for what

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:12.219
goes on the right hand side.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:13.160
We need the qx.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.469
You notice what'll
happen, it'll cancel out

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:24.460
the delta x is the result.
And in this case, what

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:40.430
you're left with is Qx
equals f of t minus bx dot.

00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:41.745
So this is number four.

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:46.429
So Qx.

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:50.120
Delta x is the bit of
virtual work that's done.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:55.040
What goes into our equation
of motion is the Qx part.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.330
And we got it by computing
the virtual work done

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:01.230
by the applied external
non conservative forces

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:06.440
as we imagine them
going through delta x.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.570
And we're done.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:11.005
You have the complete equation
of motion for a single degree

00:35:11.005 --> 00:35:11.630
freedom system.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:13.300
You could rearrange
it a little bit.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:18.830
mx double dot plus bx dot
plus kx equals mg plus f of t

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:20.260
if you well.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:24.230
So it's the same thing you would
have gotten from using Newton.

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.950
In a trivial kind
of example, but it

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:31.767
helps to find each of the
steps, things that we said

00:35:31.767 --> 00:35:32.350
were required.

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:43.740
OK, so we're going to go from
there to a much harder problem.

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:51.900
So any issues or questions
about definitions, procedure?

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.520
So we start getting into
multiple degrees of freedom.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:58.570
You need is set up a
careful bookkeeping.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:01.550
So I just do this myself.

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:07.250
The top of the page, I identify
my coordinates, write down t,

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:11.840
write down v. Then I
say, OK, coordinate one.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.250
One, two, three, four.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.020
Equation.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.020
Then I started the
coordinate two.

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.840
Calculus for one, two, three,
and four and so forth until you

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.431
get to the end.

00:36:22.431 --> 00:36:23.290
OK, questions?

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:24.962
Yeah.

00:36:24.962 --> 00:36:28.834
AUDIENCE: On the
[INAUDIBLE] what's

00:36:28.834 --> 00:36:30.931
that thing after
the [INAUDIBLE] It's

00:36:30.931 --> 00:36:33.690
like an open
parentheses [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:39.130
PROFESSOR: Oh, these are
functions of the delta j's.

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:42.790
This dr, where it
comes from, the work

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:45.480
that's being done in
a virtual displacement

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:50.810
around a dynamic equilibrium
position for the system

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:53.000
is a little movement
of the system.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.460
dr. And we express it.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:02.160
It's expressed in terms
of a virtual displacement

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.770
of the generalized
coordinates of the system.

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:08.540
So where the dr comes
from is going to be delta.

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.160
In this case, it's only delta x.

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:15.020
And in the next
problem, we're going

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.370
to do the force
in the problem is

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:22.970
not in exactly the same
direction as the delta x's

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:24.730
and delta theta's and so forth.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:28.070
So when you do the dot
product, only that complement

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.930
of the force that's
in the direction

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:33.090
of the virtual
displacement does work.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:34.960
And you account for that.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:41.330
So let's look into a
more difficult problem.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:42.830
So the problem is this.

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:45.460
I tried to fix assessed
before I came to class.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:51.070
I didn't really quite have
the parts and pieces I needed.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:55.720
But this a piece
of steel pipe here.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:59.630
It's a sleeve on the
outside of this rod.

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:06.340
And I've got a spring that's
on the outside connected

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:07.390
to this piece.

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:08.397
And so it can do this.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:16.200
And it's also,
though, a pendulum.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.430
So the system I really want
to look at is this system.

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:27.960
So this swings back and forth,
the thing slides up and down.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:32.960
So this has multiple sources of
kinetic energy, multiple forms

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.520
of potential energy.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.730
And for the purpose
of the problem,

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:44.500
I'm going to say that there's a
force that's always horizontal

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:49.640
acting on this mass pushing
this system back and forth.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:53.050
Some f cosine omega
t, always horizontal.

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:54.560
And I want to
drive the equations

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.600
of motion of the system.

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:02.170
So is it a planar
motion problem?

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.020
How many rigid bodies involved?

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.250
There's two rigid bodies.

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:18.440
Each could have possibly
six degrees of freedom.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.740
But when you say
it's a planar motion,

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.460
you're actually immediately
confining each rigid body

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.830
to three.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:29.780
Each rigid body can move
x and y and rotate in z.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:33.220
So when you [? spread ?] out
and say this is planar motion,

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.940
you've just said each
rigid body has max three.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:39.705
So this is a maximum
of six possible.

00:39:39.705 --> 00:39:41.080
Where the other
three disappeared

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:46.330
to is no z deflection and
no rotation in the x or y.

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:53.360
OK, so we have a
possible maximum six.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:56.640
How many degrees of freedom
does this problem have?

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:01.609
How many coordinates will we
need to completely describe

00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:02.650
the motion of the system?

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:04.160
So think about that.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.170
Talk to a neighbor.

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:08.730
Decide on the coordinates that
we need to use for this system

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:09.900
while I'm drawing it.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.547
OK.

00:41:28.547 --> 00:41:29.380
What did you decide?

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.090
How many?

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:31.850
Two.

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:33.350
All right, what
would you recommend?

00:41:37.994 --> 00:41:38.910
What would you choose?

00:41:41.742 --> 00:41:42.242
Pardon?

00:41:42.242 --> 00:41:44.630
AUDIENCE: The angle
and how far down it is.

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.480
PROFESSOR: An angle
and a deflection

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.860
of what I'm calling m2 here.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.740
So this is m2.

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:52.738
The rod is m1.

00:41:55.366 --> 00:42:06.950
And he's suggesting an
angle theta and a deflection

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:09.280
which I'll call x1.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:14.450
And I've attached to this
bar, the rod I'm calling it,

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:20.660
a rotating coordinate
system x1 y1.

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:25.000
About point A. So A x1 y1's
my rotating coordinate system

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.490
attached to this rod.

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:29.240
OK.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.520
So I'm going to locate
the position of this

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:35.510
by some value x1
measured from point A.

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:40.910
And locate the position of the
rod itself by an angle theta.

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:42.700
Good.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.330
Is it complete?

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:48.380
So if you freeze one, do you
still have-- the complete.

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:52.522
[INAUDIBLE] describe the motion
at any possible position.

00:42:52.522 --> 00:42:53.230
Those two things.

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.729
Yes.

00:42:53.729 --> 00:42:55.750
Is it independent?

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:59.510
If you freeze x, can
theta still move?

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.310
If you freeze theta,
can the x still move?

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:05.360
OK, is it holonomic?

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.550
Right.

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.240
You need two, we
got two and they're

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.620
independent and complete.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:10.680
Good.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.990
Now the harder work starts.

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:17.790
So I'm going to give us the
mass of the rod, the mass moment

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:22.920
of inertia the rod about the
z-axis but with respect to A.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.440
The length of the rod is l1.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:31.840
The sleeve mass m2 izz
with respect to its g.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.860
So it has a g.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.370
There's also and I'd
better call it g2.

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:38.180
That's the g of the sleeve.

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:41.810
There's also a g1.

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:45.000
A center of mass for
the rod and a center

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.260
of mass for the sleeve.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:48.910
Those are properties
we'll need to know

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:52.000
and I'll give them to you.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.480
OK.

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:57.910
So we need to come
up with expressions

00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:03.000
for potential energy
and kinetic energy.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.920
So this problem, the potential
energy's a little messy.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.610
Because you have
to pick references.

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:12.100
You have to account for
the unstretched length

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:12.695
of the spring.

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:31.360
So call l 0 is the
unstretched spring length.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.490
We know that also.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:42.880
So I propose that the
potential energy look like 1/2,

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.940
for the spring, anyway,
1/2 the amount that it

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:50.200
stretches in a movement x1.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.610
The amount that
it stretches then

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:55.260
should be whatever
that x1 position is.

00:44:55.260 --> 00:45:03.880
And that x1 position, and I
drew it slightly incorrectly.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:07.390
I'm going to use x1 to locate
the center of mass, which

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:08.570
is always a good practice.

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:10.000
So here's the center of mass.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.190
So my x1 goes to
the center of mass.

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:16.960
That's x1.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.050
So that's the total distance.

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:23.000
And from that, we
need to subtract

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.940
l0, the unstretched
length of the spring.

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:31.240
And we need to subtract
1/2 the length of the body

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:35.820
because that's that
extra bit here.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:42.990
So this is the amount that the
string is actually stretched

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.759
when the coordinate is x1.

00:45:44.759 --> 00:45:45.800
And you've got to square.

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:51.320
And that'll be the potential
energy stored in the spring.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:55.980
Then we got to do the same
thing for the potential energy.

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:58.755
We have two sources of
potential energy due to gravity.

00:45:58.755 --> 00:45:59.516
And they are?

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:05.350
Two objects, right?

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:06.430
Two potential energy.

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:08.230
So why don't you take
a minute and tell me

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:10.210
the potential energy
associated with the rod.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.180
So the rod has a center of mass.

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.490
It's a pendulum basically.

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:19.320
So it's the same
as all the pendulum

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.403
problems you've ever seen.

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:28.230
And I would recommend that we
use as our reference position

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:32.290
its equilibrium position
hanging straight down.

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:34.260
And I'll tell you
in advance, I'm

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.170
going to use the unstretched
spring position this time.

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:38.110
Just stay with that.

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:39.860
That's where it's
going to start from.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:41.870
That's my reference
for potential energy.

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:46.470
But does the unstretched
spring position

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:50.130
have anything to do with the
potential energy of the rod?

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:50.650
No.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:51.150
OK.

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:55.540
So its reference position is
just hanging straight down.

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:56.300
So figure it out.

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.280
What's the potential
energy expression

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:01.572
for just the rod part?

00:47:01.572 --> 00:47:02.280
Think about that.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:12.920
So I'm going to remind
you about something

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.510
about potential energy.

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:16.720
Potential energy, one of
the requirements about it

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.820
is the change in potential
energy from one position

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:23.940
to another is path independent.

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:28.950
So you don't actually ever have
to do the integral of minus mg

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:30.140
dot dr.

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:31.670
You don't have to
do the integral.

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:33.294
You just have to
account for the change

00:47:33.294 --> 00:47:35.590
in height between
its starting position

00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:38.220
and its some other position.

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:43.940
Spend a minute or
two, think about that.

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:44.440
Work it out.

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:45.935
You got a question?

00:47:45.935 --> 00:47:46.435
OK.

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:14.850
Can you talk?

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:17.105
Talk to a neighbor,
check your ideas.

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:56.950
So you have a suggestion for me?

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:58.484
Ladies?

00:48:58.484 --> 00:48:59.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:06.825 --> 00:49:09.300
l1/2 [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:16.127 --> 00:49:16.710
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.600
Anybody want to make
an improvement on that?

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:23.010
Or they like it?

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:24.212
Improvement?

00:49:24.212 --> 00:49:26.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:29.280
PROFESSOR: 1 minus cosine theta.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:35.550
So let's put that up and let's
figure out if we need that.

00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:43.140
We have a bid for cosine theta
and 1 minus cosine theta.

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:46.870
So you need to have a potential
energy at the reference

00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:49.680
and you need to have a potential
energy at the final point.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.330
And the difference
between the two

00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:54.430
is a change in
potential energy here.

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:57.450
So what's the reference
potential energy

00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:01.850
is mg l1 over 2 when
it hangs straight down.

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:04.610
And then when it moves up
to this other position,

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:10.000
this is the l1 over 2
times this is a delta h.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.920
This is the change in
height that it goes through.

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:14.935
So you need the 1 minus.

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:24.585
Do we have the sines right?

00:50:24.585 --> 00:50:25.085
Yeah.

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:30.530
OK.

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:39.940
So now we need another term.

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.240
And I'll write this one down.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.970
This one's a little messier.

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:49.360
We need a potential energy term
due to gravity for the sleeve.

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:51.590
And that's going to mimic this.

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:54.495
You're going to have
a term here plus m2g.

00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:59.720
And it's reference,
I'm just going

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:02.950
to do it as a reference
amount minus the final amount.

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:07.610
The reference will be
at the initial location

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:20.740
of its center of mass, which
is l0 plus l2 over 2 minus m2 g

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:24.520
x1 cosine theta.

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:29.420
Because this one
is a little messy

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:30.670
because you've got this thing.

00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:34.200
It can move up and
down the sleeve.

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:37.010
And if that moves, you've
lost your reference.

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:40.070
So you can't do this as a
concise little term like this.

00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:43.220
You have to separate
out the reference

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:46.220
and then this is the final.

00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:49.790
And the l0 plus
l2, this quantity

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:52.170
here is the starting height.

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:56.074
This x1 cosine theta is
the finishing height.

00:51:56.074 --> 00:51:57.490
And the difference
between the two

00:51:57.490 --> 00:51:59.760
gives you the change in
the potential energy.

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.170
So this is your potential
energy expression.

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:04.965
This plus this plus these.

00:52:04.965 --> 00:52:05.465
All right.

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:13.180
So what about t?

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:14.880
We got to be able write it.

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.877
Kinetic energy is
generally easier.

00:52:16.877 --> 00:52:18.710
Got to account for all
the parts and pieces.

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:20.190
So we have to chunks.

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:25.090
And we're going to have
rotational kinetic energy

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:28.750
associated with the rod,
rotational kinetic energy

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:33.190
associated with the sleeve.

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:35.450
But also some translational
kinetic energy

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:37.292
associated with the sleeve.

00:52:37.292 --> 00:52:38.625
And I'll write these terms down.

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:43.845
Make the problem go
a little faster here.

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:54.655
1/2 izz about A. That's the rod.

00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:08.055
Plus 1/2 izz for
the sleeve about g.

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.920
We'll discuss why
the difference here.

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:18.190
And that's theta dot squared.

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:30.870
Now for the kinetic energy
that comes from translation

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:33.580
of the center of mass.

00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:34.990
Because I'm broken up.

00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:40.690
Let me start over.

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:47.680
This system is pinned about
A. And the rod is just

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:52.370
simply pinned at A.
And the last lecture

00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:55.450
I put up these different
conditions and simplifications.

00:53:55.450 --> 00:54:00.470
You can account for a
something about a fixed pin

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:04.405
by computing maximum
inertia about A.

00:54:04.405 --> 00:54:06.950
It's basically a parallel
axis theorem argument.

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:09.700
Times 1/2 times that
times theta dot squared.

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:12.140
So this gives you all
the kinetic energy in one

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.460
go with the rod.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:19.000
But for the sliding mass,
because its position

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.580
is changing, you can't do that.

00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:26.080
You have to account for the two
components of kinetic energy

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.060
separately.

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:29.990
This accounts for
rotation about g.

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:32.380
Even though g is moving.

00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:33.715
That accounts for that energy.

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:37.890
Because it's only a
function of theta dot.

00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:40.860
It's not a function
of that position x.

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:44.060
This term is going to account
for the kinetic energy

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:46.890
associated with the movement
of the center of mass.

00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:53.405
So we need a vg2 in the
inertial frame dot vg2.

00:54:58.300 --> 00:54:59.620
These be in vectors.

00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:02.580
And does that get everything?

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:04.270
I think that does.

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:16.350
So vgo is it certainly
has a component that

00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:18.800
is its speed sliding up
and down the rod, right?

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.950
And that's in the
i hat direction.

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.080
But it has another
component due to what?

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.370
Can you tell me what it is?

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:34.435
Its contribution to its
speed due to its rotation.

00:55:44.113 --> 00:55:46.617
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:46.617 --> 00:55:47.950
PROFESSOR: It's got a theta dot.

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:49.500
Yep.

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.485
It needs an r, right?

00:55:51.485 --> 00:55:52.401
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:58.714 --> 00:55:59.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:01.246
So this would be an x1 plus.

00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:12.210
No actually, I made x1 go
right to the-- so just x1 theta

00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:15.308
dot in one direction.

00:56:15.308 --> 00:56:18.400
Yeah, so j hat here.

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.980
Actually that's the moving
coordinate system unit

00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:22.690
vector in the y direction.

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:26.310
And so we do the dot product.

00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:32.810
You get this times itself.
i dot i and j dot j.

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:42.190
This quantity here is
1/2 m2 x dot squared

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:46.820
plus x, this next one I guess.

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:51.880
x1 squared of theta dot squared.

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:55.180
That's the kinetic energy of
accounting for the velocity

00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:56.204
of the center of mass.

00:56:56.204 --> 00:56:58.370
So now we have our entire
kinetic energy expression.

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:12.330
So now we have how
many coordinates?

00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:12.949
Two, right?

00:57:12.949 --> 00:57:14.740
How many times do we
have to turn the crank

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:17.390
and go through the Lagrangian?

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:19.160
Got to go through it twice.

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:25.640
So let's apply Lagrange here.

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.980
And we'll just do
number one first.

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:32.720
So and let's see.

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.860
Which one do I have
on my paper first?

00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:38.120
I guess we'll do
the x1 equation.

00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.260
This is delta x1.

00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:42.920
So this generalized
coordinate x1.

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.520
And we need to do
term one, which

00:57:45.520 --> 00:58:00.210
is in d by dt of partial of
t with respect to x1 dot.

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:01.830
OK.

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:06.500
So we look at this and say,
well, is this a function?

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:09.415
Is this term a function of x?

00:58:09.415 --> 00:58:10.010
Nothing.

00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:12.180
You get nothing from there.

00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:14.370
Is this term a function of x?

00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:16.840
Yeah, it's down here.

00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:19.300
We only have to take
the derivative of this.

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:22.100
We have to do that job.

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:25.200
So the derivative of
this with respect to x

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:32.152
dot, you get a 2x dot here.

00:58:32.152 --> 00:58:34.610
Do you get anything from here
when you do this with respect

00:58:34.610 --> 00:58:35.197
to x dot?

00:58:35.197 --> 00:58:36.780
You only get a
contribution from here.

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:38.580
The two cancels that.

00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:48.930
And so this should look
like m2 x1 dot but d by dt.

00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:53.400
Do this once in two steps
here so you see what happens.

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:57.610
You get an m2 x1
double dot out of that.

00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:10.300
So we've gotten the
first piece of this.

00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:11.690
We've got a couple to go.

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:15.184
But you know a lot
about Newton's laws

00:59:15.184 --> 00:59:17.100
and you know a lot about
calculating equations

00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:21.250
of motion now using sum of
torques and all that stuff,

00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:22.070
right?

00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:27.500
So this is just something
moving, has a circular motion,

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.090
has translational motion.

00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:32.720
What other
accelerations had better

00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:35.860
appear in this
equation of motion?

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:39.320
And which equation
are we getting?

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.695
There's going to
be two equations

00:59:40.695 --> 00:59:42.790
and it has physical
significance to it.

00:59:42.790 --> 00:59:46.830
What equation does this
begin to look like?

00:59:46.830 --> 00:59:50.800
Just physically, what movement
is being accounted for here?

00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.970
Looks like translation
in the x direction.

00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:54.800
It's this thing sliding.

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:57.200
It's this part of the
motion sliding up and down.

00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:59.100
You're writing an
equation of motion and mx

00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.405
double dot has units of what?

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:06.540
Torque?

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:07.400
Force.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.490
So it's a force equation.

01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:11.869
This is just f equals ma is
what this is going to show us.

01:00:11.869 --> 01:00:13.660
Remember, the direct
method has to give you

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.920
the same answer as Lagrange.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.810
So we're getting
a force equation.

01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:23.460
It's describing mx double dot.

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:26.040
What other acceleration
terms do you

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.900
expect to appear in
this from what you know?

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:28.400
Yeah.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:28.895
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:28.895 --> 01:00:30.340
PROFESSOR: A centripetal term.

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.464
Do you believe there ought
to be a centripetal term

01:00:32.464 --> 01:00:34.150
in this answer?

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:37.030
Why?

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:39.550
Because it's got
circular motion involved.

01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:41.380
For sure.

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:42.040
Any others?

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.780
Is there any Coriolis in this?

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:45.890
In this direction.

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:49.690
Which direction
are we working in?

01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:53.680
Is there Coriolis acceleration
in the x direction?

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:58.530
By the way, these equations,
do we have any ijk's in here?

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:00.440
These are pure scalar equations.

01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:05.170
No unit vectors involved.

01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:07.810
This equation only
described motion in the x.

01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:15.270
So will there be a Coriolis
force in this acceleration

01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:16.220
in this problem?

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.050
Will there be an
Eulerian acceleration

01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:19.360
in this equation of motion?

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.151
The reason I'm going
through this with you,

01:01:21.151 --> 01:01:23.590
I want you to start developing
your own intuition about

01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:25.950
whether or not when
you get it at the end

01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:27.450
it's got everything
it ought to have

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:30.590
and doesn't have stuff
it shouldn't have.

01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:31.150
OK.

01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:35.190
So your forecasting, then we
better get a centripetal term.

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:36.550
Well, let's see what happens.

01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:39.030
So that was number one.

01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:56.010
Number two here is our dt
by minus the derivative

01:01:56.010 --> 01:01:58.970
with respect to x, in this case.

01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:00.460
So we go here.

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:02.770
x1 we've been calling it.

01:02:02.770 --> 01:02:04.500
Is this a function of x?

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.000
This piece?

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.290
Nope, it's x dot.

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:07.391
How about this one?

01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:07.890
Right.

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:10.550
Take this derivative,
you get 2x.

01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:12.580
So this fellow is
going to give us

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:22.535
minus m2 x1 theta dot squared.

01:02:25.090 --> 01:02:27.620
What's that look like?

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:28.590
There it is.

01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:30.980
There's your centripetal
term you're expecting to get.

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:31.790
OK.

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:39.900
And step three is plus partial
of v with respect to x.

01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:44.280
In this case with respect to x.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.900
And where's our potential
energy expression?

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:48.530
Well, it's up here.

01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:55.910
And where the x
dependency is in it.

01:02:55.910 --> 01:03:00.480
There is no x in that term
and no x in that term.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.220
But we have x's in both
of these other terms.

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:07.840
So when we run
through this, I'll

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.190
write down what we come up with.

01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:13.670
We get certainly a spring term.

01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:22.950
k x1 minus l0 minus l2 over 2.

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:29.420
So that's the spring piece
when you take the derivative.

01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:32.010
The two cancels the 1/2
and the derivative of parts

01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:33.670
inside just gives you 1.

01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:36.790
So that's the first piece of
the potential energy expression.

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:41.940
And the second piece is only
going to come from here.

01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:43.780
The derivative of this
with respect to x1

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:47.915
is just m2g cosine theta minus.

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.920
And you add those
bits together, you

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:11.230
end up with m2 x1 double
dot minus m2 x1 theta

01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:21.200
dot squared plus k
x1 minus l0 minus l2

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:29.440
over 2 minus m2g cosine theta.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.800
So those are the
three terms, 1 plus 2

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.160
plus 3, that go on
the left hand side.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:39.940
And they're going to
equal my qx that I find.

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:42.570
I still have to find what
the generalized force is

01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:43.386
in the x direction.

01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:57.190
So all that's left to
do for this problem

01:04:57.190 --> 01:05:01.440
is to find q sub x, the
generalized force that

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.540
goes on the right hand side.

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:10.520
So now let's draw a little
diagram here of my system.

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.330
And at the end of the sleeve.

01:05:13.330 --> 01:05:17.490
So here's my sleeve.

01:05:17.490 --> 01:05:18.960
I've applied this force.

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:25.110
This is f of t.

01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:30.030
And maybe it's some
f not cosine omega t.

01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:33.290
It's an oscillatory
force, external force.

01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:34.190
Make it vibrate.

01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:42.550
And I need to know
the virtual work done

01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:47.405
making that force go through a
displacement in what direction?

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.340
So this equation is
the x1 equation, right?

01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:02.430
And so the virtual displacement
I'm talking about is delta x1.

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:04.660
And the amount of
work that it does

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:09.340
is delta x1 times the
component of this force that's

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.420
in its direction.

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:19.380
So I'm going to take this
force and break it up

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:22.690
into two components.

01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:29.228
And if this is my theta,
this is also theta.

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:41.505
So this will be f0 product.

01:06:41.505 --> 01:06:46.255
And I'll leave out the
cosine omega t here.

01:06:46.255 --> 01:06:47.690
It's a function of time.

01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:51.770
But this side then
is cosine theta i.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.460
No, hey, I got this wrong.

01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:57.700
I drew this wrong, I'm sorry.

01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.120
This is theta.

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.165
This is going to be sine.

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:08.500
This side is sine theta
in the i direction.

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:18.025
And this piece is f0 of
t cosine theta in the j.

01:07:18.025 --> 01:07:21.260
So I break it up in two parts.

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:26.440
And the virtual work
associated with x1

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:33.810
is the thing I'm looking for,
qx, dotted with delta x1.

01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:40.910
And that is f of
t here, the vector

01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:45.990
dotted with dr, my
little displacement.

01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:48.540
But in this case, this
then all works out

01:07:48.540 --> 01:08:00.080
to be f0 cosine omega t.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:12.750
And it has sine theta i
plus cos theta j components

01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:17.890
dotted width delta x in the i.

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:21.620
So you're only going to get
i dot j gives you 0, i dot i

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:22.920
gets you 1.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:26.149
So you're going to get
one piece out of this.

01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:41.190
This says in the qx equals
f0 cosine omega t sine theta.

01:08:45.109 --> 01:08:50.250
And start with you have a
delta x here and a delta x here

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:52.560
and that gives you the
delta virtual work.

01:08:56.581 --> 01:08:58.080
Personally when I
do these problems,

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.390
I have to think in terms of
that little virtual deflection.

01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:04.670
I've actually figure out
what's the virtual work done.

01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:07.770
And then at the
end I take this out

01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:11.660
and this is the qx
that I'm looking for.

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:15.100
So my final equation
of motion says,

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:26.520
this equals f0 cosine
omega t sine theta.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.054
And that's your equation of
motion in the x1 direction.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:38.490
So when you finish one of
these, you need to ask yourself,

01:09:38.490 --> 01:09:39.479
does this make sense?

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:41.859
Does this jive with
my understanding

01:09:41.859 --> 01:09:43.115
of Newtonian physics?

01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:48.189
Better have a linear
acceleration term,

01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:50.180
because that's what it's doing.

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:52.960
You have another acceleration
term in the same direction

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.810
due to centripetal.

01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:57.060
A spring force for sure.

01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:01.470
And a component of gravity
in the direction of motion,

01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:04.700
up and down the slide,
equal to any external forces

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:05.840
in that direction.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.090
So it makes pretty good sense.

01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:09.220
OK.

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:12.850
Now, also another
test you can do

01:10:12.850 --> 01:10:17.690
is does it satisfy
the laws of statics?

01:10:17.690 --> 01:10:19.350
That's another check
you could perform.

01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:22.840
Does this thing at static
equilibrium tell the truth?

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.230
A static equilibrium all
time derivative is 0.

01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:27.430
So this would be
0, this would be 0.

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:29.620
You know its static
equilibrium hangs down,

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:31.800
so cosine theta is 1.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.320
Static you don't have any
time dependent forces.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.610
That's 0.

01:10:35.610 --> 01:10:50.630
So the static part of this says
that k x1 minus l0 minus l2

01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:57.690
over 2 equals m2g cosine.

01:10:57.690 --> 01:11:02.000
And that's cosine theta
is 1, so it's m2g.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.680
And you could figure out then
this must be k times something.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.480
This is the x.

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:12.180
This is the amount of the spring
stretches, the static stretch

01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:16.730
of the spring, so the spring
has an equal and opposite force

01:11:16.730 --> 01:11:18.690
to the weight of the thing m2g.

01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:23.220
So that's another check you
can do when doing the problems.

01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:31.070
OK, I'll write up the final one.

01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:32.530
We have one more question to go.

01:11:32.530 --> 01:11:36.090
Got to do all the derivatives
with respect to theta.

01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:43.390
So you take a minute to decide
how many acceleration terms

01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:45.040
and what acceleration
terms do you

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:48.670
expect to see come out of this
second equation of motion.

01:11:48.670 --> 01:11:51.870
Because now we're talking
about which motion?

01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:53.870
Swinging motion.

01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:55.550
And what's its direction?

01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:58.250
In Newtonian sense, it would
have a vector direction.

01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:01.530
It's in what we call j here.

01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:05.680
OK, so you're about
to get the j equation.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.042
What terms do you
expect to find in it?

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:12.730
Talk to your neighbors
and sort this out.

01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:15.550
And basically tell me what
the answer's going to be.

01:13:02.765 --> 01:13:03.690
What do you think?

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:12.836
What are we going to get?

01:13:12.836 --> 01:13:15.306
AUDIENCE: We were debating
about whether or not

01:13:15.306 --> 01:13:22.240
it was going to be like speeding
up in the theta [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:25.330
PROFESSOR: So it is a pendulum,
just a weird pendulum.

01:13:25.330 --> 01:13:33.940
So does the theta change speed?

01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:34.460
Sure.

01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:36.680
When he gets up the
top of the swing at 0.

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.620
All the way down,
it's maximum speed.

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:41.900
So what term does that imply
that you're going to get?

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:43.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.110
PROFESSOR: Well,
maybe, maybe not.

01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:46.610
Yeah?

01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:47.527
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:47.527 --> 01:13:49.818
PROFESSOR: Going to get an
Eulerian, which means you've

01:13:49.818 --> 01:13:51.140
got a theta double dot term.

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:53.640
You're expecting a theta
double dot term to show up.

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.140
OK.

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:55.120
What else?

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.860
Will you get a Coriolis term?

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:04.580
Do you expect a Coriolis term?

01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:07.556
Something that looks
like x dot theta dot.

01:14:07.556 --> 01:14:10.074
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:10.074 --> 01:14:10.740
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.573
The thing is sliding
up and down the sleeve.

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:15.640
It has a non 0 value of x dot.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:19.650
Any time you got
things moving radially

01:14:19.650 --> 01:14:24.020
while something is
swinging in a circle,

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.605
you will get Coriolis forces.

01:14:25.605 --> 01:14:28.220
It means the angular momentum
of that thing is changing

01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:30.280
and it takes forces
to make that happen.

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:34.515
So here's what this
answer looks like.

01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:55.850
That's the one term.

01:14:55.850 --> 01:15:00.530
The two piece gives you 0.

01:15:03.435 --> 01:15:09.210
It's not a function of
x in the three piece.

01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:19.290
The potential energy pace
gives you m2g x1 sine theta

01:15:19.290 --> 01:15:27.980
plus m1 g l1 over 2 sine theta.

01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:32.930
And the fourth
piece, the q theta,

01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:35.536
well, that's just going to
be the virtual work done.

01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:40.260
There's a tricky
bit to this one.

01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:43.240
Now there's virtual work,
but which direction?

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:49.800
So we have an f dot dr.
The only f we have is this.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.519
What's the dr?

01:15:51.519 --> 01:15:52.517
What direction is it?

01:15:58.010 --> 01:15:59.310
This is the theta coordinate.

01:15:59.310 --> 01:16:01.810
What direction does that
give you displacements?

01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:05.616
f dot dr's a displacement,
not an angle.

01:16:05.616 --> 01:16:07.490
To get the work done,
you got to move a force

01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:08.975
through a distance.

01:16:08.975 --> 01:16:11.100
So the distance, first of
all, is in what direction

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.256
when theta moves?

01:16:14.256 --> 01:16:14.756
j.

01:16:14.756 --> 01:16:16.910
Little j hat, right?

01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:21.050
And now if you get
a virtual deflection

01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:25.670
of delta theta, what's
the virtual displacement?

01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:28.310
You had a virtual change in
[? angle ?] delta to put theta.

01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:29.880
But is that the
virtual displacement?

01:16:32.970 --> 01:16:39.970
What's the displacement of this
point here in the j direction,

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:42.576
given a virtual
displacement delta theta?

01:16:42.576 --> 01:16:43.568
Think that out.

01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:56.067
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:56.067 --> 01:16:57.400
PROFESSOR: Can't quite hear you.

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.340
PROFESSOR: x1 delta
theta will give you

01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:04.710
the motion to displacement
at the center of mass

01:17:04.710 --> 01:17:07.560
in that direction.

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.700
x1 comes from here to here.

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:12.220
So x1 delta theta will give
you a little displacement

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:13.340
in that direction.

01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:17.140
But is that the
displacement we care about?

01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:18.600
We need the displacement here.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:19.540
So you're close.

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:32.670
So we're going to get some
force dot a displacement dr.

01:17:32.670 --> 01:17:36.370
And that's going to be
our force, this guy,

01:17:36.370 --> 01:17:38.530
with its i and j components.

01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:39.780
i and j terms.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:47.270
But this term out here
is x1 plus l2 over 2

01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:48.950
to get to the end.

01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:52.100
And it's in the j direction.

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:55.700
So it's a length times A.
And you need the delta.

01:17:59.710 --> 01:18:01.640
This quantity.

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:05.230
And you need a delta theta.

01:18:05.230 --> 01:18:07.490
Delta theta.

01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:10.150
This is the term.

01:18:10.150 --> 01:18:14.590
This is the dr for the system.

01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:18.020
An angle, a virtual deflection
in angle times the moment arm

01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:19.650
gives you a distance.

01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:27.350
It's in the j hat direction
dotted with the same force

01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:30.950
breaking the force up into
its i and j components.

01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:33.680
It had a sine theta
i cos theta j.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.840
So this is going to give
me a f cosine omega t

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.960
cos theta j dot j.

01:18:45.912 --> 01:19:02.230
f0 cosine omega t cos theta
x1 plus l2 over 2 delta theta

01:19:02.230 --> 01:19:03.930
is the delta w.

01:19:03.930 --> 01:19:07.160
That's the work and the virtual.

01:19:10.030 --> 01:19:15.820
The generalized force q
theta is this part of it.

01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:22.580
So this plus this
plus this equals

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:24.800
that on the right hand side.

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:27.940
So this is part four.

01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:30.750
And look at it.

01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:31.620
Yeah?

01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:32.536
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:41.230
PROFESSOR: So f of t, I didn't
want to write it all out.

01:19:41.230 --> 01:19:43.760
This thing breaks into
an i and a j piece,

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.310
which is written over there.

01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:48.230
This is the sine theta
i cos theta j term.

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:54.040
Which I brought back
from over there.

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.190
And we dot it with the
dr that we care about,

01:19:57.190 --> 01:20:02.620
which is this length times
that angle in the j direction.

01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:03.650
So j dot.

01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:06.620
We only pick up the
j piece of this.

01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:10.740
And that gives us this
cosine theta term.

01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:13.070
OK.

01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:14.640
Let's look quickly.

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.730
This is a rotational thing.

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:19.515
It has units of is it force?

01:20:19.515 --> 01:20:21.125
Is this a force equation?

01:20:24.050 --> 01:20:26.780
i theta double dot
has units of what?

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:27.280
Torque.

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:28.900
This is a torque equation.

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:36.080
This is the total mass
moment of inertia izz

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:40.190
with respect to A for this
system such that the Eulerian

01:20:40.190 --> 01:20:41.030
acceleration.

01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:44.030
The torque it takes
to make that happen

01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:48.280
is the sum of the mass
moment of inertia of the rod

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:51.910
plus the mass moment of
inertia of g plus m2 x1

01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:55.340
squared, which looks a lot
like the parallel axis theorem.

01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:59.550
This is izz A for
the moving mass.

01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:00.710
There's your Coriolis term.

01:21:03.730 --> 01:21:06.120
And here's your potential
terms and there's

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.371
your external force.

01:21:08.371 --> 01:21:08.870
OK.

01:21:12.570 --> 01:21:15.560
Talk more about these
things in recitation.
