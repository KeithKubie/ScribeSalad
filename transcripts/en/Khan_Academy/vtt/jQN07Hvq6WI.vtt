00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:01.377
- [Voiceover] - What I wanna start thinking about

00:00:01.377 --> 00:00:03.536
in these videos are ways for molecules

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.347
to go across a cellular membrane,

00:00:05.347 --> 00:00:07.325
either from the outside to the inside,

00:00:07.325 --> 00:00:09.968
or from the inside to the outside.

00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:13.545
And the first type of transport of molecule across membranes

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:15.889
that I'm gonna talk about is transport

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.584
that does not require energy.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:20.301
It's all about molecules moving

00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:22.414
down their concentration gradient.

00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:25.740
And that type of transport we call passive transport.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.613
Passive transport.

00:00:28.613 --> 00:00:31.005
So it does not require energy.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:32.560
It's really just about things moving

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.618
down their concentration gradient.

00:00:36.438 --> 00:00:39.202
Let me write, "Move down concentration gradient."

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:43.308
Move down concentration,

00:00:43.308 --> 00:00:46.718
concentration gradient.

00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:50.958
Now, if you have this cellular membrane,

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.321
a lot of things might want to move

00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:54.179
down their concentration gradient,

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.090
but this membrane is selectively permeable.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.099
It's going to be more or less permeable

00:00:59.099 --> 00:01:01.003
to different types of molecules.

00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:02.837
So let's think about these different types of molecules

00:01:02.837 --> 00:01:05.716
and think about how they might diffuse passively

00:01:05.716 --> 00:01:07.318
across the membrane.

00:01:07.318 --> 00:01:09.664
So if we have really small molecules, we can say,

00:01:09.664 --> 00:01:11.243
"OK, they might be able to fit in the gaps

00:01:11.243 --> 00:01:13.982
"between the hydrophilic heads,

00:01:13.982 --> 00:01:16.792
"and they might be able to fit between the gaps

00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:19.067
"of the hydrophobic tails and get through."

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:21.043
So being small is good.

00:01:22.813 --> 00:01:27.182
If you're small, that aids transport, passive transport,

00:01:27.182 --> 00:01:29.911
aids diffusion across the membrane.

00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:31.257
And in particular, it really helps

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.998
to be small and non-charged.

00:01:33.998 --> 00:01:37.783
Small and no charge.

00:01:37.783 --> 00:01:41.567
So examples of that could be things like carbon dioxide.

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:45.932
So carbon dioxide, it's a small molecule,

00:01:45.932 --> 00:01:47.814
it doesn't have a charge.

00:01:47.814 --> 00:01:49.415
So carbon dioxide molecules,

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:53.036
if I have a higher concentration on the outside,

00:01:53.036 --> 00:01:54.976
on the outside, actually let me do the other way around.

00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:58.099
Let's say I have a higher concentration on the inside

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:02.116
than I have on the outside.

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:04.183
Well, just as we learned in the diffusion video,

00:02:04.183 --> 00:02:05.528
in a given amount of time,

00:02:05.528 --> 00:02:07.914
you're gonna have more carbon dioxide molecules

00:02:07.914 --> 00:02:09.049
interacting with the bottom,

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.884
going from inside of the cell and interacting

00:02:11.884 --> 00:02:14.635
with the membrane, than from the outside of the cell.

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:17.073
And sure, they don't have any charge,

00:02:17.073 --> 00:02:19.139
and so they're not going to be particularly attracted

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.152
to the hydrophilic head of our phospholipids,

00:02:22.152 --> 00:02:24.039
but they're also not going to be repelled by them.

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:25.895
And you're gonna have more on the inside interacting

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:27.404
with the membrane than the outside,

00:02:27.404 --> 00:02:28.913
and so, since they're small,

00:02:28.913 --> 00:02:30.982
some of them are gonna able to pass through,

00:02:30.982 --> 00:02:32.363
and they're also not going to be bothered

00:02:32.363 --> 00:02:34.458
by the hydrophobic tails,

00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:35.942
and you're gonna have things going both ways,

00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:37.553
but you're gonna have more going from the inside

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:39.814
to the outside than from the outside to the inside.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.351
So they're gonna move along

00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:43.557
with their concentration gradient.

00:02:43.557 --> 00:02:46.459
So carbon dioxide can actually diffuse quite well

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.806
across cellular membranes.

00:02:48.806 --> 00:02:52.682
Another molecule that can is molecular oxygen.

00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:55.933
Molecular oxygen can also diffuse quite well

00:02:55.933 --> 00:02:57.767
across cellular membranes.

00:02:57.767 --> 00:02:59.300
So if I have a higher concentration

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.990
of oxygen on the outside than I have on the inside,

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.754
because it's small and it's non-charged,

00:03:06.754 --> 00:03:08.423
it's not gonna have problems.

00:03:08.423 --> 00:03:09.703
It's not gonna be particularly attracted

00:03:09.703 --> 00:03:11.467
to the hydrophilic heads,

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:12.996
but they're small and they're gonna be able

00:03:12.996 --> 00:03:14.228
to pass right between them,

00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:15.597
it's going to be indifferent to them,

00:03:15.597 --> 00:03:16.984
and then it's gonna be able to pass

00:03:16.984 --> 00:03:18.980
through all of these hydrophobic tails,

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.163
and since you have a higher concentration on the outside

00:03:21.163 --> 00:03:23.019
than the inside, you're just going to have more

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.024
in a given amount of time,

00:03:24.024 --> 00:03:26.596
more random interactions of the ones going in that direction

00:03:26.596 --> 00:03:27.967
than the ones going in that direction,

00:03:27.967 --> 00:03:30.706
so you would have a net inflow into the cells.

00:03:30.706 --> 00:03:33.471
So these things are going to be able to diffuse fairly...

00:03:34.491 --> 00:03:35.862
whoops, these things are going to be able

00:03:35.862 --> 00:03:39.586
to diffuse fairly naturally.

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.375
And of course, they are going to be obstructed

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:44.509
by just the structure, by all of these molecules here

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:46.296
that make up the actual cellular membrane,

00:03:46.296 --> 00:03:48.409
but they're going to be able to get through.

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.476
Now, what about things that would have a lot

00:03:50.476 --> 00:03:52.148
of trouble getting through?

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:53.982
So things that would have a lot of trouble getting through,

00:03:53.982 --> 00:03:58.347
would be things like a sodium ion.

00:03:58.347 --> 00:04:00.292
A sodium ion.

00:04:00.292 --> 00:04:04.714
Or a potassium ion.

00:04:05.314 --> 00:04:07.009
Why would they have trouble getting through?

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.006
Well, let's just imagine.

00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:09.516
Let's say I have a higher concentration

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:12.518
of sodium on the outside...

00:04:14.298 --> 00:04:17.782
than I have on the inside.

00:04:17.782 --> 00:04:20.407
Well, they might be attracted to the hydrophilic heads here

00:04:20.407 --> 00:04:22.193
that have some charge,

00:04:22.193 --> 00:04:24.167
but there's no reason why they would then want

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:25.537
to go any further.

00:04:25.537 --> 00:04:28.316
They're going to be attracted to the hydrophilic heads

00:04:28.316 --> 00:04:29.659
that have charge...

00:04:31.489 --> 00:04:34.423
and the hydrophobic tails have nothing interesting for them.

00:04:34.423 --> 00:04:37.476
They're gonna wanna maybe clump around the...

00:04:38.556 --> 00:04:39.439
phosphate heads,

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:42.619
but not be able to migrate all the way through.

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:45.614
So things that have outright charge are gonna have trouble

00:04:45.614 --> 00:04:47.567
just passively diffusing.

00:04:47.567 --> 00:04:49.865
We'll see in future videos that there's other ways

00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:51.419
for them to get through.

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.464
You have things like channel proteins,

00:04:53.464 --> 00:04:54.793
which essentially give them tunnels,

00:04:54.793 --> 00:04:56.187
and we'll talk more about that.

00:04:56.187 --> 00:05:00.437
But just naturally, natural diffusion is going to be hard

00:05:00.437 --> 00:05:01.992
for things like this.

00:05:01.992 --> 00:05:04.478
Now, what about things that are in between?

00:05:04.478 --> 00:05:06.590
What about things like water molecules?

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.169
And water is incredibly important,

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.280
because cells are living in an aqueous environment.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.069
They're surrounded by water on the inside of the cell

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:14.741
and the outside of the cell.

00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:16.411
And water is in between,

00:05:16.411 --> 00:05:18.874
because it doesn't have an outright charge,

00:05:18.874 --> 00:05:20.894
but it has a partially.

00:05:20.894 --> 00:05:24.167
Water molecules, oxygen, two hydrogens.

00:05:24.167 --> 00:05:26.048
Oxygen likes to hog the electrons.

00:05:26.048 --> 00:05:28.208
It has a partial negative charge on that end.

00:05:28.208 --> 00:05:30.182
The hydrogens have their electrons charged,

00:05:30.182 --> 00:05:32.226
have a partial positive charge end...

00:05:33.496 --> 00:05:35.726
a partial positive charge on that end.

00:05:35.726 --> 00:05:38.470
And we call these phosphate heads hydrophilic,

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.631
because they're attracted to water,

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:41.211
and water is attracted to it.

00:05:41.211 --> 00:05:44.810
So the water molecules, for sure,

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.150
are going to be attracted,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.840
are going to be attracted to the hydrophilic heads.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.980
but their charge isn't so strong that they can't,

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.373
if you have enough interactions,

00:05:56.373 --> 00:05:57.951
a lot of them will be attracted,

00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:59.809
but some of them will actually make it through.

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:01.365
The water molecule is small enough,

00:06:01.365 --> 00:06:04.476
and its charge is not strong enough, I guess you could say,

00:06:04.476 --> 00:06:05.637
It has some polarity,

00:06:05.637 --> 00:06:07.286
but it's going to be able to make it through,

00:06:07.286 --> 00:06:10.537
not as easily as carbon dioxide or the molecular oxygen,

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:13.972
but it will be able to slowly diffuse through.

00:06:13.972 --> 00:06:15.667
And as we'll see, there's other ways

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.246
that this can be facilitated,

00:06:17.246 --> 00:06:19.291
where the water can go through once again.

00:06:19.861 --> 00:06:22.215
We'll see in future videos things like aquaporins,

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:25.513
tunnels through the membranes,

00:06:25.513 --> 00:06:26.762
so it doesn't have to deal with all

00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:28.857
of this business right over here.

00:06:28.857 --> 00:06:30.923
And of course, if you have really large molecules,

00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:35.218
if you had a big, honking protein right over here,

00:06:35.218 --> 00:06:36.518
this would have trouble.

00:06:36.518 --> 00:06:37.355
This would have trouble.

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:38.911
It would have trouble even physically getting

00:06:38.911 --> 00:06:41.117
through the gaps, not to mention whether parts

00:06:41.117 --> 00:06:43.647
of it are hydrophobic or hydrophilic.

00:06:43.647 --> 00:06:46.085
So hopefully this gets you a sense of the types of things

00:06:46.085 --> 00:06:49.614
that can diffuse through a cellular membrane.

00:06:49.614 --> 00:06:52.212
This is a form of passive transport,

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:55.052
and in the next video,

00:06:55.052 --> 00:06:58.321
we'll talk about facilitated passive transport.
