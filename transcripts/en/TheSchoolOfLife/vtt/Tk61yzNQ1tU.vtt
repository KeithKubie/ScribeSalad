00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:07.860
Saying you should try to be "kind" sounds like a really, really silly and obvious thing to say

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.940
because everyone, but an idiot, knows that. DUH.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.780
It's the sort of thing you only need to tell little children

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.180
to stop them being nasty in the playground.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.940
YOU know there are better things to try to be than "kind."

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.600
Like be creative,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.380
inventing an app,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.680
or just in general, being the top dog.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.820
Kindness is for losers.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.960
This old, old lady is out of strength to be anything else.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.380
Now that no one goes to church anymore, we don't need a new religion of kindness and love.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.800
We don't need to hear that we shouldn't be greedy and exploitative.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.300
We don't need to take a pause and evaluate, every day, how our actions affect others.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.060
We don't need to hear regularly that we shouldn't trample on people weaker than ourselves;

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.560
the other people are fragile...

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.800
that we need to look after one another,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.500
because we're all we have in a cold universe...

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.240
that we should be slow to anger...

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.040
that we shouldn't be vicious and horrible online,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.620
'cause that hurts just as much as in the physical world...

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.800
that we should try to see it in the other person's point of view.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.000
We don't need to hear that we should stop hating, dissing, insulting,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.940
overlooking, judging, slamming, and being a total ass.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.560
We know it all; it's so obvious--

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.900
didn't you know?

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.980
And it's not important to be polite, either.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.840
Because politeness is FAKE,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.620
and it's always better to say and do what you really think, isn't it?

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.380
No, let's not have a philosophy of kindness.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.000
Things are already going sooo well, just as they are.
