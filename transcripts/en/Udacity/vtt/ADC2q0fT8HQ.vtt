00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.940
This course will have five lessons.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.300
In this first lesson we'll be giving you
an overview of what AB testing is and

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.814
what it can and can't be used for.

00:00:06.814 --> 00:00:10.030
We'll also go over an example
AB test from start to finish so

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.150
that you can see what
the whole process looks like.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.864
In that example we'll first choose
a metric for an experiment,

00:00:14.864 --> 00:00:16.970
then review some necessary statistics.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.290
Then we'll design our experiment and
finally we'll analyze the results.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.810
Then each subsequent lesson of
the course will dive into more detail

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.830
on a particular part of the process.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.450
In lesson two,
you'll be learning about how to protect

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.760
the participants of your experiment,
and what questions you should be

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.555
asking yourself regarding
the ethicality of experiments.

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:37.020
In lesson three will go into
more detail on choosing and

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.470
characterizing metrics to use
when evaluating your experiment.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.370
In lesson four, we'll talk more about
designing your experiment, which

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.350
includes choosing which users go in your
control group and your experiment group.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.570
And in lesson five we'll go over lots
of examples of what your results could

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.360
look like, how to analyze those results,
and how to draw valid conclusions.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.290
Now you won't need any prior
experience with AB testing in order

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.320
to take this course, because we'll
be covering it from the ground up.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.440
And you won't need any
programming experience either,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.620
because this course won't cover how
to implement an AB testing framework.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.400
It's about how to design and
analyze experiments.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.370
Introductory knowledge of statistics,
on the other hand, will be required.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.175
So if you need to brush up, check out
the links in the instructor's notes.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.985
Now throughout the course I'll be
going over lots of examples and

00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:20.385
giving you opportunities to
practice what you're learning.

00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:22.325
I'll also be having
conversations with Diane and

00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:24.539
Carrie about their
experience as an AB testing.

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:25.515
Let's do that now.
