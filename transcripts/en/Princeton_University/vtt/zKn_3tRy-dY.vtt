00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.800
 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.160
Noah's a fantastic professor and the
fact that he grew up as a deaf

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.360
individual he's very connected to the
deaf culture and the community so some

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.710
of the nuances that may not be apparent
when you're getting taught by hearing

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.189
professor Noah covers
everything and the way he conveys his

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.450
emotions and his thoughts through is
signing it's really apparent that he's

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.509
definitely really passionate about what
he's doing and you can really get

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.070
that from all of his lectures it has
just taught me that individuals who may

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.420
have different experiences or different
backgrounds like aren't necessarily hard

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.920
to interact with like I've had so much
fun with Noah as a professor I remember

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.050
my first precept the reason why I stuck
with it was because I actually like made

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.850
him laugh at like my inability to sign
something he showed us the sign for sad

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.100
which was like this and he was like what
do you think this sign for happy is and

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.750
I was like and he's like no that's the
sign for humiliated and like there's no

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.170
errors here and like we're all on the
same level and we're all just trying to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.979
learn to communicate with each other I'm
interested in practicing clinical

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.310
neuropsychology and being able to
communicate with the families and the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.819
parents of the children is actually a
really good skill to house the

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:20.369
importance of actually just
understanding this other culture is

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.719
something that I came across in this
class and not even that just being able

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.939
to communicate well with others
is a key concept in ASL so you have not

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.270
only the sign but your soft facial
expressions that play a key role in the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.749
grammar structure of ASL so just being
able to communicate really well I think

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:46.420
is a great takeaway that I've had from
this class
