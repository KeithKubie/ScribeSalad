00:00:00.327 --> 00:00:01.160
(air whooshing)

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.993
(mouse clicking)

00:00:01.993 --> 00:00:05.593
(electronic tones beeping)

00:00:05.593 --> 00:00:09.460
(pleasant piano music)

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.460
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.923
Bipedal, naked, large-brained,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.903
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.863
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.201
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.283
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.020
We shape the future

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.693
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.160
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.805
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:54.703
and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.960
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.737
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.148 --> 00:01:18.648
(upbeat electronic music)

00:01:20.812 --> 00:01:24.312
(upbeat electronic music)

00:01:39.494 --> 00:01:40.680
- Thank you everyone for coming.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.180
And, I'll just take a moment

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.990
to tell you a little bit about

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.280
how we decided to make
a CARTA meeting entirely

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.437
on human imagination.

00:01:48.437 --> 00:01:50.756
And, this is one of those things that,

00:01:50.756 --> 00:01:53.570
it seems to happens only in San Diego,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.020
where two people,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.770
and I'm talking about myself,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.920
who, I'm a professor in pediatrics

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.790
and cellular molecular medicine,

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.860
turns out to be in a meeting

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.470
sitting together with Sheldon Brown,

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.300
who's gonna here as a first speaker.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.593
And, Sheldon Brown comes from visual art.

00:02:08.593 --> 00:02:10.850
So a scientist, an artist,

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.027
we start talking,

00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:13.940
and we realized that we
have something in common.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.000
We are both fascinated
by human imagination.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.840
So, I make a challenge to Sheldon,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.560
and say, "Well, can we put
this in a scientific context?"

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.475
And, we start planning
about a meeting like that,

00:02:26.475 --> 00:02:28.834
and we realized that most of the time,

00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:31.471
when we try to understand something,

00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:34.980
if it's unique or enhanced,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.670
in humans we turn on to compare

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.470
to our closest relative,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.050
leading relative such as the chimpanzee.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.940
And, comparing to other
animals is difficult,

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.260
especially if you are talking about

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.633
cognition and imagination.

00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:50.090
So, this time,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.010
I think you're going to
hear lots of speakers

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.415
talking about imagination in modern humans

00:02:54.415 --> 00:02:58.140
and also in extinct humans
such a the Neanderthals.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.807
And, we hope that the combination

00:03:00.807 --> 00:03:02.240
of all those speakers,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.073
all this knowledge,

00:03:03.073 --> 00:03:06.287
will help us to understand
a little bit about ourselves

00:03:06.287 --> 00:03:10.923
and answer those questions
that Ageeth posed to us.

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:14.060
- So, as Allyson mentioned,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.784
we started talking about imagination,

00:03:17.784 --> 00:03:20.730
and in part because I direct this center,

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.660
the Arthur C. Clark Center
for Human Imagination

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.030
here at UCSD,

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.710
where we're trying to
understand imagination

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.920
and then think about ways

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.920
we might more directly address
imagination as a phenomenon.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.824
And, so then this comes
around to think about

00:03:35.824 --> 00:03:39.000
how might we might think about imagination

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.150
and its role in human origins?

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.195
And, I think we have
maybe at least two ways

00:03:43.195 --> 00:03:44.530
to think about this

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.853
that we're going to be
exploring in today's program.

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:52.850
So, one is what are the
dimensions of our imagination

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.110
that give rise to our humanity?

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.660
And, these particular characteristics

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.240
that allowed homo sapiens
to create our anthropic era.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.210
And, another is the critical ways in which

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.140
our imagination creates
knowledge about things

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.770
that are beyond our
ability to experience them,

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.920
whether it's about far off places

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.310
or far off time,

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.610
both in the future and in the past.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.970
And, so in particular,

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.070
I'm very interested and curious

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.510
about how we imagine

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.530
something as distant from our experience

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.343
as the origin of humanity.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.920
But, it begs the question,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.320
just what is imagination?

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.944
And, so imagination,

00:04:38.944 --> 00:04:42.430
it's kind of a mushy term.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.350
It can mean so many things

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.130
that it might end up
meaning almost nothing.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.327
So, is there a way we
can start to think about

00:04:51.327 --> 00:04:53.970
how we approach understanding

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:54.803
the phenomenon of imagination?

00:04:54.803 --> 00:04:56.480
And, so we might start

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.746
by looking at what smart people

00:04:59.746 --> 00:05:02.030
have said about imagination.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.376
And, so, the kind of poster
child for a smart person

00:05:06.376 --> 00:05:08.580
is Albert Einstein, right?

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.620
And, so Einstein said quite a few things

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.040
about imagination over his career.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.208
And, just one of these is,

00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:16.837
"Imagination is more
important than knowledge.

00:05:16.837 --> 00:05:17.847
"Knowledge is limited,

00:05:17.847 --> 00:05:20.080
"but imagination encircles the world."

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.230
And, so Einstein might have
been a pretty smart guy,

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.814
but this actually says almost
nothing about imagination.

00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:26.778
It's very inspiring.

00:05:26.778 --> 00:05:29.790
But, the only thing I
really take from this

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.820
is that imagination is extensive,

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.844
so that's a characteristic
that I can draw from it.

00:05:33.844 --> 00:05:36.820
So, maybe someone who has a
little more stakes in the game

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.076
can give another kind of
shading about imagination.

00:05:40.076 --> 00:05:42.320
And, Maria Montessori, an educator,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.092
so imagination is probably
a very important thing

00:05:44.092 --> 00:05:47.030
for an educator to say something about,

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.210
and for Montessori,

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.947
it was, "Imagination does not become great

00:05:49.947 --> 00:05:50.946
"until human beings,

00:05:50.946 --> 00:05:52.887
"given the courage and the strength,

00:05:52.887 --> 00:05:54.327
"use it to create."

00:05:56.365 --> 00:05:58.610
So, she's kind of, you know,

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.980
coming down a little
negative on imagination

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:01.910
in this quote.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.667
That creativity is important,

00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:07.610
but imagination might be
a little bit frivolous.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.450
And, Carl Sagan,

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.264
you know, another kind of smart person,

00:06:12.264 --> 00:06:15.060
gives us another kind of even,

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.240
maybe another kind of
warning about imagination.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.971
That it's gonna take us to places

00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:22.120
to worlds that never were,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.282
which sounds kinda scary, right?

00:06:24.282 --> 00:06:27.587
But, without it, we can't go anywhere.

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:29.850
So, he kind of redeems imagination.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:30.683
That, well, in the end,

00:06:30.683 --> 00:06:31.680
we probably actually need it

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.340
even though it's flown us off to someplace

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.003
that doesn't even exist.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.230
But, I kinda start to turn to some things

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.240
that I think start to shed

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.180
a little more value on imagination.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.960
And, of course, the first
one I pull up is an artist.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.250
You know, Mark Twain,

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.067
who says that,

00:06:49.067 --> 00:06:50.557
"You can't depend on your eyes

00:06:50.557 --> 00:06:52.350
"when your imagination is out of focus."

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.450
And, now to me,

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.390
this starts to actually
give us something valuable

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.043
to think about because
it starts to connect

00:06:57.043 --> 00:07:01.480
the imagination to our senses.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.812
And, so there must be
some relationship between

00:07:03.812 --> 00:07:07.720
experience and imagination.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.290
And, so, I think Oliver Sacks kind of puts

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.640
a number of pieces together

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.200
that I think are really
critical to think about.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.347
That, "every act of
perception is to some degree

00:07:17.347 --> 00:07:18.687
"an act of creation,

00:07:18.687 --> 00:07:19.987
"and every act of memory

00:07:19.987 --> 00:07:22.290
"is some degree an act of imagination."

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.670
So, we start to connect
perception, memory, and imagination

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.270
together as interrelated phenomena

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.063
that are quite important.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.695
And, so if we want to start to find,

00:07:33.695 --> 00:07:38.695
"How might we think through
exploring that connection?"

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.300
And, I think art is a
really valuable place

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.190
to think about this.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.693
I think of art as this kind
of laboratory of imagination.

00:07:47.693 --> 00:07:49.430
For a number of reasons,

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.123
and one mention here by the
philosopher George Raymond.

00:07:54.047 --> 00:07:57.000
But art, for both how art is made,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.853
but equally important for
how art is experienced.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.695
And, so as an example,

00:08:02.695 --> 00:08:06.740
we can start by looking at this fresco

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.880
in the Church of Saint Ignacio in Rome,

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.710
and start to trace through
maybe a couple of ways

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.967
in which the imagination is
working to make this a thing.

00:08:14.967 --> 00:08:16.300
So, first all,

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.150
we note that it's this trompe-l'oeil.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.245
It's using this perceptual
trick that was figured out

00:08:22.245 --> 00:08:26.120
called perspective that
tricks us into thinking

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.860
that something is a space
when it's just a flat plane.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.835
And, they do it here by extending the,

00:08:31.835 --> 00:08:33.910
the trompe-l'oeil part is because

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.800
they are extending the
architectural features

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.340
with this kind of imagined
architectural feature.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.040
And, it's also then connects

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.810
that imagined extension of this church

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.960
into that entirely imagined
placed called heaven,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.270
and so it situates it in a story space

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.570
which is this incredibly
powerful attraction

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:59.040
that we have to our
underlying cognitive need

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.840
to make sense of things.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.500
And, it populates that space
with a bunch of figures

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.300
that look a lot like the
kind of sweaty, smelly things

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.080
that are standing all around
us on the floor of the church.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.430
But, of course, they're
up there in heaven.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.450
But, all of it's just made

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.400
from these little dobs of paint, right?

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.363
These little colored pieces of pigment.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.880
But, our perception doesn't pay attention

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.095
to the small detail differences.

00:09:27.095 --> 00:09:29.530
We abstract from it and cohere it

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.860
into what we think is the
phenomena that it likely is,

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.080
which is it's probably
a person or an angel.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.000
A fictional person.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.210
And, so artists always
exploit these capabilities

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.290
and deficiencies in our senses

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.890
to engage our imaginations
on so many levels.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.960
And, so we all know
about how cinema works.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.050
We don't actually see
things that are moving.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.220
We're just seeing static frames

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.427
that are shown to us so quickly

00:09:58.427 --> 00:10:00.524
and with some ordered
coherency between them

00:10:00.524 --> 00:10:02.670
that we can't help but think

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.630
it's a depiction of something in motion.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.630
So, it's depicting something
beyond what it actually is.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.367
And, this is has always been a desire

00:10:13.367 --> 00:10:16.270
and an operation of art.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.790
So, even in these cave paintings

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.735
from 30 thousand years ago

00:10:20.735 --> 00:10:23.740
the artists start to try
to develop methodologies

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.370
to show something that's beyond

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.140
the thing that's actually there.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.379
To show something in motion
with this static medium.

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:33.700
And, by doing that,

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.040
they are directly engaging our imagination

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.760
as much as they're engaging your senses.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.310
So, art, we can see,

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.650
is this collaboration between our senses,

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.800
our memories, and our imagination,

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.655
which is also just the equation
for reality itself, right?

00:10:50.655 --> 00:10:53.220
And, so, if we want to
start to think about

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.673
how we might understand that.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.530
We've started to think
about how imagination

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.527
is a phenomena that takes us
from one moment to the next,

00:11:02.527 --> 00:11:05.590
that takes us from those
moments to the near future,

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.130
and then takes us from that near future

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.970
to think about the far future.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.680
We can also think of it

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.060
as maybe having different areas

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.300
that it kind of functions.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.590
That goes from the neurological

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.640
to the cognitive to the social,

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.700
that takes us from thinking
about kind of personal fate

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.494
to our local, global,
and even cosmic fates.

00:11:25.494 --> 00:11:30.494
So, I follow the same mistake
that I just laid on Einstein.

00:11:31.007 --> 00:11:34.629
Where imagination is
everything everywhere, right?

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:36.400
But within this,

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.190
now we actually have a
little bit of a rubric

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.900
that we might be able to
explore some things in.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:41.950
And, so later on today,

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.690
I think you're gonna be
hearing about a project

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:46.490
that Allyson is doing

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:47.610
that we're collaborating on

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.750
about thinking about an
underlying neurological basis

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.740
of human imagination.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.894
And, as we have said that there this,

00:11:57.894 --> 00:11:59.606
as Allyson was mentioning,

00:11:59.606 --> 00:12:01.760
it would be an interesting thing

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.540
to be able to think about human
imagination comparatively.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.520
And, so here's these great sculptures

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.780
by the Kennis brothers

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.815
depicting early homo
sapien and Neanderthals.

00:12:13.815 --> 00:12:17.134
Can we think about some ways in which

00:12:17.134 --> 00:12:22.134
that the homo sapien
differs in some capacities

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.450
from our cousins or early humans?

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.018
You know, we know from early humans,

00:12:28.018 --> 00:12:30.395
we see this artifactual record.

00:12:30.395 --> 00:12:33.590
The Venus of Willendorf.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.105
We see other examples
that go continuously back

00:12:36.105 --> 00:12:38.537
in time and from other places.

00:12:38.537 --> 00:12:42.523
And, even some examples
from very long ago.

00:12:43.861 --> 00:12:48.170
And, whether or not these
are kind of extrapolated,

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:53.170
we have always made little
fertility goddess figurines,

00:12:53.552 --> 00:12:57.260
or perhaps we're always looking for

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.863
fertility goddess figurines.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.977
This idea that humans have been making

00:13:02.977 --> 00:13:06.480
symbolic culture for a long time

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.310
is one of the underlying things

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.060
that we think about with imagination.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.570
And, even now we start to
find new kind of things

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.900
that help to fill out that story,

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.060
so seeing that there
are Neanderthal things,

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.240
things that we're now
attributing to Neanderthals

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.140
as part of their symbolic culture.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.460
So, might there be ways,

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.930
besides looking at the
artifactual records,

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.170
to think about human imagination

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.120
by looking more directly

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.260
at the underlying biology of these things?

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.170
And, so Allyson is like a magician

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.250
as far as I am concerned.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.410
He has come up with these ways in which

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.388
he can do something quite extraordinary

00:13:45.388 --> 00:13:48.500
which is take human stem cells,

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.450
and on the left we have human stem cells

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.150
that have grown brain organoids,

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.310
and on the right we have those stem cells

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.680
but they've been coaxed
to have Neanderthal genes

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.560
that express Neanderthal neurology.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.226
And, so on the right we
have Neanderthal brains.

00:14:06.226 --> 00:14:10.110
And, so what we're looking
to do is then test them

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.540
in relationship to how what kind of

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.060
anticipatory responses they may have

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.940
to different stimulating environments

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.440
and see what kinds of
differences they have.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.273
And, you can already see

00:14:20.273 --> 00:14:22.360
there are some morphological differences

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.510
that are quite evident.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.220
So, not only looking at the
kind of neurological structure,

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.310
I want to give a very quick example

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:30.800
of something a little higher order

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.280
to thinking about at
the cognitive structure

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.910
where we're looking at other aspects

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.790
that I think are underlying components

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.130
of our imaginations.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.610
And, one of them is spatial navigation.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:43.860
So, understanding how you are in space

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.248
and what space consists of

00:14:45.248 --> 00:14:47.360
has obviously been a very important part

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.980
of most species survival.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.900
And, here what we have started to learn

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.500
is that we have two mechanisms

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.220
of how we think about space.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.160
One in which we're egocentric,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.580
and we kind of think the world
reorients itself around us,

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.870
and one that is allocentric,

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:07.870
where we think the world is
in a fixed coordinate space,

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.942
and we reorient ourself to it.

00:15:10.942 --> 00:15:13.162
We use both these mechanisms.

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:16.290
And, in fact, when we kind
of switch between them

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.319
is one in which a place

00:15:17.319 --> 00:15:20.620
where we really have to open our eyes

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.244
and kind of re-understand

00:15:22.244 --> 00:15:24.510
what our relationship to the world is.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.940
Now, it turns out those
two kinds of experiences

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.860
excite different parts of the brain,

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.140
and we can sense that with EEG devices.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.393
So, we've been working with
a team of neuroscientists

00:15:36.393 --> 00:15:38.661
that develop virtual worlds

00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:41.499
in which they have kind
of novel structures

00:15:41.499 --> 00:15:45.469
where we can try to directly switch you

00:15:45.469 --> 00:15:50.370
into going from one navigational
scheme to the other.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:54.340
And, we do that by what
you're seeing in an example

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.320
in a video of this experience.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.920
You embody one of these avatars.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.390
You have a navigational task

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:01.160
you have to do in this environment.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.816
And, we radically change
it in a very uncanny way

00:16:04.816 --> 00:16:09.020
to try to keep you highly stimulated

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.350
in your spatial response

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:13.393
to making a coherent experience
from this environment.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.620
But, of course,

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.283
I'll maybe just wait til
the last clip plays here.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:23.805
In doing that,

00:16:23.805 --> 00:16:27.830
we sense what kind of
navigation they're using

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:29.520
and then try these tricks to trick them

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.053
to switch them into the other.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.710
But, I also want us to
be aware of this idea

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:41.218
that it's easy for us to
study humans in a certain way,

00:16:41.218 --> 00:16:44.950
but we can also fall into
this kind of circular trap

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.930
of human exceptionalism, you know.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.429
That we're the only
thing with imagination.

00:16:49.429 --> 00:16:54.429
So, I think certainly we are
exceptional in many ways,

00:16:55.234 --> 00:16:58.850
but trying to characterize and understand

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.810
where it makes sense
to kind of think about

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:04.280
what's different from
us versus other species

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.150
is a critical issue.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.340
So, for instance, I know my dog

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.199
has this amazing imagination, you know?

00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:14.120
Every time I pretend to throw the ball,

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.223
it imagines that I've thrown the ball.

00:17:16.223 --> 00:17:21.220
And, I've done this with
that dog a thousand times,

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.700
but there's obviously something about

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.350
the anticipation of throwing the ball

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:29.853
that it's more important for
him to fail a thousand times

00:17:29.853 --> 00:17:34.210
because it allows him to
succeed just a little bit better

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.043
the other few times that I do it.

00:17:39.489 --> 00:17:42.610
Imagination, maybe there's
even roots in things

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.640
that don't even have a
neurological systems.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.750
So this is a white blood cell

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.330
navigating through a complex
environment of red blood cells,

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.100
trying to chase down a virus.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.073
And, if you watch how these microbes move,

00:17:55.073 --> 00:17:58.143
they seem to at times look
to cut them off at the pass

00:17:58.143 --> 00:18:01.660
and anticipate their moving
one way versus the other.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.810
And, this is without
any kind of neurology.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.670
So, imagination is this
tricky thing to think about

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.130
just as all these other phenomena

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.648
like cognition, consciousness.

00:18:12.648 --> 00:18:16.060
To try to think about we often bring,

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.010
we first, of course,
bring to these questions

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.040
our own experiences and understanding,

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.150
and we have to be quite imaginative

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:23.890
to kind of think outside of that.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:26.120
And, it can get us into some problems.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.440
So, for a long time,

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.360
I think it was one of
the prevailing sentiments

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.060
of Neanderthals was they
didn't have a symbolic culture.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.492
And, so this is from a recent exhibition

00:18:36.492 --> 00:18:38.380
at the Australian Museum

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.780
that talked about that
they lacked the depth

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.170
of symbolic and progressive thought

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.080
displayed in modern humans.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.210
And, that was before a number
of artifacts were discovered

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.500
that may have kind of make us kind of have

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.763
a more complex relationship
to that question.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.400
So, in my work,

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.403
I try to think about things that might

00:18:59.403 --> 00:19:03.210
be able to augment our imagination.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.780
And, we're starting to do a lot of things

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.840
with artificial intelligence.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.280
For the fourth time around

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.840
that artificial intelligence is suddenly

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.913
the next big thing.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.300
But, we're working with ways

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.880
to think about how to model aspects

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.370
of human imagination through things

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.290
like genetic algorithms and neural nets,

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:28.210
and we bring to that a kind
of human-centric approach.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.043
But in the end,

00:19:29.043 --> 00:19:31.206
the kind of effective measures

00:19:31.206 --> 00:19:33.210
may cause us to really come up with

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.780
a completely different kind of imagination

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.453
than a human-based model.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.049
So, the last thing I want to talk about

00:19:40.049 --> 00:19:41.480
in relationship with this

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.270
is then how stories kind of work in this.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.386
So, we're the Arthur C. Clarke Center,

00:19:46.386 --> 00:19:51.386
and an aspect of that is
the value of science fiction

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:55.510
as this way to kind of
cause us to radically think

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:57.700
about new kinds of human conditions.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.400
And, so some of the work we do with that,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.330
this is an example of a project we did

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:02.290
with a science fiction author,

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:03.350
Kim Stanley Robinson,

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:04.360
and a performance artist,

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.880
Marina Abramovic,

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.645
where we took Marina Abramovic methods

00:20:08.645 --> 00:20:12.480
which take things that
usually take a few seconds

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.630
and try to extend them into experiences

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.380
that last over a few hours,

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.820
and Stan Robinson's work

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.310
who's trying to get us to understand

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.240
what it would be like to
experience a phenomena

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.540
that lasted a thousand years,

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.480
like to travel to another star.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.360
And, the ability to kind of
put these two temporal shifts

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.984
in relationship to each other

00:20:29.984 --> 00:20:32.500
gave people a far more
visceral understanding

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.320
of the experience of temporality.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.250
And, so these things like stories

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.250
and performance and ritual art

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.260
may have been things that
we think really discovered

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.239
once we started to extend
the day into the night.

00:20:47.239 --> 00:20:50.551
And, then think about what
we do with that nighttime.

00:20:50.551 --> 00:20:54.050
We come up with ways to make better sense

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.263
out of everything that
happened in the daytime.

00:20:56.263 --> 00:20:58.460
And, so these stories,

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.400
while they sometimes
were completely fictional

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.370
and talked about worlds that never were,

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.610
sometimes they actually
brought sense to things

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.680
that we previously
wouldn't have connected.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.513
And, of course,

00:21:11.513 --> 00:21:12.800
as we moved forward in time,

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.413
we've just come up with
more and more proliferations

00:21:15.413 --> 00:21:17.790
about those campfires.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:21.370
And, more and more ways to
tell stories around them.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:25.112
Now, it's often thought that
language came before art,

00:21:25.112 --> 00:21:27.457
but I have another theory

00:21:27.457 --> 00:21:29.146
that I think language came about

00:21:29.146 --> 00:21:32.142
so that art could be
critiqued and explained.

00:21:32.142 --> 00:21:33.451
(audience laughing)

00:21:33.451 --> 00:21:35.750
And, this is the artist Joseph Beuys.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.003
He's trying to explain
art to a dead rabbit.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.804
So, Picasso kind of gave us this idea.

00:21:42.804 --> 00:21:46.927
He said, "We all know
that art is not truth.

00:21:46.927 --> 00:21:49.640
"Art is a lie that makes
us realize the truth."

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.210
And, so this is the
astonishing thing, I think.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:53.790
That our imaginations,

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.300
our ability to conjure
meaning from occurrences

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.160
has given us this ability to
create all that we've created.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.512
And, so how this happened

00:22:00.512 --> 00:22:02.100
and where this will take us

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.190
couldn't be more important

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:04.440
or more exciting to think about,

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.450
and I look forward to digging into that

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:07.283
for the rest of the day.

00:22:07.283 --> 00:22:08.836
So, thank you.

00:22:08.836 --> 00:22:10.760
(audience applauds)

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.364
- Alright, I'm gonna thank the organizers

00:22:12.364 --> 00:22:14.580
for inviting me,

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.530
and for providing this
incredible opportunity

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.100
for all of us to be together

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.510
and to imagine.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.630
It is the human capacity
to move between the worlds

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.390
of what is and what could be

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:24.520
that marks the emergence

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.550
of a particular evolutionary
context and history

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.230
for the genus homo.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:30.650
Us, humans.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:32.130
I argue that it's the
human capacity to imagine,

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:33.470
to be creative,

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.090
to hope and to dream,

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:36.404
to infuse the world with meanings,

00:22:36.404 --> 00:22:39.790
and to cast our aspirations far and wide

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:41.580
limited neither by personal experience

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.160
nor material reality

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.690
that has enabled our lineage,

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:45.870
the genus homo,

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:47.550
to develop a particular niche,

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:49.810
a particular way of being in the world,

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.540
where imagination plays a central role.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:53.810
Humans are very creative,

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:56.690
and we use our imagination to be so.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.170
This has an evolutionary history.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:02.570
The real challenge to
understanding human evolution then

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:05.757
is not just the tracing
of the bones and stones

00:23:05.757 --> 00:23:09.470
of the 2.6 million year
history of our genus.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:13.230
Instead, it is understanding those changes

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.670
alongside the

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.610
reality that our lineage

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.536
is a lineage that went from the
makers of basic stone tools,

00:23:20.536 --> 00:23:24.230
to the creators of amazing cave art,

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:27.707
to the constructors of massive cities,

00:23:27.707 --> 00:23:32.190
and the dominant force
shaping the ecosystem today.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.150
Our lineages transition from a cluster

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:39.150
of medium-sized, fang-less,
horn-less, claw-less,

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.600
semi-naked or fully naked ape-like things

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.260
with a few rocks and some sticks

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.172
to a species who invented domestication,

00:23:47.172 --> 00:23:51.950
economies, cities, nations,
religion, warfare, and peace.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:55.520
That is the challenge of
understanding human evolution.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.470
Now, let me put humans in context here

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.661
before you think I'm talking

00:23:58.661 --> 00:24:01.040
only about human exceptionalism.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.470
That is, we know there
are may other species

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:04.303
that use tools,

00:24:04.303 --> 00:24:07.330
that have incredibly complex social lives,

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:09.650
that use sound as communication

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.180
traveling across incredible distance,

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.500
and that have cultural varieties

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:18.040
that actually impact the way
in which their genomes shift.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.850
Here's an example of hunting patterns

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:24.540
across latitudinal variation in orca pods

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.040
that has actually had a huge change

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.030
in the structure of their genomes.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.780
So, gene culture co-evolution

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.090
doesn't just occur in humans.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.230
It occurs in many organisms.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:38.230
However, we have studied
other complex organisms

00:24:38.279 --> 00:24:41.400
like chimpanzees and whales and orcas

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.260
for a long time,

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.379
and we know a lot about what they do

00:24:43.379 --> 00:24:45.510
and what they don't do.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.696
We know that chimpanzees
don't have cash economies,

00:24:47.696 --> 00:24:51.500
governments, religious
institutions, creeds, or fanatics.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.420
They don't arrest and deport each other.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.450
And, they don't create massive economies

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.830
of material and social inequality.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:59.670
They don't change planet-wide ecosystems,

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.376
build cities, make airplanes,

00:25:01.376 --> 00:25:04.310
drive thousands of other
species to extinction,

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.271
or give CARTA talks.

00:25:06.271 --> 00:25:07.830
(audience laughing)

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:08.663
But, we do.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.170
We are a particular mammal,

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:13.620
a particular primate,

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.880
a particular hominoid kind of ape

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.444
that is able to look
at the world around us

00:25:17.444 --> 00:25:19.113
and see it as it is,

00:25:19.113 --> 00:25:22.260
imagine entirely new possibilities,

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.453
and convert those imaginings
into material reality.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.840
We've evolved the capacity
to be the most compassionate,

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:29.700
the cruelest,

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.320
the most creative and the most destructive

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.680
of all life on this planet,

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.930
and we demonstrate these abilities often.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.495
How this difference came to be matters.

00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:41.213
And, it is by delving into humanity's

00:25:41.213 --> 00:25:43.283
very distinctive history

00:25:43.283 --> 00:25:48.283
that we are able to understand
why we are the way we are.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:50.914
There's incredibly good evidence

00:25:50.914 --> 00:25:52.958
that over the last two million years

00:25:52.958 --> 00:25:54.840
the members of the genus Homo,

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.760
all of those things

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.440
that have something to do
with our specific ancestry,

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.161
underwent significant
changes in their brains,

00:26:00.161 --> 00:26:01.810
their bodies, their behavior

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.110
and they created a new niche,

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.800
a new way of existing,

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.810
both ecologically and
socially in the world.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:09.030
This is a human niche,

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:13.542
and this niche involved
a particular evolution

00:26:13.542 --> 00:26:16.330
of something called the human imagination.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.270
Human imagination,

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.200
I would like to argue,

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.590
is as important as the bones and stones

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:23.160
in understanding the
processes and patterns

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.173
of human evolution.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.760
Alright, here is a summary

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.552
of a whole bunch of interesting
things that have happened

00:26:28.552 --> 00:26:31.700
over the last two million
years to our lineage.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.100
What I want to point out here,

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.190
and I'll provide some specific examples,

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:37.794
is that this is not just about linear,

00:26:37.794 --> 00:26:40.000
even though it's a line (laughs),

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.230
linear evolution.

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.300
This is about the changing relation

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.060
between individuals,

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.776
between individuals in the material world,

00:26:46.776 --> 00:26:49.670
between individuals, the material
world, and their cognitive

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.220
interpretations of that material world,

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.690
and that cycle getting more and more dense

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:56.730
as we changed,

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:58.130
as we changed the world around us,

00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.910
as we changed one another,

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.810
we began an intricate dance

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.900
which is culminating today,

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.110
and, hopefully, will
continue into the future.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:10.197
So, rather than talk about
this shifting in crania

00:27:10.197 --> 00:27:12.890
or other morphologies,

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.350
let's spend a little time

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.960
with a few of the pieces
of evidence we have

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.360
of our evolutionary history

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.620
that talk about this incredible dynamic,

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.380
this feedback between the material,

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.877
the social, the cognitive, and
our evolutionary histories.

00:27:26.877 --> 00:27:31.877
So, we know that significant
dietary changes happened

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.800
fairly early on in our history.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.936
But those significant dietary changes

00:27:36.936 --> 00:27:40.130
enabled, for example, our
brains to get much larger

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:41.370
and a variety of other things;

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.960
however, we sometimes forget

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.220
that those significant dietary changes

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.680
are really associated
with the use of tools.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.128
Now, I'm gonna show you some tools here.

00:27:52.128 --> 00:27:56.006
Up here in your upper left corner,

00:27:56.006 --> 00:27:58.050
this is an Oldowan tool.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:59.500
It's about 1.8 million years old.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.870
I'm sure none of you are impressed.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:03.718
It is a rock with some sharp edges.

00:28:03.718 --> 00:28:05.573
But, you should be.

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.420
Nothing else in the
history of this planet,

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:09.710
aside from our lineage,

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:12.688
has ever had the capacity to take a stone,

00:28:12.688 --> 00:28:14.750
to look at that stone,

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:17.400
and to imagine something
else inside that stone.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.380
To take another object

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.210
and work it on that initial stone

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:24.540
to create something anew from inside.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.990
That's fairly impressive.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:29.380
And, we know how difficult
some of these processes are.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:32.023
If you look at the next illustration here,

00:28:32.023 --> 00:28:34.480
you will notice that this is actually

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.730
a reconstruction of all of
the mapping of a stone tool.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:39.770
Right? So what we actually do

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:42.530
is you go the detritus, the debris,

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:43.670
and you piece it back together

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:46.230
so you can look at every single strike.

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.063
Now, when I say we,

00:28:47.063 --> 00:28:48.860
I mean the graduate students
that actually do the work.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.099
Not the professors.

00:28:50.099 --> 00:28:51.670
(audience laughing)

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:53.790
But, what you then know is you can see

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:55.610
that the individual stone tool maker,

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.710
even for these fairly old stone tools,

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:58.930
here we're getting into

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:01.120
the Acheulean stone tool industry,

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.160
looking something a bit more like this,

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.407
what we can see is that you take it,

00:29:04.407 --> 00:29:05.660
you have the platform,

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.493
you look at it,

00:29:06.493 --> 00:29:07.326
you strike it.

00:29:07.326 --> 00:29:09.680
You've totally, radically
altered the whole shape.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.187
You now have to reimagine
the entire thing,

00:29:11.187 --> 00:29:12.420
hit it in the next place,

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.253
hit it in the next place.

00:29:13.253 --> 00:29:14.710
And, when we construct those together,

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:16.220
it is unbelievably difficult.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.275
It takes a student today months to learn

00:29:19.275 --> 00:29:21.510
how to be a good stone tool maker,

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.800
and that is with video training,

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.370
with the rocks already brought to you,

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:27.110
and without any large
predators trying to eat you

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:28.565
while you do your work.

00:29:28.565 --> 00:29:29.780
(audience laughing)

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:33.357
We can underestimate
how important this was.

00:29:33.357 --> 00:29:35.540
Think about what I just said.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.010
Not all stones are equally
good for making stone tools,

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:39.980
so to make stone tools,

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:40.813
even the most basic ones,

00:29:40.813 --> 00:29:42.270
you have to be able to find decent stones

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:43.530
and replicate that finding.

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.150
You have to go back and
get them again and again.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:45.983
Then, you have to carry-

00:29:45.983 --> 00:29:47.430
I don't know how many
of you carry regularly

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:49.240
20 or 30 kilos of stones with you,

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.070
but that's a lot of work.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.330
Dispersing that socially
is very important.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:54.355
Then you have to make stone tools,

00:29:54.355 --> 00:29:56.660
and in an environment that is packed

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.710
with very large things with large teeth

00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:59.700
that want to eat you,

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.470
and remember you are very small, naked,

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:04.490
and you've got some rocks
and some few sticks.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:05.510
When you make stone tools,

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:06.343
it makes a lot of noise.

00:30:06.343 --> 00:30:08.628
So, you've got everything
sort of stacked against you.

00:30:08.628 --> 00:30:11.130
How did our ancestors figure this out?

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:12.430
How did they work through it?

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:15.531
Imagination, collaboration, cooperation.

00:30:15.531 --> 00:30:17.580
Really focusing in on the social.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.756
But really, interestingly,

00:30:18.756 --> 00:30:21.678
current work looking at what it means

00:30:21.678 --> 00:30:23.780
to make stone tools

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.160
by Dietrich Stout and a
number of other groups

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.320
have demonstrated that when
you make these stone tools

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:35.387
certain areas of neuro biological activity

00:30:35.387 --> 00:30:36.830
are accentuated,

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:39.280
and there's some corollary patterns.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.830
Now, what are these areas?

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:42.820
Frequently these are
areas that are associated

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.350
with higher functioning and memory,

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:46.670
with planning,

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:48.150
and, interestingly enough,

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:49.810
with language.

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.220
But, wait, don't order yet,

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.810
because it's not just
the making of stone tools

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:54.530
that does this things in your brain,

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:55.480
which probably means

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.780
they have a deep ancestry for doing that,

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.910
but also if you are
watching a stone tool maker

00:31:03.282 --> 00:31:05.573
you mirror some of those functions.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.660
And, here is the critical
component of stone tools.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.130
It's not about the tools themselves.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:13.710
It's about the social context

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:15.823
in which they were made and used.

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:18.010
We can debate whether or not

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:20.550
teaching occurred 1.5 million years ago.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:21.530
What we can't debate

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:23.250
is these complex stone tools

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:26.920
were made 1.5 - one million
500 thousand years ago,

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.913
that you or I could not make
without being instructed.

00:31:31.421 --> 00:31:32.740
Was there language?

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.110
I don't think so.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.010
But there was a broad bandwidth

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:38.070
of highly dense information transfer

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.350
that was social,

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:41.053
and it was imaginative.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.221
Now, around this time period,

00:31:43.221 --> 00:31:46.090
and between about 1.5
and a million years ago,

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:47.080
as I pointed out,

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.570
that niche is constantly
sort of augmenting

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:52.492
as more ways of dealing
with the world occur.

00:31:52.492 --> 00:31:55.540
That density and those
feedbacks continue to shape

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.910
our bodies, our lives, our cognition.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:01.940
We know that by about
half a million years ago,

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.450
you know, give or take 50 thousand years.

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:05.391
I like to work in big numbers.

00:32:05.391 --> 00:32:08.842
We had an incredible
capacity to collaborate

00:32:08.842 --> 00:32:10.727
in ways that seemed to exceed

00:32:10.727 --> 00:32:13.250
the collaboration of many other organisms.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:16.160
We had an incredibly complex
cooperative parenting

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:20.130
where males and young were
also caring for offspring.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.020
We had a pattern of the whole communities

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.840
responding to environmental pressures,

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.430
not just individuals.

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:31.430
And, we had evidence of
augmentation and enhancement

00:32:31.756 --> 00:32:34.480
in our imaginative capabilities.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.480
For example,

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.689
and we'll hear more about
this later today, fire.

00:32:38.689 --> 00:32:41.470
We heard about it already
in the previous talk.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:43.110
People underestimate fire all the time.

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:44.240
Yes, fire is wonderful

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.570
because it allows us access to nutrients

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:48.400
that we wouldn't have
otherwise by heating food.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.910
It also allows us to
modify stones and wood

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:53.060
to alter their physical structures

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.480
so that we can better use them.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.350
But, more importantly,

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:57.410
as is already mentioned,

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:00.630
fire turns night to day.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:04.167
Fire releases us from the
constraint of the sun.

00:33:04.167 --> 00:33:08.280
Fire enables and expansion
of the time we have

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.670
to be together,

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:10.900
to think together,

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.630
to imagine together.

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:14.860
But it's not just evidence of fire,

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.920
which maybe goes as far back
as 1.6 million years ago.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.540
We have glimmerings, elements.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.630
But it really isn't until

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:24.200
about four or five hundred
thousand years ago,

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.033
three hundred thousand years ago,

00:33:25.033 --> 00:33:28.460
that we start to see it
with increasing regularity.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.330
But, it's not just fire,

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.010
and, really from my perspective,

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:35.150
cool stone tools.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:37.481
Here's a nearly 300
thousand year old clam shell

00:33:37.481 --> 00:33:39.557
from Java that at some point

00:33:39.557 --> 00:33:42.599
something in the lineage Homo picked up,

00:33:42.599 --> 00:33:44.300
grabbed another object,

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.453
and doodled on it.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:47.933
Most people,

00:33:47.933 --> 00:33:49.477
just like that early Oldowan
stone tool I showed you,

00:33:49.477 --> 00:33:51.210
are not impressed by doodles.

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:53.080
But, you should be.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.570
Think what it means to doodle.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:56.320
Think what it means to take an object,

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.477
to take another object,

00:33:57.477 --> 00:34:01.163
and to alter the surface
to create a new sensation.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.540
We see this over the last
300, 400 thousand years.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.360
We see glimmerings earlier,

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.610
but it's really over this last three

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:10.714
to four hundred thousand years

00:34:10.714 --> 00:34:13.350
that we start to see this
with much higher density.

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:15.130
At that same time period,

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:16.748
we also have two very interesting,

00:34:16.748 --> 00:34:18.740
okay, not very many,

00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.040
but two very interesting events

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.340
here at (unclear) about
400 thousand years ago

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.520
we have a number of
bodies found in one place,

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.430
a deep pit.

00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:27.310
In that deep pit

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:29.340
are a couple cave bears that
looked like they fell in

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.173
and a couple other things

00:34:30.173 --> 00:34:31.830
that had been gnawing on the bones,

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:32.941
but nothing else except for,

00:34:32.941 --> 00:34:34.750
as you can see here,

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:38.030
this beautiful hand ax about this big.

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.789
It's made from a stone that is not local.

00:34:40.789 --> 00:34:42.240
And, it is gorgeous.

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:46.620
It was carved and thrown in, never used.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:47.453
What does that mean?

00:34:47.453 --> 00:34:48.920
We won't ever know.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.160
But, I bet it had something to do

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.022
with the imagination and the creativity

00:34:52.022 --> 00:34:55.780
and meaning for that group of people.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.080
And, more recently,

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.210
about say between 200 and
300 thousand years ago,

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:03.949
we have another evidence of
possible movement of bodies

00:35:03.949 --> 00:35:06.660
into an underground cave.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.270
People debate whether it's burial or not.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:10.430
I don't want to get into that debate.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:11.866
But, I do want to point out

00:35:11.866 --> 00:35:14.450
that we had glimmerings earlier on.

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:15.520
But all of these things,

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.960
burials, art, creative imagings,

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.140
incredible manipulation of the world,

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.040
all has a deep evolutionary history

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:26.150
and didn't just show up
when our species shows up

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:27.880
'cause everything I've just showed you

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.493
predates homo sapiens sapiens.

00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:37.390
But, by the last 30 to
50 thousand years or so

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:38.750
we find clear examples of identity,

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:42.104
clear examples of
individuals taking items,

00:35:42.104 --> 00:35:45.380
reshaping them to create
a completely new reality,

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.350
a new imagination,

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:47.840
a new way to be in the world.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.870
And, it is my,

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:50.180
and many others' arguments,

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:51.390
that this new way to be in the world,

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:52.820
these new senses of identity,

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.270
this new deployment of imagination,

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:58.220
had a huge impact on those feedback loops

00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.120
between our ecology,

00:35:59.120 --> 00:35:59.970
between our materials,

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:00.803
between our bodies,

00:36:00.803 --> 00:36:01.750
between our cognition,

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:03.723
and between our societies.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:08.210
So, the human niche is, of course,

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:11.070
centrally located and focused.

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.680
Our studies of understanding
human evolution

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.860
has to be about our brain,

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:14.693
and our DNA,

00:36:14.693 --> 00:36:15.526
and our morphology,

00:36:15.526 --> 00:36:16.359
and our bodies,

00:36:16.359 --> 00:36:18.112
but it also has to be about
all of the different ecologies

00:36:18.112 --> 00:36:20.940
that humans have spread
across the entire planet.

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.974
So, it's our brains, our
bodies, our ecologies,

00:36:22.974 --> 00:36:26.260
and, and you already all know this,

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.900
our perceptual realities.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.070
The way we see the world.

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:30.040
The way we think about the world.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.950
The way we feel the world is as important

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:35.730
as our bones, our muscles, and our DNA,

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:37.250
because part of that system

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:38.083
and that feedback,

00:36:38.083 --> 00:36:40.227
that complex dynamic that is the human,

00:36:40.227 --> 00:36:43.650
involves the imagination.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:46.580
So, the human niche includes creativity,

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:48.120
cooperation and imagination.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.780
Meaning, especially making meaning,

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.228
matters as an agent in the processes

00:36:53.228 --> 00:36:55.036
of our evolutionary histories.

00:36:55.036 --> 00:36:57.425
It is specifically feedback systems

00:36:57.425 --> 00:36:59.290
between behaviors, ecologies,

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:02.660
cognitive and bodily
systems involved in teaching

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.150
and learning and meaning
making, communicating,

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:07.470
that facilitated a new
niche that had huge impacts.

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:09.514
For example, it set up our brains.

00:37:09.514 --> 00:37:11.120
It structured them in a way

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:15.920
that Michael Arbib calls
language ready, right?

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.800
You don't just get language.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.190
It has to evolve.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:20.850
And, the cognitive and
neuro biological structures

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:21.683
have to be there.

00:37:21.683 --> 00:37:22.516
And, part of that is this.

00:37:22.516 --> 00:37:24.303
We also have communities
of shared imagination.

00:37:24.303 --> 00:37:26.651
Seeing these multiple iterative events

00:37:26.651 --> 00:37:29.340
of meaning making across space and time

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.076
shows that communities of humans,

00:37:31.076 --> 00:37:33.390
and I'm using the term broadly

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:35.950
because I don't necessarily
mean homo sapiens,

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:37.121
were capable of working together

00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:40.333
to remake the world in their

00:37:40.333 --> 00:37:42.650
and from their imagination.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:43.890
So, meaning making, imagination,

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:46.880
communication, creativity,
and community are central.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.920
That's my pitch.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.567
However, all of this
stuff sounds very positive

00:37:50.567 --> 00:37:52.580
and really, really exciting.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.000
I would like to say that our capacity

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.833
to be with one another,

00:37:54.833 --> 00:37:55.895
to share our minds to imagine,

00:37:55.895 --> 00:38:00.260
to think forward as a central
part of our evolutionary niche

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:03.100
also brings with it a few problems.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.006
Imagination made humans exceptional

00:38:05.006 --> 00:38:08.240
but also potentially extremely dangerous.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.310
We have interconnected the world in a way

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:12.810
that nothing on this plant has ever done.

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:14.410
And, through that interconnection,

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:17.380
we are reshaping what the
world actually looks like.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.140
Here's a global human density map.

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:23.180
This is a better map that you look at

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:26.190
because this is the way we're
shaping the actual surface

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:27.620
and functioning of the earth.

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:30.720
We have imagined ourselves into a position

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.440
where it is in the balance.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.490
Our ecologies, our
capacities, our creativities,

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:39.510
are nearing or bringing up to the point

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.704
where decisions have to be made

00:38:41.704 --> 00:38:44.140
and have to be imagined.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.980
We know today, for example,

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.410
in the United States.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:49.120
We have systems of racism,

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:53.037
misogyny, and inequality unknown before.

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:56.790
So, we need to understand

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:58.610
how our imagination and creativity

00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:00.349
has gotten us to this state

00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:03.441
always remembering that, in fact,

00:39:03.441 --> 00:39:06.404
that imagination and creativity

00:39:06.404 --> 00:39:10.120
is the one thing that
can get us out of it.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.150
Being together with one another,

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:13.020
thinking together,

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:16.210
creating, imagining, seeing
the world as the way it is,

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:18.130
imagining other possibilities,

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:20.500
and at least trying to make them happen.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.450
That's what got humans
to where we are today.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:25.015
Thank you.

00:39:25.015 --> 00:39:28.620
(audience applauding)

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:29.930
- It's such an honor to be here

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:31.880
among all these brilliant speakers,

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.210
so thank you so much for having me.

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:36.470
Human beings occupy two worlds.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:37.303
The real world

00:39:37.303 --> 00:39:38.940
is what actually happened in the past

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.880
is happening right now,

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.652
and will actually happen in the future.

00:39:42.652 --> 00:39:44.710
And, while we certainly
thing about that world,

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:46.838
we also spend this enormous about of time

00:39:46.838 --> 00:39:49.152
considering all the many possible worlds,

00:39:49.152 --> 00:39:51.030
what philosophers and psychologists

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.625
typically refer to as counterfactuals.

00:39:53.625 --> 00:39:55.370
That is, all the ways that the world

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:57.000
could have been but wasn't,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.890
and all the ways that the
world could be but aren't.

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:03.480
And, not only counterfactual
thinking pervasive

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.660
in our everyday thought,

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:06.660
perhaps you're doing it right now,

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.174
but engaging with these
imagined possibilities

00:40:08.174 --> 00:40:09.630
deeply affects us.

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:10.730
It affects our decisions.

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:11.820
It affects our judgements.

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.920
And, it affects our emotional experiences.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.790
And, from an evolutionary perspective,

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:17.650
this initially seems a
bit surprising, right?

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:19.960
Well, it's obvious why engaging deeply

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.387
with our actual real experience

00:40:21.387 --> 00:40:23.231
would give us some sort of edge,

00:40:23.231 --> 00:40:25.260
it's less obvious what we get

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:27.384
from engaging so
profoundly and emotionally

00:40:27.384 --> 00:40:31.200
with these imagined worlds as well.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.700
And, this seems particularly paradoxical

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.707
when you consider the
huge proportion of time

00:40:36.707 --> 00:40:39.140
that very young children are engaging

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.880
with these imaginary worlds.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.764
In fact, as soon as babies can talk,

00:40:42.764 --> 00:40:44.867
they immediately begin
talking about the possible

00:40:44.867 --> 00:40:46.879
in addition to the real.

00:40:46.879 --> 00:40:49.962
They begin to spontaneously
produce symbolic play

00:40:49.962 --> 00:40:54.520
substituting things like
the mouse from a computer

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.360
for a telephone.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.193
Very early on,

00:40:56.193 --> 00:40:57.030
around 18 months.

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:59.260
There's even evidence that 15 month olds

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.813
are recognizing pretend sequences

00:41:00.813 --> 00:41:03.070
that are produced by adults
in their environments,

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:04.364
so that's pretty early.

00:41:04.364 --> 00:41:06.027
So, why, right?

00:41:06.027 --> 00:41:08.100
Why would very, very young children

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.740
who, by their very definition,

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.730
have so much that they have to learn

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:13.285
about the actual world

00:41:13.285 --> 00:41:16.230
spend so much of their time
and energy and resources,

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:18.170
not to mention the resources
of their caregivers,

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:19.774
who are responsible for them,

00:41:19.774 --> 00:41:21.760
engaging with unreality.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.210
Right? We have to answer this question.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:25.640
So, classically psychologists

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.530
including the father

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:28.500
of developmental psychology, Jean Piaget,

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.440
but also our friend, Sigmund Freud here,

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.629
who pops up all over the place,

00:41:31.629 --> 00:41:34.504
offered some pretty
uncharitable characterizations

00:41:34.504 --> 00:41:36.450
of pretend play in childhood.

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:38.690
They essentially
attributed it's prevalence

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.421
to children's inability to differentiate

00:41:40.421 --> 00:41:43.610
between the products of their
imaginations and reality.

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:45.881
Between fantasy and reality.

00:41:45.881 --> 00:41:48.700
Decades of research have show that,

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:49.533
to the contrary,

00:41:49.533 --> 00:41:51.750
children are actually quite
proficient and sophisticated

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.680
at distinguishing between real
objects, events, and people

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.780
and those that are products
of their imagination

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.930
and the imaginations
of others around them.

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:00.560
I'm gonna give you just
one example of a study,

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.860
this was conducted by Jacqui Wooley,

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:04.570
just to show you how this work
is typically done with kids.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.805
A child might enter a
room with three boxes.

00:42:06.805 --> 00:42:10.850
They'll watch as an experimenter
puts a pencil in box one.

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:12.226
Box two is left empty.

00:42:12.226 --> 00:42:13.370
In box three,

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:15.300
the child is told to imagine

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.269
that there's a pencil inside the box.

00:42:17.269 --> 00:42:19.920
Afterwards, the experimenter
may ask the child

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.620
a bunch of questions and engage with them.

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.007
One of those questions will be,

00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:24.590
"Is there a pencil in box three?"

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:25.843
And, children have no problem with this.

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:27.323
They say, "Yeah, sure."

00:42:27.323 --> 00:42:29.430
They have no issue with
transporting themselves

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:30.580
into this imaginative space

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:32.990
in which there's a pencil
inside of box three.

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.870
But, if some person comes
in from the other room

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:38.520
who wasn't engaged in this
fictional context initially

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.447
and says, "Hey, I need a pencil.

00:42:40.447 --> 00:42:41.427
"Can you give me one?"

00:42:41.427 --> 00:42:43.270
Children even as young as two

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:44.620
aren't going to make the mistake

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:45.870
of looking in box three, right?

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:48.000
They know there's no
actual pencil in there.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.362
Instead, they reach into box one

00:42:49.362 --> 00:42:51.410
and give the experimenter what it is

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:53.380
that they actually asked for, right?

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.260
So, even though children
spend hours and hours

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:56.700
of their lives pretending,

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.600
they know that they're pretending,

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.640
and this ability then to adopt

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.540
this counterfactual or false premise,

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.829
like there's a pencil inside of this cup,

00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:07.440
to make inferences about
events that might happen

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.516
in a world in which there
were a pencil in the cup,

00:43:09.516 --> 00:43:11.720
but also to separate, right,

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.589
that imagined space from the real world,

00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:17.570
is already present from as
early as two years of age.

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:19.530
This is very, very early on.

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:21.550
In fact, there's other prominent
feature of pretend play

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:23.055
that suggest that it's
the result of competence

00:43:23.055 --> 00:43:25.351
rather than cognitive limitations.

00:43:25.351 --> 00:43:27.940
So, it's largely unique to human beings.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.040
It's often social in nature,

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.140
like many of our more complex functions.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.340
It becomes increasingly
elaborate over time.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.440
You'd expect the opposite, right,

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.114
if it was the result of
a cognitive limitation.

00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:39.780
Young children do this
object substitution.

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:40.790
As they get a little bit older,

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:41.820
they don't even need objects

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.180
to scaffold their pretend play with.

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.480
They just imagine things,

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.000
completely imaginary events.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:46.833
A little bit later,

00:43:46.833 --> 00:43:49.150
they might develop an imaginary
friend or companion, right?

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:51.443
This is an entity that has
a consistent psychology

00:43:51.443 --> 00:43:53.550
that they interact with over time.

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:55.744
A rich and complex
psychology and social life.

00:43:55.744 --> 00:43:57.715
Even later in late childhood,

00:43:57.715 --> 00:43:58.937
in adolescence even,

00:43:58.937 --> 00:44:01.107
children engage with paracausims,

00:44:01.107 --> 00:44:03.540
little micro worlds that they construct

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.529
of their own design.

00:44:04.529 --> 00:44:06.520
And, of course, as we know,

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.880
this extends into adulthood as well.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.644
We all appreciate fictional artifacts,

00:44:10.644 --> 00:44:13.810
and this is continuous
throughout the lifespan.

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:16.460
Okay, so, given that very young children

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:17.650
engage with imaginary worlds,

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:18.931
which seems obvious,

00:44:18.931 --> 00:44:21.030
and that this engagement doesn't stem

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.863
from their confusion

00:44:21.863 --> 00:44:22.930
which is a bit less obvious,

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:24.253
but not so much anymore,

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.540
then why are they doing it?

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:27.600
Why are they doing it, right?

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.899
And how are they doing it?

00:44:29.899 --> 00:44:32.260
Well, we know that play is characteristic

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:34.411
of young animals across
a wide range of species,

00:44:34.411 --> 00:44:36.880
and that the behaviors
that are involved in play

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:38.722
are also those that are
typically most important

00:44:38.722 --> 00:44:41.240
for adults of that species.

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.073
And, in this way,

00:44:42.073 --> 00:44:45.030
play is a form of exploratory learning.

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.863
So, the immature animal

00:44:45.863 --> 00:44:49.560
can explore and practice
alternative forms of action

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.720
in a low-cost, low-risk environment

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.025
without any of the pressures

00:44:53.025 --> 00:44:55.980
of having to actually
achieve a particular goal

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:58.030
like staying alive, for example.

00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.863
And, in fact,

00:44:58.863 --> 00:45:00.517
one of the most distinctive features,

00:45:00.517 --> 00:45:02.820
biological features of human beings,

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.856
is our unusually long
period of immaturity.

00:45:05.856 --> 00:45:07.383
Compared with our closest
primate relatives,

00:45:07.383 --> 00:45:10.340
we've evolved to have
this dramatically extended

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.741
protected period of childhood.

00:45:11.741 --> 00:45:14.269
Early, middle, late adolescence.

00:45:14.269 --> 00:45:16.080
After we go to college, right?

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.760
We're still protected in the
spirit of immaturity. (laughs)

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.340
And, what we're encouraged
to do is explore

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:22.180
during this period of time.

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:24.930
We're engaging in this
exploratory learning.

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:26.290
So, while it's sort of easy to see

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:28.210
how physical forms of exploratory play,

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:30.028
like play fighting and
hunting and climbing,

00:45:30.028 --> 00:45:32.376
might translate into later adult skills,

00:45:32.376 --> 00:45:35.340
pretend play is sort of
by it's very definition

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.490
severed from reality.

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:38.759
So, in order to make this analogy

00:45:38.759 --> 00:45:40.724
with other forms of play work,

00:45:40.724 --> 00:45:42.460
we have to really identify the role

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.220
that this particular type of cognition,

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.130
this counterfactual type of cognition,

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:48.205
plays in cognition.

00:45:48.205 --> 00:45:50.350
So, to put this in the form of a question,

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:51.640
why might it be beneficial

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.152
to draw conclusions from false premises

00:45:53.152 --> 00:45:55.295
like there's a pencil in the cup?

00:45:55.295 --> 00:45:56.990
So, to answer this question

00:45:56.990 --> 00:46:00.800
we can consider how children's
minds are constructed

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.290
to support and also to
encourage their generation

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:06.410
of a wide array of
alternative possibilities.

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:07.683
And, it turns out that new ideas

00:46:07.683 --> 00:46:10.020
about children's earliest
learning mechanisms

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:11.770
suggest that the very same abilities

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:15.130
that allow children to learn
so much about the world

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:17.234
and to reason so powerfully about it

00:46:17.234 --> 00:46:20.970
also allows them to imagine
alternatives to that world,

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:22.290
and, more specifically,

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:23.840
it's the ability to represent

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.747
cause and effect relationships

00:46:25.747 --> 00:46:27.900
that seems to underpin some of the ability

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.260
to imagine possible worlds.

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:31.260
And, not only that,

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.054
but the ability to imagine possible worlds

00:46:33.054 --> 00:46:35.660
feeds back to facilitate our reasoning

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.290
about cause and effect relationships.

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:39.210
So, the rest of this talk

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:40.703
I'm going to, very quickly,

00:46:40.703 --> 00:46:43.920
try to unpack the sort
of theoretical grounds

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.123
for making this claim.

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.680
So, by about five years of age,

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.440
children have already developed
complex causal theories

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.479
in a variety of domains.

00:46:51.479 --> 00:46:53.160
Everything from understanding

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.007
biological principles to other minds,

00:46:55.007 --> 00:46:56.900
to the nature of physical forces

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:58.440
and properties in the world.

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.010
And, the question that
motivates my research,

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:00.843
but also just sort of

00:47:00.843 --> 00:47:02.490
the field of cognitive
development in general,

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:04.090
is how this ever happens.

00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:06.640
How is it that young
children are able to learn

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.450
these abstract, structured,

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:10.150
causal representations of the world

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:11.257
so quickly and accurately

00:47:11.257 --> 00:47:13.370
given the relatively limited information

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:16.260
that's available to
them from their senses?

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:18.660
What's the origin of this knowledge?

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:21.143
And, one classic answer from
developmental psychology

00:47:21.143 --> 00:47:23.230
points to the similarities

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:24.260
between children's learning

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:25.400
and learning in science.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.940
And, the idea here proposes

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.320
that children's early theories

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.045
share in a meaningful way

00:47:30.045 --> 00:47:33.746
structure, function, and dynamics

00:47:33.746 --> 00:47:36.720
to theory change in science.

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.320
And, in particular, that children,

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.500
just like little scientists,

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.120
are implicitly formulating hypotheses

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.230
about the world

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:45.320
and then testing and rationally revising

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.560
those hypotheses in light of new evidence

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.950
that they observe.

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:50.804
So, this sounds a bit far
fetched when you first hear it.

00:47:50.804 --> 00:47:53.260
To help you imagine this,

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.424
I'm going to show you
a video of this idea.

00:47:55.424 --> 00:47:57.542
What this child is doing in this video

00:47:57.542 --> 00:47:59.560
is playing with a "blink it detector"

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.070
which is a toy that we
typically use in my lab.

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:03.730
This is just a flexible causal system.

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:04.950
It's a box that lights up,

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:05.970
which is the effect,

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:06.803
for certain things,

00:48:06.803 --> 00:48:07.636
which is the cause,

00:48:07.636 --> 00:48:08.690
and it allows us to explore

00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:11.090
children's causal inferences really well.

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:11.930
So, I'm just going to let you watch.

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:13.370
And, I want you to keep an eye out

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:16.140
for this child engaging in
hypothesis testing behavior

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:17.443
similar to a scientist.

00:48:18.822 --> 00:48:21.272
- Putting this on the box.

00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:26.272
This on the box.

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:29.357
This makes that light up the box.

00:48:31.051 --> 00:48:32.301
How 'bout this?

00:48:36.062 --> 00:48:38.904
And, that makes the other side.

00:48:38.904 --> 00:48:40.050
- [Caren] Here's a new hypothesis.

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:40.883
- Uh oh.

00:48:46.279 --> 00:48:47.112
Nothing.

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:50.660
This one lighted up,

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:52.280
and this one's not.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.767
So, that means.

00:48:53.767 --> 00:48:55.017
- [Caren] Here's another.

00:48:57.391 --> 00:48:59.891
- What's making this light up?

00:49:02.838 --> 00:49:03.720
- [Caren] There's a familiar expression

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.337
to those of us who do science.

00:49:05.337 --> 00:49:08.337
(audience laughing)

00:49:11.251 --> 00:49:13.170
(audience laughing)

00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:14.393
- [Caren] Despair.

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:21.200
- Oh, wait.

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.093
Because this needs to be like this.

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:28.703
And, this needs to be like that.

00:49:30.441 --> 00:49:33.000
That's why. Hmm.

00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:38.420
Probably the boxes are the wrong way.

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:40.880
- [Caren] This was the child's idea.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.383
Pretty imaginative.

00:49:42.383 --> 00:49:45.383
(audience laughing)

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:49.580
And, like in science,

00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:51.711
it ends with embarrassment
in front of our peers.

00:49:51.711 --> 00:49:52.780
(audience laughing)

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:54.918
So, even though these ideas
about children's learning

00:49:54.918 --> 00:49:56.650
have been around for some time,

00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:58.055
recently there's been some major advances

00:49:58.055 --> 00:49:59.800
in our ability to formally describe

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.890
the cognitive processes
that might be taking place.

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:02.940
And, the way that this is done

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.760
is by integrating
developmental psychology,

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:05.633
so this kind of work,

00:50:05.633 --> 00:50:08.302
with computational theories.

00:50:08.302 --> 00:50:10.620
So, one of the central
ideas in this framework

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:12.480
is that children's
intuitive causal theories

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.650
can be expressed in a kind of causal map

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:15.780
or abstract picture

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:16.780
of how the world works.

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.360
A little bit like this, right?

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.880
So, for example, sunlight and water

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.370
cause plants to grow.

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:24.019
Forces and contacts cause
objects to move through space.

00:50:24.019 --> 00:50:25.960
Desires and beliefs cause someone

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.030
to act towards a particular goal.

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:30.540
And, in many ways these causal maps

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:32.720
are analogous to the more
familiar spacial maps

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.610
that depict the various
locations of objects

00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:36.014
in relation to one another.

00:50:36.014 --> 00:50:37.400
This is a cognitive feature

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:38.700
that we share with other animals,

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.771
including rodents like depicted here.

00:50:40.771 --> 00:50:43.490
So, having a spacial map is useful, right?

00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:44.440
And, this was mentioned earlier

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.470
because it allows for this non-egocentric

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:47.640
representation of knowledge.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.529
It doesn't matter where
I am in this space.

00:50:49.529 --> 00:50:51.064
I can still represent the space.

00:50:51.064 --> 00:50:52.740
This means that it's flexible, right?

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:54.740
I can plan my route in advance

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:55.770
and think about the different ways

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:57.490
that I might approach this problem.

00:50:57.490 --> 00:50:58.730
And, it becomes updated

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:02.230
as new information about
this space becomes available.

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:03.235
So, in a similar way,

00:51:03.235 --> 00:51:05.069
having a causal map provides

00:51:05.069 --> 00:51:08.790
a complex representation of
the causal relationships,

00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:10.950
or an abstract picture of how one thing

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:13.240
might be causally connected to another,

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:14.490
and, just like our spatial maps,

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:17.890
it's update as new information
becomes available to us.

00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:18.910
So, you can think of each

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:20.040
of these different causal models

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.881
as a particular hypothesis
that we might hold

00:51:21.881 --> 00:51:24.760
about the true causal
structure of the world.

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.593
So, for example,

00:51:25.593 --> 00:51:27.260
if I notice that the flowers in my window

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:28.514
begin to wilt,

00:51:28.514 --> 00:51:31.600
I might entertain several
possible causal models,

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.510
each of which generate their own patterns

00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:34.573
of predictions, right?

00:51:34.573 --> 00:51:37.290
So, it could be that too much sunlight

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:40.880
is causing both the dry
soil and the wilted flowers,

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:42.700
or it could be that the sunlight

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.620
is actually causing the dry soil,

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:47.770
and it's the dry soil that's
causing my flowers to wilt.

00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:49.900
And, if I'm holding a causal model

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:50.980
that happens to be correct,

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:52.059
then the predictions that it generates

00:51:52.059 --> 00:51:53.600
will be accurate with respect

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.290
to my observations in the world, right?

00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:56.640
But, if it's incorrect,

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.500
if I hold the wrong causal model,

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.150
my predictions are going to fail me,

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:02.340
and this will prompt me
to adjust my causal model

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.630
to better approximate
the true causal structure

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:05.510
of the world.

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:06.959
So, in effect, this process,

00:52:06.959 --> 00:52:08.511
the process of early learning,

00:52:08.511 --> 00:52:10.530
might be conceived as a process of

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:12.460
comparing possible worlds

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:14.230
and updating those possibilities

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:17.530
in light of new evidence
as you observe it.

00:52:17.530 --> 00:52:19.130
And, critically, these causal maps

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:20.950
also include a means for representing

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:23.610
possible future actions
for planning in the world.

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:26.250
So, if we return to the
two sort of versions

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:27.611
of the wilted flowers
that I described earlier,

00:52:27.611 --> 00:52:30.210
even though each of these representations

00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:31.710
have the same variables, right -

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:33.227
sunlight, soil, flowers -

00:52:33.227 --> 00:52:34.860
the differences in their structure

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.210
lead to really different effects

00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:38.670
following some action that
I might take on the world.

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:41.410
Let's say I intervene on my dry soil

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:42.727
by watering my plants.

00:52:42.727 --> 00:52:44.360
Hopefully, what you can see here

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:45.380
is that depending upon

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:46.860
which of the two causal structures

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:49.160
is an accurate
representation of the world,

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.564
watering my plants here in the first one

00:52:51.564 --> 00:52:53.870
is going to have no effect
on my flowers, right,

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:54.740
because it's the sunlight

00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:56.480
that's directly causing them to wilt.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.940
In the other case, though,

00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:01.900
watering the soil will
actually have some effect.

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.470
And, importantly, these interventions

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:04.303
could be real.

00:53:04.303 --> 00:53:05.154
I could actually do them.

00:53:05.154 --> 00:53:08.380
Or, they can be imagined,
hypothetical actions.

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:09.213
I can just sort of think

00:53:09.213 --> 00:53:10.046
what it would be like

00:53:10.046 --> 00:53:11.053
if I were to intervene on the world

00:53:11.053 --> 00:53:12.290
in a particular way.

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:13.950
And, it turns out that the evidence shows

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:15.190
that even preschool aged children

00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:16.023
are able to do this.

00:53:16.023 --> 00:53:17.840
They're able to reason about intervention,

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:18.820
both in the real world

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:21.360
and also in their imaginations.

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.694
So, this gives us an
extremely powerful tool

00:53:23.694 --> 00:53:26.340
for planning and considering the outcomes

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.280
of potential outcomes in advance.

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.613
We start with a premise
that might be false

00:53:29.613 --> 00:53:31.010
with respect to the world,

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:32.080
and then we just reason about

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:34.860
the implications of
that premise downstream.

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:35.693
This leads us to the ability

00:53:35.693 --> 00:53:37.350
to design new interventions

00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:39.300
and to literally change the future

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.022
for ourselves and our environment.

00:53:42.022 --> 00:53:43.991
So, now we have to push the
pause button for a minute

00:53:43.991 --> 00:53:46.345
because this all sounds really,
really complicated to us.

00:53:46.345 --> 00:53:48.060
All of these things are, of course,

00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:50.310
happening implicitly not explicitly,

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:51.700
but you might be wondering whether or not

00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.660
kids could actually do this.

00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:55.730
So, if we return to
pretend play for a minute,

00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:56.880
we see that children are

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:59.010
routinely considering premises

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:00.950
that contradict their own knowledge.

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:02.831
They ignore the fact that
the tea cup is empty,

00:54:02.831 --> 00:54:05.200
and they proceed to
wipe up the imagined tea

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.160
when the cup is overturned anyway.

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.180
Any time, really,

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:10.510
that children are acting out the outcome

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:11.590
of pretend events,

00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:13.150
they're necessarily setting aside

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:14.050
their interpretation,

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:14.883
their causal model,

00:54:14.883 --> 00:54:15.716
of the real world

00:54:15.716 --> 00:54:17.552
and reasoning about
the causal consequences

00:54:17.552 --> 00:54:19.720
of some pretend premise.

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.558
Some other possible world.

00:54:21.558 --> 00:54:22.630
And, in fact,

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:23.780
it's causation itself

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:25.390
that gives fantasy its logic.

00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:27.280
Despite the fact that children could,

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:28.113
in principle,

00:54:28.113 --> 00:54:29.100
pretend about anything at all.

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:30.390
It's pretend, after all.

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:31.610
If you've ever hung out with children,

00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:33.635
you know that they don't
actually usually do this.

00:54:33.635 --> 00:54:35.579
Instead, some research
by Paul Harris has shown

00:54:35.579 --> 00:54:38.220
that if a child pretends
to spill the sugar

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:39.053
during their tea party,

00:54:39.053 --> 00:54:40.761
they're gonna opt to
sweep it up with a broom.

00:54:40.761 --> 00:54:42.113
If they spill the milk,

00:54:42.113 --> 00:54:44.300
then they'll grab the mop, right,

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:45.480
or a sponge.

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:46.732
And, it's precisely this unique blend

00:54:46.732 --> 00:54:48.640
of knowledge and imagination

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:49.780
that really characterizes

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:52.050
early pretend play in childhood.

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:53.090
And, in fact,

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:54.770
the cognitive processes that are involved

00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:55.860
in pretend play

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.180
aren't only useful for planning.

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:59.219
They're also critical for learning.

00:54:59.219 --> 00:55:00.830
So, for example,

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:02.331
children who create imaginary companions

00:55:02.331 --> 00:55:04.947
tend to show increased theory of mind.

00:55:04.947 --> 00:55:07.200
So, this is just an
increased understanding

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.970
of the cause and effect relationships

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:12.420
that dictate the psychological
and social world.

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:14.950
So, I propose then that pretend play

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:16.600
is really just a precocious display

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:19.200
of children's developing
abilities in causal reasoning.

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.779
It arises out of those
abilities quite actually.

00:55:21.779 --> 00:55:24.740
And, that engagement in imaginary worlds

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:25.573
actually feeds back

00:55:25.573 --> 00:55:28.270
to serve as an engine of learning as well,

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:30.611
promoting these abilities that we need.

00:55:30.611 --> 00:55:33.873
So, to sort of summarize the
logic in a single slide here.

00:55:33.873 --> 00:55:36.529
The long period of protected immaturity

00:55:36.529 --> 00:55:38.740
winds up leading to increased time

00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:41.034
for exploratory learning through play.

00:55:41.034 --> 00:55:43.302
Exploratory play allows for

00:55:43.302 --> 00:55:45.740
more flexible kinds of learning mechanisms

00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:47.580
that support the
development of causal models

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:50.610
that slowly adjust to the
environment over time.

00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:52.650
These models support
counterfactual reasoning.

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:53.950
It's sort of inherent to the model

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:55.780
to think about ways
that you might change it

00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:58.000
in order to think of
thing could be different.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.877
And, this is initially
expressed in young children

00:55:59.877 --> 00:56:01.530
in the context of pretend play

00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:04.280
really as early as they start to talk.

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.163
And, finally that reasoning
about these possibilities

00:56:06.163 --> 00:56:09.068
feeds back to support the very mechanisms

00:56:09.068 --> 00:56:12.853
that underlie causal learning in humans.

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.430
So, I'm gonna end with a quote

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:17.570
from my colleague, Alison Gopnik,

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:18.620
with whom I'm coauthored

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:20.004
all of my work in this area.

00:56:20.004 --> 00:56:23.463
And, I'd like to thank
you for your attention.

00:56:23.463 --> 00:56:26.630
(audience applauding)

00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:32.830
(upbeat electronic music)
