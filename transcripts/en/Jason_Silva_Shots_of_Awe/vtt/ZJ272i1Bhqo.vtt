00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.780
So I've been thinking a lot
about this idea of biology

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.510
as something with almost
a kind of agency, right?

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.870
A kind of directionality.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.550
Not to get metaphysical
here, but you could actually

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.030
think of the 10 trillion
cells that self organize

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.190
and collaborate to become
the meta organism that

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.185
is a human being means
that biology seems

00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:42.170
to exhibit a kind of
protoplasmic yearning, a desire

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.830
to self organize.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.655
There seems to be
conditions in this universe

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:52.160
that engender novelty,
complexity sprouts, mind

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.260
emerges from matter and then
starts to manipulate matter

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.210
at the level of the atom
with nanotechnology.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.300
It's like human beings
seem to be the cutting

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.019
edge, the evolutionary
pinnacle of self awareness

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.380
becoming aware of
its becoming, right?

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.800
It's almost like the birth of
mind folds the attention back

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.560
and looks at its own
heritage and starts

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.170
to put itself into context.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.570
The universe comes to know
itself through human beings.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.110
We've decommissioned
natural selection,

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.440
Edward O. Wilson
says, and now we

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.700
must look deep within
ourselves and decide

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.410
what we wish to become.
