RETO MEIER: What's more
fun than Pair Programming?

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.960
Asynchronous Remote Massive
Scale Pair Programming.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.410
In 2011, I presented
an I/O session,

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.930
Pro Tips for Building
Context Aware Apps.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.470
Those tips went
into a sample app

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.520
that targets Android Honeycomb
and supports Cupcake.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.130
That's Android 1.6, if
you're keeping track.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.380
That covered 98% of
active devices in 2011.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.250
Today, it's less than 3.2%.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.786
Clearly, it's time
to do an update.

00:00:26.786 --> 00:00:28.160
I asked if you'd
like to watch me

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.500
go through the process of
updating the app and you said,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.010
yes.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.219
So, despite some skepticism--

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.635
FEMALE SPEAKER: You know they're
just trolling you, right?

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:36.636
Nobody wants to watch you
write code on YouTube.

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:37.676
RETO MEIER: I don't know.

00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:39.930
There's like the Facebook
movie, "Silicon Valley,"

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.490
"CSI: Cyber," "Scorpion."

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.620
These are all really,
really popular.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.040
And this is a lot like them.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.520
FEMALE SPEAKER: This
is nothing like them.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.130
MALE SPEAKER: Woah, wait, you
haven't been telling people

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.550
that this is like them, right?

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.010
Because this is
nothing like them.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.220
This would be boring.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.860
RETO MEIER: Strong skepticism.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.080
I'm giving it a shot.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.000
The result is pivotal.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.230
It's a lot like cereal--

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.980
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's
not like that either.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.500
RETO MEIER: Each episode
is part of a larger story.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.320
Having an app
targeting an API that's

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.310
fallen off the sliding
scale of relevancy

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.920
is a great opportunity
to replace tricks, hacks,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.410
and deprecated APIs with a
robust modern architecture.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.634
That means integrating the
Android Support Library,

00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:20.300
the Fused Location Provider, the
Job Scheduler, material design,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.170
Enhanced Notifications, Android
Wear, and all the features

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.410
of Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly
Bean, KitKat, Lollipop,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.050
and Marshmallow.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.980
And everything else I don't yet
realize needs to be updated.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.710
You won't see much of
me, but imagine me here,

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.770
dressed neatly at a tidy
desk, with a warm cup of tea.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.640
Definitely do not
picture me with my feet

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.050
up on a messy desk,
and absolutely not me

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.980
at home in my pajamas.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.192
Picture me here,
in my happy place.

00:01:46.628 --> 00:01:48.253
MALE SPEAKER: Reto,
we're going to need

00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:49.294
you to clear out of here.

00:01:49.294 --> 00:01:50.730
We've got another shoot.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.295
Couldn't you do
this at your desk?

00:01:53.295 --> 00:01:54.420
RETO MEIER: I'm Reto Meier.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.710
Join me on the Android
Developers YouTube channel,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.800
as I bring all that back to
the future, here in my office.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.170
Welcome to Pivotal.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.220
