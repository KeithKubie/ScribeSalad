00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.330
Lesson number five.

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.470
I feel like oil futures are going to crash today.

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.080
What are the the gift back road now you try

4
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.050
<v 2>next up producer Tim Howard. Yes. Hi. Hello.</v>

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.530
So when I heard about this story with Emily and the brain port,

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.560
I immediately called up this guy. Hey John. Which microphone is it?

7
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:24.840
This one or this one or that one there? Okay. You might remember him.

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.770
I'm David Eagleman.

9
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:29.700
I'm a neuroscientist at Baylor College of medicine called him up because I came

10
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:34.701
across this thing that he's working on that is sort of like the next generation

11
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.090
of crazy. It's called uh, the vest,

12
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.560
which stands for the variable extra sensory sensory transducer.

13
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.520
And it's,

14
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.600
it's a vest that you wear underneath the clothing and this fest has 24 motors on

15
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:51.420
it. Little vibratory motors,

16
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:55.980
just like the ones in your cell phone and the vest connects to your phone.

17
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:57.240
So we pick ups.

18
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.500
<v 1>Hi,</v>

19
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.490
this is Time Warner cable calling with an opportunity for you to provide us with

20
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:03.324
valuable feedback

21
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.800
<v 2>well through a cell phone and the cell phone does all the computational work to</v>

22
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:12.000
then convert that sound into patterns of vibration

23
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.530
on the vest and you feel a buzzing all over your torso.

24
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.200
This is different motors running at different amplitudes.

25
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.570
It actually changes every 20 milliseconds.

26
00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:29.571
So it's a moving pattern and it might seem impossible that you could actually

27
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:32.970
extract something useful about what's being said.

28
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.320
But when David brings deaf volunteers into the lab and has them do a particular

29
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:41.520
training on the vest, he says that over the course of 12 days,

30
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.030
people get really good at word recognition.

31
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.150
Somehow they begin to intuitively recognize that this means high or blue or

32
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:51.750
chair.

33
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.750
If you tried to concentrate on it and figure out how each motor translates to

34
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:59.730
some part of that sound, you would never figure it out.

35
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.510
But the good news is you don't have to do it consciously.

36
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.840
The brain is a specialist at extracting statistical information and because of

37
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:12.840
the Marine is so good at this kind of translation says David,

38
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:17.841
what he really wants to do is use this best to create new senses.

39
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.020
So what if you fed in stock market data

40
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.610
<v 3>hockey 10 70 dash five nine 25 so 25 bucks,</v>

41
00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:28.940
75 bid at 78 converted that into

42
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.113
<v 2>the buzzing.</v>

43
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.270
Could you develop an immediate perceptual experience of the economic movements

44
00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:39.700
of the planet and would you,

45
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.020
without having any conscious awareness of how or why you're feeling a certain

46
00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:46.390
way, could you have an intuition like, you know,

47
00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:49.120
I kinda feel like oil futures are going to crash today.

48
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.830
You wouldn't be analyzing all this information. You would just feel it.

49
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.690
We're also working on feeding in.

50
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.350
You are seeing a tremendous amount of rainfall and real time weather data

51
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.650
from the, let's say 200 miles around you question is,

52
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.160
would you end up having an intuition, Peekskill eyesore? Oh,

53
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.360
that's better than what the weather man can tell you on the news or this one.

54
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.220
What if we took 500,000 tweets per second,

55
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.580
passed it through some natural language processing to sort of have a,

56
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.320
a higher level summary of what's going on and pump all that information through

57
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:29.830
the vest.

58
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.940
Would you develop a sense of what's happening on the planet where you suddenly

59
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:38.260
say, Ooh, I feel like something just happened in Nairobi and, Oh,

60
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:41.680
I think the Canadians have just, you know, finalize their election,

61
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.770
have something in it. I don't know what this will be like yet,

62
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.720
but there's no reason to expect any limit on,

63
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.090
on what the brain will be able to develop an immediate perceptual experience.

64
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.863
<v 3>Huh.</v>

65
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.320
<v 2>More experiments and translation in a moment.</v>
