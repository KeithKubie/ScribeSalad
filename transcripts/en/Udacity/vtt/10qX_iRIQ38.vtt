00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.660
So the first thing we need to
do is actually access T-Square.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.550
You can always access T-Square
through BuzzPort, but

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.610
to save a step we're going to go
straight to T-Square right now.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.400
So to access T-Square we're
going to go to t-square.gatech.edu.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.670
Now once you're here,
you'll need to login in the top right.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.270
&gt;&gt; So let me go ahead and do that.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.570
Login with your Georgia Tech ID.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.190
Once you're in across the top you'll
see a list of your active courses.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.920
We'll talk about how to
modify this list in a bit.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.590
If there are too many you can find
the rest here under my active sites.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.510
&gt;&gt; So let's start off by talking
about some of the settings

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.395
available in T-square.
