opportunity today to see some amazing
research some amazing technology and

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970
research some amazing technology and
 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.420
research some amazing technology and
some amazing minds that are wrapping

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430
some amazing minds that are wrapping

brief remarks I have today is to say

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830
brief remarks I have today is to say
 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.420
brief remarks I have today is to say
that when we think about the way

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430
that when we think about the way
 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.100
that when we think about the way
transportation has evolved in human

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110
transportation has evolved in human
 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.290

history think about the transition from
 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.210
history think about the transition from
mankind simply walking to using

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220

the human being which is where we've

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349
the human being which is where we've
 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.820
the human being which is where we've
spent most of our time in transportation

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830
spent most of our time in transportation
 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.640
spent most of our time in transportation
since those days when a man and woman

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650
since those days when a man and woman
 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.730
since those days when a man and woman
were just walking and now we're entering

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740
were just walking and now we're entering
 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.050
were just walking and now we're entering
into a phase where the technology is

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060
into a phase where the technology is
 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.320
into a phase where the technology is
becoming much smarter much more capable

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330
becoming much smarter much more capable
 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.350

sure we safely integrate those vehicles
 

00:08:37.069 --> 00:08:39.179
sure we safely integrate those vehicles
into the air space but that is another

into the air space but that is another
 

00:08:39.189 --> 00:08:44.350
into the air space but that is another
part of the future and then we also have

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:44.360
part of the future and then we also have
 

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.280
part of the future and then we also have
to think about the ways in which our

to think about the ways in which our
 

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.400

that could make decisions across the
whole system but just think about the

00:09:01.569 --> 00:09:01.579
whole system but just think about the
 

00:09:01.579 --> 00:09:03.610
whole system but just think about the
fact that our highways are basically
