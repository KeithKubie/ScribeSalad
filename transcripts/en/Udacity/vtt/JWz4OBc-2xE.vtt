I'd like to take a second to talk about a pretty important concept in Math in

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.328
general, especially when we're talking about graphing. And that is symmetry. We

00:00:08.328 --> 00:00:12.232
talked about this to a certain extent when we were dealing with quadratic

00:00:12.232 --> 00:00:16.482
functions, like y equals x squared. We said that if you have a parabola like

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:21.097
this one, we know that we can draw a line that goes straight through its vertex,

00:00:21.097 --> 00:00:25.570
such that, if you folded the problem in half along this line then it would map

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.530
directly onto itself. In other words, at any point along this middle line, this

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.192
axis of symmetry, the points on the parabola directly to the left or right of

00:00:35.192 --> 00:00:39.844
it, are equally distant from the axis. So if I'm at this position for example,

00:00:39.844 --> 00:00:44.329
this y value, then the distance in the extraction from here to here, is the same

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.600
in terms of absolute value, as the distance from here to here. Now it seems

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.352
looking at these other even functions, like a similar kind of symmetry applies

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:58.280
to them. One question is, do odd functions have symmetry as well? And, in both

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.324
cases, how do we mathematically express that symmetry. Now, I'm about to give

00:01:02.324 --> 00:01:06.540
you a kind of complex quiz that's going to require a fair amount of critical

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.718
thinking and some new materials. So, this is going to definitely be a major

00:01:10.718 --> 00:01:15.193
challenge problem. So, if we know that a point, that we are going to call x

00:01:15.193 --> 00:01:20.013
comma y, is on a given graph. What if we find that the point negative x comma y

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:24.282
is also on that graph? What does that say about this graph? Does that mean that

00:01:24.282 --> 00:01:28.430
is represent an even function, or an odd function, or neither of these? Think

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.514
about which of the graphs either on this plane or this plane, this property

00:01:33.514 --> 00:01:37.380
applies to. And you can even test it out with real points.
