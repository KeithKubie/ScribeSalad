00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.200
- [Instructor] So, let's start looking

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.860
at a short sequence of DNA,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.600
and the letters I'm going to use,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.570
these are the shorthands for
the various nucleotide bases

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.870
that make up a sequence of DNA.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.260
So, let's say that I have some thymine,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.100
thymine, cytosine,
guanine, cytosine, thymine,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.160
adenine, thymine, thymine,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.270
and let's throw another thymine in there.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.150
So, that would be our sequence of DNA,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.220
and what would be the
corresponding sequence

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.190
of RNA that it would be transcribed into?

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.410
If you remember this from previous videos,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.830
pause this video and
try to figure that out.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.680
Well, the key thing to appreciate is,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.050
if we're talking base pairs in DNA,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.960
adenine pairs with thymine,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.190
cytosine pairs with guanine,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.730
but if we're talking
about pairing into RNA,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.610
well then, instead of thymine in the RNA,

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.710
you would have uracil.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.590
So, the RNA here is,

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.780
well, the thymine in
the DNA would correspond

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.580
to an adenine in the RNA,

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.570
adenine, guanine,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.500
cytosine, guanine, adenine,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.150
and now, since this is an RNA strand,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.270
instead of having a
thymine right over here,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.910
this would be a uracil,
adenine, adenine, adenine.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.380
So, this process that we just did,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.126
this is transcription.

00:01:18.126 --> 00:01:21.250
Transcription,

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.600
transcription

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.460
from DNA,

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.670
DNA to

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.930
RNA.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.390
Now, the next step, if we're talking about

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.740
the whole process of, how
does this information actually

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.560
have an effect on the
body, is we're gonna go

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.360
from the RNA and translate that into

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.210
a protein.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.780
And the way we do that, we've
seen this in previous videos,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.520
is every three of these
bases, that's a codon,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.850
and it codes for a particular amino acid.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.660
Now, to figure out what
amino acid it codes for,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.850
we look at an amino
acid translation table,

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.100
and there's different
types that you might see.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.890
This is the most typical type,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.840
so the first base is A, second base is A,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.270
third base is G.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.300
First base, A, second base, A,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.470
we're in this cell, third base is G,

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.440
and so that will code for
the amino acid, lysine,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.450
so we could write l-y-s,
short for lysine here.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.680
And we could've also gotten that

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.520
from a different type
of translation table.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.390
For example,

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.220
you might see a circular
one that looks like that,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.430
but we would've gotten the same result.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.840
AAG, start at the center, AAG

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.630
codes for lysine.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.670
Then, the next codon,
and if you're getting

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.100
as excited about this as I am,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.230
I encourage you to pause this video

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.350
and try to keep translating this.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.660
The next codon is CGA.

00:02:42.548 --> 00:02:43.381
CGA,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.313
arginine.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.960
Arginine, and then the next one is UAA.

00:02:51.113 --> 00:02:52.650
UAA.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.920
Well here, they have this
little black, circular dot,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.230
what does that mean?

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.350
Well, that means stop codon,

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.000
and sometimes they'll just
write the word stop there.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.460
So, this is stop.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.970
There is not an amino acid called stop,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.650
this actually signals
to, and this is happening

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.540
at a ribosome, this is signaling for

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.240
the translation process to stop,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.480
this is the end of our amino acid chain,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.940
of our polypeptide chain.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.450
And so, we will stop right over there.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.670
But now, let's do some interesting things.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.230
Let's think about situations where

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.280
there are mutations,
where some of these bases,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.740
maybe something gets inserted,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.310
maybe something gets deleted,

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.110
maybe something gets swapped out.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.800
And so, let's start with what's known

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.050
as a point mutation, so let's say this C

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.370
gets swapped out for an A.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.900
Well, if that happened,
then on the RNA strand,

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.770
all of a sudden this would be a uracil,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.480
and if that is a uracil, this
AAG would still be there,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.060
coding for lysine, but this
second codon is now different.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.780
What would it now code for?

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.655
Well, CUA.

00:03:57.655 --> 00:04:02.655
CUA, it'll now code for
leucine instead of arginine.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.854
Leucine,

00:04:04.854 --> 00:04:06.170
l-e-u.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.920
This is fairly typical for
a substitution mutation.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.210
It might change a particular amino acid,

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.030
but sometimes, it could
be more significant.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.260
For example,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.230
if this G was swapped out for an A,

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.810
then this C on the RNA

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.000
would then be a U,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.710
and then what would happen?

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.340
Well, this first codon
would still code for lysine,

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.940
but the second one would be UGA.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.863
UGA.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.170
Now, all of a sudden, it
codes for a stop codon,

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.240
and so, the actual translation
process would stop,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.530
which could be a very, very big deal

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.770
if this DNA sequence,

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.600
if the normal, non-mutated polypeptide

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.690
had to keep going on, and on, and on.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.310
Over here, it just happened
to have a stop codon next,

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.950
but you could imagine, if
they had just, you know,

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.950
another thousand codons before the end,

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.140
but all of a sudden, you had a
point mutation to stop early,

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.760
that would significantly
affect the protein

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.300
that it's coding for.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.560
Now, another type of
mutation that typically

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.050
has a fairly significant affect

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.810
is a frameshift mutation,
and that's where something

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.360
gets inserted or deleted
and shifts everything.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.100
So, for example, instead of the A

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.000
being swapped in for the G,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.930
what if the A got inserted here?

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.460
So then, our sequence
would look like this.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.200
T-T-C,

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.740
and then we have A, and
then you have G-C-T,

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.740
G-C-T-A-T-T-T.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.150
So, what just happened here,

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.660
this was our original sequence,
but the A got inserted here,

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.730
it didn't replace the G, and so everything

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.500
got shifted to the right.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.490
Now, what are we coding for?

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.530
Well, when we transcribe
to RNA, this will be

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.530
A-A-G-U-C-G-A-U-A-A-A,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.860
and now this first codon
still codes for lysine,

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.490
we've seen that multiple times.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.190
But, what about this second codon?

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.424
This second codon over here, UCG.

00:06:12.424 --> 00:06:13.560
UCG,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.560
that's serine,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.100
we got a different amino acid.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.070
And what's interesting is, it's not just

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.080
that one amino acid is changing,

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.200
we're gonna see that keeps happening.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.850
So now, we have AUA.

00:06:27.756 --> 00:06:28.589
AUA.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.330
Here, we have isoleucine.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.310
So, isoleucine,

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.700
right over here, which is different

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.540
than what we had before, we
don't have a stop codon anymore,

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.310
and we would keep going on and on.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.240
And so, you could imagine
a frameshift mutation

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.010
where you either insert something

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.470
or you take it out so that
the whole frame gets shifted,

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.850
can have a dramatic impact on what

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.590
it will transcribe and then translate for.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.040
Now, lucky for us, even though mutations

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.550
are always going on, there are
many proofreading mechanisms

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.660
in biological systems to
make them less frequent

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.110
than they otherwise would be,

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.560
and people are still understanding

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.410
how these proofreading
mechanisms fully happen.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.140
Another thing to appreciate is,

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.860
we often associate a mutation

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.820
as

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.280
being equal to a bad thing,

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.020
and often times, it is a bad thing.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.890
What used to be a functional protein

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.010
may no longer be a functional protein

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.740
because the amino acids,
the coding got stopped short

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.180
or there was a frameshift mutation

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.910
that's just coding for
completely different things.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.030
So, sometimes it could be very bad,

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.140
and some diseases actually are caused

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.340
by strange mutations
like that, that show up.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.660
Often times, the mutation
might not be a big deal.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.450
Maybe something gets swapped out,

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.280
maybe only one amino acid changes

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.760
and it doesn't really change

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.880
the ability of the protein to do its job,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.430
in which case it doesn't matter,

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.130
but every now and then,
a mutation can actually

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:58.963
be a good thing.

00:07:58.963 --> 00:08:01.010
In fact, we need the mutation in order

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.210
to have variation in a population,

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.560
and variation is what natural selection

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.810
and evolution run off of.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.070
If you don't have variation,

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.880
then you're not going
to have different things

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.450
that get selected in
different environments

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.780
and you're not going to have
that gradual change over time.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.350
So, a big picture, hopefully
you got a better appreciation

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.490
for how transcription,
and then translation,

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:22.910
let me write that down.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.800
And then, so that's
transcription from DNA to RNA,

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.820
and then this is translation.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.730
Translation

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.630
from RNA

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.340
to protein,

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.410
to protein.

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.570
We have appreciation of how that happens,

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.320
we got appreciation of how to
use these translation tables,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.300
but also how either a point mutation

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:49.030
or a frameshift mutation
can eventually affect

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.210
the protein that gets coded for.
