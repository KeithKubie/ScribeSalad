00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.880
We left off the last video
at the end of 1789.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.580
The Bastille had been stormed in
July as Parisians wanted to

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.340
get the weapons from the
Bastille and free a few

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.150
political prisoners to, in
their minds, protect

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.420
themselves from any tyranny
from Louis XVI.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.690
Louis XVI had reluctantly kind
of gone behind the scenes and

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.100
said, OK, National Assembly, I'm
not going to get in your

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.720
way anymore.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.780
Because he's seen the writing
on the walls that every time

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.580
he's done something, it's only
led to even more extreme

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.330
counteraction.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.790
So at the end of 1789, already
chaos has broken loose in a

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.480
lot of France.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.340
The National Assembly, they're
in process of creating a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.230
constitution, which won't
fully happen until 1791.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.240
But they're starting to bring
things together in order to

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.560
draft that constitution.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.380
But in August of 1789, they've
already done their version of

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.670
the Declaration of
Independence.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.400
The Declaration of the Rights
of Man and the Citizen.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.290
So if everything was well, we
would just wait until a few

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.055
years, we'd get a constitution,
and maybe we

00:01:08.055 --> 00:01:11.640
would have some type of a
constitutional monarchy.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.580
But unfortunate, especially
for Louis XVI,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.560
things weren't all well.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.640
As we mentioned, all of this
was propagated, all of this

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.520
was started to begin with
because people were hungry.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.080
We have this fiscal crisis,
we have a famine.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.686
And so in October of 1789--
we're still in 1789-- October

00:01:32.686 --> 00:01:39.890
of 1789-- rumors started to
spread that Marie-Antoinette,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.840
the king's wife, that she was
hoarding grain at Versailles.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.420
So people started imagining
these big stacks of grain at

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.050
Versailles, and this is in a
time where people couldn't get

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.550
their bread.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.060
And bread was the main
staple of the diet.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.330
So there was actually a march
of peasant women onto

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.690
Versailles.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.520
And they were armed.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.040
This is a depiction of the
peasant women marching on

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.830
Versailles.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.240
And they went to Versailles, and
they actually were able to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.920
get into the building itself.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.560
And they demanded-- because they
were suspicious of what

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.870
Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette
were up to at Versailles--

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.860
they demanded that they
move to Paris.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.110
So the women's march.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.110
And they were able to
get their demands.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.540
It resulted in Louis XVI and
wife, Marie-Antoinette, moving

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.080
back to Paris, where
they couldn't do

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.000
things like hoard grain.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.380
And they'll be surrounded
by all of the maybe

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.800
not-so-friendly people
who could watch

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.050
what they're doing.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.740
I think the main factor was that
people are hungry, rumors

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.000
are spreading that the king
is hoarding grain.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.780
But there were also rumors that
the king was being very

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.220
disrespectful to some of the
symbols of the new France, of

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.330
the new National Assembly.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.390
So that also made
people angry.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.480
And across the board everyone
kind of knew, and including

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.760
Louis XVI, that he wasn't really
into what was going on.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.970
He wasn't into this kind of
constitutional monarchy that

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.740
was forming, this power
that was being lost to

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.630
the National Assembly.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.080
So we have this very
uncomfortable situation

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.420
entering into 1790, where the
king and queen are essentially

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.680
in house arrest in a building
called the Tuileries in Paris.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.610
You have this National Assembly
drafting this

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.320
constitution.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.370
They're charted to draft the
constitution up there.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.030
They all pledged at the
Tennis Court Oath.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.070
And at the same time, throughout
France, you have

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.480
some counter insurgencies.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.840
This is France right here.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.030
Throughout France you have
counter insurgencies, people

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.230
who don't like the Revolution
that's going on.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.360
And then those would
be subdued.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.270
And people are all plotting
one against each other.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.630
And then you have some
nobility, that says,

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.330
gee, you know what?

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.000
I don't like the way
that this is going.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.120
We've seen already a
lot of violence.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.260
People are angry.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.910
I'm just going to take my money
and whatever I can pack,

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.060
and I'm just going to get
out of the country.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.450
I'm going to emigrate away
from the country.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.170
So you start having nobility
starting to leave France.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.940
They're called the Emigres.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.760
I know I'm not pronouncing
it correctly.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.120
But you see, you have this
notion of gee, I had it good

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.620
in France, I'm not going to have
it good much longer, I'd

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.770
better leave. And this same
idea, now that we get to 1791.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.100
So 1790 was just kind of
a bunch of unease.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.300
Now that we're at 1791, the
same idea of trying to get

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.060
away from the danger got into
the heads of Louis XVI and

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.890
Marie-Antoinette.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.950
But they couldn't leave
the country.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.420
They didn't trust
Great Britain.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.160
They didn't trust any of these
other countries to safely give

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.340
them shelter.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.070
So one of their generals, who
was sympathetic to their

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.690
cause, said, hey, at least
come here to the frontier

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.770
areas and you could hide
from all of the unrest

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.820
that's going on.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.110
So dressed as actual servants--
and it shows you

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.690
what type of people they were--

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.940
they dressed as servants.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.840
And they actually made their
servants dress as nobility to

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.010
make them the targets in case
they were ambushed anyway on

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.475
their way trying to
escape from Paris.

00:05:29.475 --> 00:05:33.930
Dressed as servants, the king
and queen-- the king tried to

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.360
escape to this general's
estate.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.810
But when they were in Varennes,
right here, they

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.700
were actually spotted.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.680
And then the people essentially
took them captive

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.970
and brought them
back to Paris.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.940
So this is called, or you could
imagine this is the

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.520
flight to Varennes, or the
flight away from Paris, or

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.620
however you want to do it.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.520
So already, Louis XVI
started to see the

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.110
writing on the wall.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.220
They tried to get away.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.470
But people brought them back.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.560
Now you can imagine, a lot
of people already did

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.380
not like the king.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.340
They didn't like the notion
of even having a king.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.070
And the most revolutionary,
the most radical elements,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.320
were called the Jacobins.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.440
And after the king and queen
tried to escape and came back,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.250
they were like hey, gee,
what's the use of

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.230
even having a king?

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.020
You National Assembly, why are
you even trying to write some

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.860
type of constitution that
gives any power

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.520
whatsoever to a king?

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.770
We should have a republic.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.790
Which is essentially-- there's
a lot of kind of nuanced

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.660
definitions of what a republic
is, but the most simple one is

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.180
it's a state without
a king, without an

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.810
emperor, without a queen.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.670
So they're saying, we don't
need, you know-- you National

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.030
Assembly, you think you're
being radical.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.410
But you're not being
radical enough.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.160
We want to eliminate the idea
of having a monarchy

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.160
altogether.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.170
And the fact that Louis XVI
actually tried to run away, we

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.190
view that as him abdicating
the throne.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.680
Abdication, or essentially
quitting.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.790
And they actually started
to organize in Paris.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:16.380
This right here is the
Champ-de-Mars.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.190
I know I'm saying it
completely wrong.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.610
This is a current
picture of it.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.850
And so they started taking
signatures in this kind of

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.820
public park in Paris to
essentially say, we

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.620
don't need a king.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.900
We want to essentially create
our own republic.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.210
That this National Assembly,
they're not radical enough.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.630
And so people started gathering
over here in the

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.070
Champ-de-Mars and things
got a little ugly.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:51.700
So the actual troops were
sent in to kind of

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.840
calm everyone down.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.500
And these were actually
troops controlled by

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.280
the National Assembly.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.190
The people who are
mainly controlled

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.450
by the Third Estate.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.190
But things got a little crazy.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.870
Rocks were thrown at
some of the troops.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.800
Some of the troops, at
first, they started

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.430
firing in the air.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.230
But eventually when things
got really crazy, they

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.290
fired into the crowd.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.720
And about 50 people died.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.870
And this was the massacre.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.930
Or the Champ-de-Mars Massacre.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.690
I know I'm saying it wrong.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.150
This isn't a video on French
pronunciation.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.180
But you could imagine, now
people are even angrier.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.460
People are still starving.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.910
That problem has
not gone away.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:32.140
The king and queen has been
kind of very reluctantly--

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.159
everyone is suspicious of the
fact that they're probably

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.650
going to try to come
back to power.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.179
They tried to run away.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:40.549
When the Jacobins, or
in general kind of

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:43.150
revolutionaries, but they're led
by the Jacobins, when they

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.340
start to suggest that, hey,
we should have a republic.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.780
We shouldn't even have a king.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.290
And they gather people here,
all of a sudden, the troops

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.510
that are controlled by the
current National Assembly

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.650
actually fire on the crowd, and
actually kill civilians

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.510
for throwing rocks.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.990
And they might have
been big rocks.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.400
But you can imagine, this is
going to anger already hungry

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.220
and already suppressed
people even more.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.940
And to make people even more
paranoid that the king and

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.820
queen might eventually come
back to power, you had two

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.110
major powers all of a sudden
trying to insert certain

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.530
themselves into the
French Revolution.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.000
I'm going to do a little
bit of an aside here.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.810
Because this is something, at
least you when I first learned

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.370
European history, I found
the most confusing.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.120
You have these states,
you can call them.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.820
You have Austria, which I've
highlighted in orange.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.700
The kind of map here
is a modern map.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:39.370
But in orange, I've kind of
shown what Austria was at that

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.080
point in time.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.630
Around 1789, 1790, 1791.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.990
In this red color,
I have Prussia.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.860
I want to show you that these
are very different than our

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.470
current notions of
one, Austria.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.090
Austria today is this modern
country right here.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:56.240
And Prussia doesn't even exist
as a modern country.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.120
And then you had this notion
of the Holy Roman Empire,

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.020
which overlaps with these other
kingdoms, or empires, or

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.110
whatever you want
to call them.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.730
And I want to do a little
bit of an aside here.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.240
The Holy Roman Empire, as
Voltaire famously said, is

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:27.060
neither holy nor Roman
nor an empire.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.780
And he was right.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.710
It was really kind of a very
loose confederation of German

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.090
kingdoms and states-- mainly
German kingdoms and states.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.300
As you can see, it kind of
coincides with modern Germany.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.770
And the two most influential
powers in the Holy Roman

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:47.310
Empire, or actually the most
influential power in the Holy

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.260
Roman Empire, was
the Austrians.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.080
And the ruler of the Austrians
had the title

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.690
of Holy Roman Emperor.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:54.940
And that was Leopold II.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:11.430
But it's not like he was like
the Roman Emperors of old.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.310
The Roman Emperors of old
actually came out of Rome.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:17.880
Notice, nothing in the Holy
Roman Empire at that time, it

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.890
had no control of Rome.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.870
So it was not Roman, we're
not talking about

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.700
people who spoke Latin.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.960
We're talking about people who
spoke Germanic languages.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.340
And it wasn't an empire.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:32.040
That it wasn't a tightly knit
kind of governance structure.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.560
It was this loose confederation
of states.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:40.400
But what was the most
influential was the region

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.640
that was under control of the
Habsburgs of Austria, or

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.660
Leopold II.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.180
And not only was he in control,
or not only did he

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.470
have the title of Holy Roman
Empire, and essentially had

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:55.420
control of the Austrian, I guess
you could say Empire, at

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.300
that point in time.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.390
He was also Marie-Antoinette's
brother.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.340
Leopold II, that's
her brother.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:10.780
So Leopold II and Frederick
William II of Prussia, which

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.330
is another mainly
Germanic state.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.650
Let me do that in
a better color.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.950
They issued the Declaration
of Pillnitz.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:27.940
Let me write this down.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.240
So this is going to add even
more insult to injury to just

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.670
the general population
of France.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.090
The Declaration of Pillnitz.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.890
And this was done in August. so
I just want to make it very

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:51.910
clear what happened.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.220
In June of 1791, they tried
to escape, they

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.700
were captured at Varennes.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:01.400
Then in July of 1791, you have
the Champ-de-Mars Massacre.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.270
So already, people are very
wary of the royals.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.810
The idea that we don't need
them is spreading.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.050
And people are getting
angrier.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.960
And then you have the
Declaration of Pillnitz by

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.580
these foreign powers, one of
whom is essentially the

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.290
brother of the current
French royalty.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:18.400
And that declaration is
essentially saying that they

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:25.090
intend to bring the French
monarchy back to power.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.730
They don't say that they're
definitely going to do it in

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:27.990
military terms or whatever.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.950
But it's a declaration that they
do not approve of what's

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:31.880
going on in France.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.140
And even though they themselves
might have not

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.920
taken it too seriously, the
people of France took it

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.370
really seriously.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:42.140
You have these huge powers on
their border right here.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:48.670
You had the Austrians
and the Prussians.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.200
So this wasn't anything
that people

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.920
could take very lightly.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.330
So it only increased the fear
that the royals were going to

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.040
do something to come back
to full power and

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.250
really suppress people.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:04.000
And it really gave even more
fuel for the Jacobins to kind

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.530
of argue for some type
of a republic.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.080
So I'm going to leave you
there in this video.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.710
As you can see, we saw in the
first video, things got bad.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.960
Now they're getting really
worst. Chaos is

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.740
breaking out in France.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.470
People are questioning
whether they even

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:18.970
need a king or queen.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.520
Foreign powers are getting
involved, saying hey, they

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.880
don't like what they're seeing
there, with kings and queens

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.670
getting overthrown.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.690
Maybe that'll give ideas
to their people.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:28.630
And by the way, I'm your
brother, so I want to

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:29.470
help you out too.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.080
That scares people even more.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.560
The current National Assembly,
which is kind of the beginning

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.820
of the Revolution, they
themselves are on some level

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.310
massacring people.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.850
So it's really leading to a
really tense and ugly time in

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:43.480
French history.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.540
And you're going to see that
that's going to culminate with

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.220
what's called the
Reign of Terror.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.110
And we're going to see that
in the next video.
