00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.520
When Elaine on Seinfeld failed a drug test
after eating a poppy seed muffin back in the

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.090
1996 episode “The Shower Head,” the idea
that you could fail a drug test after eating

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.720
poppy seeds took off.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.410
Turns out, this wasn’t yet another Hollywood
writer invention—you really can potentially

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.740
fail a drug test if you eat poppy seeds.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.579
Before they’re put into muffins, bagels,
or cakes, poppy seeds can be found in poppy

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.579
seed pods.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.780
It just so happens that opium is found in
those same seed pods—it is a milky substance

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.870
that is extracted from the seed pods which
contains morphine and codeine, among other

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.199
pain relieving substances.

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.949
While poppy seeds themselves don’t inherently
contain any opium, when the seeds are harvested,

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.770
they can become contaminated with the opium
in the pod.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.100
The poppy seeds must then be cleaned and processed.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.730
Some countries have strict processing requirements,
which leads to less opiate residue on the

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.350
seeds, but others don’t.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.160
In the end, there is no way to guarantee that
the poppy seeds you’re consuming are free

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.729
of opiates, and in many cases they have at
least some contamination.

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.880
Even a small amount of contamination goes
a long way when it comes to certain drug tests.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.750
In a study conducted by the Institute of Biochemistry
in Germany in 2003, a group of people consumed

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.750
different quantities of a normal commercial
poppy seed cake.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.829
Their urine samples were tested 24 hours after
the cake was eaten, and again at the 48-hour

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:34.829
mark.

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.110
For both tests, each participant tested positive
for opium ranging as high as 10 microg/mL.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.990
For reference, as they noted in the study,
the International Olympic Committee, at least

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.159
in 2003, had the cutoff at 1 microg/mL for
a test to be considered positive.

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.220
A similar test was conducted by MythBusters,
who found the same thing: the opium found

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.229
on poppy seeds stayed in the system up to
48 hours after consumption in significant

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.090
enough quantities to potentially test positive
in certain drug tests.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.850
Elaine Benes wasn’t the only one to get
into trouble at work after failing a drug

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.850
test due to poppy seeds.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.170
There have been numerous reports of men and
women getting fired after a workplace drug

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.940
test—or, in one 2010 case, having a newborn
baby snatched from their arms at the hospital

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.030
after testing positive for opium.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.750
(The baby was later returned, and the mother
was given a monetary settlement.)

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.220
In 1990, a police officer in St. Louis with
an exemplary work record underwent a random

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.989
drug test and was suspended after it came
back positive for opiate use.

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.110
He had eaten four poppy seed bagels the day
before the test.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.200
The department refused to believe that the
officer in question had an opiate problem

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.560
and conducted an experiment of their own:
they had another officer who had a clean test

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.470
before then eat four poppy seed bagels and
take another drug test, which came back positive.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.290
The first officer was reinstated with back
pay.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.860
Poppy seeds struck again in 1994, when a woman
who had a poppy seed bagel for lunch lost

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.890
a prospective job after failing a drug screening.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.850
The company did not allow her to have a second
test as they did not believe a poppy seed

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.000
bagel was to blame.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.750
A similar fate befell a woman in 1997 who
was denied a job at Bankers Insurance Group

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.450
after failing a drug test because of poppy
seeds; in this case, though, the woman was

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.830
awarded over $800,000 in damages.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.159
In 1999, a prison guard was fired for the
same reason, only to be reinstated seven months

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.159
later.

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:28.310
All that said, the concentration of opium
in the urine of someone who eats a poppy seed

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.860
muffin is much lower than someone who is an
actual opiate abuser.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.140
It’s the same reason eating poppy seeds
doesn’t result in the same physical and

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.230
mental side effects that using morphine does:
there just isn’t a lot of opium in the system

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.739
after eating poppy seeds, despite the sensitivity
of the tests.

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.550
Because of this issue, in the early 2000s,
the United States federal government raised

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.959
the threshold for what is considered a positive
opiate test in workplace screening from 0.3

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.189
micrograms per milliliter to 2 micrograms
per milliliter.

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.599
Using the new standard, someone who eats a
couple of poppy seed muffins in the morning

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.940
should test well under the limit, showing
that they are not an opiate abuser—just

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.280
a poppy seed lover.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.590
However, as noted by the Institute of Biochemistry
study, it’s still possible to exceed that

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.700
as some of their subjects who simply ate the
poppy seed cake tested as high as 10 micrograms

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.160
per milliliter.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.020
Just to be on the safe side, if you ever have
to take such a test, best to swear off poppy

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:46.440
seed food items for at least a few days before
the test.
