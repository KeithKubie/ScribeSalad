dash 80 and at that time we were putting

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
dash 80 and at that time we were putting
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.790

a pratt &amp; whitney engine on the side of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
a pratt &amp; whitney engine on the side of
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.720
a pratt &amp; whitney engine on the side of
it which was known as the jt8d and was

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730
it which was known as the jt8d and was
 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.330
it which was known as the jt8d and was
going to be the engine for the 727 which

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340
going to be the engine for the 727 which
 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.889
going to be the engine for the 727 which
at that time was on the drawing board

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
at that time was on the drawing board
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.770
at that time was on the drawing board
and so we did flight test to see how

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
and so we did flight test to see how
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.620

that would work strapped on the side of

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630
that would work strapped on the side of
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.560
that would work strapped on the side of
a 707 and that was the first job I had I

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570
a 707 and that was the first job I had I

equations and I wanted to be in the air

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920
equations and I wanted to be in the air
 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.899
equations and I wanted to be in the air
and so very fortunate I was able

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909

the chief of flight test and I moved

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290
the chief of flight test and I moved
 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.499
the chief of flight test and I moved
into flight test very early and I spent

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509
into flight test very early and I spent
 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.539
into flight test very early and I spent
that short career at Boeing as a flight

test engineer and got to do a lot of

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
test engineer and got to do a lot of
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.700
test engineer and got to do a lot of
flying and a lot of piloting also so it

getting large verdicts against the
 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.629
getting large verdicts against the
industry all of a sudden they were

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639
industry all of a sudden they were
 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.729
industry all of a sudden they were
listening to me and making changes that

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739

out over a group of people instead of
 

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.800
out over a group of people instead of
one person so the jury system I think

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:47.810
one person so the jury system I think
 

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:52.569
one person so the jury system I think

and for understanding what the facts

00:09:55.569 --> 00:09:55.579
and for understanding what the facts
 

00:09:55.579 --> 00:09:59.139
and for understanding what the facts
really were in a way that they're kind

00:09:59.139 --> 00:09:59.149
really were in a way that they're kind
 

00:09:59.149 --> 00:10:01.960
really were in a way that they're kind
of understood by a good cross-section of

for more of a blue ribbon jury in the
case of technical cases but that has a

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:22.040
case of technical cases but that has a
 

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.960

lot of problems all

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:22.970
lot of problems all
 

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.960
lot of problems all
so I've read about it a bit I think the

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:25.970
so I've read about it a bit I think the
 

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.860
so I've read about it a bit I think the
system we have for civil cases which is

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:29.870
system we have for civil cases which is
 

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.300
system we have for civil cases which is
rare because not very many countries

people and corporations I think it's
 

00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:41.710
people and corporations I think it's
probably the best system i have seen and

federal courts see themselves as very

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:12.300
federal courts see themselves as very
 

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.689
federal courts see themselves as very
sophisticated they really don't see

00:13:14.689 --> 00:13:14.699
sophisticated they really don't see
 

00:13:14.699 --> 00:13:17.420
sophisticated they really don't see
themselves as courts for people they see

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:17.430

realize that and oftentimes it's
necessary to play to the jury which is a

00:13:38.059 --> 00:13:38.069
necessary to play to the jury which is a
 

00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:43.519
necessary to play to the jury which is a
jury of people and it's it's difficult

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:43.529

00:13:44.809 --> 00:13:44.819
you have to assess the whole situation
 

00:13:44.819 --> 00:13:47.689
you have to assess the whole situation
because no matter how much the jury may

some corporation or airline so you have
 

00:14:32.579 --> 00:14:34.519
some corporation or airline so you have
a jury at least in the courtroom and

a jury at least in the courtroom and
 

00:14:34.529 --> 00:14:36.889
a jury at least in the courtroom and
then the judges under the pressure of

00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:36.899
then the judges under the pressure of
 

00:14:36.899 --> 00:14:39.680
then the judges under the pressure of
having to pay attention to the jury and

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:39.690
having to pay attention to the jury and
 

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.050
having to pay attention to the jury and

not look like he's offending the jury
 

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.900
not look like he's offending the jury
and not be totally inconsistent with the

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:44.910
and not be totally inconsistent with the
 

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.059
and not be totally inconsistent with the
jury so a jury is a great safety valve

00:14:47.059 --> 00:14:47.069
jury so a jury is a great safety valve
 

00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:50.389
jury so a jury is a great safety valve
in that context so I always tried to do

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399
in that context so I always tried to do
 

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:53.449
in that context so I always tried to do
that if I can if you don't have a jury

00:14:53.449 --> 00:14:53.459
that if I can if you don't have a jury
 

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:55.519
that if I can if you don't have a jury
in a federal system you're going to have

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:55.529
in a federal system you're going to have
 

00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:57.590
in a federal system you're going to have
to play to the prejudices of the court

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600
to play to the prejudices of the court
 

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.629
to play to the prejudices of the court
and the judge and so you have to learn

00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639
and the judge and so you have to learn
 

00:14:59.639 --> 00:15:02.389
and the judge and so you have to learn
those quickly and there's a few tests

00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399
those quickly and there's a few tests
 

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:04.850
those quickly and there's a few tests
that i use for an example to find out

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:04.860
that i use for an example to find out
 

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.980
that i use for an example to find out
where i think that judge may go if i

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:06.990
where i think that judge may go if i
 

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.410
where i think that judge may go if i
reach a little fire on behalf of my

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.420
reach a little fire on behalf of my
 

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.079
reach a little fire on behalf of my
client or you know push some particular

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:12.089
client or you know push some particular
 

00:15:12.089 --> 00:15:14.240
client or you know push some particular
issue so it's more much more sensitive

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:14.250
issue so it's more much more sensitive
 

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.780
issue so it's more much more sensitive
in the state court system judges are

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:17.790
in the state court system judges are
 

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.730
in the state court system judges are
elected and are elected by the community

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:19.740
elected and are elected by the community
 

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.180
elected and are elected by the community
or by the

or by the
 

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.580
or by the
shins that are in that community and so

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:23.590
shins that are in that community and so
 

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.740
shins that are in that community and so
they're much more sensitive to being

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:25.750
they're much more sensitive to being
 

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.480
they're much more sensitive to being
offensive and they're much more likely

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:27.490
offensive and they're much more likely
 

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.780
offensive and they're much more likely
to be people's courts so that's usually

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:30.790
to be people's courts so that's usually
 

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.930

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.110
airplane like Boeing they have to look
at what their risk is from the day they

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:46.120
at what their risk is from the day they
 

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.629
at what their risk is from the day they
are plane crashed there may be three

00:20:48.629 --> 00:20:48.639
are plane crashed there may be three
 

00:20:48.639 --> 00:20:50.610
are plane crashed there may be three
hundred people were killed or 150 people

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:50.620
hundred people were killed or 150 people
 

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.610
hundred people were killed or 150 people
were killed a lot of issues they may

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:53.620
were killed a lot of issues they may
 

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.070
were killed a lot of issues they may
have sold off a large portion of their

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080
have sold off a large portion of their
 

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.129
have sold off a large portion of their
risk for an air carrier let's say ninety

00:20:59.129 --> 00:20:59.139
risk for an air carrier let's say ninety
 

00:20:59.139 --> 00:21:01.560
risk for an air carrier let's say ninety
percent to some foreign insurance market

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:01.570
percent to some foreign insurance market
 

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.769
percent to some foreign insurance market
like Lloyd's or some French market or

00:21:04.769 --> 00:21:04.779
like Lloyd's or some French market or
 

00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:06.869
like Lloyd's or some French market or
combination thereof and they may have

00:21:06.869 --> 00:21:06.879
combination thereof and they may have
 

00:21:06.879 --> 00:21:08.850
combination thereof and they may have
held on to only ten percent of the risk

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:08.860
held on to only ten percent of the risk
 

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.240
held on to only ten percent of the risk
but in the case of the manufacturer they

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:12.250
but in the case of the manufacturer they
 

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.490
but in the case of the manufacturer they
may have held on to fifty percent of the

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:14.500
may have held on to fifty percent of the
 

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.159
may have held on to fifty percent of the
risks in sold off fifty percent so they

00:21:17.159 --> 00:21:17.169
risks in sold off fifty percent so they
 

00:21:17.169 --> 00:21:19.740
risks in sold off fifty percent so they
know from day one at the time the plane

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:19.750
know from day one at the time the plane
 

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.659
know from day one at the time the plane
crashes where their biggest risk is

00:21:21.659 --> 00:21:21.669
crashes where their biggest risk is
 

00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:23.970
crashes where their biggest risk is
they're better off having it being an

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:23.980
they're better off having it being an
 

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.340
they're better off having it being an
air carrier problem than being an

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:26.350
air carrier problem than being an
 

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.169
air carrier problem than being an
airplane problem because they've sold

00:21:28.169 --> 00:21:28.179
airplane problem because they've sold
 

00:21:28.179 --> 00:21:29.039
airplane problem because they've sold
off most of the

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:29.049
off most of the
 

00:21:29.049 --> 00:21:32.249
off most of the
risk for the carrier and they're only

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:32.259
risk for the carrier and they're only
 

00:21:32.259 --> 00:21:34.259
risk for the carrier and they're only
holding a small percentage of it so

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:34.269
holding a small percentage of it so
 

00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:35.639
holding a small percentage of it so
there's a motivation right from the

there's a motivation right from the
beginning to make sure that the people

metallurgical people will look at
 

00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:44.820
metallurgical people will look at

I don't think that the NTSB does the

if you take a Boeing Airplane like the
 

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.890
if you take a Boeing Airplane like the
model 737 that's kind of the workhorse

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.500
model 737 that's kind of the workhorse
of the world industry I mean they only

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:07.510
of the world industry I mean they only
 

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.450
of the world industry I mean they only
have one competition and that's Airbus

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:09.460
have one competition and that's Airbus

and for the NTSB to come out and say
 

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:17.040

safer or aviation saver now I would add

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:06.700
safer or aviation saver now I would add
 

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.090
safer or aviation saver now I would add
that I think aviation has got much safer

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:09.100
that I think aviation has got much safer
 

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.610
that I think aviation has got much safer
in the last 30 years that I've doing the

business especially in their carrier
 

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:14.820
business especially in their carrier
business I don't think in general

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:14.830
business I don't think in general
 

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.220
business I don't think in general
aviation it's got much safer but in the

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:17.230
aviation it's got much safer but in the
 

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:18.660
aviation it's got much safer but in the
air carrier business there's a lot of

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:18.670
air carrier business there's a lot of
 

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:19.950
air carrier business there's a lot of
things that have gone in the right

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:19.960
things that have gone in the right
 

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.260
things that have gone in the right
direction one crew training is much

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:22.270
direction one crew training is much
 

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.290
direction one crew training is much
better than it ever was the one single

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:25.300
better than it ever was the one single
 

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:26.940
better than it ever was the one single
thing there that makes it much better is

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:26.950
thing there that makes it much better is
 

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.880
thing there that makes it much better is
the the simulators are so much better I

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:29.890
the the simulators are so much better I
 

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:33.600

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:17.950
well I'm sure it's not an original
thought by any stretch but I think that

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:17.960
thought by any stretch but I think that
 

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.340
thought by any stretch but I think that
suborbital travel is is a concept that

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:21.350
suborbital travel is is a concept that
 

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:25.210
suborbital travel is is a concept that
makes a lot of sense for a scientist to

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:25.220
makes a lot of sense for a scientist to
 

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.550
makes a lot of sense for a scientist to
look at right now you know the globe

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560
look at right now you know the globe
 

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:30.010
look at right now you know the globe
turns a thousand nautical miles every

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:30.020
turns a thousand nautical miles every
 

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:33.340
turns a thousand nautical miles every
hour so let's take some advantage of

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:33.350
hour so let's take some advantage of
 

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:35.380
hour so let's take some advantage of
that if you wanted to travel from New

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:35.390
that if you wanted to travel from New
 

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:39.580
that if you wanted to travel from New
York to Sydney why not get out to the

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:39.590
York to Sydney why not get out to the
 

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.680
York to Sydney why not get out to the
outer edges of the atmosphere either

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:41.690
outer edges of the atmosphere either
 

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.650
outer edges of the atmosphere either
re-enter skip off of the atmosphere and

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:44.660
re-enter skip off of the atmosphere and
 

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:47.680
re-enter skip off of the atmosphere and
re-enter into Sydney or what have you

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:47.690
re-enter into Sydney or what have you
 

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:51.970
re-enter into Sydney or what have you
you could do it at tremendous speeds you

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:51.980
you could do it at tremendous speeds you
 

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:55.510
you could do it at tremendous speeds you
could do it with a lot less energy I

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520
could do it with a lot less energy I
 

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.850
could do it with a lot less energy I
believe although there's a lot of debate

00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:57.860
believe although there's a lot of debate
 

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:02.770
believe although there's a lot of debate
on that right now how you do it you know

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:02.780
on that right now how you do it you know
 

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.860
on that right now how you do it you know
is it would be a great concept great

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:04.870
is it would be a great concept great
 

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.500
is it would be a great concept great
prize for competition but that excites

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:08.510
prize for competition but that excites
 

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:11.260
prize for competition but that excites
me that idea the idea of blasting

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:11.270
me that idea the idea of blasting
 

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:13.690
me that idea the idea of blasting
through the atmosphere at altitudes of

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:13.700
through the atmosphere at altitudes of
 

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:17.020
through the atmosphere at altitudes of
30 to 45 thousand feet and all the time

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:17.030
30 to 45 thousand feet and all the time
 

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:19.660
30 to 45 thousand feet and all the time
seems to me to be very energy

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:19.670
seems to me to be very energy
 

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:22.000
seems to me to be very energy
inefficient and also right now we're

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:22.010
inefficient and also right now we're
 

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:23.740
inefficient and also right now we're
using a lot of carbon fuels and we're

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:23.750
using a lot of carbon fuels and we're
 

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:24.940
using a lot of carbon fuels and we're
doing a lot of damage to the atmosphere

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:24.950
doing a lot of damage to the atmosphere
 

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:31.550
doing a lot of damage to the atmosphere
into the planet

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:36.450
 
well you know Eagle is a big issue

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:36.460
well you know Eagle is a big issue
 

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.180
well you know Eagle is a big issue

don't have much trouble to communicating

00:39:51.839 --> 00:39:51.849
don't have much trouble to communicating
 

00:39:51.849 --> 00:39:54.870
don't have much trouble to communicating
with scientists on that level to me is

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880
with scientists on that level to me is
 

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.550
with scientists on that level to me is
very similar to communicating with

you call mature scientists in expansive
thinkers that can do that with that can

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:18.730
thinkers that can do that with that can
 

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:20.790
thinkers that can do that with that can
make a safe place for people to share

make a safe place for people to share
 

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.280
make a safe place for people to share
ideas and that's the work in progress

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:23.290
ideas and that's the work in progress
 

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:27.330
ideas and that's the work in progress
that's where we're evolving

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:27.340
 
 

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:31.440
 
every day I meet more new ones I think

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:31.450
every day I meet more new ones I think
 

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:34.710
every day I meet more new ones I think
that on in the last month or so I've met

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720
that on in the last month or so I've met
 

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:40.620
that on in the last month or so I've met
some that I some whose names I could

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:40.630
some that I some whose names I could
 

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:42.780
some that I some whose names I could
give freely like Peter Diamandis I think

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:42.790
give freely like Peter Diamandis I think
 

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:45.630
give freely like Peter Diamandis I think
it is great along these lines it was he

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640
it is great along these lines it was he
 

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.100
it is great along these lines it was he
was a great fine for me I think that

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:49.110
was a great fine for me I think that
 

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.990
was a great fine for me I think that
some people in terms of helping to

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000
some people in terms of helping to
 

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.610
some people in terms of helping to
expand the level of consciousness people

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:56.620
expand the level of consciousness people
 

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:59.430
expand the level of consciousness people
like Andrew Cohen from enlightenment

00:40:59.430 --> 00:40:59.440
like Andrew Cohen from enlightenment
 

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:04.380
like Andrew Cohen from enlightenment
next I think that kind of teaching will

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:04.390
next I think that kind of teaching will
 

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:07.140
next I think that kind of teaching will
help tremendously to expand people so

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:07.150
help tremendously to expand people so
 

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:09.380
help tremendously to expand people so
that they will you know work for the

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:09.390
that they will you know work for the
 

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:12.650
that they will you know work for the
good of their culture is compared to the

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660
good of their culture is compared to the
 

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:17.430
good of their culture is compared to the
egocentric kind of inventors that we

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440
egocentric kind of inventors that we
 

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.760
egocentric kind of inventors that we
have really had historically so every

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:20.770
have really had historically so every
 

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:22.590
have really had historically so every
day I meeting more people that I think

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:22.600
day I meeting more people that I think
 

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.870
day I meeting more people that I think
that will make this inner circle work

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880
that will make this inner circle work
 

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.650
that will make this inner circle work
and and I've met several people whose

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:28.660
and and I've met several people whose
 

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:30.150
and and I've met several people whose
names I wouldn't feel real freely to

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160
names I wouldn't feel real freely to
 

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.170
names I wouldn't feel real freely to
give right now because I don't think

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:31.180
give right now because I don't think
 

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.060
give right now because I don't think
they would feel safe but I think they

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:33.070
they would feel safe but I think they
 

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:36.970
they would feel safe but I think they
will very shortly

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:36.980
 
 

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.950
 
what's interesting you know I'm driving

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960
what's interesting you know I'm driving
 

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.630
what's interesting you know I'm driving
a hundred percent electric car for

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640
a hundred percent electric car for
 

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.849
a hundred percent electric car for
example the Tesla which is a great

00:41:42.849 --> 00:41:42.859
example the Tesla which is a great
 

00:41:42.859 --> 00:41:47.020
example the Tesla which is a great
concept because I think that Tesla has

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:47.030
concept because I think that Tesla has
 

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:49.510
concept because I think that Tesla has
done what needed to be done to let

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520
done what needed to be done to let
 

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:54.010
done what needed to be done to let
people know that to have an electric car

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:54.020
people know that to have an electric car
 

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.849
people know that to have an electric car
didn't mean you had to be a driving a

00:41:57.849 --> 00:41:57.859
didn't mean you had to be a driving a
 

00:41:57.859 --> 00:42:02.680
didn't mean you had to be a driving a
breadbox looking ugly green sort of

Colorado but you could actually look
 

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:09.970
Colorado but you could actually look
kind of sporty and and go fast and it's

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:09.980
kind of sporty and and go fast and it's
 

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.010

electric I think that we still have to

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:16.760
electric I think that we still have to
 

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.609

look at you know what it costs to make

00:42:18.609 --> 00:42:18.619
look at you know what it costs to make
 

00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:20.830
look at you know what it costs to make
the electricity and how much carbon fuel

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:20.840
the electricity and how much carbon fuel
 

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.480
the electricity and how much carbon fuel
hydrocarbon fuels were used to make the

competitive to apportion in terms of

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:32.210
competitive to apportion in terms of
 

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:35.500
competitive to apportion in terms of
performance I think that is great not

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:35.510
performance I think that is great not
 

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:37.930
performance I think that is great not
that it's new and innovative but

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:37.940
that it's new and innovative but
 

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:41.710
that it's new and innovative but
electric boats are very easy that's why

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:41.720
electric boats are very easy that's why
 

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.620
electric boats are very easy that's why
there aren't more electric boats it is

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:44.630
there aren't more electric boats it is
 

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:48.810
there aren't more electric boats it is
difficult hard for me to imagine but I

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:48.820
difficult hard for me to imagine but I
 

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.000
difficult hard for me to imagine but I
it was Christmas time I rented a hundred

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:52.010
it was Christmas time I rented a hundred
 

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:53.440
it was Christmas time I rented a hundred
percent electric boat and spent

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:53.450
percent electric boat and spent
 

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:55.870

Christmas Day on electric bout it works

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:55.880
Christmas Day on electric bout it works
 

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:59.340
Christmas Day on electric bout it works
fine and it has a lot of advantages over

00:42:59.340 --> 00:42:59.350
fine and it has a lot of advantages over
 

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:02.950
fine and it has a lot of advantages over

and what have you so I think that's

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:07.220
and what have you so I think that's
 

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.920
and what have you so I think that's
another area where we can do real well

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:08.930
another area where we can do real well
 

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:11.170
another area where we can do real well
in the ocean is a big part of my own

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:11.180

another again not innovative but there

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:15.830
another again not innovative but there
 

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:17.470
another again not innovative but there
are some real new innovative ways to

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:17.480
are some real new innovative ways to
 

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.800
are some real new innovative ways to
make saline more efficient and even more

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:20.810
make saline more efficient and even more
 

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:23.680
make saline more efficient and even more
available for commercial use I think

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:23.690
available for commercial use I think
 

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:25.180
available for commercial use I think
some some of the things in sport

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:25.190
some some of the things in sport
 

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:28.990
some some of the things in sport
aviation or sport sailing could be some

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:29.000
aviation or sport sailing could be some
 

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.330
aviation or sport sailing could be some
of that some of those ideas and some of

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:31.340
of that some of those ideas and some of
 

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:32.770
of that some of those ideas and some of
that technology could be really

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:32.780
that technology could be really
 

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.250
that technology could be really
transferred to commercial shipping in it

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:36.260
transferred to commercial shipping in it
 

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.290
transferred to commercial shipping in it
kind of a I love it because it's a

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:38.300
kind of a I love it because it's a
 

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.760
kind of a I love it because it's a
combination of aerodynamics and

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:39.770
combination of aerodynamics and
 

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:43.300
combination of aerodynamics and
hydrodynamics so that's great so those

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:43.310
hydrodynamics so that's great so those
 

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:46.240
hydrodynamics so that's great so those
are those are some things other than

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:46.250
are those are some things other than
 

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:48.340
are those are some things other than
aviation those are on the surface and

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:48.350
aviation those are on the surface and
 

00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:50.990
aviation those are on the surface and
then you know the idea of

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000
then you know the idea of
 

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.330
then you know the idea of
of traveling beyond the atmospheres in a

00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:56.340
of traveling beyond the atmospheres in a
 

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.760
of traveling beyond the atmospheres in a
rocketry and space mechanics are also

00:43:58.760 --> 00:43:58.770
rocketry and space mechanics are also
 

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:00.920
rocketry and space mechanics are also
very interesting because I think they

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:00.930
very interesting because I think they
 

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:05.150
very interesting because I think they
can solve a lot of problems

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160
 
 

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.700
 
well one of the problems is that you

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:07.710
well one of the problems is that you
 

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:09.890
well one of the problems is that you
know we have regulation systems that

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:09.900
know we have regulation systems that
 

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.410
know we have regulation systems that
make it very difficult to take risk to

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:12.420
make it very difficult to take risk to
 

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:15.380
make it very difficult to take risk to
try new things for example if you try to

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:15.390
try new things for example if you try to
 

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:18.049
try new things for example if you try to
design a new airplane today many of

00:44:18.049 --> 00:44:18.059
design a new airplane today many of
 

00:44:18.059 --> 00:44:20.240
design a new airplane today many of
things that inhibit airplane design are

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:20.250
things that inhibit airplane design are
 

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:22.279
things that inhibit airplane design are
the federal air regulations now on one

00:44:22.279 --> 00:44:22.289
the federal air regulations now on one
 

00:44:22.289 --> 00:44:23.539
the federal air regulations now on one
hand that's real important from the

00:44:23.539 --> 00:44:23.549
hand that's real important from the
 

00:44:23.549 --> 00:44:26.029
hand that's real important from the
standpoint of safety but it makes it

00:44:26.029 --> 00:44:26.039
standpoint of safety but it makes it
 

00:44:26.039 --> 00:44:28.089
standpoint of safety but it makes it
very difficult for innovation because

00:44:28.089 --> 00:44:28.099
very difficult for innovation because
 

00:44:28.099 --> 00:44:30.770
very difficult for innovation because
we're stuck in these old regulations

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:30.780
we're stuck in these old regulations
 

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.799
we're stuck in these old regulations
that were the design criteria that we're

00:44:33.799 --> 00:44:33.809
that were the design criteria that we're
 

00:44:33.809 --> 00:44:37.309
that were the design criteria that we're
back you know basically created back in

00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319
back you know basically created back in
 

00:44:37.319 --> 00:44:40.279
back you know basically created back in
the mid 50's or even before that for air

00:44:40.279 --> 00:44:40.289
the mid 50's or even before that for air
 

00:44:40.289 --> 00:44:44.029
the mid 50's or even before that for air
transports so the that that part of the

00:44:44.029 --> 00:44:44.039
transports so the that that part of the
 

00:44:44.039 --> 00:44:45.770
transports so the that that part of the
infrastructure if you will call it

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:45.780
infrastructure if you will call it
 

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:48.890
infrastructure if you will call it
infrastructure is inhibiting rather than

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900
infrastructure is inhibiting rather than
 

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.770
infrastructure is inhibiting rather than
helpful understanding that it's

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:51.780
helpful understanding that it's
 

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:54.589
helpful understanding that it's
necessary for safety there just has to

00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599
necessary for safety there just has to
 

00:44:54.599 --> 00:44:57.349
necessary for safety there just has to
be another way to be able to advance

00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359
be another way to be able to advance
 

00:44:57.359 --> 00:45:03.859
be another way to be able to advance
this technology and to take the risk for

00:45:03.859 --> 00:45:03.869
this technology and to take the risk for
 

00:45:03.869 --> 00:45:06.260
this technology and to take the risk for
new ideas without having the

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:06.270
new ideas without having the
 

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:08.029
new ideas without having the
infrastructure prevent that from

00:45:08.029 --> 00:45:08.039
infrastructure prevent that from
 

00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:12.500
infrastructure prevent that from
happening of things so many aviation I

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:12.510
happening of things so many aviation I
 

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:14.059
happening of things so many aviation I
just just haven't come to fruition

00:45:14.059 --> 00:45:14.069
just just haven't come to fruition
 

00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:16.339
just just haven't come to fruition
because of the infrastructure and

00:45:16.339 --> 00:45:16.349
because of the infrastructure and
 

00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:19.130
because of the infrastructure and
another problem is that the regulated

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.140
another problem is that the regulated
 

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.430
another problem is that the regulated
have become the regulator's to a large

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440
have become the regulator's to a large
 

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.680
have become the regulator's to a large
extent you know in the aviation industry

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:26.690
 
 

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:29.120
 
we could say that they know the Boeing

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:29.130
we could say that they know the Boeing
 

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:31.279
we could say that they know the Boeing
Airplane Company you know certifies

00:45:31.279 --> 00:45:31.289
Airplane Company you know certifies
 

00:45:31.289 --> 00:45:34.630
Airplane Company you know certifies
their own airplanes and or tells the FAA

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640
their own airplanes and or tells the FAA
 

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.529
their own airplanes and or tells the FAA
when they're going to certify them and

00:45:36.529 --> 00:45:36.539
when they're going to certify them and
 

00:45:36.539 --> 00:45:38.569
when they're going to certify them and
how they're going to certify them so the

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:38.579
how they're going to certify them so the
 

00:45:38.579 --> 00:45:39.890
how they're going to certify them so the
system is kind of turned around on

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900
system is kind of turned around on
 

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:43.680
system is kind of turned around on
itself a little bit

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:43.690
 
 

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:46.680
 
I think listening to people that have

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:46.690
I think listening to people that have
 

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:50.099
I think listening to people that have
expertise in the in the areas or in the

00:45:50.099 --> 00:45:50.109
expertise in the in the areas or in the
 

00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:54.170
expertise in the in the areas or in the
fields of Transportation rather than I

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.180
fields of Transportation rather than I
 

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:57.930
fields of Transportation rather than I
and I'm talking about people as compared

00:45:57.930 --> 00:45:57.940
and I'm talking about people as compared
 

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:00.900
and I'm talking about people as compared
to corporations that it can do that are

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:00.910
to corporations that it can do that are
 

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:03.150
to corporations that it can do that are
in control of the economy and I want to

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:03.160
in control of the economy and I want to
 

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.099
in control of the economy and I want to
make that distinction I think there's a

00:46:05.099 --> 00:46:05.109
make that distinction I think there's a
 

00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:07.319
make that distinction I think there's a
tremendous number of people that never

00:46:07.319 --> 00:46:07.329
tremendous number of people that never
 

00:46:07.329 --> 00:46:10.170
tremendous number of people that never
get listened to and if you go to

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:10.180
get listened to and if you go to
 

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.880

it's ridiculous but they perpetuated

00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319
it's ridiculous but they perpetuated
 

00:48:24.319 --> 00:48:28.569
it's ridiculous but they perpetuated
that for 40 years and we have to have

00:48:28.569 --> 00:48:28.579
that for 40 years and we have to have
 

00:48:28.579 --> 00:48:30.760

that challenge they knew how in the
 

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:32.529
that challenge they knew how in the
universities and the labs and then the

00:48:32.529 --> 00:48:32.539
universities and the labs and then the
 

00:48:32.539 --> 00:48:36.069

best the best scientific thinkers years
 

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:41.190
best the best scientific thinkers years
ago knew how to fix that problem

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.350
 
first question I would ask is how you

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:43.360
first question I would ask is how you
 

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.870

fly through the atmosphere with a fuel

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:45.880
fly through the atmosphere with a fuel
 

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.120

that's alternative to carbon fuel that

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:48.130
that's alternative to carbon fuel that
 

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:49.230
that's alternative to carbon fuel that
would be one of the first questions that

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:49.240
would be one of the first questions that
 

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:52.020
would be one of the first questions that
ask you know what's out there what can

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:52.030
ask you know what's out there what can
 

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:55.800
ask you know what's out there what can
we find and how can we find it an

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:55.810
we find and how can we find it an
 

00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:58.200
we find and how can we find it an
alternative to a carbon fuel for flying

00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:58.210
alternative to a carbon fuel for flying
 

00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:01.320
alternative to a carbon fuel for flying
through the atmosphere or to reduce the

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:01.330
through the atmosphere or to reduce the
 

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:04.410
through the atmosphere or to reduce the
use of carbon fuel by say fifty percent

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:04.420
use of carbon fuel by say fifty percent
 

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.750
use of carbon fuel by say fifty percent
or seventy-five percent and that would

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:06.760
or seventy-five percent and that would
 

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.030
or seventy-five percent and that would
be a result of clean aerodynamics so

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040
be a result of clean aerodynamics so
 

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.160
be a result of clean aerodynamics so
what how do we make aerodynamics clean

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:11.170
what how do we make aerodynamics clean
 

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:13.230
what how do we make aerodynamics clean
enough so that we use half the field we

well I know of him I think he knows the

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920
well I know of him I think he knows the
 

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.490
well I know of him I think he knows the
answer to that but I think that he would

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:23.500
answer to that but I think that he would
 

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:26.430
answer to that but I think that he would
say that isn't being done because I

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:26.440
say that isn't being done because I
