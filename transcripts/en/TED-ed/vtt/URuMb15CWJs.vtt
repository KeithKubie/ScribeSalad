00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.320
Just for a moment,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.315
focus on your breath.

00:00:10.315 --> 00:00:12.140
In slowly.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.756
Out slowly.

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:15.274
In slowly.

00:00:15.274 --> 00:00:16.625
Out.

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:19.944
The same pattern repeats within
every one of us

00:00:19.944 --> 00:00:21.574
and consider your pulse.

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:25.474
The beat is built into the very
fabric of our being.

00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:29.405
Simply put, we're creatures of rhythm
and repetition.

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:31.466
It's central to our experience,

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.231
rhythm and repetition,

00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:35.260
rhythm and repetition.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.449
On, and in,

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.736
and on, and out.

00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:41.409
And we delight in those aspects everyday,

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:42.696
in the rhythm of a song,

00:00:42.696 --> 00:00:44.148
the beat of the drum,

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:45.564
the nod of your head,

00:00:45.564 --> 00:00:47.874
or in the repetition of soup cans,

00:00:47.874 --> 00:00:49.492
the rows of an orchard,

00:00:49.492 --> 00:00:51.382
the artistry of petals.

00:00:51.382 --> 00:00:53.511
Pattern can be pleasure.

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:56.475
In language, rhythm and repetition
are often used

00:00:56.475 --> 00:00:59.406
as the building blocks for poetry.

00:00:59.406 --> 00:01:01.305
There's the rhythm of language,

00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:04.101
created by syllables and their emphasis,

00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:09.806
such as, "So long as men can breathe
or eyes can see."

00:01:09.806 --> 00:01:13.026
And there's the repetition of language
at multiple levels:

00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:14.667
the repetition of letters,

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:18.071
"So long lives this
and this gives life to thee,"

00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:19.291
of sounds,

00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:21.874
"breathe," "see," "thee,"

00:01:21.874 --> 00:01:23.477
and of words.

00:01:23.477 --> 00:01:27.250
With so many uses, repetition
is one of the poet's most malleable

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.342
and reliable tools.

00:01:29.342 --> 00:01:31.818
It can lift or lull the listener,

00:01:31.818 --> 00:01:34.197
amplify or diminish the line,

00:01:34.197 --> 00:01:37.223
unify or diversify ideas.

00:01:37.223 --> 00:01:39.318
In fact, even rhythm itself,

00:01:39.318 --> 00:01:42.088
a repeated pattern of stressed syllables,

00:01:42.088 --> 00:01:44.500
is a form of repetition.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.362
Yet for all its varied uses,

00:01:46.362 --> 00:01:48.942
too much repetition can backfire.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:53.095
Imagine writing the same sentence
on the blackboard twenty times,

00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:55.739
again, and again, and again, and again,

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:59.695
or imagine a young child clamoring
for her mother's attention,

00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:03.241
"Mom, mom, mommy, mom, mom."

00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:06.164
Not exactly what we might call poetry.

00:02:06.164 --> 00:02:09.831
So what is poetic repetition,
and why does it work?

00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:12.249
Possibly most familiar is rhyme,

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:15.343
the repetition of like sounds
in word endings.

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:17.529
As with Shakespeare's example,

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.547
we often encounter rhyme
at the ends of lines.

00:02:20.547 --> 00:02:23.862
Repetition in this way creates
an expectation.

00:02:23.862 --> 00:02:27.601
We begin to listen for the repetition
of those similar sounds.

00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:31.250
When we hear them, 
the found pattern is pleasurable.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.588
Like finding Waldo in the visual chaos,

00:02:33.588 --> 00:02:36.815
we hear the echo in the oral chatter.

00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:41.347
Yet, rhyme need not surface solely
at a line's end.

00:02:41.347 --> 00:02:43.374
Notice the strong "i" sound in,

00:02:43.374 --> 00:02:47.631
"So long lives this 
and this gives life to thee."

00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:50.757
This repetition of vowel sounds
is called assonance

00:02:50.757 --> 00:02:53.771
and can also be heard 
in Eminem's "Lose Yourself."

00:02:53.771 --> 00:02:57.146
Notice how the "e" and "o" sounds
repeat both within in

00:02:57.146 --> 00:02:59.150
and at the end of each line:

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.011
"Oh, there goes gravity,

00:03:01.011 --> 00:03:03.046
Oh, there goes rabbit,
he choked,

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:05.578
he so mad but he won't
give up that easy,

00:03:05.578 --> 00:03:06.750
no, he won't have it,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.903
he knows his whole back's
to these ropes."

00:03:09.903 --> 00:03:12.441
The alternating assonance
creates its own rhythm,

00:03:12.441 --> 00:03:15.982
and invites us to try our own voices
in echoing it.

00:03:15.982 --> 00:03:20.261
Similarly, consonance is the repetition
of like consonant sounds,

00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:22.385
such as the "l" and "th" in,

00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:26.417
"So long lives this
and this gives life to thee."

00:03:26.417 --> 00:03:28.991
In fact, this type of specific consonance,

00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:31.201
which occurs at the beginning of words

00:03:31.201 --> 00:03:33.207
may be familiar to you already.

00:03:33.207 --> 00:03:36.482
It's called alliteration,
or front rhyme.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.639
Great examples include tongue twisters.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.187
Betty bought some butter 
but the butter was bitter

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:44.634
so Betty bought some better butter
to make the bitter butter better.

00:03:44.634 --> 00:03:49.357
Here, the pleasure in pattern is apparent
as we trip over the consonance

00:03:49.357 --> 00:03:52.544
both within words and at their start.

00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:57.281
Yet tongue twisters also reflect the need
for variation in poetic repetition.

00:03:57.281 --> 00:03:58.853
While challenging to say,

00:03:58.853 --> 00:04:02.500
they're seen by some
as lesser imitations of poetry,

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.784
or gimmicky because they hammer
so heavily on the same sounds,

00:04:06.784 --> 00:04:09.192
closer to that blackboard-style 
of repetition.

00:04:09.192 --> 00:04:12.538
Ultimately, this is the poet's 
balancing act,

00:04:12.538 --> 00:04:13.858
learning when to repeat

00:04:13.858 --> 00:04:15.181
and when to riff,

00:04:15.181 --> 00:04:17.009
when to satisfy expectations,

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:19.367
and when to thwart them,

00:04:19.367 --> 00:04:21.970
and in that balance, 
it may be enough to remember

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.061
we all live in a world of wild variation

00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:27.987
and carry with us our own breath and beat,

00:04:27.987 --> 00:04:30.755
our own repetition wherever we go.
