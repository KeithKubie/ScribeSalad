sponsored by BASF, THE chemical company.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.759
Water + air + sun = jet fuel?

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:14.370
Well... yeah.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.820
That's a thing we can say now!

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.680
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and we did
it!

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.560
We have successfully created jet fuel, out
of thin air.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.800
And by we, I mean a team of highly specialized
chemists.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.800
Obviously.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.670
Researchers from the SOLAR-JET Project have
found a way to create kerosene, using only

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.800
water, air, and sunlight.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.940
And if you don't think that's amazing, then
I don't know what to tell you.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.210
The basic idea is this: they combine water
and carbon dioxide, and then use simulated,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.770
concentrated sunlight to convert it into syngas,
which is a gas made up of hydrogen, carbon

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.390
monoxide, and oxygen.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.630
They then used the Fischer-Tropsch process,
which is a chemical process invented in Germany

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.870
in the 1920s, to convert the syngas into kerosene,
so it can be used as fuel.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.140
It's a simple idea, right?

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.980
Yes, but it's been hard to accomplish until
now, for 2 main reasons.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.400
One - the dissociation of carbon dioxide and
water only happens at extremely high temperatures,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.640
around 4,000 degrees F. So to achieve that,
they used a high-flux solar simulator that

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.000
mimics the output from a solar concentrator.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.280
So it gets insanely hot.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.280
Problem solved.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.579
The other issue, is that the Fischer--Tropsch
process, which converts the syngas into kerosene

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.290
- can cause a massive explosion if the oxygen
isn't completely removed from the syngas first.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.460
This problem was solved by using ceria, which
is a chemical compound that releases oxygen

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.439
when heated above 2,700 degrees F. So when
you heat up the ceria, all of the oxygen gets

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.580
released, and you're left with this reduced
form of ceria.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.750
You then add that to the water and carbon
dioxide, so when you heat all of them up together

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.700
- the oxygen given off by the dissociation
of water and carbon dioxide - gets absorbed

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.150
back into the ceria.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.360
And that process gets repeated over and over
again, so eventually, you end up with syngas

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.840
that's completely oxygen-free.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.810
At which point you can safely convert it into
fuel.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.120
As amazing as this process is, the team who
discovered it has only produced a single glass

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.900
of kerosene thus far - but they estimate a
full-scale solar reactor could produce up

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.680
to 20,000 litres of jet fuel every day.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.590
Above all else, they say "it's an important
milestone in the long-term process of developing

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.860
a truly sustainable alternative fuel future."

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.250
It uses infinite materials we already have
- and turns harmful ones - like carbon dioxide

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.060
- into actual useful resources.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.060
What could be better than that?

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.220
Not much, I tell you.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.220
Not much.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.240
I think this is incredible, personally, and
I hope you guys agree - as always if you have
