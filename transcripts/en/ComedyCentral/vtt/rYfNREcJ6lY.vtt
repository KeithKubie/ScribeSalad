EGYPT, WE'LL GO WITH YOU FIRST.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.439 align:start position:0% line:85%
LADIES FIRST.

00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:09.242 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WAIT A MINUTE, THIS IS A
SETUP!

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:16.249 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT IS BEER PONG SO
WE'RE GONNA DO THE FRAT

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:22.021 align:start position:0% line:91%
QUESTION. YOU HEARD IN THE NEWS,
SAE, THE RACIST FRAT --

00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:25.458 line:85%
&gt;&gt; KIND OF REDUNDANT, ISN'T IT?

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:28.528 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WELL DONE! AND THERE'S
THE GUYS AT PENN STATE

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.030 align:start position:0% line:91%
WITH NAKED PICTURES AND WILL
FERRELL CAME

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:35.935 align:start position:0% line:91%
OUT AND SAID WE SHOULD GET RID
OF FRATS ALTOGETHER.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:40.673 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU'RE A BIG PARTYING FRAT GUY,
ROBERT, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:44.110 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I SAY FRATERNITIES ARE
ELITISTS, EXCLUSIVE AND THERE IS

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:45.244 size:75% position:38% line:85%
NO EDUCATIONAL FUNCTION.

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:47.046 size:84% position:42% line:85%
GET RID OF THEM COMPLETELY.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.948 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: GONE?

00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:51.751 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; IF YOU GET RID OF SORORITIES

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:55.421 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND FRATERNITIES, NO ONE GOES TO
SCHOOL ANYMORE, QUITE HONEST.

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:57.757 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S THE BEST PART OF COLLEGE,
THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.327 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU SHOULD'NT THROW OUT THE
WHOLE BATCH OF APPLES BECAUSE OF

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.561 align:start position:0% line:85%
ONE BAD APPLE.

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:06.532 line:91%
THE REALTY IS THERE ARE A LOT OF
FRATERNITIES AND SORORITY THAT

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:07.633 align:start position:0% line:85%
ARE EXEMPLARY.

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:13.339 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY DO GREAT COMMUNITY SERVICE,
THROW GREAT PARTIES --

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:14.674 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:18.044 line:91%
LET ME JUST SAY THAT FOR THE
LAST 40 YEARS THAT I HAVE BEEN

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:22.315 size:88% position:44% line:91%
IN AND AROUND UNIVERSITIES,
EVERY YEAR OR TWO THERE IS A

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:26.352 align:start position:0% line:91%
SCANDAL AND THERE'S AN APOLOGY
AND THESE PRIVILEGED ELITE

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:29.322 line:91%
PEOPLE COME OUT AND DO PRESS
CONFERENCES AND THEY SAY NEVER,

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:33.659 align:start position:0% line:91%
NEVER AGAIN, AND THEY DO IT
AGAIN!

00:01:33.692 --> 00:01:40.533 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: IT'S A NEW BATCH OF
DICKS COMING IN, THOUGH.

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:43.669 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT'S FRESH DICKS.

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:47.039 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHY AM I THE ONLY WOMAN ON
THE SET HERE!

00:01:47.072 --> 00:01:47.907 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HOLD ON A MINUTE.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.475 size:81% position:41% line:85%
I THINK YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:53.212 line:91%
I DON'T THINK THEY DO AS MUCH
GOOD AS EGYPT SAYS BUT I DON'T

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:55.314 size:78% position:39% line:85%
THINK WE SHOULD BAN THEM.

00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:58.017 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT I DON'T THINK THEY DO A LOT
OF GOOD.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.120 align:start position:0% line:91%
BANNING STUFF IS A BAD PRACTICE
JUST BECAUSE A COUPLE OF

00:02:01.153 --> 00:02:04.223 size:88% position:44% line:91%
PEOPLE -- IN OTHER WORDS, WE
HAVE THE KKK IN AMERICA, WE

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:05.658 align:start position:0% line:85%
DON'T BAN THAT.

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:09.295 line:85%
&gt;&gt; THOSE GUYS ARE BIGGER DICKS!

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:12.865 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: K.K.K. HAS A LOT OF
GOOD PARTIES, TOO!

00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:15.334 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; LARRY, I'M GOING TO DISAGREE

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:16.536 align:start position:0% line:85%
WITH THAT.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.372 align:start position:0% line:91%
AS A JEW, I DON'T GO TO THOSE
PARTIES.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.440 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WERE YOU EVER IN A
FRAT OR ANYTHING?

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:24.343 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I CONSIDERED JOINING A FRAT
WHEN I GOT IN COLLEGE.

00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:30.449 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEN I HUNG OUT WITH TEN GUYS
AND WE HAD OUR OWN CREW

00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:31.584 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CALLED A GANG.

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:35.855 align:start position:0% line:91%
WELL, WE DID OUR STUFF
UNDERCOVER.

00:02:35.888 --> 00:02:36.989 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; AGAIN...

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:43.462 size:84% position:42% line:91%
BUT I WILL SAY YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE BAD AND GOOD FRATS.

00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:52.038 align:start position:0% line:91%
DID YOU SEE OLD SCHOOL?  I
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BAN THEM.

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.940 size:88% position:44% line:85%
JUST MAKE THEM MORE DIVERSE.

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:58.344 line:91%
THAT WAY, IF THEY DO SOMETHING
RACIST, THE BLACK GUY GOES, WHAT

00:02:58.377 --> 00:02:59.710 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE (BLEEP) YOU SAY?
