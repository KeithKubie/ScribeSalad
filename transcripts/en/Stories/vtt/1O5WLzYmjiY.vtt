00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.630
INTERVIEWER: You're
already invited.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.870
A simple message that
could invoke excitement if

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.730
found in a Hallmark card.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.340
But it's something that seems
much more mysterious when

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.500
taped the window of
an airplane traveling

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.260
30,000 feet in the air.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.350
But it turns out there's a
very good reason for this note.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.470
TAYLOR: Hi, my name
is Taylor Tippett.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.480
I am from North Carolina.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.750
I am a fight attendant
for a major airline,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.774
and I'm currently
based out of DC.

00:00:30.774 --> 00:00:33.065
INTERVIEWER: Taylor wrote
this note and decided to tape

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:35.440
it on the window one
day while working.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.930
She took the quote from
one of my favorite books,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.670
using it as a quick source
of motivation for that day.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.280
TAYLOR: And so you're already
invited was just a pick-me-up.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.950
Like, you're already invited
to kill this day, to nail it,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.470
to have the best day ever.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.870
It's already set up for you.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.490
You just have to go do it.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.730
So that was the encouragement
behind that specific word

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.875
from the window seat.

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:57.500
INTERVIEWER: Words
from the window seat

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.776
became something
Taylor did regularly.

00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:01.150
Whenever she felt
inspired, she'd

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.110
write a quote a piece of paper
and tape it to the window.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.750
It soon became a
hit on Instagram,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.770
where she amassed
over 85,000 followers,

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.050
and spawned a
hashtag and copycats.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.790
TAYLOR: If I'm not encouraging
and inspiring others,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.350
what am I doing with my life?

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.430
What am I doing
with my time here?

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.530
I'm not doing anything.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.560
I'm wasting it.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.560
For my voice to matter,
and for other people

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.850
to connect, or feel loved, or
just feel understood and heard,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.910
that is all that matters to me.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.060
INTERVIEWER: And Taylor
also I respects her medium.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.310
She understands it
has its boundaries

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.480
and may be best taken in via the
internet, and not as a surprise

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.030
when you take your seat.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.080
TAYLOR: I've had some
cases, even friends of mine,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.360
where they tape that note
up, and people freak out,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.760
because-- they're
like, what is this?

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.870
Like, somebody left this.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.320
This is not supposed to be here.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.060
Once I'm done taking
my picture, I'll

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.510
tape it in the safety card
for the passenger to find it,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.840
or for the next passenger
to find it, as a little--

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.591
just a pick-me-up.

00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:03.631
INTERVIEWER: Taylor doesn't
do this to be famous,

00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:05.150
or for the recognition.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.150
She writes these notes
for the same reason she

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.360
likes being a flight attendant.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.530
TAYLOR: There's nothing like
your office being in the sky,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.700
and flying on a metal tube, and
meeting 300-plus people a day,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.119
and just knowing that your
smile and your kindness matters.

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:25.660
