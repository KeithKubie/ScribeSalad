00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.050
PROFESSOR: Here's
another case study.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.530
I simply put two pieces
of paper overlapping.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.800
These papers are used for
particular medical analysis.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.280
So I captured it, once again,
at a very high resolution,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.980
so that as we zoom
into the image,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.750
we can actually see the
fibers in the paper.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.510
Here's an image where I
added background color.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.390
Now, I'm not changing
the important information

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.340
in the image-- the structure.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.130
The structure is the data.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.840
I'm just adding an
additional component

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.880
to allow the viewer to
see the material better.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.830
We'll be looking at adding
backgrounds in the how to do it

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.570
section.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.440
I want to spend a few
minutes on backgrounds

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.880
I am a bit of a
background collector.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.900
And, frankly, I think
you should be one, too.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.500
Really, it helps a lot
to imagine your images,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.000
even while you're not
even working on it.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.600
Whenever some interesting
envelope or card

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.270
arrives in my mailbox, I
keep it, believe it or not,

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.180
thinking that it might
help with an image one day.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.360
Or platters.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.200
Or wired thingies.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.200
Anything that might be
appropriate for a background

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.620
for small devices.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.080
And besides, it's
fun to think about.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.400
So let's take a look
at one particular idea.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.660
Take this simple graph paper
which I tried as a background

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.230
for this device.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.760
Looks OK.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.000
Here I tried some bubble
wrap, of all things.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.640
Definitely over the top,
and doesn't work quite well.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.580
There should be some sort of
intelligent visual connection

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.740
between your device
and your background,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.700
and bubble wrap
doesn't quite cut it.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.820
In the end I finally landed
on using simple green paper

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.450
with this device.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.370
And because the
image was captured

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.410
with the scanner sitting
at a high resolution--

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.750
it was about a
400-meg file-- I was

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.250
able to zoom in, crop,
and finalize the image.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.290
I think that both the
simple colored background

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.860
and the composition works.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.720
Here we see three microfluidic
devices, which I initially

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.510
lined up in a pretty boring
way, as you see here.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.930
And once again, I'm always
playing with composition,

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.850
so what I did was I used
two of them instead.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.180
Just the two of
them really visually

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.170
say what you need to say.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.490
We don't need three.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.790
You might think about
that in your own work.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.600
So I captured it at a
very high resolution,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.950
putting the devices
on an angle--

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.910
a much more interesting
composition.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.870
And because of the
high resolution,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.650
I was able to zoom in
and crop the image.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.970
Now, watch what
happens when I enhance

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.180
the image using a
sharpening tool.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.420
We'll talk about sharpening
images in the how to do it

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.600
section.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.020
This is an important technique.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.610
The sharpening filter is
not changing your data.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.500
If your data is about
form and structure,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.610
it's permitting you
and your viewers

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.290
to see the image clearly.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.360
But whenever any of
these filters are used,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.640
it's imperative
to always indicate

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.670
the process in the caption.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.430
Something that I
encourage you to consider.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.760
Because I captured this
at such a high resolution,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.360
we can zoom in and see
30-micron structure.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.590
Here is again.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.180
First, the original image.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.270
And here it is sharpened, where
you can really see the detail.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.170
It's pretty neat.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.070
So this is our first week,
imaging with a flatbed scanner.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.980
Think about it.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.180
It's not an expensive
piece of equipment,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.300
and if used properly, you can
achieve high-quality images

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.200
without spending an
inordinate amount of time.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.050
In the next weeks, we'll
talk about cameras,

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.550
lenses, lighting, approaches
to imaging science

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.100
and engineering.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.190
We'll also discuss
how to graphically use

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.079
these images for figures
and potential cover designs.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.980
So lots more ahead, and
I look forward to it.
