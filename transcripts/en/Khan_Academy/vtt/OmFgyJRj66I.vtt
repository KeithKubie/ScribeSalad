00:00:00.938 --> 00:00:02.258
- [Lecturer] We've already had many videos

00:00:02.258 --> 00:00:05.075
on Buddhism and its
connections to Hinduism

00:00:05.075 --> 00:00:06.524
but what we want to do in this video

00:00:06.524 --> 00:00:10.964
is more explicitly answer
an important question.

00:00:10.964 --> 00:00:14.859
Why did Buddhism emerge
when and where it did?

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.091
And this is a question that you should

00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:18.503
always be asking yourself
as you study history.

00:00:18.503 --> 00:00:21.251
Why did something emerge,
why did something happen

00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:22.993
when and where it did?

00:00:22.993 --> 00:00:25.504
And I encourage you to pause
this video and think about it.

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:27.131
Maybe you're viewing
some of the other videos

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:31.670
on Buddhism and Hinduism or
doing some research yourself.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.575
Well let's remind
ourselves of the context.

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:39.070
Buddha emerges in northeast
India in modern day Nepal

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.475
at the end of the Vedic period.

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:45.241
Hinduism has been evolving now
for many hundreds of years,

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:47.677
arguably close to 1,000 years.

00:00:47.677 --> 00:00:49.300
Now as we've talked about in other videos,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.621
there's a spiritual core of Hinduism

00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:55.389
described in the Upanishads,

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:58.947
this idea of Atman, your inner self.

00:00:58.947 --> 00:01:02.979
Brahman, the ultimate reality that we live

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.443
in an illusion of Maya
and through meditation

00:01:05.443 --> 00:01:07.129
we should be able to pierce that veil

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:09.169
and eventually break
free from the cycle of

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:11.232
birth and rebirth, Samsara,

00:01:11.232 --> 00:01:12.960
and become one with Brahmin,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.300
become one with the ultimate reality.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.846
But in the time of Buddha there were

00:01:16.846 --> 00:01:19.127
other aspects of Hinduism that were

00:01:19.127 --> 00:01:22.006
maybe even more associated
with the religion.

00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:25.351
There is also a lot of
ritual in the Vedas,

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:29.509
and in the time of Buddha the
Hinduism that he grows up in

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.176
is very focused on the
ritual aspects of it.

00:01:34.557 --> 00:01:36.918
And it was a Hinduism
in which not just anyone

00:01:36.918 --> 00:01:38.821
could do the rituals, it was

00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:42.980
a fairly stratified
society that he grew up in.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.964
We discussed the caste
system in some detail.

00:01:45.964 --> 00:01:48.075
It's still a matter of
debate to what degree

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:51.542
caste is hereditary in it's
actually part of the religion,

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:55.482
but it was a fact of
the culture of the time.

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:59.672
Where at the top you had the
Brahmins who were the priests

00:01:59.672 --> 00:02:01.861
and much of their power came from

00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:04.737
their ability to interpret the Vedas.

00:02:04.737 --> 00:02:07.009
Came from their exclusive ability

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.566
to practice the rituals just right.

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:11.807
Buddha came from a ruling class,

00:02:11.807 --> 00:02:13.439
he came from the Kshatriyas class,

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:16.320
but even they were considered
one notch below the Brahmins

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.660
and especially the bottom
rungs of the caste system

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.102
these were fairly marginalized people.

00:02:22.102 --> 00:02:24.465
And so when Buddha emerges,

00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:26.611
initially in a very privileged life

00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:27.647
he's essentially a prince

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:30.816
but eventually when Buddha sees
the suffering in the world,

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:32.358
a lot of the suffering happening in these

00:02:32.358 --> 00:02:35.554
lower rungs of society,
he looks for answers,

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:39.260
spiritual answers, and is not
satisfied by what he sees.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.103
He's not satisfied by the answers

00:02:41.103 --> 00:02:43.661
that he's getting from this ruling class.

00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:45.663
You could imagine that
he's even suspicious of it,

00:02:45.663 --> 00:02:48.101
whether they're focused on
the true spiritual core,

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:49.644
or whether they're focused on ritual

00:02:49.644 --> 00:02:52.099
as a way to keep their power.

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.348
But there's also another
tradition in Hinduism at the time.

00:02:55.348 --> 00:02:56.841
This is all very important to why

00:02:56.841 --> 00:02:59.886
Buddhism was able to
emerge when it happened.

00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:03.219
There was this tradition of asceticism,

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:04.820
of people going off into the woods

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.143
and meditating and thinking
about the nature of life

00:03:08.143 --> 00:03:10.168
and these folks were much more focused

00:03:10.168 --> 00:03:12.813
on this spiritual core and so Buddha

00:03:12.813 --> 00:03:15.093
initially takes that track.

00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:17.743
He goes and he meditates and he eventually

00:03:17.743 --> 00:03:21.752
comes to a realization,
he awakens so to speak

00:03:21.752 --> 00:03:23.968
at the root of Buddhism is that there

00:03:23.968 --> 00:03:26.559
should not be this stratified society.

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:28.746
That one should not focus on ritual.

00:03:28.746 --> 00:03:30.291
That at the end of the day, you need

00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:33.901
to have a very personal path to Nirvana,

00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:36.841
to escaping the cycle of Samsara.

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:39.420
So I would argue, if I were
to simply answer the question

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.551
why did Buddhism emerge
when and where it did?

00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:44.156
Well if you consider Buddhism to be

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:46.173
a reformation of Hinduism,

00:03:46.173 --> 00:03:49.157
it's important that Buddha was Hindu.

00:03:49.157 --> 00:03:51.820
It's also important that
it needed to be reformed

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.509
or at least Buddha thought
it needed to be reformed.

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:56.636
So it's important that at
the time that he lived,

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:59.044
Hinduism had become very ritualistic.

00:03:59.044 --> 00:04:00.899
It had become very stratified,

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:03.444
and he saw a need to reform it.

00:04:03.444 --> 00:04:05.609
Now there's even a further question.

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.167
It emerged when it did and we have

00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:09.598
some ideas of why that
might have happened,

00:04:09.598 --> 00:04:12.239
but why did it become a major religion?

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.689
One argument was that what he was

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.843
describing was just very compelling.

00:04:15.843 --> 00:04:18.729
You no longer have to go
through this ruling class,

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:19.868
through the priests anymore.

00:04:19.868 --> 00:04:22.633
You could have your own personal path.

00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:24.753
It was also perhaps compelling to people

00:04:24.753 --> 00:04:26.669
who felt marginalized in the

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.905
traditional hierarchy of the time.

00:04:29.905 --> 00:04:32.337
Another argument would
be the emperor Ashoka

00:04:32.337 --> 00:04:34.009
who we study in other videos,

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.137
that once he converts to Buddhism

00:04:36.137 --> 00:04:39.208
after feeling guilty
for his war with Kalinga

00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:40.666
where tens of thousands if not

00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:43.249
hundreds of thousands
of people are killed,

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:44.878
he converts to Buddhism and becomes

00:04:44.878 --> 00:04:47.002
a major patron of Buddhism and sends

00:04:47.002 --> 00:04:49.828
missionaries throughout
the world to spread it.

00:04:49.828 --> 00:04:52.210
So one argument of why Buddhism spread

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.944
is that a few hundred years after Buddha

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:57.483
you have a significant powerful emperor

00:04:57.483 --> 00:05:01.548
converting to the religion
and deciding to spread it.

00:05:01.548 --> 00:05:04.233
Now that leads us to a second question.

00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:06.050
Are there other historical parallels

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.090
to what we have just described?

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.314
And this is something that once again

00:05:09.314 --> 00:05:11.817
you should always ask yourself in history.

00:05:11.817 --> 00:05:14.269
And what's the structure of this?

00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:17.830
Well there's some spiritual core here,

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.367
but eventually you have
the ritualistic side

00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:23.867
as it actually gets practiced.

00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:28.137
And you have a stratified society

00:05:28.137 --> 00:05:30.366
where you have a class that has

00:05:30.366 --> 00:05:32.347
a bit of a monopoly on the ritual

00:05:32.347 --> 00:05:36.180
derives a lot of their
power from that ritual.

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:39.617
And then someone comes
along and says wait,

00:05:39.617 --> 00:05:43.177
this priesthood is more
focused on power and on ritual

00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:45.875
than the true spiritual
core, and they're not happy

00:05:45.875 --> 00:05:48.796
with the answers that that
priesthood is delivering.

00:05:48.796 --> 00:05:52.206
Can you think of any
other parallels to that?

00:05:52.206 --> 00:05:54.169
Well a few come to my mind,

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:55.989
and once again these could all be debated

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:58.109
and that's the fun thing about history.

00:05:58.109 --> 00:06:00.441
I encourage you to debate
all of these things.

00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:03.346
About 500 years after the time of Buddha,

00:06:03.346 --> 00:06:05.821
someone by the name of Jesus of Nazareth

00:06:05.821 --> 00:06:07.937
comes onto the scene.

00:06:07.937 --> 00:06:09.106
Where is the parallel?

00:06:09.106 --> 00:06:11.559
Well you have the
spiritual core of Judaism

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:14.722
that comes from Abraham and Moses,

00:06:14.722 --> 00:06:18.312
but then you have the ritual
of the Pharisees of the time.

00:06:18.312 --> 00:06:19.773
They are the power brokers.

00:06:19.773 --> 00:06:21.956
He feels that the religion is corrupted.

00:06:21.956 --> 00:06:24.381
He sees the money changers in the temple,

00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:26.851
and much of his preaching
is a reformation,

00:06:26.851 --> 00:06:29.684
a reminder of that spiritual core.

00:06:30.573 --> 00:06:32.544
He also tries to encourage people

00:06:32.544 --> 00:06:34.804
to have a more personal connection

00:06:34.804 --> 00:06:36.632
and tries to break up the stratification

00:06:36.632 --> 00:06:38.802
and once again, you could imagine this

00:06:38.802 --> 00:06:40.822
to be a very compelling message

00:06:40.822 --> 00:06:43.251
for those who felt marginalized

00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:45.751
and the parallel goes even further.

00:06:45.751 --> 00:06:48.907
Just as Buddha had Ashoka
come onto the scene

00:06:48.907 --> 00:06:51.397
a few hundred years after Buddha

00:06:51.397 --> 00:06:53.585
to really popularize the religion,

00:06:53.585 --> 00:06:55.708
Jesus has a parallel.

00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:58.528
Roughly 300 years after the life of Jesus,

00:06:58.528 --> 00:07:01.225
Constantine is emperor of the Romans.

00:07:01.225 --> 00:07:04.325
The same Romans who have
been persecuting Christians

00:07:04.325 --> 00:07:07.334
for 300 years, and all
of the sudden Constantine

00:07:07.334 --> 00:07:09.455
not only allows it to be legal,

00:07:09.455 --> 00:07:11.265
but he eventually promotes the religion

00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:14.213
and converts to the
religion and it eventually,

00:07:14.213 --> 00:07:15.420
after Constantine's death,

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.881
becomes the official religion of Rome

00:07:17.881 --> 00:07:19.977
whether you're talking
about Buddha or Jesus

00:07:19.977 --> 00:07:22.269
you have a reformer and then
a few hundred years later

00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:24.423
you have a powerful emperor who

00:07:24.423 --> 00:07:26.924
adopts the religion and spreads it.

00:07:26.924 --> 00:07:28.260
What are other examples?

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.724
Well even within the world of Christianity

00:07:29.724 --> 00:07:32.015
we can fast forward another 1,500 years

00:07:32.015 --> 00:07:36.182
from the time of Jesus and go
to the time of Martin Luther.

00:07:38.644 --> 00:07:39.644
Who at least from his perspective

00:07:39.644 --> 00:07:42.951
sees the Christian church
in the early 16th Century

00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:46.046
and thinks that it has diverged
from the spiritual core,

00:07:46.046 --> 00:07:47.446
from the teachings of Jesus

00:07:47.446 --> 00:07:49.542
that it has become too focused on ritual,

00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:52.663
that the priesthood and
the papacy is really

00:07:52.663 --> 00:07:56.321
more about power than it
is about spirituality.

00:07:56.321 --> 00:07:57.879
So he brings about what will be known

00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:00.146
as a Protestant Reformation

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.863
which is making the
religion more personal,

00:08:02.863 --> 00:08:04.707
not have to go through a priest,

00:08:04.707 --> 00:08:06.286
having a personal connection

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:08.942
with the spiritual core of religion.

00:08:08.942 --> 00:08:11.243
After this video think about
other historical parallels.

00:08:11.243 --> 00:08:12.753
Are there other religions?

00:08:12.753 --> 00:08:14.101
What about Islam?

00:08:14.101 --> 00:08:15.632
What about Sikhism?

00:08:15.632 --> 00:08:17.706
How do they connect to these ideas

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.320
or how do they not connect to these?

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.117
Maybe they're counter-examples,

00:08:21.117 --> 00:08:22.850
and maybe there are parallels in history

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.792
that have nothing to do with religion.

00:08:24.792 --> 00:08:28.665
Maybe it's more about politics
or science or economics.

00:08:28.665 --> 00:08:31.082
Think about these questions.
