00:00:01.216 --> 00:00:04.396
&gt;&gt;Cantor: Stress will make it
very difficult for children

00:00:04.396 --> 00:00:07.116
to pay attention, to focus and to learn.

00:00:07.526 --> 00:00:13.286
But there is a powerful antidote
to stress and that is the effect

00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:16.616
of the human relationship
and the presence of trust.

00:00:19.906 --> 00:00:25.436
&gt;&gt;One-on-one time is a great opportunity
for a child to have with an adult

00:00:25.576 --> 00:00:30.866
where they can feel seen,
known, soothed, cared about

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:34.016
and open up the brain to learning.

00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:35.236
&gt;&gt;Whetzel: Hey, Kumari, how's it going?

00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:36.706
&gt;&gt;Khamari: Good.

00:00:36.706 --> 00:00:38.726
&gt;&gt;Whetzel: How are you at Uno?
&gt;&gt;Khamari: Better than you.

00:00:38.826 --> 00:00:41.656
&gt;&gt;Whetzel: Okay, we're about to find
out. Does that mean you get to go first?

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:49.306
&gt;&gt;Roger Sapp: Generally, a
student who just needs a little bit

00:00:49.376 --> 00:00:55.356
of extra support will be identified
by the student support team.

00:00:55.536 --> 00:01:00.236
They will identify a really good time
that's non-academic, usually lunch time

00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:04.016
or snack, where the student
can spend some one-on-one time.

00:01:04.236 --> 00:01:05.500
&gt;&gt;Whetzel: Who wins at home?
&gt;&gt;Khamari: Me.

00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:08.276
&gt;&gt;Whetzel: Are you sure? Your
mom's pretty competitive.

00:01:08.396 --> 00:01:11.666
&gt;&gt;I have Kumari, who I meet
with typically during lunch.

00:01:11.826 --> 00:01:14.086
He can just sit and talk
to me about his family,

00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:16.356
play a quick game, or play an activity.

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:18.796
&gt;&gt;Sapp: Talking about life, just kind

00:01:18.796 --> 00:01:22.156
of getting their mind off
whatever's bothering them that day.

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:25.366
It really is whatever the student wants.

00:01:25.946 --> 00:01:26.736
&gt;&gt;Whetzel: What are you
doing this weekend?

00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:29.066
&gt;&gt;Khamari: I got a football game.

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:29.850
&gt;&gt;Whetzel: Uno.

00:01:30.526 --> 00:01:34.426
&gt;&gt;Khamari: Like, we'll talk
about like football and, like,

00:01:34.526 --> 00:01:36.426
personal stuff about our life.

00:01:37.236 --> 00:01:39.246
&gt;&gt;Sapp: A really important piece

00:01:39.246 --> 00:01:41.896
of non-contingent time is
that it's always there.

00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:47.336
What our students crave the most
is predictability by the adults

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:52.906
who are interacting with them and, so,
the non-contingent time is not dependent

00:01:52.906 --> 00:01:57.946
on behavior, because sometimes when
a student is having a hardest day is

00:01:58.016 --> 00:02:00.056
when they need that non-contingent
time the most.

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:01.646
&gt;&gt;What did mom say?

00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:03.896
&gt;&gt;Student: "Good job."

00:02:04.226 --> 00:02:09.306
&gt;&gt;Cantor: Finding time with a child
who might be struggling in some way

00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:14.616
and saying to yourself, "I'm going
to meet with that child every day

00:02:14.616 --> 00:02:17.746
and it's not going to be a
reward for something good.

00:02:17.746 --> 00:02:21.016
It's not going to be withheld
if something bad happens,

00:02:21.456 --> 00:02:23.696
but what it will be is consistent."

00:02:24.126 --> 00:02:27.986
That is the factor that
builds trust and connection

00:02:28.646 --> 00:02:30.976
between a student and a teacher.

00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:33.676
&gt;&gt;Whetzel: How do I know it's working?

00:02:33.676 --> 00:02:36.106
I know it's working academically,
his grades have gone up,

00:02:36.336 --> 00:02:37.736
he spends more time in the classroom.

00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:40.566
In terms of emotional impact
with Khamari, he's more willing

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:42.066
to communicate when there's a problem.

00:02:42.526 --> 00:02:47.876
&gt;&gt;Khamari: I feel less stress,
because I could control my anger.

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:51.076
Like, when I get very mad,
I know how to calm it down.

00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:55.556
&gt;&gt;Whetzel: When kids feel like they can
trust you, when they can share things

00:02:55.556 --> 00:02:58.136
that are going on in their personal
lives, they're more willing to come

00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:01.446
to school relaxed like, "This is a safe
place where I know I'm going to be okay

00:03:01.836 --> 00:03:03.216
and I can focus on learning."

00:03:03.496 --> 00:03:09.846
And so when they're more attentive
in the classroom their grades go up.
