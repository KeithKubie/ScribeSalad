JUNICHI MONMA: Hello, everyone.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.860
So my name is Junichi Monma.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.490
So head of with Android
Partner Engineering in Japan.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.680
So today I wanted to
introduce that robot

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.330
and so that is a tightly
integrated with the Android, so

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.240
and also the Google Play and
the Google Mobile Services.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.800
And also introduced
another new SDK

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.820
that is enabling
to the developer

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.960
to making the application.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.970
So supporting to these
systems and also that

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.460
are Android, so
welcome to the Pepper

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.450
to joining to the
Android family today.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.720
So Laurent from the
SoftBank Robotics.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.660
So he will be explain more
detail about the SDK today,

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.840
and also write programming
for that Pepper for you guys.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.080
And then Pepper, of course,
assist to the Laurent

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.390
in this session.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.040
So Laurent, please come in.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.082
LAURENT LEC: Thank you.

00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:10.162
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.620
Hello, everyone.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.740
I'm Laurent, software
director at SoftBank Robotics,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.300
and I'm very thrilled
to be here today at I/O.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.420
And we even brought some
company as I know some of you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.330
have noticed earlier.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.580
So this is Pepper.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.750
He's a humanoid robot
designed by SoftBank Robotics,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.690
and he's one of the first
mass-produced robots

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.930
to serve as a
emotional companion.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.420
And the good news is it's
coming to the US this year.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.620
So we are happy to start
supporting the developer

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.230
community.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.870
But maybe we can let him
explain more about himself.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.800
PEPPER: Hi there, everybody.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.060
I'm Pepper.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.920
It's an honor to be
here as a speaker

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.090
at Google I/O. We have
a great show for you.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.480
I hope you're excited.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.066
Are you guys ready?

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:04.691
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:05.191
Yeah.

00:02:24.074 --> 00:02:27.553
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.234
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:34.234 --> 00:03:36.070
OK, guys, take a break.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.047
I'll take things from here.

00:03:38.047 --> 00:03:39.630
LAURENT LEC: So this
was a short dance

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.600
to introduce you to the
capabilities of Pepper

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.560
and hopefully to
get you more excited

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.615
about what we have
to show today.

00:03:46.615 --> 00:03:47.990
So for the past
couple of months,

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.540
we have been working on
an Android SDK for Pepper.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.220
This is not the
first SDK we write,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.678
because we've been working on
robots for more than 10 years

00:03:55.678 --> 00:03:56.440
now.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.780
But we thought
and we wonder what

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.230
would be the best robotics SDK.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.270
What would make
robots as accessible

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.290
as any other devices, such
as tablets and smartphones?

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.100
And basically, today we want
to share our conclusions

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.630
about this and we want to
show you how simple robotics

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.829
development can be for anybody.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.390
So as you may have already
guessed, our SDK for Pepper

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.730
is an Android Studio plugin.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:28.780
It is already available.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.613
You can download it.

00:04:29.613 --> 00:04:31.050
It's online.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.400
And basically, you can keep the
same tools and the same habits

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.400
you have, because
we basically kept--

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.290
we want to get the original
Android Studio flow,

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.280
because we know you
are familiar with it

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.510
and this is something
that we really wanted--

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.660
we didn't want to change it.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.080
So what we did is
merely adding tools

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.990
to the existing environment.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.915
Tools for robots.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.670
Basically, doing
your application

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.080
is exactly the same
way, but we also

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.940
provide APIs so that, of course,
you can make the robot move.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.990
You can make it talk.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.330
You can make it interact.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.030
You should see what you
would expect from an SDK,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.060
but more interesting
tools, such as animations.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.250
So you can use
preexisting animations

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.900
that we provide with the SDK and
you can also create your own.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.480
We will get to that later.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.250
And we also provide
a chat editor,

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.780
so that you can script
very simple interactions

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.470
with the robot, which
is voice-commanded.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.300
And last but not least, the SDK
also provide a simulated robot,

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.270
so that even if you don't have
a robot, which is probably

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.870
already the case,
you can already

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.035
start developing your own
robotics applications.

00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:50.410
And for the rest,
it is the same.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.870
So once your
application is ready,

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.239
you can create your PKG
as usual and maybe even

00:05:55.239 --> 00:05:56.530
publish them on the Play Store.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.650
So I have to say, we don't
have so many slides today,

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.780
because what I really want to
show you is the SDK itself.

00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:16.415
So on the left side--
you already know

00:06:16.415 --> 00:06:17.970
this-- it's Android Studio.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.130
And in the upper right corner,
you see Android Emulator,

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.840
and the last item
is the robot view.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.120
So the robot view is
basically a simulated Pepper.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.540
And if you install the plugin
for Android Studio, which

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:45.420
would look something like
this, automatically you

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.960
will have new features
added to Android Studio

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.040
to be used with
Pepper, such as, you

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.800
will notice that there are
new buttons on the second line

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.870
of the toolbar here.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.600
So the first one
is just my FD SDK,

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.000
because you can update
them with normal things.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.090
And second one is
to, as I said-- oops.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.940
It's OK, I can restart it--
to start the emulator, which

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.090
will automatically start
the tablet emulator,

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.030
but also the simulated robot.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.180
So we have to wait a little bit.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.650
And I said earlier that we
support animation and also

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.410
chat files, and these are
accessible as normal Android

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.620
resources using
this little menu.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.050
So all the tools we are
providing out there.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.060
And so you can create
robot application.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.250
You can add a animation
timeline that we show you

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.360
a little bit later.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.190
You can create chat topics
or chat files and also

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.200
import animations,
because we already

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.946
provide a library with very
nice and useful animations.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.805
So maybe you can start
with a little coding.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.125
What we wanted to do also is not
to provide the same usual way

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:15.440
APIs work with
service and modules.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.240
Our design is based on actions.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.110
So what is an action?

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.050
An action is more like a task
that you can start and stop,

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.250
and this is-- it really
correspond to something

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.450
the robot is doing.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:31.110
So for instance, a window
draws widgets and a robot

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.460
would perform actions.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.289
So when you create a task,
you can set some parameters

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.350
and then execute the task.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.940
And of course, you can
do it synchronously

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.140
or asynchronously, which is
very important for Android.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:48.260
And getting called back
when the action is finished,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.370
things like that.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.670
So if I take a very
simple example, which

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.870
would be to make the
robot say something,

00:08:53.870 --> 00:09:01.310
it would look like
creating a Say object

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:05.840
and then simply run
it with the parameter.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.362
So for instance, this wouldn't
be [? LOR ?] but [? LOIO. ?]

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.770
Now, I don't want to spend
so much time compiling

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.170
and deploying so we have
already preinstalled

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.960
the sample on the robot.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.910
So what you see on the
screen would exactly do this.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.850
PEPPER: Hello, I/O.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.120
LAURENT LEC: Very simple.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.073
And the robot talks.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.330
So I said that we
provide motors,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.460
because running an
application is not only

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.020
about writing code for robots.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.410
You have to care about
a lot of other things,

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.230
such as using the hardware,
because we have so many motors

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.630
that you really want the
robot to do something.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.700
This is why we also
have animations.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.520
And our SDK allows you to
use preexisting animations

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.818
that our company is doing.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.360
So we provide some
more categories.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.850
Let's say for instance,
action, animals,

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.130
because it will come back
later in the presentation.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.850
Let's say, a gorilla animation.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.860
So this animation-- you
can see the preview--

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.280
you can exactly take
it and import it

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.170
into your project just as
any normal Android resource.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.790
Let me show you.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.130
So we're happy with this
animation, we select it,

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.500
and this is automatically
imported into the resources.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.660
You will see that the
code window has changed

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.700
to look like you are
probably familiar with that,

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.840
this is more like
a key frame setup,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.650
because you can edit those
animations from the plugin.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:11:00.190
So if you look quickly, here we
have the values of the joints,

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.670
so like the different motors,
and we have the positions

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.670
for the shoulders.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.650
And so we can change
it and sometimes it's

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:11.920
not enough to just
set the angles,

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.410
because that could make
very jerky animations.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.360
So we also provide
a more advanced mode

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:23.010
for the people who really want
to fine-tune the animations,

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.040
which look like this.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.110
So basically it's
a nice way to set

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.740
all the tangents
of the animations

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.850
and to control how
the movement would--

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:35.830
how you would get from
position A to position B.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:42.130
So if I preview the
animation on the emulator,

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.190
you can see the robot
is doing something.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.690
And what I didn't
mention earlier

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.220
is you can also connect
directly to a physical robot.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.710
It's just the same.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.780
So if I preview the
animation, let's say,

00:11:54.780 --> 00:12:01.180
I want to change the position
of like the elbow roll,

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.720
and you will see like the
difference in sense and feel.

00:12:10.674 --> 00:12:12.090
Well, it's not so
obvious, but you

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:13.910
can see that the right
elbow of the robot

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.310
is moving in a different way.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.880
So all this can be easily
changed and customized.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.390
And this is basically
how we write the dancing

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:26.620
that you've seen at
the beginning, which

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.720
is more of a professional
way of doing animations.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.776
But again, if you
just want to have

00:12:31.776 --> 00:12:33.970
an application with a
robot doing the gorilla,

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.670
you just use the
preexisting animations.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.170
Let me show you a
couple other ones.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.250
So maybe animals are
not so interesting,

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.280
but when you write
applications and you

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.380
want to have
interaction with a user,

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:59.100
you want to use expressions
like affirmation or exclamation.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.076
[INAUDIBLE]

00:13:01.076 --> 00:13:05.350
You can have more complicated
stuff like emotions.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:10.290
So if he's look at positive,
you know, like blowing kisses,

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.700
because it's a nice application.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.740
Yeah, so this is
it for animations.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.830
And again, this is
very important when

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.750
you write a robotic
application, because you

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.950
don't want only to display
things on the tablets.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.470
You also want to have a
robot that moves and that can

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.798
do a lot more things than
just a normal device.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.690
Then it's also nice if you
can talk with your robot.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.250
So we've seen that yesterday
during the keynote.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.500
Vocal command is so
important and interesting.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.180
So we also provide the way
to write your own sequence,

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.340
like script, little
interactions with the robot

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.310
that we call chat files.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:14:00.960
So I have a chat files
already prepared here.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.150
So I will not go into the
details of the grammar,

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.770
but basically you
can write questions.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.860
And depending on the
answer to that question,

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.840
react differently.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.477
And I will show you that
on the emulator, which also

00:14:18.477 --> 00:14:19.685
preinstalled the application.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.210
And let's say you're
working on the plane

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:25.876
or on the train or
whatever and you just

00:14:25.876 --> 00:14:29.340
want to test what you're doing,
we provide dialogue view.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.410
So here you can type
anything and directly

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:32.940
discuss with your robot.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.810
This is exactly
the same thing that

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.060
would happen if you talk to it.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:41.650
It's just that you are feeding
the text through the emulator.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.887
So for instance, hi.

00:14:45.887 --> 00:14:46.678
Do you like comics?

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.040
Yes.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.960
Whose side are you on,
Steve Rogers or Tony Stark?

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.634
That is Steve.

00:14:59.634 --> 00:15:00.800
And the robot is turning me.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.630
So this quick example
show you that it's

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.790
very easy to write
your own sequences

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.330
and it can be very
easy like this,

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.326
but you can quickly get to
more complicated examples

00:15:17.326 --> 00:15:19.870
and also have
reactions tied to that,

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.140
so starting things and all,
which is more interesting

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:23.970
than just talking.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.580
So all those tools,
again, are directly

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.920
integrated into Android Studio.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.740
You don't have to do anything
else, just installing

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.370
the plugin and using them.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:49.760
So I showed you the
things separately.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.239
Let's look at the more
complicated example.

00:15:52.239 --> 00:15:54.280
But I don't really want
to spoil what he will do,

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.930
so let's first start with the
application, which is already

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.488
on the robot, and then I will
show you how it's written.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.626
Demo I/O.

00:16:09.626 --> 00:16:11.125
PEPPER: This is my
waving animation.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.860
Watch me move and
speak at the same time.

00:16:30.481 --> 00:16:31.980
LAURENT LEC: So
let's show it again.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.700
PEPPER: This is my
waving animation.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.440
LAURENT LEC: So
starting an animation.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.390
Making the robot talk.

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:47.740
PEPPER: Watch me move and
speak at the same time.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.281
LAURENT LEC: Then let's make
him move and hopefully not fall.

00:16:52.065 --> 00:16:53.190
PEPPER: I will sing a joke.

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:54.690
LAURENT LEC: And I
touch the screen.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:58.648
[ELEPHANT TRUMPETING]

00:16:58.648 --> 00:17:00.920
[ELEPHANT TRUMPETING]

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.560
[ELEPHANT TRUMPETING]

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.819
And you have the first
robotics-- elephant robotics

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:08.510
joke ever.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:13.349
So all this, which is
already looks pretty cool.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:16.400
I'm sure you really want
to try it and show it

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.435
to people how you already
have more complex ideas.

00:17:21.435 --> 00:17:23.310
I want to show you the
code, because it's not

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:23.935
so complicated.

00:17:32.315 --> 00:17:34.794
Here.

00:17:34.794 --> 00:17:37.210
So are we not going into more
details about the on create.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:41.490
We create the activity and we
carried or saw it different,

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:44.400
right, because for a few
statements, you will see,

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.380
I want to block and we don't
want to stop the UI thread.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.620
So create a new
thread and you can

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.630
see there is a start method,
which is just underneath, which

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.310
we call the wave method
and the move method.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:58.720
Let's look at the code of those.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.210
So for the wave, the robot
was saying, "This is my waving

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.270
animation" and then waving.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.360
So two lines to
make the robot talk.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.370
You create a say action
and then you just

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.490
run it with the
appropriate parameters.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.910
And then the animation, what
we did first was actually

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:23.350
to import the animation,
the elephant animation,

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:24.820
into the resource
of the project.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:33.040
And once it's done, we can just
start the animation using run.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.590
So yeah, maybe a
more details, you

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.857
can see the line is
Hello animation, I

00:18:38.857 --> 00:18:42.130
import the-- I create an
animation from the resource

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.460
Hello A001.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.970
And then I can just
run the animate

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:50.264
with the Hello animation.

00:18:50.264 --> 00:18:52.180
So if you want to start
a different animation,

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:56.110
we just need to make another
animation from resources

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.600
and just play it.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.370
Now, to get a robot to move,
it's a bit more complicated,

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:10.540
but hopefully we provide
better [INAUDIBLE] still a bit

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.380
[INAUDIBLE].

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.610
What is important is that
the robot is in a 3D world.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.070
The robot is moving
and you're also moving,

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.100
so you need to get a good
sense of where you are

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.250
and where you go and
where things are.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.770
This is why we have
what we call frames.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:29.410
So you have the robot
frame, it's basically

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.190
is where the robot
is, and then you also

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.830
have to define where
you want to go.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.500
So that's why you can
see the few lines of math

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.280
to get moving correct,
but again, hopefully we

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.990
want to make it simpler soon.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.920
So we've just said everything
we want to do and set the target

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:51.570
frame and simply create a go
to object here and then run it,

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.320
and the robot will move
one meter, so roughly.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.240
And then, I don't know
if you remember, but I

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.030
touched the screen and he
played elephant animation

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:06.550
and play sound.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.730
So this is basically,
we have a call back

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.940
when I touch the picture.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.240
And so you're probably already
familiar with the audio manager

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.820
to just get the
sound and play it.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.810
And the animation again,
is a wave something,

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.470
you just create the
animation from the resources

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:26.040
and then you just play it.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.190
So that's it.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:29.900
Like very few lines if you
remove all the boilerplate

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:35.110
code, you can start doing
things that are very interesting

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:38.450
and you don't even need to know
a lot about the robot itself.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.380
You just use the APIs, because
this is what we want you to do.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.120
We want to extract
everything on the robot side,

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.584
because it's a
very complex thing.

00:20:46.584 --> 00:20:48.500
It's not only a display,
there are many things

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.450
to synchronize and resources.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.890
We don't want to
have confliction,

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:53.681
these kind of things,
and this is basically

00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:55.290
our job to give
you the right API

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.706
so that you don't have to care
about these kind of things.

00:21:04.315 --> 00:21:09.490
So, yeah, I think it's about
like 70 lines or something

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.730
and we have a pretty
good animation.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:18.360
So this is just an example
to show you about the SDK,

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.530
but I think it's
not very interesting

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:24.350
and it doesn't leave you a
good idea about-- not very

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.270
good ideas, but we
have better things

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:29.010
to show you that
we've been working on.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:34.090
And we've prepared two very
interesting demos with Google

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:40.880
using Googie technologies and
we want to show you those.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.840
And as Pepper would say,
it's better with a robot.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:49.514
So we'll use the physical
robot instead of the emulator.

00:21:49.514 --> 00:21:50.490
Can you come back?

00:21:53.906 --> 00:21:57.322
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.440
JUNICHI MONMA: Thanks, Laurent.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:08.590
So today we are going to
show that two another demos.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:13.110
So first one is
showing the magic hand,

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.580
we call the magic hand.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.790
So it's kind of a
gesture recognition.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:23.070
So most of devices in the
mobile one, that is still using

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.080
that 2D dimensional display.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.560
So biggest difference
between the mobile devices

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.850
are so this kind
of a robot, this

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.450
can be expressed at
any reaction by using

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.990
this three-dimensional things.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:43.950
So that would be one of the
impressive integration for us.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:49.670
So the other one is we are
going to show that [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:51.730
presence today then.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:56.760
So Laurent, can you show us that
first one for that magic hand?

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.800
LAURENT LEC: Yes.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.390
So we built a demo using tensile
flow that you're probably

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.680
familiar with.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:10.454
And we wanted to use the sorry.

00:23:10.454 --> 00:23:12.370
We wanted to use the 3D
sensor for the robot--

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:13.680
PEPPER: Starting Enchantment.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.640
LAURENT LEC: --so we have
two 3D cameras here--

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.270
PEPPER: Please wait.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:16.795
Let's see.

00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:17.520
LAURENT LEC: --here,
and the robot

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.610
can get a good sense
of his environment

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:20.030
and detect [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:20.420
PEPPER: Please wait.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:20.970
Let's see.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:21.450
Just a second.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.430
LAURENT LEC: And a
more cool example

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:23.555
would be what you will see.

00:23:23.555 --> 00:23:24.940
PEPPER: I found it.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.080
LAURENT LEC: So this
is not really a game,

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.100
but it's more like a proof of
concept using tensile flow--

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:30.590
PEPPER: I found this magic book.

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:31.840
LAURENT LEC: --and
the 3D camera.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.820
PEPPER: It sure
looks [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.320
LAURENT LEC: The
idea is to detect--

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.860
PEPPER: Would you like
to learn some spells?

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.090
LAURENT LEC: --shape of my
hands, what gesture I'm doing.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:38.920
PEPPER: For the
magic signs to work,

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.560
you need to first put me
under your control using

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.630
the spell starter sign.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.440
The magic book says to hold
up your right hand towards me

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.000
just like on my chest display.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.346
Hold it for three seconds.

00:23:50.346 --> 00:23:52.970
LAURENT LEC: So the robot wants
me to do this for a few seconds

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.087
so that it's enchanted.

00:23:55.087 --> 00:23:56.545
So I get that
control of the robot.

00:24:07.939 --> 00:24:11.350
Doesn't see me.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.390
PEPPER: Make sure you're
using your right hand

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:17.229
and holding it in front of you.

00:24:17.229 --> 00:24:18.020
LAURENT LEC: Hello.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.715
So it's supposed to see my hand
and detect the shape, but--

00:24:34.994 --> 00:24:36.942
[WHOOP WHOOP SOUNDS]

00:24:36.942 --> 00:24:37.903
PEPPER: Hello.

00:24:37.903 --> 00:24:38.403
It worked.

00:24:38.403 --> 00:24:40.750
The magic must be strong in you.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.059
Let's see if you can cast
some higher level signs.

00:24:43.059 --> 00:24:44.850
LAURENT LEC: I think
the robot [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:49.287
PEPPER: Next, try tilting your
hand to the right, like this.

00:24:49.287 --> 00:24:50.745
LAURENT LEC: So
the robots now want

00:24:50.745 --> 00:24:51.980
me to do something like this.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:52.480
So--

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.540
PEPPER: Make sure you're
using your right hand

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.473
and holding it in front of you.

00:25:03.473 --> 00:25:04.514
[ELECTRONIC SOUND EFFECT]

00:25:04.514 --> 00:25:05.014
We did it.

00:25:05.014 --> 00:25:07.720
Now, try the same sign
but to the opposite side.

00:25:11.786 --> 00:25:12.744
LAURENT LEC: Like this.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.540
PEPPER: Make sure you're
using your right hand

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.166
and holding it in front of you.

00:25:27.239 --> 00:25:28.280
[ELECTRONIC SOUND EFFECT]

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:28.960
Amazing.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.330
Maybe you should fix the Tower
of Italy, if you have time.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:31.330
LAURENT LEC: OK, so we
see we have some issues

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.850
with [INAUDIBLE] cells
in this environment,

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.149
but you get the idea.

00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:36.940
PEPPER: Wow, you're a
very talented wizard.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.500
LAURENT LEC: Thank you.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.970
PEPPER: I haven't seen hands
this magic since the last time

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.401
I visited my masseuse.

00:25:41.401 --> 00:25:41.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.960
Let's see if you can master
some other magic signs.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.210
First, put me under
your spell again

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:49.830
with a spell starter sign.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.840
LAURENT LEC: So this is a
very interesting example,

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.780
because with like
very few things,

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.710
using tensile flow
and some learning,

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:04.950
you can have a very
interesting product

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:07.880
with applications in real life.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.760
Because if we have
this, then we can easily

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.970
have things like Pepper
understanding sign languages,

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:14.167
for instance.

00:26:14.167 --> 00:26:16.250
And maybe someday, because
right now it's probably

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.110
a bit difficult for
him, but we could also

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.239
have the robot talking back.

00:26:20.239 --> 00:26:21.780
So it would support
a different class

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.540
of languages and translations,
which would be, I think,

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.330
pretty cool.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.130
So yeah, this is
using tensile flow

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:33.480
and we also have another
very interesting example

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.850
using other technologies.

00:26:37.339 --> 00:26:38.130
So I will show you.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.999
PEPPER: Starting a
Pepper trio dance.

00:26:44.999 --> 00:26:46.390
Please wait.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:47.630
Let's see.

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:48.765
Just a second.

00:26:48.765 --> 00:26:49.390
Oh, I found it.

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:50.848
LAURENT LEC: Ah,
wrong application.

00:26:52.722 --> 00:26:53.430
Here's the dance.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.933
PEPPER: Starting
Pepper telepresence.

00:27:00.933 --> 00:27:02.016
LAURENT LEC: This is good?

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:10.000
JUNICHI MONMA: So there's
something the trouble then?

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.410
So next there is a
telepresence then

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:18.140
you may have already having
that Cardboard this time.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.770
We are going to
use the Cardboard

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:23.040
demo with the Peppers.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.570
Pepper has the
video and also that

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.865
another bunch of a
sensory in that robot

00:27:28.865 --> 00:27:32.810
and we are using that
video and also the mic,

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.850
and they're also
sending to those data

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.630
to that mobile devices.

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:41.270
You can see that everything
that's through the Cardboard

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.340
are using that mobile
devices and Cardboard,

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.690
then if you are printing to
that paper to your house,

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:53.190
then you can remotely see
into that status of your house

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:58.862
and everything so through
their mobile networks.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.510
LAURENT LEC: Here we go.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.910
So we are using Cardboard
and basically taking

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.870
control of the robot.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:14.620
So it's not a really
nice environment,

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:18.110
but what would be
great is actually

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:19.870
that when I'm speaking,
the sound also

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:21.380
comes out from the microphones.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:26.912
So I could be [INAUDIBLE]
with my Cardboard.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.350
So this is a very interesting
telepresence use case,

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:41.800
because now I feel like I'm the
robot, which is a bit weird.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:47.310
And this is also-- this is
a very simple application.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:51.240
We are just using Google
technologies and simply putting

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.910
things together, getting
the cameras of the robot,

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:57.910
and just using normal
Cardboard development.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:02.660
JUNICHI MONMA: OK.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.280
Thank you.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:13.450
So this is quite new, and
then just before the I/O

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:17.440
then, sorry for that
some of the trouble.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.980
So hopefully the [? USG ?]
making the more cool

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.610
application and then go
through the Google Play

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.860
and uploading to
the Google Play.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:29.430
So that would be created
another ecosystem in the wall.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:33.400
So you can-- so
Pepper will assist

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:38.670
your life and [INAUDIBLE]
your life, of course,

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:42.580
and that can be given
the more opportunity

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.415
to that the people to be using
these devices in the kiosk

00:29:46.415 --> 00:29:50.030
devices, and also
that any assistance

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.700
for that [INAUDIBLE]
kind of devices.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.960
That would be great
integration to this area.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.790
So thank you for joining
to that this session,

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.660
and their hope you today
are making the application,

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.197
starting to the
application sometime soon,

00:30:06.197 --> 00:30:09.310
and are ready to
that Google Play.

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.060
So thank you very much.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.910
