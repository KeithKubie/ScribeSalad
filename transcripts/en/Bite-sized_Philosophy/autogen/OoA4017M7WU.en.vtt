what's the implication of that better

what's the implication of that better

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.630 align:start position:0%
working out and so the more valuable the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.040 align:start position:0%

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 align:start position:0%
start to take on a positive charge and
 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
start to take on a positive charge and
so<00:02:56.590><c> what</c><00:02:56.770><c> that</c><00:02:56.800><c> means</c><00:02:57.160><c> is</c><00:02:57.400><c> well</c><00:02:57.610><c> you</c><00:02:57.730><c> get</c><00:02:57.880><c> up</c><00:02:57.970><c> in</c>

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 align:start position:0%
so what that means is well you get up in
 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
so what that means is well you get up in
the<00:02:58.150><c> morning</c><00:02:58.390><c> and</c><00:02:58.510><c> you're</c><00:02:58.600><c> excited</c><00:02:59.050><c> about</c><00:02:59.380><c> the</c>

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 align:start position:0%
their goals too because they don't like

their goals too because they don't like

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
to specify conditions for failure so if
 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.930 align:start position:0%
to specify conditions for failure so if
you<00:05:18.410><c> keep</c><00:05:18.650><c> yourself</c><00:05:19.010><c> all</c><00:05:19.190><c> vague</c><00:05:19.430><c> and</c><00:05:19.670><c> foggy</c>

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 align:start position:0%
you keep yourself all vague and foggy
 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.270 align:start position:0%
you keep yourself all vague and foggy

which is real easy because that's just a

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 align:start position:0%
don't know when you fail and people
 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
don't know when you fail and people

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 align:start position:0%
might say well I really don't want to
 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.170 align:start position:0%
might say well I really don't want to

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 align:start position:0%
know when I fail because that's painful
 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
know when I fail because that's painful
so<00:05:29.510><c> I'll</c><00:05:29.630><c> keep</c><00:05:30.020><c> myself</c><00:05:30.260><c> blind</c><00:05:30.860><c> about</c><00:05:31.250><c> when</c><00:05:31.460><c> I</c>

so I'll keep myself blind about when I
 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.730 align:start position:0%
so I'll keep myself blind about when I

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 align:start position:0%

fail that's fine except you'll fail all

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 align:start position:0%
the time then you just won't know it
 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.690 align:start position:0%
the time then you just won't know it
until<00:05:35.780><c> you</c><00:05:36.080><c> failed</c><00:05:36.440><c> so</c><00:05:36.710><c> badly</c><00:05:36.920><c> that</c><00:05:37.130><c> you're</c>

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 align:start position:0%
until you failed so badly that you're
 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.850 align:start position:0%
until you failed so badly that you're

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 align:start position:0%
done and that can easily happen by the
 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.660 align:start position:0%
done and that can easily happen by the
time<00:05:40.100><c> you're</c><00:05:40.280><c> 40</c><00:05:40.780><c> so</c><00:05:41.780><c> so</c><00:05:42.260><c> I</c><00:05:42.590><c> would</c><00:05:43.250><c> recommend</c>

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670 align:start position:0%
time you're 40 so so I would recommend
 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.010 align:start position:0%
time you're 40 so so I would recommend
that<00:05:43.730><c> you</c><00:05:43.820><c> don't</c><00:05:44.060><c> let</c><00:05:44.240><c> that</c><00:05:44.270><c> happen</c>

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 align:start position:0%
that you don't let that happen
 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.630 align:start position:0%
that you don't let that happen
so<00:05:45.230><c> that's</c><00:05:45.380><c> willful</c><00:05:45.860><c> blindness</c><00:05:46.280><c> right</c><00:05:46.520><c> you</c>

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
so that's willful blindness right you
 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.790 align:start position:0%
so that's willful blindness right you
could<00:05:46.940><c> have</c><00:05:47.090><c> known</c><00:05:47.360><c> but</c><00:05:48.140><c> you</c><00:05:48.230><c> chose</c><00:05:48.440><c> not</c><00:05:48.500><c> to</c>

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
could have known but you chose not to
 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.010 align:start position:0%
could have known but you chose not to
okay<00:05:49.520><c> so</c><00:05:49.700><c> once</c><00:05:49.970><c> you</c><00:05:50.120><c> get</c><00:05:50.240><c> your</c><00:05:50.300><c> goal</c><00:05:50.600><c> structure</c>

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 align:start position:0%
okay so once you get your goal structure
 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.780 align:start position:0%
okay so once you get your goal structure
set<00:05:51.410><c> up</c><00:05:51.440><c> you</c><00:05:51.710><c> think</c><00:05:51.890><c> okay</c><00:05:52.190><c> if</c><00:05:52.310><c> I</c><00:05:52.430><c> could</c><00:05:52.490><c> have</c>

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 align:start position:0%
set up you think okay if I could have
 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.850 align:start position:0%
set up you think okay if I could have
this<00:05:53.090><c> life</c><00:05:53.450><c> it</c><00:05:54.080><c> looks</c><00:05:54.140><c> like</c><00:05:54.470><c> that</c><00:05:54.590><c> might</c><00:05:54.800><c> be</c>

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 align:start position:0%
this life it looks like that might be

some suffering and loss involved in all

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 align:start position:0%
of that obviously the goal is to have a

of that obviously the goal is to have a

things considered that justifies your

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 align:start position:0%
effort okay so then what do you do well
 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.820 align:start position:0%
effort okay so then what do you do well
then<00:06:14.120><c> then</c><00:06:14.810><c> you</c><00:06:14.930><c> turn</c><00:06:15.110><c> down</c><00:06:15.140><c> to</c><00:06:15.470><c> the</c><00:06:15.560><c> micro</c>

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 align:start position:0%
then then you turn down to the micro
 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.230 align:start position:0%
then then you turn down to the micro
routine<00:06:16.190><c> it's</c><00:06:16.400><c> like</c><00:06:16.520><c> okay</c><00:06:16.760><c> well</c><00:06:16.880><c> this</c><00:06:16.970><c> is</c><00:06:17.120><c> what</c>

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
routine it's like okay well this is what
 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
routine it's like okay well this is what
I'm<00:06:17.330><c> aiming</c><00:06:17.450><c> for</c><00:06:17.630><c> how</c><00:06:18.260><c> does</c><00:06:18.320><c> that</c><00:06:18.800><c> instantiate</c>

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:19.730 align:start position:0%
I'm aiming for how does that instantiate
 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.060 align:start position:0%
I'm aiming for how does that instantiate
itself<00:06:20.150><c> day</c><00:06:20.780><c> to</c><00:06:20.840><c> day</c><00:06:21.050><c> week</c><00:06:21.380><c> to</c><00:06:21.410><c> week</c><00:06:21.590><c> month</c><00:06:21.710><c> to</c>

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 align:start position:0%
itself day to day week to week month to
 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.860 align:start position:0%
itself day to day week to week month to
month<00:06:22.190><c> and</c><00:06:22.520><c> that's</c><00:06:23.060><c> where</c><00:06:23.360><c> something</c><00:06:23.720><c> like</c><00:06:23.840><c> a</c>

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 align:start position:0%
month and that's where something like a
 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.750 align:start position:0%
month and that's where something like a
schedule<00:06:24.200><c> can</c><00:06:24.860><c> be</c><00:06:24.890><c> unbelievably</c><00:06:25.580><c> useful</c>

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
schedule can be unbelievably useful
 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
schedule can be unbelievably useful
Google<00:06:26.330><c> Calendar</c><00:06:26.810><c> it's</c><00:06:27.200><c> like</c><00:06:27.320><c> make</c><00:06:27.590><c> a</c><00:06:27.620><c> damn</c>

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:27.890 align:start position:0%
Google Calendar it's like make a damn
 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.890 align:start position:0%
Google Calendar it's like make a damn
schedule<00:06:28.550><c> and</c><00:06:28.790><c> stick</c><00:06:29.420><c> to</c><00:06:29.630><c> it</c>

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 align:start position:0%
schedule and stick to it
 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.420 align:start position:0%
schedule and stick to it
okay<00:06:30.530><c> so</c><00:06:30.590><c> what's</c><00:06:30.860><c> the</c><00:06:30.920><c> rule</c><00:06:31.160><c> with</c><00:06:31.340><c> the</c>

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 align:start position:0%

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
of those in a row you just dig you know
 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.730 align:start position:0%
of those in a row you just dig you know
you<00:07:23.300><c> dig</c><00:07:23.570><c> yourself</c><00:07:23.690><c> a</c><00:07:24.050><c> hole</c><00:07:24.080><c> and</c><00:07:24.500><c> then</c><00:07:24.590><c> you</c>

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:24.740 align:start position:0%
you dig yourself a hole and then you
 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
you dig yourself a hole and then you
bury<00:07:25.010><c> yourself</c><00:07:25.160><c> in</c><00:07:25.640><c> it's</c><00:07:25.790><c> like</c><00:07:26.000><c> sorry</c><00:07:26.600><c> that's</c>

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930 align:start position:0%
bury yourself in it's like sorry that's
 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.990 align:start position:0%
bury yourself in it's like sorry that's
just<00:07:27.020><c> not</c><00:07:27.350><c> a</c><00:07:27.380><c> good</c><00:07:27.590><c> strategy</c><00:07:28.160><c> it's</c><00:07:28.730><c> a</c><00:07:28.820><c> bad</c>

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
just not a good strategy it's a bad
 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.650 align:start position:0%
just not a good strategy it's a bad
strategy

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:29.660 align:start position:0%
strategy
 

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
strategy
so<00:07:29.930><c> maybe</c><00:07:30.730><c> 20%</c><00:07:31.730><c> of</c><00:07:31.850><c> your</c><00:07:31.970><c> day</c><00:07:32.180><c> has</c><00:07:32.420><c> to</c><00:07:32.570><c> be</c>

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.690 align:start position:0%
so maybe 20% of your day has to be
 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.660 align:start position:0%
so maybe 20% of your day has to be

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:34.670 align:start position:0%
responsibility and obligation or maybe
 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.190 align:start position:0%
responsibility and obligation or maybe
it's<00:07:34.850><c> more</c><00:07:34.910><c> than</c><00:07:35.180><c> that</c><00:07:35.300><c> depending</c><00:07:35.750><c> on</c><00:07:35.840><c> how</c><00:07:35.960><c> far</c>

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
it's more than that depending on how far
 

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.470 align:start position:0%
it's more than that depending on how far
behind<00:07:36.380><c> you</c><00:07:36.650><c> are</c><00:07:36.740><c> but</c><00:07:37.310><c> even</c><00:07:37.580><c> that</c><00:07:37.790><c> you</c><00:07:38.060><c> can</c><00:07:38.240><c> you</c>

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:15.250 align:start position:0%
and so this is investment time and what
you<00:10:13.550><c> do</c><00:10:13.820><c> now</c><00:10:13.970><c> is</c><00:10:14.180><c> going</c><00:10:14.390><c> to</c><00:10:14.480><c> multiply</c><00:10:14.930><c> its</c>

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:15.260 align:start position:0%
you do now is going to multiply its
 

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.530 align:start position:0%
you do now is going to multiply its
effects<00:10:15.680><c> in</c><00:10:15.860><c> the</c><00:10:15.949><c> future</c><00:10:16.070><c> so</c><00:10:16.519><c> so</c><00:10:17.180><c> let's</c><00:10:17.390><c> say</c>

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:17.540 align:start position:0%
effects in the future so so let's say
 

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
effects in the future so so let's say
it's<00:10:17.690><c> 50</c><00:10:17.810><c> bucks</c><00:10:18.199><c> an</c><00:10:18.320><c> hour</c><00:10:18.440><c> which</c><00:10:18.680><c> is</c><00:10:18.709><c> perfectly</c>

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:19.250 align:start position:0%
it's 50 bucks an hour which is perfectly
 

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
it's 50 bucks an hour which is perfectly
reasonable<00:10:19.490><c> so</c><00:10:19.970><c> if</c><00:10:20.089><c> you</c><00:10:20.209><c> weigh</c><00:10:20.329><c> six</c><00:10:20.630><c> hours</c><00:10:20.899><c> a</c>

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:20.930 align:start position:0%
reasonable so if you weigh six hours a
 

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.019 align:start position:0%
reasonable so if you weigh six hours a
day<00:10:21.019><c> and</c><00:10:21.410><c> you</c><00:10:21.680><c> are</c><00:10:21.860><c> then</c><00:10:22.519><c> you're</c><00:10:22.670><c> wasting</c>

00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:23.029 align:start position:0%
day and you are then you're wasting
 

00:10:23.029 --> 00:10:25.660 align:start position:0%
day and you are then you're wasting
about<00:10:23.209><c> $2,000</c><00:10:24.019><c> a</c><00:10:24.050><c> week</c><00:10:24.140><c> or</c><00:10:24.560><c> about</c><00:10:24.740><c> $100,000</c><00:10:25.579><c> a</c>

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:25.670 align:start position:0%
about $2,000 a week or about $100,000 a
 

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.610 align:start position:0%
about $2,000 a week or about $100,000 a

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:27.620 align:start position:0%
