00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:09.750
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi there.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.380
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and you're watching

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.060
The Developer Show, a
special Google I/O 2016

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.792
on-location edition.

00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:18.500
In this episode, we're
going to check out

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.690
the cool stuff going on at the
Google Cloud Platform tent.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.390
Now, I'm about to play
Query It with Felipe.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.680
And just, before we start,
I'd like to ask the crowd,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.370
is Felipe going to win?

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.190
SPEAKER: No.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.440
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What about me?

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.540
[CROWD CHEERING]

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.160
The crowd's on my side.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.498
FELIPE HOFFA: Get ready.

00:00:41.498 --> 00:00:44.430
GDELT. All the
news in the world.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.640
Everything that is
happening from 30 years ago

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.980
until the last fifteen minutes.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.650
What country, besides
the United States,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.199
was mentioned with Greece
the most last year?

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:54.240
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, yeah.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.652
I know that one.

00:00:55.652 --> 00:00:57.556
FELIPE HOFFA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:58.306
They're close.

00:00:58.306 --> 00:00:59.264
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Turkey?

00:00:59.317 --> 00:01:01.150
FELIPE HOFFA: I think
you may be right, but.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.930
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You're
just screwing with me now.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.080
Don't let me win, Felipe.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.115
FELIPE HOFFA:
They're super close.

00:01:07.115 --> 00:01:08.570
SQL query.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.250
Analyzing all of the
news from last year.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.695
This is a real-time query.

00:01:13.695 --> 00:01:15.777
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This is so cool.

00:01:15.777 --> 00:01:16.610
It's also beautiful.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.976
FELIPE HOFFA: Yes.

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:17.100
I--

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.500
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I mean, the cool
part is how fast it's querying.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.205
It's also beautiful.

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:21.830
FELIPE HOFFA: I do
love this animation.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.020
But to analyze-- analyze
in thirty seconds.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.660
Over a million.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.180
Germany.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.100
CROWD: Turkey.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.400
FELIPE HOFFA: [SHOUTING] Oh!

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.370
Turkey was the second one.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.194
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:42.880
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.880
Now I'm here with Bret.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.360
Still in the Google
Cloud Platform tent.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.344
And we're going to take a
look at the Cloud Vision API.

00:01:49.344 --> 00:01:51.010
But first, we need
to take a few photos.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.370
All right, Bret.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.820
So this is the Cloud Vision
API detecting facial emotions.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.200
Tell me all about it.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.750
BRET MCGOWEN: So
the Vision API does

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.450
a lot of things, one of
which is emotion detection.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.169
So it's actually
analyzing these faces,

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.764
and it's going to
give us a likelihood

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:11.680
of different emotions.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.450
So joy, sorrow,
anger, and surprise.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.814
And it does it by looking at
different facial features,

00:02:16.814 --> 00:02:18.980
so like, where your nose
is, position of your mouth,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.040
position of your
ears, and so forth.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.670
So we can see in
these it's going

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.770
to color it appropriately.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.560
So this is very
likely to be joy.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.490
So you can see that
it's, like, yellow on it.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.876
This is angry, so it's red,
and sorrow, so it's blue.

00:02:31.876 --> 00:02:33.876
So our-- our photos are
starting to come in now.

00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:34.290
You can see--

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.956
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
an angry Timothy.

00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:38.530
BRET MCGOWEN: I would say that
is very likely to be angry.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.850
Surprised.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.200
And then, what is this one?

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.691
Joy.

00:02:43.691 --> 00:02:44.190
All right.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.500
So it's actually zooming in.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.670
And you can see all these
dots are actually spots

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.000
recognized by the Vision API.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.824
So midpoint between the
nose and eyes, and so forth.

00:02:52.824 --> 00:02:54.115
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's amazing.

00:02:54.115 --> 00:02:55.350
BRET MCGOWEN: And there's
a whole lot of things

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.700
that the Vision API does.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.970
It can analyze images to
see what's in a photo.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.455
It can tell you,
for example, this

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:03.470
is a photo of a dog, or
furniture, or a chair.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.870
It can do text extraction,
so you can upload an image

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.860
and it can read street
signs, for example.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.280
Take a picture of
a page in a book,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.806
and it'll give
you the text back.

00:03:12.806 --> 00:03:15.180
An interesting thing is it
can do safe-search protection.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.139
So you can upload an image, tell
you if it's not safe for work.

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:19.680
It's powered by the
same algorithms--

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.220
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really useful.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.960
BRET MCGOWEN: Yeah.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.940
It's powered by
the same algorithms

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.530
that powers Google
SafeSearch on the web.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.100
BRET MCGOWEN: So
you can plug them

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.384
in to anything that can
make a rest API call.

00:03:27.384 --> 00:03:29.050
So you can use it
from your Android app,

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.730
you can use it from your
web app, from your iOS app.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.962
We also have speech API.

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:35.420
Which, if you use, like, Google
Now, and as you talk, like,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.552
it sort of transcribes
your text as you go.

00:03:37.552 --> 00:03:39.010
So we have a version
of speech API.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.590
We've got a prediction
API, translate API,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.840
and a lot more on the way.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.230
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.640
Thanks, Bret.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.806
BRET MCGOWEN: Yeah, you bet.

00:03:44.806 --> 00:03:48.480
