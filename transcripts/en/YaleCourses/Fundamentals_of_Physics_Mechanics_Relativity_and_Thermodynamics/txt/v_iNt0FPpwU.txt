Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay, so what, uh, what problem are we trying to solve? You're trying to solve the problem of masses, couple of the springs and uh, acted upon by various forces on the equation that we need is the following.

Speaker 1:          00:00:32       So this is the most general problem. We looked at this as f sub zero. I may have this, call it f last name. Doesn't matter. It's a matter of this symbols. Okay. All right. Let us first divide everything by him. You write everything by m, then it becomes x double.plus Gamma X. Dot. Let's Omega zero squared. X Equals F zero over M Cosine Omega T. I'm using the fact that the Omega not was defined as the root of k over that. We used to call it Omega, but now I'm calling it Omega not, and you should understand why I'm doing that because there are now two Omegas in the problem that is the Omega of the driving force. So you should imagine, and also the 34th grabbing this mass and moving it back and forth. We'll make an art. It's the natural frequency of the math. If you pull the spring, let it go. That's the frequency which it will vibrate that I really natural frequency. But this fixed by K and M and o may guys for you to decide, you can decide to apply to it. Any force you like have any frequency. So first take the easy case in which the right hand side is zero, no driving force.

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       So I'm saying let's consider a simple case f zero or f f the applied force vanishes. That's the problem I spent considerable amount of time on yesterday. You can say, well, if there's no driving force, why does anything move? That's actually correct. If you look a mass in the spring and it didn't, anything, didn't do anything to it, the solution to this equation, this x equal to zero and that just fine, but it also has interesting nontrivial solutions because you can pull the mass and then let it go after to let it go. That are no forces on the system except the force of friction and the force of the spring and that has this problem. How do you solve this problem? I told you, the way you solve this problem is you make a guess. X of t is some number a times either the Alpha t see if it'll work and you find a little work and you can this in your head. I certainly don't want to repeat all of that. The reason it's going to work is that every time you take a of to Webex, you bring down an Alpha and still keep eating the Alpha t. So when he put that gets into this equation, you're going to get alpha square plus gamma, Alpha Omega Not Square famous, a either the Alpha t equal to zero

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       and if this is going to vanish, it's not big as the bay and it's not because if you're the Alpha t is bigger, this guy in brackets is going to vanish. So that's zero. You all recognize this to be a quadratic equation. You go back to your days in the sandbox when you all knew what the answer to this is. The answer to this is minus gamma over to less than a minus GAM over to square minus Omega, Not Square. These are the roots. Now here you have to look at. So any of it, what does this mean? This means that yes, you can find a solution to this equation that looks like a the Alpha tea. It can be any number you like, no restrictions placed on a, but Alpha cannot be any number you like. Alpha has to be the solution to this quadratic equation.

Speaker 1:          00:04:19       And there are two solutions, so you can call them Alpha plus an Alpha minus. That's been, I branched off into two different cases. Case one. You can see, look, when you do the quadratic equation, do you know the, the way it's going to fall out is depending on whether the stuff inside the bracket is positive or negative. So let's take the easier case. When it's positive, that means gamble. We're two is bigger than Omega, not gamma. You remember this, the force of friction. So we wanted to be not only not zero, but bigger than this amount controlled by the natural frequency. In that case, let's not go into details, but you can all see, uh, you put whatever value you have for gamma. The square root of this is some number. The whole thing is going to be two real choices you get. One will be minus gamma over two plus whatever it is inside the square root, other we minus gamma over two minus what you have in this way.

Speaker 1:          00:05:20       The only thing I want you to notice is that both these routes are negative. This guy's obviously negative because there's a minus GAM or two minus something else. That's definitely a negative. You may be a little worried here that this is mine as GAM while we're doing this plus something, but the plus something is smaller than the minus something because what's inside the square root is gamma over to square. If it did this quadrant of that, you will get exactly gam over to what you're taking away from it. This number, therefore, this square root is bigger, smarter than this number. So the overall thing will still on negative. So why am I so eager that it should come off negative? Why am eager to the rules should be negative?

Speaker 2:          00:06:07       Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:06:12       Uh, no. Even if I had positive [inaudible] workout.

Speaker 2:          00:06:16       Yes, out greater than one. Then

Speaker 1:          00:06:26       one converse to what? This is not a course sign function. This is never going to be a cost sine functions related to either the eye omega t or eat the [inaudible]. These are all real exponential. Yes,

Speaker 2:          00:06:40       yes.

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       Yeah. That's some of the main problem when you write an exponential function, usually people write exponential. It's like this for population growth. Everyone says our problem is that increasing exponentially. They always think of exponential as rising. Of course, it's also possible that if alphabet and negative number, you could write it as a play mc absolute value of Alpha just to show you it's a falling explanations and we have a stomach only for falling exponentials. You got to think, if I pull this mass and then let it go, I expect x to go down from whatever value I had not to keep growing indefinitely. That doesn't make any physical sense and one of the great things about the Union of mathematics and physics is the equation automatically works out that way. It gives you an answer. That makes sense. Okay. So what you get then is a solution that looks like this one number eight times either the one of the routes, uh, plus another number B times either.

Speaker 1:          00:07:43       The other route I wrote them, they are both here, the Alpha t but I write it is minus the absolute value. So you can all see that falling exponentials. You understand if a number is negative, like negative five, that can be written as the minus one times the absolute value of the number. So it is either the Alpha t but I want to write it in this form so it's falling. So this is a case where if you pull the mass and you let it go, it will just relax eventually coming to x equals zero, which is his normal location, equilibrium location. Now how about the numbers a and B? Right now they are completely arbitrary. And another thing you guys should know by now is how we find a and B. In order to find a and B, we need to be given more information other than simply the mass in the spring.

Speaker 1:          00:08:35       Constant, they are all sitting here and the friction coefficient, but that's not enough to tell you what it does on a given day. It wants to know, well, yes it's the masters that spring, but did you pull it or they do release it in this way or that way. That's what the control, the answer their call, the initial conditions, one initial condition is what the value of x at time t equals zero. That's asking you how much you put it when you let it go. The other initial condition is what does the velocity, namely the but the Webex at times you most of the time what you will find as you pull the mass in the release it then it's got a non zero x that a zero velocity, but it doesn't have to be that way because I could have pulled it and release the teak. Will the zero starting to move in words and that's when you would jump in and you set your clocks to zero but at that instant excess of value and the velocity also has a nonsuit about, they don't all have to be zero but there are some two numbers you can pick at will.

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       You can see that if I put t equals zero I'm going to get a zero which is one I'm going to get a plus. B is x zero. That's one condition on a and B. Now we'll take a deliberative, namely find the velocity, then put t equal to zero and set that equal to some pre assigned number. You've got a second equation for amb and we all know we can solve those two equations to find a and B. That's how you fit these three parameters to the solution tailored made for that particular situation. You should also ask another question. Why is it that I can pick these numbers x not and be not, but why not keep going? Maybe the acceleration at time zero is some number. Why is that not up to me to decide? Can anyone tell me why that's not negotiable?

Speaker 2:          00:10:27       Yes. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:34       Depends upon what can I pick the acceleration of a body at will?

Speaker 2:          00:10:39       Yes. That tells you,

Speaker 1:          00:10:48       yeah, I, I'm not sure they heard the exact answer, but it sounds close. Close enough to what I had in mind, which is Newton will tell you what the acceleration of our bodies, namely mass times acceleration is the force and the force. Once it's given in any given problem, which is given by where the body is and what the velocity is. In this example, you have no choice in what the accelerations, but initial position and velocity are not given by Newton's law. Newton's law says if the forest is so and so, the acceleration is so and so, but he doesn't tell you what should be the velocity at a given time. What would be the position at a given time? That's why they are two, three numbers. That's why you have the answer with two, three numbers that you can pick to bring it in a card with these two numbers. Okay. This solution to the equation with x equals zero. From now on, I'm going to call x sub C, but c stands for the complimentary function.

Speaker 2:          00:11:50       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:11:51       Now that is another thing that could've happened here. Uh, which is in fact another alternative. Let me, you can think about what I'm saying. The other alternative is when this gamma over two is smarter than this Omega not. Then of course you have the square root of a negative number. So then you go back to the stage where they're finding the root and they say alpha equals minus gamma or were two plus and minus square root of GAM over two squared minus omega, not square, but that number is negative. So that can be written as a negative sign times the square root of this number and the square root of minus one will come over to us an I in front. So either you will get to real roots. This is a mathematical result. Nothing to do with physics, a quadratic equation with real coefficients. Either we'll have two real roots or it will have two routes which are complex conjugates of each other. You'll learn the notion of complex conjugation, which is the item in the PSI. You can see the Alpha plus Alpha minus have the same reel part minus gamma or to an opposite imaginary parts, so in this example, Alpha plus, it's the complex conjugate of Alpha minus and I've totally, this relationship works both ways. Therefore, Alpha minus is a complex con to get them out for plus.

Speaker 3:          00:13:12       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:13:12       so what's the solution going to look like? It's going to look like a e to the minus gamma t over to either the eye or make up prime t, but I'm going to call this fellow in brackets as Omega prime.

Speaker 3:          00:13:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       Then there's the second solution. The real part is exactly the same. Imaginary part is opposite minus I omega prime t we'll make a prime is a new frequency connected to the natural frequency and the frictional force. That's where we got three Omegas. You've got to keep that in mind. We'll make a nod is a natural frequency vibration. If I have a driving force, I reserved the symbol Omega for the frequency of the driving force. Here is yet another quantity with units of frequency, which I'm calling Omega Prime. So what does this guy look like? The first of all is full of complex numbers and we don't like it. We know the oscillator should have a real coordinate. So you ask, I have not picked a and B yet. How shall I pick them? So x's real well, forget a and B for a minute and look at this number and this number.

Speaker 1:          00:14:26       Do you guys realize that they're complex conjugates of each other? Because I had gone to minus sign. So for example, if a and be able to equal numbers, this would be a real number because a number of pluses conjugate, you kill the imaginary part because they have opposite imaginative parts. So A and B reel is a good answer, but it's too restrictive. All we will demand instead of a looks like absolutely family of times either the IFI B should look like absolute value of a plan, either the minus sized pie, in other words be should be the complex gone to get an a. That means the same absolute value, but opposite phase. I didn't mind doing the complex plane. If a numberZ is sitting there, the complex spine together, sitting here, they have opposite angles. Fine.

Speaker 3:          00:15:14       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:15:14       so if you do that, then you get a absolute value either to the miners gam over two times e to the I Omega prime t plus five plus e to the minus. I may get prime t plus Fi. Now we have made it real. Yeah, and be bought. Being fully real means this five year zero but you see fight doesn't really have to be zero. That is too much of a distraction. Fight can be whatever you like provided the fight that he has, the phase that it has same as the phase that B has. That means the angle in the complex plane of the number eight the number be have to be opposite of each other. This, you guys should know what it is. I've told you many times this is unforgivable. If you don't know what this is, you're the ITA replicated the minus I data over to his core science data. Since you don't have the over to, you can read it as to a either minus GAM over to call sign of whatever is in here, Omega prime t plus Fi.

Speaker 1:          00:16:25       At this point I'm going to change and rotation a little bit in view of what's to come. Instead of calling this Fi, I'm going to call it fi zero, right? Because another fire is going to come in and I want to separate those two. So two times a is a new number. I'm going to call that C and this is the bottom line answer looks like either minus gamma t over two host sine Omega prime t plus five zero s so we had, we had done all this yesterday. I've given you the notes, but I want you to understand where we are going with all of this. If you pull a mass and let it go, it turns out that are two things that can happen. I really wish I had time to bring you these different masses and show you. If you have no friction, everyone knows what's going to happen.

Speaker 1:          00:17:17       You pull the out and let it go. It oscillates forever. In real life, there is always some friction, so let's turn a little friction. What'll happen is what's very familiar, unexpected. It started with an aptitude of five. Go to Ford to go to three, go to rock, back and forth and slowly. It may be around, but you won't be able to see it. That's called a damped oscillation. That's really what's described by this solution here. It looks like a course sign of something, but the number in front of it itself is falling with time and the picture for that look like the following. If you just draw an exponentially falling function, that's your amplitude and you multiply that by an oscillating course, sign it. We'll do this. This is it. Damped Oscillation, but another extreme case, which you may not think about this, if you crank up the friction more, they'll gamma over two is bigger than Omega, not.

Speaker 1:          00:18:10       Then what happens is if you pull the mass and let it go, it doesn't even go to the other side of x equal to zero. It just slowly gets you to zero in infinite amount of time. You understand that if you pull it from here, you let it go. No friction is this for eternity. Smaller monitor friction is slowly damped, oscillation, too much of friction. You come back slowly and you come to rest. These are, there are different cases and the mathematics tells you the different cases. So that's what we like about the Union of mathematics and physics. Once you wrote down the Basic Law of Newton, you have no choice as to where it takes you go where it takes. These are the different types of options. Okay, so this was uh, what I did earlier on in the day, but now let's go back to the more general problem I had with this uh, right hand side, which is not zero. So let's write the right hand side is an not zero x double.plus Gamma X. Dot. Omega notch squared, x equalsF , naught over and m costs Omega t.

Speaker 1:          00:19:15       This is called the driven oscillator oscillators, the present all the time. For example, if you have a swing swing goes back and forth, you may, you may choose to push the swing back and forth. If you've got a kid in a park, you're applying a force, which is an oscillating force. Whereas in the absence of external forces, all oscillations will eventually die down. You guys understand that? Why? Why do all our solutions die down in the absence of external forces? Yes. Yeah. Well, in this case, it's not addresses but friction. But what friction does is that in the presence of friction, you cannot prove a law of conservation of energy. We saw that whenever friction acts, the energy total mechanical energy goes down. So candidate plus potential will decrease with time. So the installations get down. But if you are pushing it from outside, you can provide a constant source of energy so we can maintain a steady oscillation. And that's the problem we're looking at. That is this problem. So how did we solve this problem? But I said, I don't want to solve this equation. I'm going to manufacture it. Another problem. Z double.plus Gamma Times Z. Dot. Let's Omega Not Square. Z is f naught over em. Eat with the Iomega.

Speaker 1:          00:20:42       So let's be very clear. This is the real physics problem that occurs the time. This is clearly not of Auburn world because in our world you don't have a force either. The iomega t all forces in the real world or real, so this is a complex force. If you break down the Edi, Omega, t you all know it's cost to make a tea, which I like. Lists I assign Omega t with. They don't like. I'm solving a problem in which on top of the force I'm really applying. That's the imaginary force put on top of it.

Speaker 1:          00:21:16       So what does the strategy where we've taken the problem and making it worse than it is? Because we have a strategy. The strategy is the following. If you have a right hand side costs, I may get d, Ask yourself what you're trying to do. You're looking for some function. X of t we should obey this equation. You can try various function, maybe excess of cost, sign of time. If it's of course not enough time to deliver. This will be a coastline, no date of it. It will be assigned. One did have a doable, I'm gonna study nor delivered. It will be a course in one day it will be assigned so you cannot make it into your cost side. If it took a sign, the middle guy will look like of course sign. You can try to balance that against this. The end two terms look like coastline.

Speaker 1:          00:21:58       So neither a sign, not a coastline works I turned, so something in between we'll work, but something that always works is the following. If the right hand side instead of being constant, mega t was either the Iomega t you can guess the answer immediately, namely z itself will behave like the Iomega tea because then if I take two diverters, that's going to look like either the Iomega tee time. Some numbers that's going to look like a [inaudible] mega t that's going to look like Edi, Omega t. So the beauty of the exponential that when you take directives you keep getting the exponential

Speaker 3:          00:22:33       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:35       But now the problem is this is not the problem. No one told you to solve this problem, but our strategy is the following. The right hand side has got a real force and imaginary force, the real force and produce the ex that I won the imaginary force, purely imaginary items, send a mega t will produce a purely imaginary answer. So at the end of the day, I will find the answer and keep only the real part. That's the plan. That's going to be the strategy. So that this z a d, this the is going to be the ex that I want and we'll have a part hanging around. Why that I don't want, but why is being driven by the sine Omega t and x is being driven by the constant Manga te but now let's solve it by inspection. So let's make a guess that z looks like some numbers. Z, not even the Iomega t no, it's very easy to take delivered of exponential gets pulled down Iomega every time you see a date of it too. So z double dot will become Iomega Square, which is minus Omega squared. Z. Dot will become Iomega. There's a gamma there and Omega and square is multiplying by a number. So this is what I get on the left hand side and I wanted to equal this on the right hand side.

Speaker 1:          00:23:55       And you're almost there because the time dependence of the two sites that are identical so you can cancel it. And what you find is yes, I can satisfy the equation that's given to me throw wide the numberZ , not the numbers in front of it, or B, is this condition.

Speaker 3:          00:24:11       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:24:13       that's trivially solved because we all know how to get the solution. That one zene art is opened by dividing both sides by everything that multiplies the knot, which happens to be well make gun r squared minus Omega Square less Iomega gamble.

Speaker 3:          00:24:37       So the

Speaker 1:          00:24:38       beautiful property, the exponential function is that you take what is a differential equation, turn it into an Algebraic equation,

Speaker 3:          00:24:48       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:24:49       Because the act of taking derivatives generally is a nasty operations. Science become coastlines. Excused become three x square, but exponential domains, the exponential, that's the property you'd find next blind here. So now we got z not to be this one and z itself. The function. The complex function looking for is f not over m e to the I Omega t divided by this quantity downstairs. This quantity downstairs I'm going to call Ifo Omega I Omega is the complex number. It's got a real part and an imaginary part. The real part is on mega, not square minus Omega squared. Imaginary part is Omega Gamma.

Speaker 1:          00:25:40       It's not a fixed complex number like every frequency of the driving force Omega, it's the different complex number, but if you're sitting at one frequency of the driving force, it is a particular number. Everyone should know how to work it out. We'll mega an artist root of k over them or make has given to you that some real number gamma's given to you. That's an imaginary part. If you actually put the numbers, it might look like six plus five I in the end, the the thing I call impedance that I is just a complex number, but it varies from frequency to frequency. You can see that, okay, now we got Zift. If the problem given to us wasZ , we are done. You don't have to do any motor work. Here's the answer, but we were told to take the real part of this answer because x was a real part of the answer. Why he was not part of the game. How do you take the deal part? Your temptation may be well, eat the Iomega t is costing me got deeper as ice sine omega. Teresa dropped the ice sine Omega t but that would not be right.

Speaker 1:          00:26:42       Why is that not right? Anyone know why that's not the way to get the real part yet? Yep. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:26:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:55       Yes. This number downstairs, it's not a real number. It's a complex number, so if you have a complex number on the top divided by complex number in the bottom, the deal part is not simply the real part of the top. You've got right, the whole thing, so you can clearly separate the real and imaginary parts and that's what I'm going to do next. Every complex number we know can be written as an absolute value times either the iPhone, right? Every z looks like mark Z, either the item data because then it's Margie cost data, which is x plus eight times more designed data. Which is Iwai. Every complex number can be written that way. And what would be the magnitude of this guy? Well, by the Pythagoras Theorem, it'd be the square of the rail part less the square of the imaginary part under roof. Every complex number that you have, we'll have an absolute value, which is that squared with that square on the route and it'll have a phase fi or being the condition tan fi is the imaginary part divided by the rail park.

Speaker 3:          00:28:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:01       I want you to realize that in a given problem with a given mass given friction given frequency board, these are no, there's simply a magnitude of I and the phase Phi can be found by this process. Now write it like that. Then you get FCO over m divided by absolute value of I eat of the Ifi and I got either to the Omega t on the top. I'm almost there. I'm almost there because either the IFI in the bottom, can I put it in his ear? The minus IFI on the top.

Speaker 1:          00:28:39       So did this whole thing becomes FCO over m divided by the absolute value of I eat the I Omega t minus five. No, it's easier to take the deal part because this is constant mega t minus five plus I sine Omega t minus five. These are all real numbers so they're just multiplied the whole thing. But the real to imagine that the separation now comes from just taking the course and part of this exponential and that is our final answer. That's the answer we've been looking for, which is x of t is equal to f zero over m divided absolute value of I of course in Omega t minus Fi. Why did we go through the whole business a complex numbers. We went there because the answer is not a cost center. It's not assigned and may get the minus fi if you know your, your trigonometry is costing me. Got The by minus sine Omega t signed fine. So you've gotten some costs. Omega t has got some sine Omega t and that's why it's hard to guess that answer. But if you go to the complex numbers, it comes off very easily.

Speaker 3:          00:30:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:30:01       So the next thing is to analyze the properties of the answer you got. You can write this whole thing in front as some overall amplitude x not cause sine Omega t minus Phi, and you ask what does this function look like? But this function is obvious to all of you. There's oscillating. Notice that even those oscillating like of course sign, it's not in step with the applied force. The applied forces cost to make a tea. It's maximum on my Curtis said zero to Pi four Pi, etc. This guy's maximum occurs somewhere later. The first maximum, my career's been omega. These equal to defined, so it's said to be lagging the function. You can imagine two functions oscillating, one is behind the other one. It reaches the maximum slightly later. So the first property is in a driven oscillator. The X will not be in step with the F. Would you be lagging? Audit could be leading. Depends on what fires. Then what about the amplitude of installation? That's the thing that's very interesting. How big is the oscillation? It looks like f knife over the m divided by the absolute value of I. Let me write the absolute value of I for you.

Speaker 3:          00:31:11       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:31:17       so the amplitude of oscillation depends on the frequency. You got to draw the graph as a function of frequency. What does the one over this look like? Pardon me? Yes, but a minus B squared and B minus a square. That's why I have not been paying attention. Okay. Yeah, so I'm pretty careless on what I put in, but this is one occasion where I sort of know it's okay because I'm going to square this. I don't have to remember who is Omega naught, who's Omega. I have be very careful that I don't square things like here, but if I'm squaring it doesn't matter. Okay, so go back here and plot something divided by this denominator and ask what does it at various frequencies.

Speaker 3:          00:32:13       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:13       When Omega is zero, that goes away. That goes away. You'll get Omega and odd square and we'll make an r squared is care with them and I claim what you will find initially. Yes, this'll become f naught over k. That'll be the value of this whole amplitudes at zero frequency.

Speaker 1:          00:32:37       I hope that makes a lot of sense to is zero frequency means the force is not even isolating. It's a constant force. What acts are you going to get? You're going to get the force divided by the force constant. That's the extra which you will pull this spring. That's why if you put all the Omegas and masters back into proper place, you will find it. F Not over k. Then what happens is as Omega increases this denominator, one of these guys and denominator, they're starting to vanish if gamma, but a very, very tiny number, but Omega naught equals Omega, you will be dividing by various small lumber and the answer will have a huge rise. Then you can see an Omega goes to infinity, very large Omega. You're dividing by Omega Square. It'll fall off like this.

Speaker 1:          00:33:24       Now, one of the homework problems is to find out exactly where it peaks with. Gamma is very small. You don't have to do much work to know it peaks at Omega Equals Omega and arc, but otherwise he was near that. That's a phenomenon that's called resonance. Resonance is the following. You are playing a force f not constant. May Get t you go on bedding the frequency and responds to your force. The system oscillates the absolute of Oscillation is the largest. When the applied frequency is very near, the natural frequency predict the limit of very small gamma. This maximum is very close to a mega knot. That's called resonance. If gamma is really tiny, you can get greives where it's incredibly peaked.

Speaker 1:          00:34:12       So that's when system started vibrating a lot. That's why I'm in here. Car. It goes over certain bumps. If they're pediatric, they are hitting your cotter and certain frequency and that frequency is anywhere near the natural frequency of vibration of your suspension system. And the car caught begins to resonate. That is his famous bridge in Tacoma that was getting hit by these wins. They were coming at some frequency and by bad luck, they coincided with the natural frequency of the bridge so that as his famous movies made for high school and with the bridge, jostle is more than more than more than uh, twists and turns and collapses. That's another example of resonance. People always say, yeah, I can resonate with what the person is saying. What does that mean? The person is saying whatever the hell he wants. Some people think is interesting and some people think it's boring.

Speaker 1:          00:34:59       It's the same thing here. The forces acting at a certain frequency. If your natural frequency is close to that, your response is high. If it's low, you don't care. Same thing. That's mechanical systems selecting a frequency. In fact, this is how radios work. If you have a radio, if there's only one radio station, you build an electrical circuits in which occurred like select to go back and forth or oscillate at a certain frequency. Radio stations should send signals of that frequency. Your responses will be very high, but what if there is more than one radio station which is the fact of life? What did they do? What they do is each one sense a signal at a different frequency. You'll take your radio and the in signed, well I forgot you could do you know what a dialogue is because you are now there is pushing the some other button.

Speaker 1:          00:35:47       There is a time when you had to turn the dial. When you turn a dial, you're changing the properties, the electrical circuit and changing its natural frequency. You move the natural frequency to the lines up with the frequency of the radio station with one particular station. Then the response from that station is very high and that's the sound you hear. Other stations are also present but you are not near their maximum. Uh, they were there. We are sitting somewhere here and somewhere here. So you want the station frequency to come under this residence. Peak is if you've got a bad radio, it'll pick up sound from any stations because it's not very refined. If the peak is broad, you will get sound from many stations. You want to build a system which is very finally sensitive to the frequency and that requires gamma to be very small cameras, very, very small. You can see if gamma is going to zero, the nominated is one divided by zero. It's going to be infinite. So if gamma is very tiny, one over, very tiniest, very big, and you can get enormous spikes in response. And that's what people need.

Speaker 1:          00:36:51       Okay. The last thing you need to do this problem set, by the way, I know this problem sounds very nasty towards the end. It got tough. You got email. Uh, I agree with you that this, this whole course is somewhat more difficult than it has always been. Okay. I'm aware of that fact and I will bear this fact in mind when you go into your final because for some reason, uh, I want her to use problems not in our book for technical reasons. So I got them from here and there or made them up. They generally tend to be more challenging and more time consuming. So if you thought this is a tough course, well, it's supposed to be a tough course, but maybe not this hard or not this time consuming. So I will remember that in the end of the, when I make the final exam or look at your grade, I will have to compare to you, not simply to your predecessors, but I love to give you some, cut you some slack and then compare to you to previous generations.

Speaker 1:          00:37:49       So, uh, this use of complex numbers is something from which I will not. However, back down, it turns out that yes, you can do all of this without using complex numbers. Why? Because in the real world, everything has got real numbers. So you can in fact by Rgf triganom metric identities solve it with science and course science. But eventually I'll give you a problem. But he just cannot do it in a meaningful way. The power of complex numbers is they turn differential equations is into Algebraic equations. All you have to do is find the roots of a quadratic equation. Whereas what he started out was to find the solution of a differential equation. That advantage you will lose if you stop using complex numbers. And when you do quantum mechanics and second term, a complex numbers are in the equations of motion. The analog of f equals I made, there's an ice sitting there.

Speaker 1:          00:38:41       So you cannot escape the eye. It's there. So I'm saying, uh, depending on how much exposure you've had, you have to do more or less work. But you just got to get used to complex numbers. You've got to get used to the absolute value, the phase angle, how the metal plate them if you already to know it that good. If you don't know it, you have to do more work than other people, but I'm not going to let off on it. Yes, no. Anything you need to know. Differential equations is what I've done for you in the class today. That's it. That's the only part you know and with complex numbers, you turned it into ordinary equations so you have to go over these steps and work them out. That's the part I cannot do for you. That's something you have to do. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:39:24       What is finally missing is that x of t if I wrote for you or they wrote about which is [inaudible], I don't want to write the [inaudible] again. Is f not or what am I? Maybe I will write the whole thing. If not over m divided by absolute value. I times cosine Omega t minus five it turns out this is not the full answer to the question. What happens when I push a mass? Let's understand why. Suppose I go to this mass in spring system, I grabbed it or t equals zero and start shaking. Well, rt equals zero x was zero because I grabbed her. The t equals zero. Well at t equals zero if they go to this solution, it's not giving me zero each saying it's ethanol over MRI costs signed Phi. So what happened to the freedom I had to assign the velocity and position arbitrarily. Well, it turns out that I can still do that. That's because this solution has got a part that's actually missing and the part that's missing is this complementary solution, eh, to the minus gamma t over to cause saying of Omega prime, t minus finite.

Speaker 1:          00:40:37       You can always add the solution to this solution. Why is that? Because of x obeyed a certain equation. If I put that in, I'm saying adding this part will not change the fact that obeys the equation. Let's ask ourselves why go back to the top line there. F X, double dark was gamma is dark, was Omega naught squared x will be equal to if not over him, make a tea. If you put this in now, what if you keep adding? This is the solution. Will you mess it up? Imagine adding this to the left hand side, but I claim on the lefthand side there'll be no extra terms because this guy double dark plus gamma at times. This guy.plus, oh Megan r-squared them. This guy is zero. This is the function which you would say is annihilated by the operations. On the lefthand side, it's like saying the following. If you want to function who's derivative is equal to the sine x, then I miss you. I know the function. There's minus cost sine x and you all know you can add to that at constant.

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       Where do you add the constant way doesn't do screw up everything because the database to have a constant is zero. But here this is not a constant and yet the combination of data reduce appearing the equation act on this to give you a zero. That's why you can add it without screwing up what you've done so far. So the way you do these problems is you first find this function that depends on the applied force and you add to this solution. You get foot free even in the absence of an applied force. Yes. Let's call the complimentary function and this is called the particular solution. This particular solution depends on the force and this is the function. I don't know why it's called compliment. Maybe it compliments the answer. It's it's a Freebie. You don't pay for it with any force but it's called complimentary, but you got to add the two to get the final lands so you will still have, this number's a and fine art hanging around and how do you select them?

Speaker 1:          00:42:41       You select them if on top of it somebody tells you that this driven oscillator had a certain coordinate and certain velocity at t equals zero, so you'll evaluate the whole expression at t equals zero by putting t equals zero everywhere. You'll get one equation in wellbeing, a and fine art and they'll take the deliberative for the Valencia. They said that equal to given number. You got the second equation involving a and find out, you will juggle the two equations and solve for the two numbers and find out, okay, so that is the whole story. Okay. That's uh, that's what I tried to do yesterday, but this is not the first time it's happened to me that I tried to go fast in the end. I lost time because I was not happy with the way it was explained. And uh, I usually come back and say sorry and then do it all over again.

Speaker 1:          00:43:30       Okay. But that is only so much I can do. Uh, the rest is up to you guys. You have to have to do the work and you have to do more problems. Okay. So now we're moving off to another topic or the other topic. Uh, somebody was saying that relief is not very different. Uh, okay. This is, these are waves, but I think it's going to be, look, I think this probably is the hardest point of what we're doing in this term, at least mathematically. Everything else we do, heat, hot water, cold water, that kind of stuff you've done in high school. That's all in near future is going to be a lot easier. Okay. Waves. So everyone has a good feeling for waves. You go to a lake, you know if you're a hit man for the mafia, you're dropping things in with some weight.

Speaker 1:          00:44:21       They go down. What's the first thing they do? Once a body's falling into the water, it's carving out some body of water and diving in. So the water next to it dives into fill that hole, but then the water even next to it drives in to fill the hole left behind by these guys. For you it looks like when the ripples traveling outwards from the center, so this is the classic example of a way. If you've got one example, you can latch onto it. Every time I say wave, so what's the wave in this problem? Yes, that if I drop plot of the height of the water versus the place where I dropped the rock, or maybe I should do it. Pop view here, this is the top view. After awhile you got these ripples emanating from this point or if you kept your eye next to the water, you will find these ups and downs going outwards. So the wave is some displacement of a medium. That's what people say. That's not a perfect definition because we know electromagnetic waves have no medium. They travel in vacuum. But I think for this purpose in this course, you should imagine a way it was what happens when you excited medium.

Speaker 1:          00:45:34       So here's what, here's the way to think about the way you all understand the harmonic oscillator pretty well. White Mass in brings system in equilibrium will sit there forever. If you give it a kick, it'll start vibrating. I don't this equilibrium position that you have to keep track only one variable x, which is location of the mass. The wave is an oscillation off a medium. That means at every point in space that is something that's ready to oscillate. So it's not a system with one degree of freedom system, infinite numbers, big does of freedom because the height of the water at each point is an independent variable. It can jump up and down with time and that's what is oscillating. So if you don't do anything but the water, it'll stay at that height. But if you fiddled with it, you dropped something, you hit it with something and start vibrating.

Speaker 1:          00:46:25       But except this is the vibration not of one variable but if available in space and time x was a function of time and the name we use for the wave, if something is oscillating such as the water measurement from some point x, I'm going to use the symbol sigh of x, the Dennard, the height of the water from its normal position at the point x at time t so x is not a dynamical variable here. X labels the point size, the dynamical available size. The thing jumping up in though, okay no, that are two kinds of waves. That's the longitudinal wave and the transfers wave and we define them as follows. The way of travels out with some velocity, so I'm going to use the symbol v for the velocity of the wave. That's something for which all of you have good intuitive understanding, so no need to mess it up right now.

Speaker 1:          00:47:21       You go to the lake, you drop a rock, you see when the waves get to the shore, you take the distance divided by time. That's the velocity in sound. You know you light up a firecracker after a while you hear it. You can see how long it took and how far you are and you can find the velocity. That's the velocity of sound in air. No, these velocities are all variable. I liked the velocity of light. That doesn't seem to depend on anything. All of that. The cities, depending on various conditions, double last year, sound depends on the temperature for example, or do you can take the following thing. You can take an iron rod, which you know is made up a lot of atoms and you'll take a hammer and you hit it. Here you stand. You basically, you compress these atoms and they compress the atoms next to them and the shock waves travels through this ride that's also called sound that travels at the speed, which is much faster than the speed of sound in air, but it is technically also called sound. If you were to create your living inside the iron bar, you will think of it as sound. Here's another way you can hear it. Um, for example is the standard example. Here's the railway track and that is some kind of a mountain here and you, you're over here and the train is coming here.

Speaker 1:          00:48:38       It turns out if the train lets out a sound, you will, the sound will travel around the band and you will hear it. But actually the pounding of the train on the tracks, we'll set up shock waves in the track that you can hear by putting your ear to the track and you will hear the train before you hit it by depending on the sound coming through the air. Because the waves going through the solid travel much faster. Okay. So I would recommend that if you're going to do this, you do the somewhere here because you want to have enough time to move if you do it here. Okay? So most of the things, please don't do this at home. This would be done by a trained person, but I certainly did it as a kid. Listen for trains before they come around the bend.

Speaker 1:          00:49:19       And you can actually hit it. The track audit in water, that explorations in water, you can hear them fast, that if you're under the water, then if you're outside the water, because the waves travel faster in water, then in a thunder and lightning is the most famous example of something happens in the sky. This light gets to you first and the sound gets to you. You're traveling at different velocities. Okay, so now let's talk about longitudinal transfers. Waves. When I talked to you, I think you sort of know what happens. The ad in this room is have some pressure and that pressure is constant and the pressure is pushing you. The Ed room from the outside is going through your uh, istation count pushing the drum from the insight and the two pressures balance and you don't feel anything. If I talk, uh, the vocal cards move back and forth and the increase in decrease the pressure as I talk.

Speaker 1:          00:50:14       If I push out, increased the pressure. If I go backwards, I decompress the editor. Reduce the pressure though. Shock waves propagate dod year, they hit your ear drum. But the ear drum is getting the pressure different from the outside, but the inside pressure is fixed. So what happens is when I decompressed, the ear drum comes out and it goes in, it goes back and forth and the ear drum moves. Then behind the Ed round might be a little bones and then the bones go and that is some tube and there's not the doctors take over from this point. So some loose Harris shaking in this fluid, then it picks up some nervous things and goes to your brain. Then you figured out, you know, you at least know what the person's saying. You know how she's, your wife is talking to this particular fashion. But you can at least understand and translate.

Speaker 1:          00:51:01       So that's a long chain of transducers of energy from sound to the stuff in your year into your brain. I draw the line of the hydro. I don't want to go on the other side of the head. Drunk cause a very shaky turf, but the part, this part I know very well, it's a sound wave and it's a longitudinal wave for the following reason. If you look at the pressure waves, the molecules of air, they're going back and forth following my hands and the signal from me to you. It's also going from me to you. So the motion is in line with the velocity. The motion of the medium isn't the same direction as the motion of the wave. A transverse wave is what you find in water. If you are on a string, take a string clamped or that. Then they do give it a little flick like that. This bump after a while it will end up here is the rope is moving transfers, but the velocity of the signal is to the right.

Speaker 1:          00:51:57       So do not confuse the motion of the medium with the motion of the signal. Okay. The rope at any given point is either at rest or going up and down, but the signal is going from left to right. So the medium doesn't have to actually move in the direction of the wave. For example, if a bunch of people line up and each one tells the person next to the next person some secret and the secret is eventually transmitted all the way at the end. What does travel is a secret. The actual person in the first place has not gone over physically to the end. So what happens is you are sitting there not doing anything and suddenly you hear something, you pass it on to the next person, then you've gone back to doing nothing. Then the signal travels. That's what'll happen in the rope here. This section of the rope is not doing anything. When this pulse hits that, it'll jump up and down for a while. Then it'll quiet down and somebody to the right. We'll start moving. Okay, so they had the examples of longitudinal and transfers waves. So we have have the notion of velocity. No. I want to consider one concrete example of a wave so you people have a good feeling of how to study waves in physics.

Speaker 3:          00:53:11       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:53:13       so that are many, many waves, water waves, electromagnetic waves, elastic waves. I'm going to do one, I think to do one thing in some depth. We'll give you a feeling for hobby analyze waves. That's going to be waves on a, so you have to imagine that I have a string as being clamped the two n's and somebody plucks the string say into that shape and Lex go, we know the string is going to vibrate back and forth. Let's measure the cord in it. X, which is the point on the string and PSI is the displacement of the string. At that point you guys got that. This is really the x axis. This is not my string. That is my string. Each point is labeled by an x value that it would have the string relax to the normal position. We are asking what is the displacement of the string at the point x at time t society is so new, dynamical Beatty, namely the variable for which we like to write the equations governing his motion.

Speaker 1:          00:54:13       And we want to ask how does cyber 80 but time, what will it do if I started out, what will it do? You understand the parallel to the mass in spring system, the mass in spring system, you've got a mass and you've got a spring, you pull the mass out to some new location, you let it go and you want to know what it does. The answer was Casa mega t no. At every point x, I have some string and I displaced all those degrees of freedom and I let them go and they're going to do something and I want to know how they are all very, so previously we had only one coordinator, which they call x with varied with time. Now at every point x, I have a coordinate side that varies with time and while job is to find the equation satisfied by sy.

Speaker 4:          00:55:05       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:55:05       so let us take a string and the string has to be under some tension. That means you hang some weights on the end or you tighten it with some screws. That's attention, tension so that the string is willing to dying to break apart. If you cut it to a t. T is the tension on the string without detention? Uh, none, none of this will work. So he had a string.

Speaker 4:          00:55:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:27       And I'm going to analyze the fate of assignee. Tiny segment of length. DX. An essential it did here is called [inaudible], which is the mass, but unit length. That means you put the string on a weighing machine, you find a mass and you divided by the length. For example, if you've got a 10 meters ring and it weighs a one 10th of a kilogram, then the masculine it link is one over thousand kilograms per meter. And t is the tension. The textbook may use F for tension because t is the time period also. So it depends on what symbol they use in the book. I'm not completely sure I'm going to call it t because it's been called tea in the past. Now I pulled this and I want to know what the whole string we'll do. Who is going to tell me now, man, I mean, what authority will decide the behavior of the strings? What do we have to appeal to?

Speaker 2:          00:56:38       Yes. Pardon me.

Speaker 1:          00:56:47       Very good. So he said, find the force that will return it to the original position. And what was the issue that you mentioned?

Speaker 2:          00:56:55       Pardon me.

Speaker 1:          00:56:59       Right. But, uh, we are going to apply. Yes. Any other answers before they go? Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:57:05       Modeled the emotion of the story by saying that by pretending that just using some point in and being like, this is, the motion is just the same as if we had a, uh, a us, us, us, mass on sprint and it's oscillating back and forth.

Speaker 1:          00:57:23       Yeah. It will look like that. That is correct. But you all, I want you to understand this, that are no new laws that I'm going to invoke. I'm not going to say, well, we just started master's in spring. Today's time to study strings and I'm going to tell you a new law of motion. There's only one law of motion that is f equals m. A. The whole purpose of my exercise now is to show you that really does control that way. It's Super Law. Everything mechanical follows from that law and I want to show you ethicals mas all I have and I got to use it properly. That's going to tell me what the string will do. So what I do is the string is of course a long and extended and complicated object. I isolate a portion of it of lengthy x and I'm going to apply ethical CMA to that guy. All I need to know is the f the total force on it and I'm going to eat better to mass times acceleration. Okay. Now this force on this little segment is the tension pulling this way, the same tension pulling that way, the tension on the string, it doesn't change from point to point, but the angle at which it is pulling is not necessarily the same. Here, there is some angle theta plus Delta data and here there is an angle data.

Speaker 1:          00:58:43       This force is at an angle to say Tara below the horizontal, this pulling about a plus delta data, so the string is curving. Therefore the the tangent to the string at this end and that end are not quite the same and that's the key because if they were exactly the same, the same tension on the two ends. If you take any object like this and apply exactly the same force, they will cancel because the opposite forces andF is zero and may will be zero and this thing won't move. The reason that moves is because even though the magnitude of the force is the same, the angle at which is acting is not the same. So I'm going to find out the component of the force here and take the difference from there. It's the force here we'd be tee times sine theta plus Delta Theta. Theta is the angle with the horizontal and the force of the other side will be tee times. Sine Theta. Theta is the angle made by the string from the horizontal and that angle is some changing over this tiny lane.

Speaker 3:          00:59:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:51       Next approximation. That's the force that's going to be mass times acceleration. Mass up this little segment. Is the mass per unit length times the length of the segment? No. What is the acceleration in the language of Calculus? What does the acceleration here? Pardon me. Ah, he said deep two x over Dt Square, but the d by Dt squared is right. It's not d two of x off side because you've got to understand, I think, look, this was not fair trick, but you have to be aware that what is oscillating up and down is the coordinate. I X is not a real dynamical court in excess. A label on the string. What? Jumping up and down the PSI, so the acceleration, the second bit of it, and I write partial derivative because psych can vary with X. Audit can vary with time and I want to take the second time did have it.

Speaker 3:          01:00:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:50       Now come to the lefthand side and you assume the angles involved. Very small. The angles involved are very small. I remind you guys at the following identity, sine theta begins sustained up plus.dot dot. You remember the CTSA award for you? Of course signed data is one minus data squared over two and we have decided that we are going to treat data is so small that data square, we're not interested and 10 data which is [inaudible] is now state over one. We just stayed up. So small angle approximation is scientists though approximately equal potato corn sainted approximately equal to one 10 data maybe approximately the place might data. So first nice break. We don't have to work with sign with just one t of data plus Delta Theta minus that which is dealt at data.

Speaker 3:          01:01:48       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:01:49       Delta Theta is a change in the angle from the left end of the string bit to the right end of the string bean. No, I got a d x here, so what I'm going to do is divide by a dx and multiplied by the x. We are almost there in did I in the equation? I look, I've been calling a dx and Delta x so pardon that? Just call it, uh, just dx. You the x, the two PSI over Dt Square. Now what does the data, I'm going to say data is the same as Stan data in the small angle approximation. Tamp data is these side the x, you know from the calculus, if you're more horizontally by DX, a new move vertically by the PSI. These ideas is the Tan of the angle. That's one of the first things you learned in calculus. So this is really de by Dx of these IDX that becomes deep.

Speaker 1:          01:02:58       Two PSI over dx squared equals the mew, the two psi over Dt Square. Now some of you may find the derivation heart, then forget about the details. You're not responsible for that. But some of you may say, look, I don't ever want you to tell me something which you cannot prove unless it's an axiom or the law of nature. But this is not a new law of nature. So I have to tell you where I got this. I got this by applying f equals m a tiny portion of the string. And you can ask yourself, when you pull a string up, why does it come down? It comes down because there's a tension on the string and the tension here and the tension here have vertical components that don't quite match. You see the string is flattening out like this. The vertical downward component of this is bigger than the vertical upward component of this force.

Speaker 1:          01:03:53       If it resolve it, the vertical, horizontal part, the downward part is bigger than the upward part in this picture that there's a net force bringing you down. But I'm not bringing you down is because the deliberative here and here are not the same because the derivative is the slope. So the whole thing depends on the rate of change of the rate of change and that's why you get this. But the mass of the tiny segment also depends on dx. So dx cancels in the end, you drop it and you get this equation. So what I want you to think of is dictated. DX is really d by the x of these IDX. And but I should actually use partial data with this because I depends on x, empty. So if you a little careful with that, you get d two Psi over DP Square. So now I'm going to write down the final wave equation. From this point on, you have to get engaged in the problem because you, even though you may or may not follow the derivation, you should know what is called the wave equation. This is the way we equation d two PSI over. DX squared is equal to one over v Square, d two Psi or d p square, but v square is equal to t over a meal or to be the square root of p over me. I just invented a symbol [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:05:27       This is very important. What do you have to know is that Cy, the displacement of the string at the point caught labeled x horizontally from the left hand at the time t varies with time according to this equation. This is a very famous equation and it turns out you take any elastic medium and you are disturbed a little bit from equilibrium, always seems to be patients of this type. So our job from now till sometime is to analyze the equation and see what it means, what are the consequences of this wave equation. And even though I call it d, it has UNICEF velocity, I have no right to argue that it really is the velocity of the wave. We'll have to find out it got dimensions of velocity. You can check by putting the units yet. Okay, but now let me write down a solution to this equation. Then we will understand what can happen. So this is like saying I got some equation, second database to Webex.

Speaker 4:          01:06:33       Yeah

Speaker 1:          01:06:36       is equal to some number claims, sex and we set the answer this constantly got tea and sine Omega t but nobody got secondary to the perspective space. Second did it with respect to time and I know that this guy is going to oscillate up and down, but he's going to oscillate. If you imagine a string, if you take a string out of waterway, which is traveling back and forth, the triplets at traveling, if you took a snapshot of the way at a given time, it'll be going up and down in space. Artifice stored at one point in the water and have the wave go past you. The water will go up and down in time at a given space. I understand it. The waves coming towards the shore. Do you stand in one place? You don't. You don't have to move the way we'll go past you and Brad you are.

Speaker 1:          01:07:23       The water will go up and down with time art. If you took a picture of it at one instant, the way it will go up and down in space at a given time. So waves oscillate in space and time and you have to guess the answer. Now if I had more time I can tell you guys how did they use the answer is not very hard but I just don't have that kind of time so I'm going to just write down his solution and in fact there are many, many solution to the equation. It's very general. So I'm going read a particular solution. The solution I'm going to write down, it looks like this is some number which to the amplitude and it looks like cause sign some number called k times x minus Omega T. Unfortunately this case not a force constant. It is some new symbol and Omega is another symbol who's meeting we will deduce shortly.

Speaker 3:          01:08:17       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:08:17       at least you can see that I just cannot right away of like x minus t or something cause of course should have an argument with this nor dimensions, so if I have an ex I should multiply multiplied by some number that's got units of inverse x and if I have a time I should multiply by something that looks like a frequency from dimensional analysis. I look for a solution of this foreign to these equations. Once again, whether you saw this is by the way is called a partial differential equation because it involves partial [inaudible]. All I'm going to be doing, I'm going to be content with this showing you that this solution when I stick it into this equation actually works. Let us first verify that it works. Then it will come next Monday and analyze in detail what does this really do? We'll come to that in a moment. Let's verify that it works. So let's take this IDX. What happens when you take these IDX? When you take a partial, a little bit of an x, it says, forget about time, treat x as the only variable. Then you will get minus a sign k, x minus Omega t times or did I bet too of what's inside the argument, which happens to be key knife. You differentiate the second time the two side, the x square, you do the whole thing again and then you'll get minus a k square sign. K X minus Omega t

Speaker 1:          01:09:45       I'm sorry. Yes, thank you. No, you should take d two psy d t square. You would get minus Omega squared, a uh, course sign, k x minus Omega t. You could take one over v squared times that you would get this.

Speaker 3:          01:10:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:10:07       What does the wave equation say? It says the secondary way to have an x should be one of [inaudible] to the second derivative in time and for my solution, that's a second. Did a bit of an ex that a second time. I want them to match. Well, they're almost there. A matches. The cost matches the cost, but Omega and care not independent numbers or may go over to v should be equal to k. In other words, this wave equation for waves on a string, we'll have solutions that look like this where it can be any number you like k and Omega between the two of them. That is one degree of freedom. You can pick k at will and pick Omega so that Omega equals kv pick Omega freely and choose case or that case we'll make a over B but that is a relation between the two of them, which you can write in any number of ways. So let us put that knowledge back into the solution. Let us say omega is in fact kv so that the write that explicitly in terms of the CAE, which is completely free to sign now looks like a cause k times x minus I hear is about you guys gotta do a little mental Algebra here. If I pull the key out, can you see the tea? Will be multiplied by Omega over k but Omega over case v.

Speaker 3:          01:11:38       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:11:40       so this is my solution. It costs k x minus V t and that is a very pretty result and I just, I will conclude by telling you what that is telling. It stays the CFX t which depends on x and depends on ti depends on x and t through this combination. X minus bt. Other words, if I explained this a bt has a certain value science, a certain value. If I change x and if I change t keeping x minus vd constant, the function doesn't change, right? Because it's functionally of this combination. I will argue that that really means it's the way of this traveling at a velocity v.

Speaker 1:          01:12:28       Let me show you why. Let's take a function e to the minus x squared. You must've seen this function in statistics. It looks like this. It likes to have x equals zero take the function that exited, he placed by x minus v. T where does this function? Habits maximum you'd has the maximum when this guy on top vanishes that just say when x equal to Vt. So if you took the function, either the x minus V t square, the minus sign [inaudible] be here at at that time it'll be here, but at every instant the bump, we'll be moving to the right. You can see with the Velocity v because the peak is at a location VT, so in a way of the whole profile, what was it, the velocity and therefore this symbol we use here is in fact the velocity of the wave.

Speaker 1:          01:13:25       Well, maybe I'll give you one extreme example. Arctic will the zero. It just looks like co was k x and we all know what costs and Kx looks like. It's got a maximum at x equal to zero. If you wait a little longer had is that bad? Is this maximum little later increased x a little bit. If you increased time a little bit, you've got increased x a little bit so that these two still cancel each other. Originally, experts at zero and t was a zero. You're at a maximum little later after some time built a t. If you go to the point delta x so that these two numbers cancel, you're still writing the maximum, but that means the delta x over Delta t is v. That means if you moved to the right after same delta t you would ride the, that means the crest is moving at the Velocity v so I think to summarize what I've shown you so far is that when you take a string and you, I have attention on it, you pull it and let it go.

Speaker 1:          01:14:22       It vibrates according to this equation that the first statement, this is a solution. I'm not telling you it's the most gentle one or the only one that anything I want to start at least have one concrete solution and I'm not told you yet how to visualize the function or I have told you whatever the function is, it is drifting to the right at a speed that we call me because any function of x minus VT has a property that if it did something at x equals zero. It does the same thing that x equals the Vt. That means the whole shape is bodily transported to the right. So this really signifies a wave traveling to the right. If you wanted a way of traveling to the left, we should put a plus sign here. Then we'll go backwards.
