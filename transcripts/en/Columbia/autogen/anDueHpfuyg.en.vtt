00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.639
 
okay so that's the second order cross

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649
okay so that's the second order cross
 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.280
okay so that's the second order cross
partial and so I simply defined this

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290
partial and so I simply defined this
 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.339
partial and so I simply defined this
quantity this way you would work that

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:16.349
quantity this way you would work that
 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:26.950
quantity this way you would work that
out if that quantity is positive and

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960
 
 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.339
 
this is the second derivative with

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349
this is the second derivative with
 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.380
this is the second derivative with
respect to X if that's positive then the

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390
respect to X if that's positive then the
 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.180
respect to X if that's positive then the
function has a relative minimum at that

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
function has a relative minimum at that
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.619
function has a relative minimum at that
point okay if that quantity D is

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629
point okay if that quantity D is
 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.810
point okay if that quantity D is
positive and the cross and the second

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820
positive and the cross and the second
 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.580
positive and the cross and the second
second partial derivative with respect

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590
second partial derivative with respect
 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.580
second partial derivative with respect
to X is negative then it has a relative

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
to X is negative then it has a relative
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.970
to X is negative then it has a relative
maximum okay if this quantity is

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980
maximum okay if this quantity is
 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.700
maximum okay if this quantity is
negative then this has neither a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710
negative then this has neither a
 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.740
negative then this has neither a
relative maximum nor a relative minimum

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
relative maximum nor a relative minimum
 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.490
relative maximum nor a relative minimum
at that point it could be a saddle point

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500
at that point it could be a saddle point
 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.899
at that point it could be a saddle point
okay and if it's zero then we actually

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909
okay and if it's zero then we actually
 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.719
okay and if it's zero then we actually
don't know anything about that those

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729
don't know anything about that those
 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.690
don't know anything about that those
critical points okay and this is sort of

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
critical points okay and this is sort of
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.800
critical points okay and this is sort of
a pathological case where the crowd

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810
a pathological case where the crowd
 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.130
a pathological case where the crowd
these quantities are exactly offsetting

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140
these quantities are exactly offsetting
 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.800
these quantities are exactly offsetting
that quantity which would be unusual

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810
 
 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.060
 
okay

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070
 
 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.690
 
okay so that is that's everything on

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700
okay so that is that's everything on
 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.190

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550
second but before I do that how is
 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.719

everyone feeling comfortable okay you're

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729
everyone feeling comfortable okay you're
 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:12.790
everyone feeling comfortable okay you're
ready to jump into a integration okay so

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800
 
 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.449
 
there are two fundamental calculus

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459
there are two fundamental calculus
 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.729

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739
problems that people for millennia have
 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.070
problems that people for millennia have
been trying to solve and have succeeded

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080
been trying to solve and have succeeded
 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.620

in solving of course but with calculus
 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.670
in solving of course but with calculus
but the two fundamental problems are one

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680
but the two fundamental problems are one
 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.840

what we've been doing till now the other

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070
what we've been doing till now the other
 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.630

out that the problem of finding the area

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579
out that the problem of finding the area
 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.009
out that the problem of finding the area

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650
at a particular point okay so whoops
 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.440

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450
sorry so finding the area of a region
 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.319
sorry so finding the area of a region

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329
under a curve how has it been done in
 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.560
under a curve how has it been done in
the absence of calculus well you could

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570
the absence of calculus well you could
 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.710
the absence of calculus well you could
draw the curve for example

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720
 
 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:45.670
 
this curve here

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680
 
 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.009
 
you could draw this curve and you could

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019
you could draw this curve and you could
 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.059
you could draw this curve and you could
approximate the area under this curve

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069
approximate the area under this curve
 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.280
approximate the area under this curve
for example simply by drawing a whole

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290
for example simply by drawing a whole
 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.569
for example simply by drawing a whole
bunch of actually the way a better

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579
bunch of actually the way a better
 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:25.420
bunch of actually the way a better
approximation would be excuse me

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430
 
 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.250
 
is to take a bunch of rectangles that

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260
is to take a bunch of rectangles that
 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.730
is to take a bunch of rectangles that
approximate the area under that curve

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740
approximate the area under that curve
 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.470
approximate the area under that curve
you know how to compute the area for

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480
you know how to compute the area for
 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.380
you know how to compute the area for
rectangle it's simply the length times

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390
rectangle it's simply the length times
 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.160
rectangle it's simply the length times
the width so you'd work out the area of

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170
the width so you'd work out the area of
 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.920
the width so you'd work out the area of
each rectangle and then some the area's

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930
each rectangle and then some the area's
 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.860
each rectangle and then some the area's
over all those rectangles right so you

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870
over all those rectangles right so you
 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.380
over all those rectangles right so you
could certainly do that and that was the

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390
could certainly do that and that was the
 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:59.090
could certainly do that and that was the
method by which the the definite and

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100
method by which the the definite and
 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.310
method by which the the definite and
indefinite integrals were actually

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320
indefinite integrals were actually
 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.960
indefinite integrals were actually
arrived at summing these areas is known

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970
arrived at summing these areas is known
 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:24.860
arrived at summing these areas is known
as a remind them okay Riemann sum and it

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870
as a remind them okay Riemann sum and it
 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.909
as a remind them okay Riemann sum and it
turns out that the integral or the

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919
turns out that the integral or the
 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:36.730
turns out that the integral or the
antiderivative is simply the limit of

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740
antiderivative is simply the limit of
 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:43.219
antiderivative is simply the limit of
the sum of these rectangles as the width

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229
the sum of these rectangles as the width
 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.550
the sum of these rectangles as the width
of each of these rectangles goes to zero

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560
of each of these rectangles goes to zero
 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.700
of each of these rectangles goes to zero
so of course if you reduced the width of

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710
so of course if you reduced the width of
 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.060
so of course if you reduced the width of
these rectangles you'd have many more

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070
these rectangles you'd have many more
 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.940
these rectangles you'd have many more
rectangles to compute many more smaller

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950
rectangles to compute many more smaller
 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.760
rectangles to compute many more smaller
rectangles and your approximation would

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770
rectangles and your approximation would
 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.159
rectangles and your approximation would
get closer and closer to the actual area

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169
get closer and closer to the actual area
 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.020
get closer and closer to the actual area
under the curve because of course your

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030
under the curve because of course your
 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.500
under the curve because of course your
errors are all here where you're

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510
errors are all here where you're
 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.170
errors are all here where you're
estimating too much here too little here

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180
estimating too much here too little here
 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.510
estimating too much here too little here
and so on right so the narrower your

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520
and so on right so the narrower your
 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.140
and so on right so the narrower your
rectangle they're more precise your

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150
rectangle they're more precise your
 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:21.290
rectangle they're more precise your
approximation and if the width of these

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300
approximation and if the width of these
 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.850
approximation and if the width of these
rectangles go to 0 then the limit of the

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860
rectangles go to 0 then the limit of the
 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.140
rectangles go to 0 then the limit of the
sum of these areas the limit of the

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150
sum of these areas the limit of the
 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.390
sum of these areas the limit of the
Riemann sum will go to the integral okay

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400
Riemann sum will go to the integral okay
 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.730
Riemann sum will go to the integral okay
so keep in mind we

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740
so keep in mind we
 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.650
so keep in mind we
talked about the derivative the

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660
talked about the derivative the
 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.110
talked about the derivative the
derivative itself was a limit that we

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120
derivative itself was a limit that we
 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.279
derivative itself was a limit that we
were talking about a limit of the slope

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:49.289
were talking about a limit of the slope
 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:56.450
were talking about a limit of the slope
of a secant line as the distance as some

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460
of a secant line as the distance as some
 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.570
of a secant line as the distance as some
increment Delta went to zero okay so

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580
increment Delta went to zero okay so
 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.950
increment Delta went to zero okay so
similarly the integral is derived

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960
similarly the integral is derived
 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:11.300
similarly the integral is derived
through a limit okay now so the

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310
through a limit okay now so the
 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.110
through a limit okay now so the
derivative was a slope it's the rate at

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120
derivative was a slope it's the rate at
 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.050
derivative was a slope it's the rate at
which the function f is changing with

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060
which the function f is changing with
 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.050
which the function f is changing with
respect to changes in the variable X the

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060
respect to changes in the variable X the
 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.580
respect to changes in the variable X the
rise over the run sometimes we know the

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.590
rise over the run sometimes we know the
 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.520
rise over the run sometimes we know the
rate of change but we don't know the

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.530
rate of change but we don't know the
 

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:33.499
rate of change but we don't know the
function itself okay it turns out that

00:07:33.499 --> 00:07:33.509
function itself okay it turns out that
 

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:36.589
function itself okay it turns out that
when we do that when when we have that

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599
when we do that when when we have that
 

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:38.480
when we do that when when we have that
situation we're really looking for the

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:38.490
situation we're really looking for the
 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.670
situation we're really looking for the
integral for a moment let's talk about

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680
integral for a moment let's talk about
 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.469
integral for a moment let's talk about
the antiderivative think of the

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479
the antiderivative think of the
 

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.930
the antiderivative think of the
antiderivative not as the integral but

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940
antiderivative not as the integral but
 

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:50.029
antiderivative not as the integral but
simply as the what you get if you

00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039
simply as the what you get if you
 

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:52.189
simply as the what you get if you
reverse the process of finding the

00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199
reverse the process of finding the
 

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:55.219
reverse the process of finding the
derivative right to find the derivative

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:55.229
derivative right to find the derivative
 

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:59.060
derivative right to find the derivative
you applied some rule if you had a

00:07:59.060 --> 00:07:59.070
you applied some rule if you had a
 

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.670
you applied some rule if you had a
polynomial you used the power function

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680
polynomial you used the power function
 

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.180
polynomial you used the power function
rule so you had x squared you took the

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:05.190
rule so you had x squared you took the
 

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:09.920
rule so you had x squared you took the
derivative you got 2x now if you are

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:09.930
derivative you got 2x now if you are
 

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.870
derivative you got 2x now if you are
faced with some function I want you to

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:11.880
faced with some function I want you to
 

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.540
faced with some function I want you to
reverse the rules of differentiation to

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:14.550
reverse the rules of differentiation to
 

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.300
reverse the rules of differentiation to
get the antiderivative the opposite of

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:17.310
get the antiderivative the opposite of
 

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:22.580
get the antiderivative the opposite of
the derivative right so suppose FX is a

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:22.590
the derivative right so suppose FX is a
 

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:27.320
the derivative right so suppose FX is a
given function little F X and capital FX

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:27.330
given function little F X and capital FX
 

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.010
given function little F X and capital FX
is a function that has little FX as its

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.020
is a function that has little FX as its
 

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:35.380
is a function that has little FX as its
derivative can you'll see this often a

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:35.390
derivative can you'll see this often a
 

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:40.430
derivative can you'll see this often a
capital letter will often denote the

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440
capital letter will often denote the
 

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.529
capital letter will often denote the
antiderivative function of the little

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:42.539
antiderivative function of the little
 

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:49.930
antiderivative function of the little
letter okay so f capital f prime x

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:49.940
letter okay so f capital f prime x
 

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.100
letter okay so f capital f prime x
is little F X okay so we'll call capital

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:54.110
is little F X okay so we'll call capital
 

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.580
is little F X okay so we'll call capital
F the integral or the antiderivative of

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:57.590
F the integral or the antiderivative of
 

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:01.900
F the integral or the antiderivative of
little F okay so this is so far we're

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:01.910
little F okay so this is so far we're
 

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.460
little F okay so this is so far we're
just talking in mechanical terms simply

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:05.470
just talking in mechanical terms simply
 

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:09.460
just talking in mechanical terms simply
faced with a function you simply reverse

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:09.470
faced with a function you simply reverse
 

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.410
faced with a function you simply reverse
the rules that you use to get the

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:11.420
the rules that you use to get the
 

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.700
the rules that you use to get the
derivative and by applying those rules

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:15.710
derivative and by applying those rules
 

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.410
derivative and by applying those rules
in Reverse you're getting an

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:17.420
in Reverse you're getting an
 

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:23.620
in Reverse you're getting an
antiderivative okay so what's the

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:23.630
antiderivative okay so what's the
 

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.710
antiderivative okay so what's the
antiderivative of x squared you can

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720
antiderivative of x squared you can
 

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:32.010
antiderivative of x squared you can
reverse the general power you rule if

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:32.020
reverse the general power you rule if
 

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:36.400
reverse the general power you rule if
little F X is x squared then the

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:36.410
little F X is x squared then the
 

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:41.140
little F X is x squared then the
antiderivative is going to be well I've

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:41.150
antiderivative is going to be well I've
 

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:49.330
antiderivative is going to be well I've
given you the answer there but what's

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:49.340
given you the answer there but what's
 

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.570
given you the answer there but what's
the logic you applied to get the

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:52.580
the logic you applied to get the
 

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:59.310
the logic you applied to get the
derivative to you know if you have some

00:09:59.310 --> 00:09:59.320
derivative to you know if you have some
 

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:04.780
derivative to you know if you have some
function X to the K when you take a

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:04.790
function X to the K when you take a
 

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:10.800
function X to the K when you take a
derivative you get K X to the K minus 1

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:10.810
derivative you get K X to the K minus 1
 

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.000
derivative you get K X to the K minus 1
okay so you're taking this putting that

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.010
okay so you're taking this putting that
 

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.780
okay so you're taking this putting that
in front and subtracting by one so to go

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:16.790
in front and subtracting by one so to go
 

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:25.600
in front and subtracting by one so to go
back well you know that you're going to

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:25.610
back well you know that you're going to
 

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:31.960
back well you know that you're going to
add one to the exponent okay so if you

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:31.970
add one to the exponent okay so if you
 

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.570
add one to the exponent okay so if you
had k minus 1 you're going to have K

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:34.580
had k minus 1 you're going to have K
 

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:40.540
had k minus 1 you're going to have K
minus 1 plus 1 okay and what you did

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:40.550
minus 1 plus 1 okay and what you did
 

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:45.870
minus 1 plus 1 okay and what you did
here was you x k multiplied the 10 by K

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:45.880
here was you x k multiplied the 10 by K
 

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:54.370
here was you x k multiplied the 10 by K
so you're going to divide by in this

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:54.380
so you're going to divide by in this
 

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.230
so you're going to divide by in this
case you're going to divide by the

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240
case you're going to divide by the
 

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.090
case you're going to divide by the
exponent so you're going to divide by K

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:58.100
exponent so you're going to divide by K
 

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:08.449
exponent so you're going to divide by K
minus 1

00:11:08.449 --> 00:11:08.459
 
 

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:13.229
 
no because because here just ok so I'm

00:11:13.229 --> 00:11:13.239
no because because here just ok so I'm
 

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:22.259
no because because here just ok so I'm
starting out with this right ok so in

00:11:22.259 --> 00:11:22.269
starting out with this right ok so in
 

00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:26.699
starting out with this right ok so in
that case we had x squared so suppose

00:11:26.699 --> 00:11:26.709
that case we had x squared so suppose
 

00:11:26.709 --> 00:11:31.979
that case we had x squared so suppose
this is x squared then I'm just going to

00:11:31.979 --> 00:11:31.989
this is x squared then I'm just going to
 

00:11:31.989 --> 00:11:36.590
this is x squared then I'm just going to
get you know I'm going to end up with X

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600
get you know I'm going to end up with X
 

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:42.989
get you know I'm going to end up with X
to the two and that's k minus 1 plus 1

00:11:42.989 --> 00:11:42.999
to the two and that's k minus 1 plus 1
 

00:11:42.999 --> 00:11:56.299
to the two and that's k minus 1 plus 1
so i've got x cubed and I've got to /

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:56.309
 
 

00:11:56.309 --> 00:12:01.439
 
hold on yeah you I think you're right

00:12:01.439 --> 00:12:01.449
hold on yeah you I think you're right
 

00:12:01.449 --> 00:12:05.519
hold on yeah you I think you're right
right it's got to BK plus 1 because I

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:05.529
right it's got to BK plus 1 because I
 

00:12:05.529 --> 00:12:08.519
right it's got to BK plus 1 because I
had here too that's right sorry this

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:08.529
had here too that's right sorry this
 

00:12:08.529 --> 00:12:15.269
had here too that's right sorry this
should be k plus 1 so because it has to

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279
should be k plus 1 so because it has to
 

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:20.999
should be k plus 1 so because it has to
be has to be this and that because this

00:12:20.999 --> 00:12:21.009
be has to be this and that because this
 

00:12:21.009 --> 00:12:25.530
be has to be this and that because this
is what i did when i went down here ok

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:25.540
is what i did when i went down here ok
 

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:31.379
is what i did when i went down here ok
so in this case k plus 1 is 2 plus 1 so

00:12:31.379 --> 00:12:31.389
so in this case k plus 1 is 2 plus 1 so
 

00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:39.269
so in this case k plus 1 is 2 plus 1 so
1 / 1 / k plus 1 which is three ok so

00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:39.279
1 / 1 / k plus 1 which is three ok so
 

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:43.379
1 / 1 / k plus 1 which is three ok so
and you can always check if i have to

00:12:43.379 --> 00:12:43.389
and you can always check if i have to
 

00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:46.139
and you can always check if i have to
take the derivative of this well that's

00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:46.149
take the derivative of this well that's
 

00:12:46.149 --> 00:12:52.639
take the derivative of this well that's
going to be 3 over 3 times x squared

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:52.649
going to be 3 over 3 times x squared
 

00:12:52.649 --> 00:12:57.689
going to be 3 over 3 times x squared
which is just x squared which is what i

00:12:57.689 --> 00:12:57.699
which is just x squared which is what i
 

00:12:57.699 --> 00:13:02.100
which is just x squared which is what i
had when i started out ok so always do

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:02.110
had when i started out ok so always do
 

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:07.900
had when i started out ok so always do
that check

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:07.910
 
 

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:13.370
 
ok now but the slight complication is

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:13.380
ok now but the slight complication is
 

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:18.530
ok now but the slight complication is
that of course when I take a derivative

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:18.540
that of course when I take a derivative
 

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.050
that of course when I take a derivative
if they're happen to have been a

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:21.060
if they're happen to have been a
 

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.270
if they're happen to have been a
constant in the original equation if

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:25.280
constant in the original equation if
 

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:31.310
constant in the original equation if
this was X K X to the k plus 2 or X to

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320
this was X K X to the k plus 2 or X to
 

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.630
this was X K X to the k plus 2 or X to
the K plus 6 I would still end up with K

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:35.640
the K plus 6 I would still end up with K
 

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.260
the K plus 6 I would still end up with K
X to the K minus 1 so all of those would

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:39.270
X to the K minus 1 so all of those would
 

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.860
X to the K minus 1 so all of those would
give me this derivative so when I

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:42.870
give me this derivative so when I
 

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:47.360
give me this derivative so when I
reverse and I go to the antiderivative I

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:47.370
reverse and I go to the antiderivative I
 

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:51.290
reverse and I go to the antiderivative I
have to keep in mind that whatever I get

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:51.300
have to keep in mind that whatever I get
 

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:56.360
have to keep in mind that whatever I get
as an antiderivative plus some constant

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:56.370
as an antiderivative plus some constant
 

00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.410
as an antiderivative plus some constant
which I do not know it could be because

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:00.420
which I do not know it could be because
 

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.310
which I do not know it could be because
that it could have been any number that

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:03.320
that it could have been any number that
 

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.140
that it could have been any number that
started out could have been a five or a

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:06.150
started out could have been a five or a
 

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:10.940
started out could have been a five or a
one and we denote that the constant of

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:10.950
one and we denote that the constant of
 

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.760
one and we denote that the constant of
integration yes yeah I'm just saying

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:13.770
integration yes yeah I'm just saying
 

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.310
integration yes yeah I'm just saying
that if you start as suppose you started

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320
that if you start as suppose you started
 

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:25.400
that if you start as suppose you started
out with sorry x to the power of k plus

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:25.410
out with sorry x to the power of k plus
 

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:29.240
out with sorry x to the power of k plus
1 yeah all I'm saying is that I start

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:29.250
1 yeah all I'm saying is that I start
 

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:33.290
1 yeah all I'm saying is that I start
your I start out with this and then I

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:33.300
your I start out with this and then I
 

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.050
your I start out with this and then I
add 12 so so if that's why it's

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:36.060
add 12 so so if that's why it's
 

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.150
add 12 so so if that's why it's
confusing because it's not that I

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160
confusing because it's not that I
 

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.930
confusing because it's not that I
started out with k you see that's why we

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:41.940
started out with k you see that's why we
 

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.360
started out with k you see that's why we
got where we got confused before I'm

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:44.370
got where we got confused before I'm
 

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.370
got where we got confused before I'm
just trying to show you that I go back

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:46.380
just trying to show you that I go back
 

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.560
just trying to show you that I go back
to the same place so i'm saying i

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:48.570
to the same place so i'm saying i
 

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.800
to the same place so i'm saying i
started out here with k minus 1 so this

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:51.810
started out here with k minus 1 so this
 

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:55.940
started out here with k minus 1 so this
is what i had i just added 1 exactly if

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:55.950
is what i had i just added 1 exactly if
 

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.010
is what i had i just added 1 exactly if
it was K this is what you have to do

00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:58.020
it was K this is what you have to do
 

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.450
it was K this is what you have to do
this is the rule you have to apply you

00:14:59.450 --> 00:14:59.460
this is the rule you have to apply you
 

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:04.580
this is the rule you have to apply you
just have to add one okay and that's

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:04.590
just have to add one okay and that's
 

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.470
just have to add one okay and that's
what I'm doing there I got x squared i

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480
what I'm doing there I got x squared i
 

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.920
what I'm doing there I got x squared i
just added one but i have in mind that

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:09.930
just added one but i have in mind that
 

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.650
just added one but i have in mind that
that x squared must have come from an X

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:12.660
that x squared must have come from an X
 

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.340
that x squared must have come from an X
cubed

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:15.350
 
 

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:24.290
 
my k is yeah that's right my k is no no

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.300
my k is yeah that's right my k is no no
 

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.020
my k is yeah that's right my k is no no
no no this is this is a different this

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:27.030
no no this is this is a different this
 

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:32.450
no no this is this is a different this
this is a different k right I still have

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:32.460
this is a different k right I still have
 

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.960
this is a different k right I still have
my k is going to be 3 and I'm definitely

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:35.970
my k is going to be 3 and I'm definitely
 

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:41.830
my k is going to be 3 and I'm definitely
going to get 1 over 3 you see so this

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:41.840
going to get 1 over 3 you see so this
 

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.660
going to get 1 over 3 you see so this
this is the Beast this is the exponent

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:44.670
this is the Beast this is the exponent
 

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:50.200
this is the Beast this is the exponent
to which I add one ok and here I've got

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:50.210
to which I add one ok and here I've got
 

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:54.290
to which I add one ok and here I've got
some some coefficient it so happens that

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.300
some some coefficient it so happens that
 

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.180
some some coefficient it so happens that
those two things are related but I'm

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:56.190
those two things are related but I'm
 

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:59.870
those two things are related but I'm
just saying that what's the thing that I

00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880
just saying that what's the thing that I
 

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.880
just saying that what's the thing that I
have to do to that to get back here i'm

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:04.890
have to do to that to get back here i'm
 

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:13.730
have to do to that to get back here i'm
going to divide by k plus 1 this your

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:13.740
going to divide by k plus 1 this your
 

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.530
going to divide by k plus 1 this your
you know what the problem is that the

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:15.540
you know what the problem is that the
 

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.860
you know what the problem is that the
notation is bad this k is not the same

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:18.870
notation is bad this k is not the same
 

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:23.720
notation is bad this k is not the same
as that K this K is just is this K right

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:23.730
as that K this K is just is this K right
 

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:28.460
as that K this K is just is this K right
so that's really this is just a bad bad

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:28.470
so that's really this is just a bad bad
 

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:32.630
so that's really this is just a bad bad
way of expressing the notation yes so

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:32.640
way of expressing the notation yes so
 

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.180
way of expressing the notation yes so
instead of x squared let's suppose that

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:35.190
instead of x squared let's suppose that
 

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:44.750
instead of x squared let's suppose that
we have 2x cubed ok and that is the

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:44.760
we have 2x cubed ok and that is the
 

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:51.110
we have 2x cubed ok and that is the
derivative ok so now I know that that's

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120
derivative ok so now I know that that's
 

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.860
derivative ok so now I know that that's
the derivative so I've got to go up one

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:54.870
the derivative so I've got to go up one
 

00:16:54.870 --> 00:17:03.620
the derivative so I've got to go up one
so f X has got to have a four ok then

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:03.630
so f X has got to have a four ok then
 

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:10.280
so f X has got to have a four ok then
I'm looking for the i'm looking to

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:10.290
I'm looking for the i'm looking to
 

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:16.819
I'm looking for the i'm looking to
divide if i had a 4 here i put the four

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:16.829
divide if i had a 4 here i put the four
 

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:23.179
divide if i had a 4 here i put the four
there but i ended up with a 2 ok so I've

00:17:23.179 --> 00:17:23.189
there but i ended up with a 2 ok so I've
 

00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:28.400
there but i ended up with a 2 ok so I've
got to divide let's try that

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:28.410
got to divide let's try that
 

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:33.800
got to divide let's try that
I do that would that work so that would

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:33.810
I do that would that work so that would
 

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:43.490
I do that would that work so that would
be 2x cubed okay but we just have to

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:43.500
be 2x cubed okay but we just have to
 

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.580
be 2x cubed okay but we just have to
make sure I put the four in front I get

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:46.590
make sure I put the four in front I get
 

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:55.430
make sure I put the four in front I get
a 2x cubed and then plus C okay so you

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440
a 2x cubed and then plus C okay so you
 

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.310
a 2x cubed and then plus C okay so you
just I think instead of trying to apply

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320
just I think instead of trying to apply
 

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.010
just I think instead of trying to apply
that rule that I try to come up with on

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:01.020
that rule that I try to come up with on
 

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:06.110
that rule that I try to come up with on
the fly just ask yourself put the

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120
the fly just ask yourself put the
 

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.470
the fly just ask yourself put the
exponent up by one put that exponent in

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480
exponent up by one put that exponent in
 

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.780
exponent up by one put that exponent in
front and see what you'd have to divide

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:11.790
front and see what you'd have to divide
 

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:16.280
front and see what you'd have to divide
by to get that okay is that good

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:16.290
by to get that okay is that good
 

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:24.290
by to get that okay is that good
splitter okay yeah so I know you know

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:24.300
splitter okay yeah so I know you know
 

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.600
splitter okay yeah so I know you know
one thing that I can be sure about is

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:26.610
one thing that I can be sure about is
 

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.400
one thing that I can be sure about is
that the exponent is always going to go

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:28.410
that the exponent is always going to go
 

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:34.420
that the exponent is always going to go
up by one so first do the exponent and

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:34.430
up by one so first do the exponent and
 

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:37.720
up by one so first do the exponent and
ask yourself well if I had

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:37.730
ask yourself well if I had
 

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:42.590
ask yourself well if I had
differentiated a term X to the 4 that

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600
differentiated a term X to the 4 that
 

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.770
differentiated a term X to the 4 that
for would have come in front and it

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:45.780
for would have come in front and it
 

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.960
for would have come in front and it
would have been something like 4x but

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:47.970
would have been something like 4x but
 

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.590
would have been something like 4x but
actually i have 2x so there must have

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600
actually i have 2x so there must have
 

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:57.110
actually i have 2x so there must have
been some coefficient that made the four

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120
been some coefficient that made the four
 

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.900
been some coefficient that made the four
go to two and what is that what is that

00:18:59.900 --> 00:18:59.910
go to two and what is that what is that
 

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.570
go to two and what is that what is that
coefficient that i need to make that

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580
coefficient that i need to make that
 

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:08.180
coefficient that i need to make that
four go to two yeah you could yeah you

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:08.190
four go to two yeah you could yeah you
 

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:12.550
four go to two yeah you could yeah you
could take the the this coefficient and

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:12.560
could take the the this coefficient and
 

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:17.240
could take the the this coefficient and
/ yeah which is which was the k plus one

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:17.250
/ yeah which is which was the k plus one
 

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.200
/ yeah which is which was the k plus one
that I had before so / see I put their k

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:21.210
that I had before so / see I put their k
 

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.440
that I had before so / see I put their k
plus one that was the 3+1 but it's a

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:24.450
plus one that was the 3+1 but it's a
 

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.300
plus one that was the 3+1 but it's a
different k that's why I don't want you

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:26.310
different k that's why I don't want you
 

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:30.230
different k that's why I don't want you
to use that you divide by the new

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240
to use that you divide by the new
 

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.270
to use that you divide by the new
exponent forget the k but divided by the

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280
exponent forget the k but divided by the
 

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.490
exponent forget the k but divided by the
new exponent which is which is the old

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.500
new exponent which is which is the old
 

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:42.360
new exponent which is which is the old
exponent plus one yeah if you have a

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:42.370
exponent plus one yeah if you have a
 

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.750
exponent plus one yeah if you have a
a polynomial function like this okay

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760
a polynomial function like this okay
 

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.150
a polynomial function like this okay
won't be the case for example if you had

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.160
won't be the case for example if you had
 

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.270
won't be the case for example if you had
X in the exponent remember those that's

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280
X in the exponent remember those that's
 

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.730
X in the exponent remember those that's
a different kind of function will see

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:53.740
a different kind of function will see
 

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:58.200
a different kind of function will see
that in a second okay this see ya the

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:58.210
that in a second okay this see ya the
 

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.610
that in a second okay this see ya the
sea right well the reason for the sea is

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620
sea right well the reason for the sea is
 

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:12.180
sea right well the reason for the sea is
that okay if I take a derivative of this

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:12.190
that okay if I take a derivative of this
 

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:15.240
that okay if I take a derivative of this
function then as you know you get 2x

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:15.250
function then as you know you get 2x
 

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:19.590
function then as you know you get 2x
cubed suppose that instead of this

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600
cubed suppose that instead of this
 

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.070
cubed suppose that instead of this
function I had the following function

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.080
function I had the following function
 

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.430
function I had the following function
and I were to take a derivative of this

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:26.440
and I were to take a derivative of this
 

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:33.090
and I were to take a derivative of this
what would be the derivative 2x cubed

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:33.100
what would be the derivative 2x cubed
 

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:38.100
what would be the derivative 2x cubed
right same as before and similarly if I

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:38.110
right same as before and similarly if I
 

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:43.919
right same as before and similarly if I
had 300 there right so there are many

00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:43.929
had 300 there right so there are many
 

00:20:43.929 --> 00:20:47.040
had 300 there right so there are many
many different functions whose

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:47.050
many different functions whose
 

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:50.040
many different functions whose
derivative is this and they're all

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:50.050
derivative is this and they're all
 

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:53.370
derivative is this and they're all
different from each other by some

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:53.380
different from each other by some
 

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:58.110
different from each other by some
constant and so that C is an indication

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120
constant and so that C is an indication
 

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.910
constant and so that C is an indication
of my ignorance that is I do not know

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:01.920
of my ignorance that is I do not know
 

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.860
of my ignorance that is I do not know
the value of that constant that could be

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:04.870
the value of that constant that could be
 

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.520
the value of that constant that could be
a 0 or it could be some other number

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:07.530
a 0 or it could be some other number
 

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:12.180
a 0 or it could be some other number
okay so actually this is really a class

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:12.190
okay so actually this is really a class
 

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.419
okay so actually this is really a class
of functions all different from each

00:21:15.419 --> 00:21:15.429
of functions all different from each
 

00:21:15.429 --> 00:21:26.130
of functions all different from each
other by a constant okay so okay so

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:26.140
other by a constant okay so okay so
 

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.740
other by a constant okay so okay so
let's see so this is suppose you have to

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:28.750
let's see so this is suppose you have to
 

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.950
let's see so this is suppose you have to
look for the antiderivative 2x minus 1

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:31.960
look for the antiderivative 2x minus 1
 

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.650
look for the antiderivative 2x minus 1
over x squared so this is a good just to

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:34.660
over x squared so this is a good just to
 

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:44.590
over x squared so this is a good just to
get some practice okay so

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600
 
 

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:49.639
 
2x minus that's 1 over x squared it's

00:21:49.639 --> 00:21:49.649
2x minus that's 1 over x squared it's
 

00:21:49.649 --> 00:21:53.049
2x minus that's 1 over x squared it's
helpful to write it with the exponent

00:21:53.049 --> 00:21:53.059
helpful to write it with the exponent
 

00:21:53.059 --> 00:22:02.049
helpful to write it with the exponent
okay so that's minus X to the minus 2

00:22:02.049 --> 00:22:02.059
 
 

00:22:02.059 --> 00:22:11.720
 
okay and so what what is f of X well the

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:11.730
okay and so what what is f of X well the
 

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:20.629
okay and so what what is f of X well the
2x was what just x squared right so I

00:22:20.629 --> 00:22:20.639
2x was what just x squared right so I
 

00:22:20.639 --> 00:22:24.110
2x was what just x squared right so I
raised the exponent by one and then

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120
raised the exponent by one and then
 

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.470
raised the exponent by one and then
divided this to buy this too so i end up

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480
divided this to buy this too so i end up
 

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:31.460
divided this to buy this too so i end up
with a 1 here and then here I'm going to

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:31.470
with a 1 here and then here I'm going to
 

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:37.210
with a 1 here and then here I'm going to
raise the exponent by one so that is

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:37.220
raise the exponent by one so that is
 

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:44.799
raise the exponent by one so that is
minus 1 okay and then divide this

00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:44.809
minus 1 okay and then divide this
 

00:22:44.809 --> 00:22:49.389
minus 1 okay and then divide this
coefficient by that so this is minus 1

00:22:49.389 --> 00:22:49.399
coefficient by that so this is minus 1
 

00:22:49.399 --> 00:22:59.210
coefficient by that so this is minus 1
divided by minus 1 which is plus 1 ok

00:22:59.210 --> 00:22:59.220
divided by minus 1 which is plus 1 ok
 

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:05.539
divided by minus 1 which is plus 1 ok
plus the constant okay and this as you

00:23:05.539 --> 00:23:05.549
plus the constant okay and this as you
 

00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:15.220
plus the constant okay and this as you
know is just 1 over X

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:15.230
 
 

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:22.580
 
okay everybody feel comfortable okay

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:22.590
okay everybody feel comfortable okay
 

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:26.690
okay everybody feel comfortable okay
that's that is the inter indefinite

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:26.700
that's that is the inter indefinite
 

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.169
that's that is the inter indefinite

think of which you use to construct the

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:23.370
think of which you use to construct the
 

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:28.970

find the antiderivative off and that is

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760
find the antiderivative off and that is
 

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:52.640
find the antiderivative off and that is
the antiderivative okay okay you know if

the antiderivative okay okay you know if
 

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:55.549
the antiderivative okay okay you know if
this would be why then it would be with

00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559
this would be why then it would be with
 

00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:59.810
this would be why then it would be with

that you might come across so suppose we

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360
that you might come across so suppose we
 

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.120
that you might come across so suppose we
determine X to the determine the

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:16.130
determine X to the determine the
 

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:21.919
determine X to the determine the

00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:21.929
antiderivative of x to the r where r is
 

00:25:21.929 --> 00:25:23.960
antiderivative of x to the r where r is
a constant not equal to minus 1 so

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:23.970
a constant not equal to minus 1 so
 

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.240
a constant not equal to minus 1 so
there's just a general generalization of

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:26.250
there's just a general generalization of
 

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:26.810
there's just a general generalization of
the problem

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:26.820
the problem
 

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:33.139
the problem
we've been doing so far okay so note

00:25:33.139 --> 00:25:33.149
we've been doing so far okay so note
 

00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:37.340
we've been doing so far okay so note
that x to the r is the same as X to the

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:37.350
that x to the r is the same as X to the
 

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:43.070
that x to the r is the same as X to the
odd times r plus 1 over R plus 1 this is

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080
odd times r plus 1 over R plus 1 this is
 

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.950
odd times r plus 1 over R plus 1 this is
just equal to 1 so ok so let's it looks

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:47.960
just equal to 1 so ok so let's it looks
 

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:52.960
just equal to 1 so ok so let's it looks
more obvious when you write it this way

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:52.970
more obvious when you write it this way
 

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:58.149
more obvious when you write it this way
x to the r is of course just X to the r

00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159
x to the r is of course just X to the r
 

00:25:58.159 --> 00:26:09.080
x to the r is of course just X to the r
over r plus 1 over r plus 1 ok so again

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:09.090
over r plus 1 over r plus 1 ok so again
 

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.990
over r plus 1 over r plus 1 ok so again
just using the power rule that we talked

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000
just using the power rule that we talked
 

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.570
just using the power rule that we talked
about before this helps us to do the

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:16.580
about before this helps us to do the
 

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.190
about before this helps us to do the
division of the coefficient that we did

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200
division of the coefficient that we did
 

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.320
division of the coefficient that we did
before if I have to find if X to the r

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:24.330
before if I have to find if X to the r
 

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:28.700
before if I have to find if X to the r
is the derivative the antiderivative is

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:28.710
is the derivative the antiderivative is
 

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:36.470
is the derivative the antiderivative is
going to be X to the r plus 1 and then

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480
going to be X to the r plus 1 and then
 

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:42.049
going to be X to the r plus 1 and then
this has to if I were taking a

00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:42.059
this has to if I were taking a
 

00:26:42.059 --> 00:26:44.330
this has to if I were taking a
derivative this would go in front so

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:44.340
derivative this would go in front so
 

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:51.129
derivative this would go in front so
would be an r plus 1 but I have a 1 here

00:26:51.129 --> 00:26:51.139
would be an r plus 1 but I have a 1 here
 

00:26:51.139 --> 00:27:01.639
would be an r plus 1 but I have a 1 here
so what I have to do is to / / r plus 1

00:27:01.639 --> 00:27:01.649
so what I have to do is to / / r plus 1
 

00:27:01.649 --> 00:27:06.710
so what I have to do is to / / r plus 1
right so i'm going to get r plus 1 just

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720
right so i'm going to get r plus 1 just
 

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.720
right so i'm going to get r plus 1 just
as we did before we we take the new

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:08.730
as we did before we we take the new
 

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:19.369
as we did before we we take the new
exponent and divide this by r plus 1 it

00:27:19.369 --> 00:27:19.379
exponent and divide this by r plus 1 it
 

00:27:19.379 --> 00:27:21.200
exponent and divide this by r plus 1 it
may not help you to think about it this

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:21.210
may not help you to think about it this
 

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:25.550
may not help you to think about it this
way

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:25.560
 
 

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.170
 
well you know if you just want to think

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:28.180
well you know if you just want to think
 

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:30.690
well you know if you just want to think
about it as take the new exponent and

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:30.700
about it as take the new exponent and
 

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.030
about it as take the new exponent and
divide the old coefficient by the new

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:33.040
divide the old coefficient by the new
 

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.380
divide the old coefficient by the new
exponent that's fine okay but here's why

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:37.390
exponent that's fine okay but here's why
 

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:42.390
exponent that's fine okay but here's why
you want to know exactly why here's why

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:42.400
you want to know exactly why here's why
 

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.060
you want to know exactly why here's why
you want to think about this because

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:45.070
you want to think about this because
 

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:50.420
you want to think about this because
you're dividing by r plus 1 right well

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:50.430
you're dividing by r plus 1 right well
 

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:54.510
you're dividing by r plus 1 right well
what can you not / in our Emma in our

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:54.520
what can you not / in our Emma in our
 

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:59.160
what can you not / in our Emma in our
numerical imagination by 0 right so if

00:27:59.160 --> 00:27:59.170
numerical imagination by 0 right so if
 

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:02.850
numerical imagination by 0 right so if
our happens to be minus 1 then you can't

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:02.860
our happens to be minus 1 then you can't
 

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:06.150
our happens to be minus 1 then you can't
carry out that division which is why

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:06.160
carry out that division which is why
 

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.600
carry out that division which is why
we're excluding the case that r is equal

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:09.610
we're excluding the case that r is equal
 

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:12.690
we're excluding the case that r is equal
to minus 1 okay that was your question

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:12.700
to minus 1 okay that was your question
 

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:17.670
to minus 1 okay that was your question
right anybody know for bonus credit what

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:17.680
right anybody know for bonus credit what
 

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:25.730
right anybody know for bonus credit what
the antiderivative is if R is minus 1

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:25.740
 
 

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.950
 
yeah it's the natural log right so that

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960
yeah it's the natural log right so that
 

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:35.700
yeah it's the natural log right so that
is if R is minus 1 okay that's the same

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:35.710
is if R is minus 1 okay that's the same
 

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:39.600
is if R is minus 1 okay that's the same
as 1 over X the antiderivative of 1 over

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:39.610
as 1 over X the antiderivative of 1 over
 

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:46.700
as 1 over X the antiderivative of 1 over
X is the natural log of X okay and

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:46.710
X is the natural log of X okay and
 

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:49.200
X is the natural log of X okay and
deriving that is beyond the scope of

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:49.210
deriving that is beyond the scope of
 

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:52.710
deriving that is beyond the scope of
this evenings session but just keep that

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720
this evenings session but just keep that
 

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.170
this evenings session but just keep that
in mind it is actually something we use

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:55.180
in mind it is actually something we use
 

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.930
in mind it is actually something we use
quite a lot in economics the natural log

00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:57.940
quite a lot in economics the natural log
 

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:07.919
quite a lot in economics the natural log
and its derivative

00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:07.929
 
 

00:29:07.929 --> 00:29:09.990
