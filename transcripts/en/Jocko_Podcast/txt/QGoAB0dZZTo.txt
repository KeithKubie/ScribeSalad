Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 11 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening.

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       So yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:13       almost two years ago I had a guy on the podcast by the name of Jody medic and we ended up talking for so long that we actually turned one podcast into two podcasts. The first one was a review of his book, which had just come out. It was called unflinching, the making of a Canadian sniper, and then we did a second podcast right after that. That was just us talking and discussing some more of the details of where he had his life had gone since that book had come out. And those podcasts are number 24 and number 25 and if you haven't listened to those yet, just stop here, go back and listen to them first. And in those podcasts we discussed Jodi's early life and how he ended up in the military and his sniper training in his two deployments to Afghanistan and the events of January 11th, 2007 when during an operation he hit a landmine and lost both of his legs below the knee. And from there.

Speaker 2:          00:01:31       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       he struggled to stay alive, but he did and he made it back to Canada where he then struggled to recover from his injuries and he struggled to adapt to his new life. And along the way he struggled to overcome addiction to pain medications that had been given to them so freely. But he did overcome those struggles and made a new life and wrote a book and got elected as a member of the city council of the city of Ottawa.

Speaker 2:          00:02:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:08       And he continued to raise his young girls and take care of them. And by all accounts, we're talking about a model citizen. In fact, I'd go so far as to say a model human being,

Speaker 2:          00:02:25       but

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       things aren't always as they appear. And although Jodie look to be doing great by any measure behind that public persona,

Speaker 2:          00:02:41       the

Speaker 1:          00:02:41       struggle continued.

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       And I saw a glimpse of it when Jody came down to be on the podcast. I first noticed it when I made reservations for Jody at a hotel by my house and I just got a nice little hotel nearby me so I could pick them up easy. And didn't think much of it. I gave him the hotel information than a couple of days later he called me up and said he needed to transfer to a different hotel because the hotel that I had made reservations at didn't have handicap accessible rooms. And of course I felt like a like a jerk, but at the same time I didn't really understand because I'd seen all these video clips of Jody walking around and and actually running around and he'd gotten second place in this TV show called the amazing race where he's doing all these different challenges and I saw pictures of him and videos of him running and driving cars and even riding motorcycles, driving motorcycles.

Speaker 1:          00:03:49       So clearly there was something that I didn't understand that was going on and maybe he wasn't as mobile as I thought he was. And when I went to pick them up at the airport, I wasn't really sure what to expect. I didn't know if he's going to be in a wheelchair. I didn't know if he's going to need help getting around. And as I drove through the pickup area looking for me, he wasn't hard to spot. He was standing at the curb, big beasts s over six feet tall. And he walked over to the car with confidence when we really zero indication that he was walking on two prosthetic legs and you know, so we recorded the podcast after afternoon and it took forever. It was like five hours or six hours. And then we got done with that and we went and grabbed steak and the next day, you know, he said, hey can, can you give me a tour of San Diego?

Speaker 1:          00:04:37       Can you show me, you know, some of the sites around here. And so we did that and I took him down to the, the buds compound where the seal training is. And then I took him to the seal teams and we went to the USS Midway, the aircraft carrier museum, and we were walking all over that. And then he wanted to go down to the beach town where I live in. So we walked around there and it was awesome. And he was enjoying it being down from the cold, frozen Tundra of Canada. And as we got towards the end of the day, you know, Jodie started walking a little bit slower and, and I noticed on his face he had a look of discomfort, right? That he was, you could see he was trying not to really reveal it, but it was there. And then finally said, you know, can we, can we sit down for a minute?

Speaker 1:          00:05:22       These things start to hurt after a while. And he's pointing down at his legs and said, of course. Yeah, no problem, man. So we sat down for a little while and he recovered a little bit and then we got up and we walked a little bit more. And then he said, hey man, can we sit down again? And I said, yeah, man, of course. So then we sat down for a little while and then when he got up again, he said, hey, can we just head back to your house and maybe sit or sit around there for a little while? These things are starting to hurt pretty good right now. You know, the skin wears off and it starts to bleed and you know, it's doesn't feel good man. And I said, yeah brother, no problem. So we headed back to my house and, and we went up on the deck and we sat there and just kinda hung out, talked and

Speaker 2:          00:06:07       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       And it became clear to me something I did know from my other friends that have been wounded badly, that it's a lot harder than it looks.

Speaker 2:          00:06:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       It isn't the bionic man and it's hard to adapt. The intermingling of human flesh with mechanical parts is not a natural thing. It's not a smooth thing. It's a battle and it's a battle that's hard for us to perceive from the outside. But it's a battle that takes place every minute of every day, usually behind the scenes

Speaker 2:          00:06:52       privately because yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:06:58       as soldiers, as marines, these men learn to suffer and bear their burdens silently and without complaints. And it was here at my house that Jody explained to me why he needed a handicapped accessible room. He said, yeah, you don't matter. I get home and I gotta take my legs off and then I got to crawl to the bathroom to use the toilet and I got a crawl to get in the shower and I need those little handles to pull myself up. Yeah, it's a struggle.

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       And [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:07:37       Jodi suffered and struggled again, not outwardly, not in public,

Speaker 2:          00:07:45       but alone.

Speaker 1:          00:07:48       He pressed on and we kept in touch over the last couple of years, you know, text messages and what's going on and did you see this? And I sent you that and I watched as Jodi continued on his journey of his life and he was awesome to watch and he got back to Canada and he's started to podcast and he continued with his political career and he wrote another bestselling book called Everyday Heroes.

Speaker 2:          00:08:14       And

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       you know, from a distance everything appeared to be going great.

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       But again,

Speaker 1:          00:08:25       things aren't always what they seem. And behind all that, Jody was

Speaker 2:          00:08:33       struggling and yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:08:38       a couple months ago I got a text, a simple text from Jodi and it read,

Speaker 2:          00:08:47       Bro, the enemy out flanked me. Now

Speaker 1:          00:08:57       in military terms, that's about as bad as it gets. It means the enemy has attacked your weakness. It means the enemy has the upper hand. It means you have lost momentum in the battle, and it means you could very likely be overrun. And being overrun means that you're going to get killed. And I could see from that text that Jody was at war again, not on the battlefield, but in his life. But Jody's a soldier.

Speaker 2:          00:09:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:38       And Jody fought back because that's what soldiers do. Then a little while later, he sent another text that read on finally turning into the ambush and starting to fight through. He attacked the problems. He's back on track again back on the path and came down to visit me. And after talking to him a little bit and discussing what he's been through, I asked him if he would come on and talk about it. So other people, not, not just veterans, but everyone that struggles, all of us can learn from what he's been through and what he's overcome.

Speaker 1:          00:10:35       So here we are once again. Then with that, Jodi Jacko, welcome back to the podcast. Wow, you had me, uh, and me and I'll get in the fields there for a minute. Thank you. Yeah man, it's, um, thank you for that. You work, you were talking to me last night about, about the texts that you had sent me. Yeah. And you said, you know, there were some, there was some heavy texts I sent you in and I was like, really? And you said yeah, and I go, did I pick up on it? And you were like, yeah, yeah, yeah. I thought you did. Well No, when I read through my clearly did. Yeah. And just do the responses and the conversation we were having, but that, that first text that you sent me, yeah. I was like, Damn. And, and then I of course I went and I went back on your social media, looked at what have been going through and you dropped off social media. Yeah. And so you had basically reached out and said, you know, hey, brother needs lean, a little air support over on this side. And so what happened from, I mean just you leave here from, from the last podcast two years ago, you go back to Canada. Yeah. You Start Your podcast. That was great. Yeah. Great

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       podcast. Oh yeah. Uh, got, you know, a lot of people were listening to it and getting a lot of feedback from people. A lot of people hit me like, yeah, Jody's podcast is great. So you're doing that, you're working on the other book that just came, when did that book come out? October last October. Last October. Hit the shelves bestseller running. Boom. Yeah. So when I was already, I was already hadn't done a podcast since me. Um, actually, uh, last podcast I did, it was with some guys from cans off. Uh, they started their own company, tactical beaver if is like supposed to springboard us into the next podcast. We had some other guys coming in and some other cans off entrepreneurs and we are starting to kind of shift to supporting veterans in their business opportunity cause it seems like we're all becoming entrepreneurs are the guys that will employ our friends and things like that.

Speaker 3:          00:12:42       And that's what I want to focus on is how do we help the troops after they go through what I went through because I had zero plan. Nobody had really dealt with this stuff in Canada since Korea. Really. We had some guys in Bosnia in that, but the, the chain of command and the, and the government frankly lied about the fact that Canadian forces were in combat, uh, in, in the, in the former Yugoslavia. That all aside, the point is we were, we were trying to lead by, I always trying to lead by example. Luke, my, my echo, uh, Luke was, uh, was trying to help out and he was doing his best and he was seeing the wheels fall off the Jody Mitic machine and you kept trying to like put them back on and gun tape them. And, um, just do as best though because him and I, it's not like we're like close buds.

Speaker 3:          00:13:28       Like we're not like besties since we were kids or anything. So he's trying to keep his distance and keep that like Jody Mitic podcast is Jody medics. And I'm, I'm Luke. I could tell too. And I kept telling my friends that, you know, that we're close as well. Like I can tell he really wants to help, but he's not sure. And then one day, um, so I had a kind of a perfect storm, so I moved out of my house in October last October 16 and you know, I'll just get that out of the way. That was the beginning really of things going south. And it's not cause, uh, my ex and I are enemies by any stretch. We're still friends. We have two amazing kids. We had amazing life. It's just sometimes, uh, you know, sometimes you'd units don't Mesh Right. And that's just kinda the way it went.

Speaker 3:          00:14:18       You know, we both have different visions of our future and, and things like that. So, but then you kind of got to put on the, the face for the public, you know. Um, and so I stopped going to the gym at that time. I stopped seeing my therapist just cause he's on the other end of town and I can't be bothered right now. I've got too many other things to do. Um, and even when I was here, like you said, you saw, I forgot about that walk. And you're right, I remember sitting on the wall at visit. It, is it, is it Ocean Beach Ob. Yep. And I love like the Air Americana, that's what we call in Cam Americana. History is amazing to me in the California beach. Each beach has its own history in the, in the group I loved. And you're talking about and I'm looking around at all these buildings built in the forties, 50s, 60s.

Speaker 3:          00:15:06       And um, and in my mind I drove route 66 to get here. Like I love the history of this, of this country so much. And then I was on route 66 until I saw the pony express trail is to your left. And I went, okay. Turned left and I would follow the pony express trail down into Arizona. Um, but even then, uh, like you said, like the pain was really hitting me and I'm terrified of the pills because of becoming addicted. And so, okay, what do you do for pain if you're not taking pills? And I'm not a weed guy. Like, I know I talk about it and not everything, but I don't know anything about it. But I know a lot about Crown Royal, my Jack Daniels and a and captain Morgan and I are good buddies. And uh, so I found I went from having a beer after work or in my case, uh, I like cider.

Speaker 3:          00:15:56       I know I get made fun of for it, but booze, booze, boys. So you know what I'm saying? Um, oh, I can't wait to have that side or after work or that, that a rum and coke, uh, when I get to the get to the pub with the, with the guys, two guys. Now, the guys that you're talking about now are your fellow people you're working with in the government. A lot of them are politicians, but also just some of the boys that, cause Ottawa is like the biggest military posting and Canada, but also all the cans offer in that area. So I got buddies that are coming back from deployment in Iraq, uh, on and off. And they come in for their home for a month. They're gone for three home for three, gone for a month. So whenever you get a, you hear from them, you run out.

Speaker 3:          00:16:37       And of course they just got back from the sandbox so they wouldn't have a beer or two. And you know, and I'm like okay, because it might like I'm going going, going, I get up at six, put on my suit, go to work, come home and I'm in pain the whole time. And from the pain you saw two October, 2016 and then come spring 2017 now it's just, it's reached points where I wouldn't, but I was thinking about drinking before work and it's not, cause I'm like stressed out and I was stressed out but is more like, oh man, like my, cause I, there is a deadening of the, of the pain for sure. And it's like, well Uber Ride is only 12 bucks to get to work and this and that. And, or my staff drives right by my place to go so I could have her pick me up and at discipline kept me from doing that for awhile.

Speaker 3:          00:17:31       And then I had a trip to Oregon to go shooting at the Leopold shooting academy. They opened there. That was great. But before I left, I think I took my legs off for a solid three to four weeks and as in my wheelchair and that kind of sucked because my car isn't set up to drive, you know, my place I got, which is like a block from the house. So it's not that far from the kids in, in the acts and everything. So you know, I'm seeing them a lot any way and stuff, but nothing else in my life is set up to live without legs. Even like where I keep my coffee in the kitchen is for when I'm on my legs. So I'm in my, I'm in my wheelchair the first day and I'm like, oh, I don't really make coffee when I'm in my wheelchair.

Speaker 3:          00:18:15       Do I? Oh, tongs, right. So I get tongs out of the cupboard, reach off, I can do this, whatever. Adapt. And it's like, okay, time to go to work. Oh shoot. And then I did call my staff and she picked me up already. Took an Uber, but then I went to Oregon and that was a week, like it was about seven, eight, nine days, nine days on my leg, straight, excruciating pain the whole time or whatever was happening in the doctor. I finally went back and she said that like my skin had reached a point where it couldn't regenerate fast enough. So we've just breaking down. And then the way I like to wear my legs was being rejected by the body. So I like to wear with, it gets called a suction as suction holds. So it's like a vacuum until you release it with a, with a valve.

Speaker 3:          00:19:01       And my body was like, well we're done with this. But I'm like, wow, no, me, no lake, leg, leg sleeve, legs, sleeve takeaway, mobility, Mino once. And so my, you know that if you're going to be dumb, you better be tough. Thing comes in, you gotta be telling. Yeah. And you know, and, and, and, and I didn't have it and I'm not living with, with a medic anymore, right. So she's not there to be like, hey, stupid, but yourself, like take the legs off and let someone take care of you. My mom actually moved to Ottawa December 16 and I'm completely ignoring her advice because you know what, mom, mom's always going to try and look after you, but come on mom, I'm 40 years old Jews. Um, and I was pushing away against a lot of the same things I would then in the same day would tell people like, hey man, you gotta let people look after you.

Speaker 3:          00:19:50       You know, cause I get texts, I've probably same as you, right? I get texts bbms I get dms on Instagram and Twitter and Facebook on my fan page and then the podcast page, uh, hey, what's going on? Like, I need help with this. And I'd be like, don't be afraid to go get help. Don't be afraid to reach out those around you. Love you. Let them look after. And I'm completely ignoring any of this advice myself cause I'm like, I kicked oxycotton when I was 22, I think. And on deployment I stopped smoking just because I wanted to. Uh, I drink on the weekend, I don't need to drink. But meanwhile, while I'm sitting there checking these messages while having a drink, I know and I look back and I'm like, I'm so stupid. But I guess sometimes you got to go through, there's a reason why you go back to basics.

Speaker 3:          00:20:34       Is there, is there like in your mind when you're going through that, are you thinking yourself, I could stop if I wanted to do every day? Just don't want to, yeah, I don't, it's not getting in the way of anything. I'm still functional. I'm still at work. I'm still doing. To me, my main job was what I was elected to do. Right. And I have a four year in my mind it's a, it's a, it's Kinda like being in the army where you're on four year, four year commitments, right? So I'm like, well, right now I have a four year commitment. I'm not drinking at work. I mean at some point I did start drinking at work, but in politics and business as you know, like sometimes after lunch, instead of going back to the office, you have a beer and you're still working, you're still talking about issues, you're still getting, like I used to get a lot of advice from, I shouldn't say used to.

Speaker 3:          00:21:20       I, I get a lot of advice from the other more experienced politicians because that's what you do. And we all would have a beer or a cider and then they'd go back to the office and I'd stay and keep on the phone and now I have one more, you know? And then another group of guys would come in from like, oh, hey, you're still here. Like, you know, so and so's already back at City Hall. What kind of, what kind of drunk are you happy? I'm a happy go lucky I get a little loud, but it's not like I'm like, Hey, what's going on? Better? Um, but you know, anyway, well I know it to your ass. No, I'm actually just asking. You could, you could still call on the phone and be like, hey buddy, blah blah. You know, some people when they drink they get angry.

Speaker 3:          00:22:08       Some people I know they slur their speech really bad and so you've got all these different, you drams when I drink I basically just like am more of Jocko. Yeah. I'm more Jody. Yeah. For the most part I do slur, but even I could, I'd be like, ah, I'm slurring my words. Okay, well I'll drink some water for a minute and then I'll get it back or I'll have a coffee. Um, and I'm good. I'm not, I'm normally, and even when I'm like, I rarely get fall over drunk. Right. If ever, but just let me rewind. I know that's a long answer to a short question, but so may I get back from Oregon and I'm just like dying. And then I had to go real quick down to ebony. Cause of part of my job with the city is I'm the sports commissioner and I'm desperately trying to get the crossfit games to bring the eastern regional games to Ottawa because I just think that'd be awesome to have an Ottawa.

Speaker 3:          00:23:02       We, you know, we've got the UFC in Ottawa. I was a part of that. And so I was really proud and I said when I got the job, I said I want to do two things in the four years at the UFC and get the crossfit games. So I'm still trying to do the crossfit games. I got less than a year to do it, but I think we can do it. But anyway, that's a lot of people that participate in crossfit that listen to this podcast maybe. Yeah, I've met a lot of them. And you know what? The crossfit guys, a crafty and Albany city itself, they don't want to lose the crossfit games. So they knew I was in town and they started to sweeten the deal, if you know what I mean. And the crossfit games go well, auto was offering us this. Albany, what you got?

Speaker 3:          00:23:37       Hey, it's business. I get it. But you know what, I'm coming back. Um, I got back from that trip that was about a four day trip from Ottawa to Albany and back. And when I was here with you guys, I didn't bring a wheelchair began. That's what I meant by I crawl around, which is why I could stay at your house. But I don't want your kids seeing a grown man crawl to the bathroom. And it's not because I'm above crawling, it's just, it's one of those personal things in my own space. I'm not above it and around like loved ones. Okay. So that's why you want your own space and even a and stuff like that. So even when I visit my dad, I get a hotel room, you know, my dad loves me and I'm not, but it's also my space or if I want to crawl around naked, I can write.

Speaker 3:          00:24:21       And so anyway, that's why that, so then I get back and, um, I take the legs off and I'd just, I can't put them back on. I look, I would like, I don't know, I said it on your show last time, but I have mornings where I look at my prosthetics. I'm like, fuck, sorry, sorry for swearing. I know we were allowed, but I'm trying to be a little bit bit of a remand Deco, you know what I mean? You're going to be an echo. I don't want you having to edit out things that I say. Okay. So, um, I took them off and I just looked, I just threw him across the room and I said I can't deal. I have a wound in my left stumped. I did I show it to you? No, it's been there since April of 14 and it happened.

Speaker 3:          00:25:04       I remember the second it happened. My brother and I were doing an amazing race thing post show in Alberta and we did a little like, you know, go, Hey Jodi and Corey from amazing raise woo. We got a few bucks for it. And we gave a speech to a, some kind of convention and then I was walking down the airport to the plane and I felt something go on my foot. It's, and it's like having a hotspot when you're on a rug merge or whatever except I can't really shift what part of my foot and walking on, I just can, and it went from a little tiny like breaking the skin to something the size and Canada. We have two knees, it's $2. I know you guys still use the dollar bill like a 50 cent piece and then back now it's down to like a pinprick of scab.

Speaker 3:          00:25:51       But that's what are we talking now where uh, almost four years. Right. And I had to mitigate that the whole time and it was painful and I got a couple of, I got to infections in the four years from it, but that's where I was like that's it. I need to let myself heal. I need to like let my body regenerate except now from that. And it took me until fall late fall to realize that when I did that I might as well have stepped on another landmine. And I went through, it took me to late fall to go cause I was like, cause that's when things really went south because you basically not even basically because you lost your legs again. Yeah, I lost my legs again. Except because truly when you were down here, even though you're in pain bro, we were doing, you know, we were walking up

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       and downstairs we were, we're doing whatever. We walked all over that aircraft carrier over that aircraft carrier up and downstairs we walked all over the seal compound. We walked through, you know, we, I loved it. I went out on the beach when we walked out on the beach where you guys torture the, the recruits, trains every step. I was like, cause you've got to dig through the sand. But to me that's hollowed ground burrow. Like when you took me to the grinder, I remember standing there like this is the grinder. I'm Katie, I'm Canadian army and but there's some things where you go, you just, you feel right. If I brought you up to the recruit spot and for basic and Canadian army, you'd be, you'd feel, you get that feeling like this is where soldiers are born. There's been a lot of those little, they have the little fins on the grinder stuff like what, what Jody's talking about is where are they trained seals that first day in the movies, right?

Speaker 4:          00:27:31       Yeah, it's, it's, and they have little fins, so like little dive fins. There's little 40 you know the marine corps, they have boots. Yeah. Yeah. He in the army, they have boots painted on the ground. They paint them on the ground. Well in the ad, the grinder at buds, they have little swim fins to little tiny swim fins are painting. There's a couple of hundred of them. And that's when you get out there for PTU. Stand onto your little set us when tents and then as the days go by there's less and less. He is great. And then, and I've read, I've read if I've read less than 24 navy seal books from, from the beginning to today. Right. Yours included. I'd be surprised. I've read, I've read the, uh, the old blurps right. I've read about those guys. I've read about the original rangers. I've read about the Canadian, I'm a American special service for us.

Speaker 4:          00:28:17       Actually when I was with rob, my buddy from the green berets down in Yuma, I was wearing a ranger up tee shirt. That's like a special service for us. Tribute, you know, to me like that's our history. That's the history of, of, of, of soft and Canada in the u s and, and then, you know, in Buds and new Greenbury or navy seals. The green berets are kind of created by Kennedy at the same, see, look at me. I'm a fucking nerd when it comes to this stuff. So to me, you know, the, uh, I haven't been there, but I've heard about it because a lot of my friends that had been there, the Aussies, they have a parade ground, like in the middle of their compound. Have you been there? No, I've never been to Australia. They're the, the only time they use this parade ground apparently is at memorial services for their men.

Speaker 4:          00:28:59       Yeah. And I believe that no one walks on it. It's just in the middle of their compound. No one walks on. In Canada we have a similar thing where if you're on the parade square and it's not parade, like you're going on extra duty. Like if the sergeant major catches you on his parade square a, you better be have a broom in your hand or you better be on parade. And if you're not like, cause it's, cause it's usually like, oh if I go from here to there, it's right across the print screen, but it's the short route and it's like one of those tests, right then the new guys in the hallways of most units, the unit, uh, emblem is in the floor and there's one of those sergeants that just has nothing better to do but to stand there and watch and see who steps on the, and even if you're like family

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       of one of the troops, oh my hair by drip bro. And you get the knife hand, it's awesome. But when I was here, I wasn't gonna not go see the grinder cause my fucking legs hurt. Don't be a pussy. And I, I'll be honest, that first night after you dropped me off, I had a couple of drinks to ease the ease the day. Like when we left your porch and you draw me back at the, at the hotel. Yeah. Um, I, I went and I had a few drinks at the hotel bar, you know, and I, and I, I was actually toying with talking to you about this stuff back then because it was bugging me then and I'm like, okay, what do I do? Who do I talk to? Tacos? A kind of guy echoed is the kind of energy you want to be around.

Speaker 3:          00:30:21       And like, you know, and that's one of this part of this, this trip for the last 10 days I've been on is just kind of like refining. So a lot of my Canadian and American friends that have kept me on, on the straight and narrow or as I mentioned, you can did for Jody Mitic and um, you tell bro, it's a constant wrestling match, right? The little evil and the good angel, except a lot of times they high five each other. And Go, okay, let's see what happens. And um, and yeah, man, so when the legs came off, so no car. So now my mommy Uber or my staff or my ex are driving me around, all happy to do it all. Not like holding it against me, but at the same time, man, I, I'm out of sandwich meat. Hmm, okay, now I need to go to the store.

Speaker 3:          00:31:07       Hey Mommy can, can you drive my car and take me to the store? And then that's, I kind of turned my hat backwards and kind of like, you know, tried to like, you know, cowboy up and do it. But I took me again until then. My daughter turned nine, September 19th, I think it was her, I missed a lot of her birthday from being hung over and she was at this awesome trampoline place and I'm in a wheelchair and I remember getting there and being like, all I want to do right now is jump on trampolines with my, with my little girl and I can't, a and B, I'm an hour and a half late for her party. Uh, because I decided to have too many drinks last night and that was when I was like, what the fuck is really wrong with me? Because I couldn't really get it. And then what is, what is the

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       escalation? Right? So you were down here with me. Yeah. You know, we worked hard. We cause it's, it is, you know, do you want a podcast? Like when we do sit there and talk to each other about intense stuff for five hours, then we went and ate, we stayed up late. We get up early the next day we go do all the stuff that we did and you get done. You have a couple of drinks, right? What does that escalation look like over time? Where you're like, you know what? You're not even saying like, oh, I don't know if I should have drinks. You're like, hey, as soon as Jocko gets in his car, I'm getting some drinks right now. It's something that you recognized. Is it something that you just, you just said to yourself, you know what? This is gonna make me feel better right now and I've got to go to God. God, I don't remember exactly what month I was here. Do you

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       like, I don't remember. No, I know it was a warm month and ah, and Canada leg. It was cool. But it was spring or fall.

Speaker 1:          00:32:48       Well we started in December. It was 24 podcasts in that

Speaker 3:          00:32:52       December of what? 2015 so must've been spring Fort 15, 16. Yes. 16 so I, cause I remember in Canada wasn't cold, but like we were wearing still wearing down vests with food, with hoodies and stuff. Uh, when I was doing my quick podcast for I left. So at that time I was, it was just, the pain was just kinda like have a couple of drinks before bed. Right. But even that was bugging me and that's what I mean like when I was, but then like if, if, if it had been this spring where we had met, yeah, I would've been like, like this the whole time. And like as soon as Jocko has gone, I might've just like last night when we had dinner, I might have just been like, fuck it, I'm having drinks. I don't care if Jack was here because being around someone like you, like I used to be the guy who could, I don't need to drink. I'd go months and be like, oh yeah, I haven't had a drink. Like you know, I'll have a drink and, and you don't drink and you haven't drank since you were like in your twenties I think you said. No,

Speaker 1:          00:33:48       I haven't drank since I retired. Oh, okay. So last time I felt the effects of alcohol, which I felt quite strongly that the basically the day I retired. Yeah, you're the day I retired, which was October 1st, 2010 you know, of course me and the boys were, went out, we had a bunch of drinks. I woke up in the morning cause I still wake up early and I woke up in the morning and I was like, well yeah, that's done because I got other stuff I got to do now. And basically when I no longer had we'll call them friends to drink with. Yeah. Then I was like, yeah, well I'm done with that. And I just ever since then, just haven't really, I've had, and another thing is sometimes people think I'm like offended if they have drinks or whatever and I'm here, I'm not, you know, I remember actually I went, I was on the first podcast I was on was Tim Ferriss and we got done with the podcast and he, you know, we went out to grab some food because I was staying the night at his house and we went out and we got some food, we've got some steak.

Speaker 1:          00:34:46       And he's like, do you mind if I have a glass of wine with this? And I was like, Bro, I don't care. You. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:34:51       yeah. Like a reformed alcoholic. You just decided one day you're like, my dad one day he was like, Eh, this gets in the way of work.

Speaker 1:          00:34:59       Yeah. That's Kinda, that's kind of my attitude isn't really. Yeah. I mean, if I want to drink something that tastes good, then I'll drink chocolate milk, which I love the taste of. Yeah. The Jocko white tea. Right. I mean, that stuff makes me feel good and I just, um, yeah. And people ask me about a lot and I need, it's something that I need to address in the podcast because the other thing is just, I might as well dive into this a little bit right at this moment, but when I was a kid, I was into hardcore music I was into, and the type of music that I listened to was against drinking and against like it was, yeah, yeah. We're talking straight edge. We're talking minor threat. Yeah. Really? Yes, absolutely. And so it was almost, and I was, again, I was never really, I'm very, I'm very, I'm not a real good follower.

Speaker 1:          00:35:48       So any time there's some kind of a movement going on, I'm always like saying, wait, why is this move and going, why am I always questioned? I don't just jump in. I'm hard to get on board with something like that. So it was around, I wasn't like, so there's a, there's a thing with straight edge. Okay. So this, this thing was called straight edge. It started in, I'd say you'd see the, the epicenter of it was in Washington DC. The first band really to coined the term was minor threat, which is a punk band, a heartburn if I've heard of them, I assumed they were partiers. No, not at all. No. And so one of the things that, one of the symbols of straight edge was, uh, you know, when you go to a bar or when kids used to go to bars for a show for a, for a music show, if they were too young to drink once when the bounce all looked at their ID card, that they'd put a big x on their hands.

Speaker 1:          00:36:37       And so the straight edge I'm symbol was they'd put the x's on their hands, meaning look, I don't drink. And it's actually funny cause I took my two of my kids to see the white buffalo the other night in San Diego and it was awesome. And, but when they came, when they show their ids, they got the x's on their hands. And I was like, Oh yeah, it always is. So what the straight edge kids would do is they would draw big x's on their hands, meaning, hey look, I'm not drinking. So there was that. And then that of course morphed into like a gang. And there was no, by the time I was, uh, you know, middle teenager, there was hardcore gangs that would assault people that drank and would get crazy and vinyls guys and together with the Juggalos. Yeah. So it just, so, so, so when I was a kid I was okay and I wasn't like a full on, I wasn't drawing.

Speaker 1:          00:37:31       I don't think, I know I never like had x's on my story, but I, but I understood philosophically, right. What was being said, right. Which was, look, I want to win. Right. I'm hardcore, I want to be stronger, I want to be aware, I want to be alert and drinking and doing drugs doesn't give me any of those things. So at that, at that, so sorry, but even at that age, you understood the fuel that goes into the machine affects the performance. Yes. He, I didn't get that as a young man. Yes. So here I am. And, and it was, you know, I was disciplined and you know, I had a before the seals. Oh yeah. I had a band, a hardcore band. The name of my hardcore band was rage of discipline. That was the name of my hardcore band. That was af. That's what, that's what Bronson's children. Cause my first band when I was like 13 was called Bronson's children. But then as I got older I got more hardcore than it became a rage of discipline. There was also about nine, it's brunch. These children Bronson, she bronzes Charlesville he didn't drink, I don't even know. Oh [inaudible] name. We do know Charles Bronson was a bad ass. And when I was a kid

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       I thought Charles Bronson was the man because he's the baddest man on the planet. He was a tail gunner in a, you know, bomber in World War II. And he grew up in the mines when he was a kid, when he was 10 years old or 11 years old, he was working in the mines. And until he was old enough that he used to have to wear a dress, cause he didn't have parents that have money to buy him clothes. So you had to wear one of his sister's dresses down to the mind. So then he went to World War II and then he became, and you know, he's just had great movies and he always played this stoic character that was on emotional. And so I was, you know, hey, when I grew up I to be Charles Bronson of course. So then we had a band, it was called Bronson children.

Speaker 4:          00:39:12       Well, as we got more hardcore, eventually that name morphed into rage of discipline, of which Elgin James was the guitarist, who's another buddy of mine. That echo is met, who will come on the podcast at some point and tell his crazy life story, which I'm a big part of in the beginning until I joined the military. The military Jocko stories. Yeah. So I'll be tuning into that one long story. Then I joined the military. Yeah. So when I joined the military, what do I want to be? I want to be, I want to be a seal. I want to be a frog man. I want to be the best frogman I can be. I show up at a seal team. Guess what frogman do frogman drink. Okay, cool. I didn't know that. Now that I know that, give me a, give me a shot of Jagermeister cause I'm ready to rock and roll.

Speaker 4:          00:39:54       And that was sort of how you proved yourself and that's what we did. And I was immature and dumb and, and despite everything I just said about like, Hey, I'm a little bit, I'm hesitant to really follow, well now I'm in the seal teams, this is my dream job and this is what I want to do. Maybe you don't buy in, you're not in. Yeah. And it's like it's not, I don't even know if it's it just like that's the way it is. Yeah. My first drink I was 17 right after I finished basic training, I show up at the regimen and they're like, all right, what are you drinking? And I'm like, cause my family is full of alcoholics on both sides and it's nothing against them. Like, you know, Grandpa was, my other grandpa was and Grandpa's Grandpa was and you know, one of my uncles, nothing.

Speaker 4:          00:40:36       Okay. They might hear this but we all know what you do. Okay. Right. So not a big deal, but um, and dad, but dad was one of those guys, he was like, well, that just doesn't affect me. And me personally, like you as a kid, I'm like, I don't really see the interest. Like what I gotta throw up on myself and whatever, whatever. And I was one of those kids that say no to drugs, actually worked on, you know, like now I'm older and I'm like, man, I should've been smoking weed since I was like 12 and shit. But, um, I still don't, but I did. I just like, you see the effects on people. Like when I was a Bouncer, I'm like, yeah, like the guy who smoked weed, we're really mellow. And the guy that had coke and drank, like they were the ones who are the problem.

Speaker 4:          00:41:10       But, um, when I get to the regimen, the first night of parade is done and they're like, Hey, what are you drinking? And I'm like, well, I'm 17. They're like, this is an army mess. Like it's okay, just, we'll worry. We're all going to keep an eye. Like you're welcome to look. I'm not trying to tell the world like, Hey, underage people drink, but hey Andrades people drink. But it's an environment full of people that are there to look out for each other. Anyway, so I had a couple of drinks and I'm like, okay, this is the way it is. And same thing. Yeah. Work Monday to Friday, you work your ass off, you, you go hard as you can. Like you go hard in the paint, right, your, your tires or are stripped at the end of the day. Friday rolls around. Okay. We don't see it. 8:00 AM Monday morning boys and uh, you know, if you're going to drink, don't drive.

Speaker 4:          00:41:54       But if you do drink driver, that's what you got told when you, when you're dismissed for the weekend. Right? Yeah. And so basically have fun, blow off the steam, don't hurt anybody and take care of each other basically what you're told. So the seal teams definitely is a culture. It was even more when I first got in because now you're talking about the old Vietnam guys and it wasn't a war going on and it was just, hey, what are you going to do if there's no war going on and you're, you're a frog man, what are you gonna do? Well, we drank and I'm not, I'm going to look down on, I mean, we had a great time. It was funded. We, you know, it was, it was fun. It was what you did was what we did. And I'm not even trying to say anything negative about it, but that's what it was.

Speaker 4:          00:42:34       And unfortunately, there's a lot of guys, I shouldn't even say a lot. There's a decent number of guys that don't do well with alcohol man. Yeah. And it ruins, their lives are ruins their careers. And that sucks. It sucks to see. I never really had any issues. I drank when I drank. It never interfered with my one here at the time in any way. And you know, that was it. It wasn't a huge deal. And I mean, of course, I mean when I'm talking, when I was 1920 2122, I mean we drank all lot. We drank all lots of weird how your body legs, you're at that age. Yeah. And you got up the next morning, the next morning PT like it was nothing we, and that's what we did. Um, but then like I said, and even now, you know, when I, when I go out and hang out with some of my old buddies or actually it's more not want to just go and hang out with some of my old buddies, you know, we probably don't even, you know, maybe have a beer.

Speaker 4:          00:43:28       But when I go out and see the young guys, the young guys are getting after it, I don't look down on them at all. I think, you know, fine getting after it. I've found, I've found when I hung out with my buddies that are still serving, you're not in the gig anymore. You're not doing the job. So you're a little out of shape. Your, your drills are a little rusty maybe or whatever. I find on, I'm around guys my age that are still operational. I can't keep up with them drinking or because it's part of the training is part of the culture. I've fallen off. And even like before I was in, I didn't really drink. And then when it got out I stopped drinking as much, you know, and it's not like, again guys, we're not Jocko and aren't saying the military were all functional alcoholics.

Speaker 4:          00:44:10       What we're saying is it's just what we do. And you know, and remember the job that we volunteer to do, we, we volunteered or run into gunfire, uh, you know, for our countries and for fun, like let's face it, a lot of us think it's fun. I thought it was the best time of my life, but he's still got a blow off that steam and booze is really good at lubricating the, the, you know, the, the, the, the machinery of blowing off steam. So when I, when I started drinking for pain though, as where I realized, cause even the pills bro, like, let's go back to my pills. I didn't know I was addicted to the pills until I watched uh, intervention and Billy was addicted to Oxycontin. I was, like, I said, I said this on the show last time. Oxycotton that sounds familiar.

Speaker 4:          00:44:53       And I pick up the pill bottle that's next to me and I go, Oh, I'm on Oxycontin. And then they say the doses, he takes her this, I'm like, I'm on three times the dose he's on. And I'm like, that's when I went, I can get addicted to pills I get, it was so foreign to my brain that doctors doctor meet me and pain doctor go here, soldier would take this and I go, okay. And I take it no more pain. Go fight more. You know? That's, that's good. Going back to the alcohol thing is one more thing for me. I was just about to say this was, I said, hey, look, went back in the day before the war started, there was like nothing else. Like yeah, there's nothing better to do. Who's going to get drunk? Now, the younger guys, they're smarter than we were and they have a reason to be doing, they have a reason to be there and they have a reason not to drink.

Speaker 4:          00:45:42       They're like, hey bro, I'm going to go fight a war. You know, like I want to be in shape, I want to be better, I want to be faster. I don't want to get in a fight. I don't want to get a Dui. So they're smarter than they are. And that part of the culture is slowly changing and I think it's good. I think it's awesome. I think it's awesome and I hope it continues. Um, again, I think it's, it got overemphasized when I first came in over emphasized in the 90s. It was like, but it was a way because we weren't fighting anyone else. Exactly. So you drank to be a man and then you fight each other and have another platoon shows up. You fight. Those fucking guys have another squad shows up or another company. Alright. Band together. I know we were just fighting, but we'll get back to that.

Speaker 4:          00:46:20       But there's a wreck. It was an armored regimen over there. We're going to go fuck those guys. Others, there's something that I've been thinking about on this subject, which is in the military, right? Yeah. And even in life as a human, you want to prove that you're ready to sacrifice yourself for the cause. I'm, I'm willing to make the sacrifice. Well in a bazaar and kind of unfortunate way proving to Jody that, you know what, watch this, Jodi, I'm going to drink 16 show. You're not firewall. You're nice. I'll, you're not, I don't care. I would have the parts bitch and then we'd go, oh, then I prove light up. 18 line up 18 army versus navy. Let's go. That's how it's fuck away. It goes. Echo, Echo. You played football. Yeah. You were talking about that earlier about, uh, are on the show. I was listening to do. You were taking a shit with no stalls and you're saying, yeah, and football. We'd rip the doors off the stall and that's how it, oh, well I don't care. Watch me. Shit. What's, what's more aptly the word now? What's more apt to happen now as a guy to be like, hey, I can clean and jerk, you know, two 85 what can you get? And, and, and so the guys are, they're focused on something that fit is focused. They're blown out. Shoulders

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       and knees. Yeah, we'll talk about that later. But so, but I get what you're saying. Cause in the Canadian Forces, we hadn't had a war since Korea and we had the, what combat we had as I was coming in was being downplayed. We had guys take it, we had a guy, and this is history, this is proven. He took an RPG round through his chest, like just killed him obviously and everything. But his family is told he was killed in a rollover because our government was like, they're supposed to be peacekeeping wasn't in the former Yugoslavia. And I know a guy who took a sniper round through the chest as a tank commander. He was told to shut the fuck up, take your pension and your benefits got full benefits. Like it didn't, they didn't downplay what you've got if you're wounded. They just said, don't you dare tell anybody.

Speaker 3:          00:48:14       We had a, we had a unit come home after like fighting some of the most intense combat in Europe since World War Two when the Croats are trying to go through a service area and ethnically cleanse. And this is in the 90s when the Canadian like rep for peacekeeping really got, which was known since Egypt, but came back because our units and the French Foreign Legion units where the only units that were like, fuck you are not moving if you're going to f ethnic cleanse through here, you're going through us. Whereas all the other UN units ran away and they were in four or five days of like intense combat, bunch of wounded, know killed thankfully, but the government and the, and the and the chain of command where like shut your fucking mouth, go home. Like nothing happened. That's real. That's real bro. Google made act pocket Canadian Forces.

Speaker 3:          00:48:59       And you'll read all about these dudes who just like basically were like hanging out, drinking coffee, smoking butts, and telling war stories that, that never happened to be an in a war and going, Holy Shit. A buddy of mine, um, he's gonna get mad at me. He put out a book called shadow keeper or ghost keepers. I'll, I'll get the name, sorry. And I'll, I'll, and he was the first Canadian unit. Him and his unit were the first Canadian. It's into Bosnia and the shit they saw and the things they went through. It's a great book by the way. It goes. Keepers. Um, why would he be mad at you for talking about it? I'm forgetting the name wrong. Sorry about that. But the point is that at that time he was told like, you don't tell, we don't, we don't Brag is what the line that was told.

Speaker 3:          00:49:43       But really the government back home was like, we didn't know this was going to happen. Well, you don't piece keep without busting heads. Like there's a reason if you, if I want to go kill that guy and you're in my way, um, well guess what I'm going to do? I'm going to try and go through, you write like this concept of peacekeeping and you know, it was like, you know, like the guy with the Billy club. All right. Okay. Everybody keep it down here. See like, that's kind of what the politicians thought because we were college kids sometimes. Yeah. But even then, every now and then, yes. Smack one over the head with that Billy club like, and I think, and I remember my first tour in Kosovo, even we trained for crowd control. We trained for a whole lot of things, but then the final training exercises when we all went, oh, because the Russians rolled in and took over the airport in Kosovo.

Speaker 3:          00:50:31       I don't know if you remember that. Yeah. And we did a live training exercise to a joint, um, uh, armored, a full combat team exercise, like main battle tanks firing. And like, I'd never, my Dick was rock hard and you were a five. We've got 500 rounds on each other. We're just like bullets flying everywhere and like, uh, like Ray, the range control safety was like minimal, right? Cause they're like trying to simulate real combat. And then we got, but anyway, the point is that when you don't have anything to point your soldiers at, they turn on each other. And that's what we were getting at earlier. But to round out the whole, like what soldiers board soldiers are a danger echo. I think if you've been around a group of active navy seals, I think, or maybe even army guys, like if they got nothing else to fight though, just fight each other like we used to whenever we're waiting for a plane to go on a trip like this upon my youngest, like it would start off with, okay, let's see, you can hit that pole over there with a rock.

Speaker 3:          00:51:31       Yeah. Right. And then all of a sudden it's like, okay, let's see. You can hit the light with the Rock and then all of a sudden it's, hey, let's see, you can hit that car tire with a rock. And pretty soon years hired, is it whoever you bunch of idiots. Right. And pretty soon you're either having a rock fight, right, which is, which is not smart because you're hocking rocks the size of baseballs at each other or whatever. Yeah, and we were talking about wisdom, the newer guys see how we did it. But they have an enemy though. Yeah, absolutely. Like they have, we have a perpetual enemy that is not going away and so I see the guys that are in my unit now, they come in and they're like, okay, what supplements are going to keep me at my best? Zack? Like they read my book, they go, okay, so Jody, you'd stopped drinking coffee.

Speaker 3:          00:52:16       How many days before you deployed? I'd be like, well at least five days. So it's out of my system because when I'm out there getting after the enemy, I don't want to be having a caffeine crash, but if I need it, I want that piece. Did you ever get that wake up gum in your rats? No. It's like four cups of coffee in one or two cups of coffee and like when you need it, like I would keep that in my pocket till the very end. Like the Hilo might be coming to pick us up and if I didn't take it, I was happy. But sometimes, yeah, you take that in the middle of a mission and you're like, okay, I got two more days in me. Right. But the point is like they have something to aim themselves at. Right. Is at the beginning we didn't.

Speaker 3:          00:52:52       But even then, booze wasn't a big deal to me. It was just what we did. Like you said, fast forward to this fall that would just pass and I realize I'm crashing. I felt like 52 or something. You saw something. Oh you, cause I kind of caught you off. You were talking about seeing the program where they show addicted people. What's that program called? Intervention interaction. When I first got wounded in oh seven and that's when I realized I was addicted to the pills but not addicted. Like I need a pill. It was like my body would just start reacting and I would be like, oh, I'm itchy for some reason. And then that's when I started easing off and I never took a pill after father's Day 2011. Uh, but even that you read the book, I ended up buying pills from a guy in an alley once and I went, what the fuck is it like, and the system is treating me like an asshole because I want more pills.

Speaker 3:          00:53:40       And then they're like, yeah, if you want more appeals, you've got to come to the hospital everyday. You get your dose. I'm like, I'm not a fucking junkie dog. I just don't let the dose you're giving me isn't enough to keep me from feeling like shit and like, and then a mitigating my stress with the pills. So maybe, okay, so go to more therapy and that's when I started rebuilding in 2011. So come the fall. I'm still not on my legs. I, this is 2011, 2011 is when I quit the pills. Got It. And that's why I thought booze wouldn't be a problem. Cigarettes aren't a problem. Boozes or problem. You'd feel like problems. I mean, you'd quit pills, whatever. It was like, oh, whatever. When the time comes for you to quit booze, you'll just quit. That's when I'm ready. I'll be done with it.

Speaker 3:          00:54:18       Got It. And, but what I, what, what happened and if you're a politician, the most important thing, federal, uh, state, uh, municipal. So Canada state would be provincial budget money. Money is the big thing that everybody worries about in private live and everything else. So when are we talking about right now? Sorry, you're already bad. You're behind on bouncing around a little bit. I'm just saying in my mind, 2017 wasn't that big a deal as far as the drinking because I'd kicked all these other habits and I, whether it's real or not, I had an army psychologist once tell me I had an auntie addictive personality because I guess like you, like to me it's like, okay, well what's going to help me function better? What's going to get me to the next day without too many issues? And if I want to have a few drinks, I'm gonna have a few drinks and I can cause tomorrow morning I don't have to be anywhere until 9:00 AM anyway.

Speaker 3:          00:55:12       So whatever, if I'm a little hung over when I get there, I'll have a coffee and a glass of water or Gatorade and an Advil. Not a big deal. Fast forward to again, my daughter's birthday last fall. Oh daddy can't be there yet cause I'm still hung over. Right. I got my car, I and I, and it was when I realized I'm going through, I was like, I felt this before because I kept asking myself, what the fuck? Why do I keep screwing everything up? And then the budget's process started. That's where I was going with this. And that's where I remembered. I'm not cause your Jocko, you're not a private citizen anymore. You know that, right? What do you mean? Well, if you fell off Instagram tomorrow, there's a million people out there. I'd probably be like, well, where the fuck is Jocko? And I was posting less.

Speaker 3:          00:55:59       I was being less upbeat and what I did post the few last couple of podcasts, even going back to the spring on one of them, we got loaded and we said it was for fun, but I like, I needed a drink myself. Um, and uh, I'm starting to miss budget and budget is money. That's what everything runs on. The city of Ottawa has a three and a half billion dollar budget. Why isn't counselor Munich at the budget meeting for the Community Protective Services Committee, Community Protective Services Committee. Oh, he's not feeling well. His legs are bugging him. Stuff like whatever. My staff said, I'm tell it, they're asking me what's going on boss. And I'm like, yeah, I just, I need you to buy me some time. But that's when the media and the voter goes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We get it. You like to write books and you like to do podcasts, you'd like to shoot guns and you, you know you're a dude and we and we accept you as who you are.

Speaker 3:          00:56:52       But our four year commitment, the biggest part of that commitment is making sure that money is spent properly and on the things that we want it spent on and we elected you to be that voice. Why aren't you at that meeting and personal private matters can only get you so far during like the most important part of of your job, right? While either go on medical leave or be at the meeting is basically what I was told. Right. Get a doctor's note or be here. And that's when uh, I ended up doing that radio interview in December when it really came to a head and when I had to really admit to myself like I'm border, I think I was in my mind I was borderline alcoholic I guess. Um, but I was, I was just not able to deal with that failure in myself.

Speaker 3:          00:57:44       How much, how much were you drinking at the peak? It was a 40 ounce of whatever I get my hands on sometimes it was like to remember one time it was two 26 ounce bottles of Rye, of crown royal was my brand of choice and a, if that wasn't around again, Jack, Dan Lynn, you're drinking, you're getting done with work and that's it. You know, at this point I just waking up in the morning and drinking at work. Like I was just, I knew in the morning I couldn't go and then you feel like shit because you drank all day. So what do you do that you go for the hair of the dog? And that just turns into a perpetual circle. And then the wounds I was talking about earlier, they're not healing because my body's full of alcohol. And a friend of mine said, you know what, my dad used to have that problem because he drank too much too.

Speaker 3:          00:58:31       And he would like cut his hand working on like a woodwork and the shed and it would be there for like six, eight, nine months. And then he'd sober up for a couple months and then it would go away. But then he'd fall back and I went, you're dad the maniac you've told me stories about. And she was like, yeah. And I'm like, okay. So this is really becoming a problem. So now I'm dealing with the internal struggle of I'm a complete failure of a human being. I've met, failed my kids, I failed the voters, I failed like friends of mine, like Jocko and Echo, who, you know, we expect certain things from each other, right? Or we think we do. And you could, you could have a terrible day. And I would never judge you for it, but you don't know that until it happens. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:59:09       And even if you know that you still don't want to admit it, nevermind to Jocko or echo, how about to yourself? Right. And again, I'd stopped meditating, I'd stopped going to my therapist, I'd stopped going to the gym, I'd stopped podcasting, I'd stopped writing really even though, and then during the book tour in October, and I know I'm rewinding a little bit, but I, the last thing I want to do is go on the book tour. But the book is coming out and that's a commitment that I signed and you know, you're dealing with all this and I, and I did the tour in my wheelchair and everybody's like, oh, you're doing so much better cause you're okay with being in the wheelchair. And I'm like, yeah, cool. Close the hotel room door and like opened a drink, right. Have a drink. So December was the worst month of my life.

Speaker 3:          00:59:56       Getting blown up was easy in my opinion, dealing with this shit. But what I didn't do in 2007 was actually deal with the fact that I was blown up, frankly. I was so like, yeah, recover, be, be useful to the regimen, be useful. The Queen Bee get better for the country. Um, put prosthetic legs on life as normal ish. And then now I'm like, okay, first of all, now, dude, you're 40, uh, second of all your, you have kids that are now like, where the f like I would see them and they'd be like, we miss you. Like, where have you been? Like, why aren't you around more? And like you, you don't live far away. Like what's your excuse because, oh, because I'm ashamed of you seeing me all dealing with the next day of being drunk and stuff, you know? And, and it really, it really, it really became, I understand now I've, I've always been sympathetic to addicts since my oxycotton days, but now I get how depression can really make you into someone not worth saving in your own mind.

Speaker 3:          01:01:04       And I get, I get it. And I've, I've never dis, uh, I've never thought hatefully or anything of friends that have committed suicide or have gone down that path of depression that you just, if you're not in it, you don't get it. And you go, man, why can't you just like read a book or listen to some comedy or not drink today? Like have, I'll sit with you and have a water and you're like, you just don't get it. And I was doing a lot of this on my self isolation too, because you don't want anyone seeing you like this. And then the few people that do hang around are often in the same, in one of the levels of, of fuck up of life. Fuck up. And so,

Speaker 1:          01:01:49       you know, I've talked about this before where it sounds like you're describing exactly. I talk about how like people get into a place where they're basically in a storm right there, there's a storm all around their head and no matter which direction they look, they just see clouds and thunder and rain and horror. Right. And everybody that's outside that storm looks at him and they go, well yeah, you're in a storm. Just come over here and you'll be out of the storm. Just move over here and you'll be able to storm. Yeah. Just put down the drink or you know, you start working out again or whatever. You just move over here and you'll be out of the store. Yeah, but, but that person

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       can't see, they can't see the directions. Everything around them is a storm. They don't understand how me coming over there is like climbing a mountain and not to give anyone shit but maybe a little bit of Shit if you know who you are. Hey Man, uh, one to watch UFC tonight at my place. Yeah. Cool. Except hey bro, I'm in a wheelchair. I can't even get into your front door. Can you come to my place where I can get around and take a piss without getting out of water bottle and you know like being embarrassed in front of your wife. Yeah. But you live all the way over there. Like we've already got plans and shit. Like, well cool. What about next weekend? Eh, that Kinda, that didn't help as well because people like, they don't like even coming here, you're like, aw, this is buddy carry up the stairs.

Speaker 3:          01:03:06       And I'm like, yeah, I trust you. But at the same time, like some of my friends offering to carry me into their house or like 140 pounds soaking wet, never been lifted a weight in their life and nothing against them. But it's like you want me to trust my physical safety or you could just come to my place like, like, and they don't get it and I don't, I'm not mad at anyone about it. It's like a, it's like that saying like I don't hate them about it, but at the same time it's Kinda like, all right, cool man. I'll just watch the fight and we can text and I'll be at my place alone again. Right. Like, cause I didn't leave my dog. Isn't that the place where I'm at right now? Right. So that all thing just kind of fell into a big blender.

Speaker 3:          01:03:44       And in December. Um, how long did that, so did this, when you got back in your wheelchair, you gave up the leg? Yeah, this is me. This is May. So in May when you get, like I said, can we went on that long trip, you went to Albany, you come back from that, now you're now you're like dumbed down with my prosthetics. They're freaking killing me. Yeah. And I'm getting in a wheelchair back in the wheelchair. Is that sort of like now you're just, you're not, you're just gaining momentum going downhill. I, yeah. Well that and but that's a crazy thing is I thought I'm starting to climb up because I'm like finally admitting I can't wear my prosthetics cause I would like walk into council, which is the big, like every two weeks you do the big meeting and that's where all like all everything you went to the bar and drank about and then went to the office and like argued behind the scenes with each other.

Speaker 3:          01:04:33       Now you sit down and you go all those in favor, Aye. All those against the nay and then it's passed a resolution passes. And now it's illegal to eat ice cream on bank street on Sundays, which is a bylaw in Ottawa that I'm going to actually try and get changed by the way from like 18 hundreds but the point is that's the big show. Like if all the other training, right, that's the live fire exercise or that's the actual op, right? So that's what your work for. So when I started missing those at the end of the year when we're pat like the budget is the thing that if without budget you have, you guys just had a government shutdown over budget. Yup. That's what you're trying to avoid. And that's when the media who, you know, they're doing their job, but Jody Mitic and a headline gets clicks and now Jody Mitic the guy everybody loves, oh he's fucking up.

Speaker 3:          01:05:20       What's going on here? One guy even made a video called no show medic because I'd missed like four or five meetings, but the meetings I'd missed were the ones out. Like you could miss every other meeting throughout the year and nobody would give a fine fuck of a rolling donut. Which is a saying out of a book, a series of books I love but, but I miss these three meetings. Oh No. Oh no man. Like these are the meetings we really voted for you to be at where you at? No show medic. And this guy is trying to make a name for himself as a political commentator, whatever. He's an asshole. But the point is to say that shit to my face. Um, the point is he's right though. Where is no show medic and now in Ma, cause that's what I was in my head already.

Speaker 3:          01:06:04       Right. And then I'm like, okay. So I thought if I said personal family matters or personal health matters, they get it. They know me, they know I've dealing with stuff along the way. But they're like, yeah, we get it man. But if you don't tell us what's going on and then we're going to assume you're just fucking being lazy cause why else? Why shouldn't we? And I went, okay. And a and a reporter buddy of mine and I sent you a couple of texts. That's when I, and I, when you said that earlier I, my skin went like, you know, we've got the goosebumps because I forgot I sent that and I was starting to think like, okay, I gotta go back to basics. I gotta remember who I am and what I was and my own advice. And that's why I went, oh yeah, I got too comfortable in my pity in the enemy now is on my left flank and I have zero defense is on the left flank.

Speaker 3:          01:06:52       And what do you, instead of fighting a shitty losing rear guard, you turn and you face the fucking, you face the battle. So I turned and a reporter friend of mine, and for the record reporters are not really friends. Those friends that you kind of keep at arm's length and you're always ready to punch, but you never know, right? You're not really punched. But I'm not threatening anyone with violence. UPC World Weirdos. But the, he said, he called me on a personal note and he said, hey man, here's what's being said in the, in the, in the media world about you. And this is what could be going to headline if you don't say anything soon. And I, Oh man, okay, well some of that's true. Some of that's made up, but that's what you do when you don't know. And I said, all right, uh, can I come on your show?

Speaker 3:          01:07:39       And he's like, well that's what I was just about to ask you if you want come on my show. And that's Evan and we, and then we went and we talked about it and he was very kind to me, he's rough. He's a tough dude. He's a tough a reporter, but at the same time, very fair. And he hit me with a few with a few shifts and I hit him back. But what I did was I got it all out of my system because it's basically you feel like you're holding, nevermind, I'm keeping a secret from Jocko and echo. I'm keeping a secret from 40,000 residents who trusted me to be their counselor. Then there's all the fans of Jody Mitic that are out there and all the supporters who are all amazing and who all are willing to support you through the best and the worst of times.

Speaker 3:          01:08:22       But they can't support you without anything that they like to them. I just stopped podcasting for no reason and I've stopped being positive on social media. So what, like what did you just decide? Is this the real Jodie now? Is that who like were you faking it before? Like that's some of the messages I got. Like all, obviously you've figured out that you can still make money and be, be the asshole you actually are. And I was like, Oh shit. Like Jesus, it may, maybe I am that asshole. But when I did my buddy show a huge weight went off my shoulders. I shouldn't say buddy, but you know, but the point is that that was the beginning of me turning into the, into the fight instead of running. And I had a couple of setbacks, so, so hold on. So this show that you did and you, you said you listen.

Speaker 3:          01:09:07       I did listen to it, but um, the, the premise of the show was what you did, for lack of a better word, as you took ownership of everything that was going on. I even laughed a, I was laughing right before I went online. I went onto the show. I said, I'm doing a jock when I'm taking extreme ownership, extreme ownership. You went, so you went on there and you said, look, I'd like a baby. By the way. Anyone who thinks I'm a tough guy, I been drinking too much yet. What do you like, what were the facts that, what were the things that you took ownership of? Was that night? That was the major thing, right? The booze caused a lot of the lack of energy, lack of a t attempted it at attendance went down because it's one thing to be buzzed. It's another thing to be completely hung over and fucked up and show up for meeting.

Speaker 3:          01:09:56       Like you, you didn't know yourself. I know myself and I know like if I go in there like this right now, people will be like, he is completely fucked. Right. And I know I'm swearing a lot and I apologize, but you avoid that. And then so I said, okay guys, well here's why I missed this meeting and here's why I missed that meeting cause I've turned to an old friend, crown royal instead of my, my therapist and my doctors and my friends and my family and my supporters and all the things that made me able to cope from 2007 to 2017. So for basically a decade I forgot about and I left behind like never mind, never mind the g like stopped the gym, stop talking to me, therapist, stopped talking to my kids, stop talking to my ex, stop talking to my mom, stopped talking to my dad, my friends. Again, I've self isolating and there are times when I'd want to pick up the phone and just call like you or rob or um, or some of my friends at home or some of my sniper buddies and just be like, I don't know what to do.

Speaker 3:          01:11:00       And now you're man Echo, right? Sure. Imagine trying to make that call. Yeah. And I'm not saying it's a man problem, I'm saying it's a definitely a human problem, but I'm the guy, everybody thinks I get told you're the poster child of success post injury. And I'm like, in my head I'm like, I'm a fucking bullshitter. Like that's how you feel. And I'm like, whether I am or not, I've been lucky and I've made a few decent decisions on for my own accord and I am where I am through hard work and discipline and now what? And now I feel like I'm losing it all because I have, I have, I've been faking it. Was this just a ride that I was on and now I'm done and I want to get off the thing. The things that go through your head now. First of all, I, I was never suicidal.

Speaker 3:          01:11:49       I had never thought, never crossed my mind. I don't know why it just didn't. But I did have one thought one day where I went, I think I understand why some guys take that path though. I had a such a day one day where it was in December and I, it wasn't like I thought, oh, things would be better if I was dead. It was like I just, I was at such a low moment and I went, I think I get it. Why sometimes guys take that path because it's just like, you know, like it was just such an extreme combination of everything from all sides. And I went, I think I kind of get it now cause it before, I don't know about you, but I've, I've tried to figure out why some of the guys go that route and, and I just can't.

Speaker 3:          01:12:29       But that moment I went, oh okay. I kind of get it. And it was, it wasn't like I thought solution for myself, but I just is very quick as it took about two minutes of in and out. And it stuck with me though, because I went, that's the first time I've ever had any thought like that. Right. And then, so my daughter's birthday is late December and I missed that one too. And then New Year's Eve. And I've already made plans to go and do an assessment that would tell me how terrible of an addict I am as a, as an alcoholic because that's what you are. You're an addict. And I'm going to Aa Kinda sorta and my have a sponsor who's all over me. He's a great guy and I won't say his name here, but he knows who he is and he's a beautiful human being.

Speaker 3:          01:13:21       Um, and he's trying to get on top of me. And Luke is trying to get on top of me and my mom and my ex and my friends and they're all trying to just be like, okay man, like we get it. Now we've heard, we've heard your call is loud and clear now. How do we help you? And then it's trying to like mitigate that and then Ah, it's, you know, it's Christmas. I'll have a few drinks. I know I told the world this, but you know, I can handle it. I'm not, I'm not that bad. And then the next morning you're like, oh man. But then New Year's Eve, I had some company that came out cause they're like, we heard you man. We're here. It's New Year's Eve. Let's hang out. Let's be floods. Have Fun, we'll have a few drinks. We're all here to keep an eye on.

Speaker 3:          01:13:57       You can't get that bad. We know who you are. And the next morning it's like I did what? Because now all the pressure's on now to get better. And I was here in radio interviews where there I was headline news in Ottawa for a couple of days where they went. Wow. Real brave of him to say that. Now how's he going to get better? Guys are talking about me. I have to retire. Are resigned from politics. Uh, in Canada with the gun laws as they are a public city, anyone can call in a threat on anybody who owns guns, right? So some gun hating citizen, and I'm not hating them for this, I'm just hating them for being a dick. He said, oh, I can get a prominent gun owners guns taken away if I call the police and say, I think he's a threat to public safety. And that's all you have to do.

Speaker 3:          01:14:47       It's completely anonymous, which is bullshit. And anyone can do it against anyone that's a gun owner. And so now the police call and they say, listen, we have to do an investigation. So like, so that actually happened. So this was, this was right before New Year's Eve. So I'm like freaking out. I am losing my shit. And because I'm like, I don't know how it works now. They're very understanding, but they have to do the check. They look once the investigation started real or not, or, um, substantiated or not, we gotta go through steps. One does that. Okay, so they go inspect the guns. The guns are safe, the guns are where they're supposed to be. Everything's locked out, everything's proper, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. Talk to my family. Nope, he's never been threatening with them. That I love the law. And then like, and then, and then in the new year's eve rolls around and I have this terrible, this is the last I, the last drop of booze I had was new year's eve and we started with a small bottle and I drank it all myself and this past New Year's Eve, just passengers, he evicts sold towards today 2022, 23 days ago.

Speaker 3:          01:15:57       And the next morning, uh, I got a little bit of a lowdown about what I was like and I call him evil Jody. And he came out once in 2005 after my first deployment to Afghanistan, before my second one where I got wounded and I was bouncing at the time. And I was, you know, having some little bit too much fun in life maybe. But I was also drinking too much for the wrong reasons at the time. And a lot of us were because we had the cane forces, we hadn't dealt with, you know, combat a lot. Right. Like I said, and a lot of us were green, uh, when we went into Afghanistan the first time. So maybe a lot, like you said, a fair number of us, me included, where maybe choosing the wrong ways. Um, I was still meditating and all that, so mitigated a little bit.

Speaker 3:          01:16:46       But this, I call them evil Jody, he came out, my friend, why? One of my buddies who, uh, still talk to, he's a police sniper now, but he, he pulled me aside and he said, hey man, like I've never ever seen you act like that ever. No matter how drunk you were, what was going on or how angry you were, who pissed you off? What the fuck was that about? And I went, oh, that sounds like grandpa or whatever. So I locked him in a cage and I used to joke that, you know, Oh, don't let, don't let the caveman man out of his cage. And then, but that night, so the 25 days ago or whatever it was, he got out and I didn't hurt anybody and anything, anybody said things you don't shouldn't and I maybe made actions that you shouldn't. Yeah. And for me the biggest thing is when you, you realize that you had no control over what's happening and how about not even remembering.

Speaker 3:          01:17:39       Yeah. Well that's what I'm saying. You don't want, my dad did all these things. I said, what to who? Oh my God. And you're just like your thing. I, and I called, so I called one of the people that was there and I said, I am so sorry. And he was like, been there, done that dude. You gotta get your shit together. I'll be here when you're done, when you're ready or I'm here tomorrow. He was such a great guy about it. And I went, oh, so the world doesn't hate you for being a fuck up. And I at that helped too. We talked about this last night, like who, when you mitigate, um, crisis, David Letterman or tiger woods, whoever, like don't follow the Tiger Woods' book. Go with David Letterman on it. Explain what David Letterman did cause I did. So, yeah, so in, in, in a, in a nutshell, David Letterman got, he got caught in an affair on his wife, David Letterman by the way, is a, is like a talk show host at night and uh, yeah, he's not anymore, but I guess he was and he was pretty popular at some point.

Speaker 3:          01:18:38       Yeah. He was already texting. Some people don't know is a, is a golf player. So he yeah, if you haven't heard of him he's like, yeah, he's like half black, half Thai. And you know, he swung a golf club pretty good for a minute. Um, but he got caught cheating on his wife too. But so David Letterman got, uh, uh, blackmail letter right before one of his shows and the guy said, I know what happened. That it ended up having an affair or something. He had had one or he was having one and it was like, pay me $40,000 a week for the rest of my life or this or something. I'll tell the world. And David Letterman went, alright, I fucked up. And he went out. And He, and I don't remember because I did see it, but I don't remember exactly how it went. But basically, usually they do a monologue, these guys for their show.

Speaker 3:          01:19:26       And he went, instead of today's monologue, I'm gonna look into the camera and I'm going to say I cheated on my wife and she knows about it and we're working on it. And somebody else found out and they thought they were going to get money from me. So he looked in the camera went, fuck you. The police are coming to your house right now. And to the rest of you, I apologize. I'm sorry. Am I have to my wife? I apologize. And I understand. If this is a problem for us, then we will have to deal with it again because of who I am. It's world news. And does he? He owned it. He owned all of it. And uh, the other day he interviewed this guy named Obama. You might've heard of him on his new show on Netflix called, uh, I forget what the next guest or something.

Speaker 3:          01:20:07       And he was on, he's, he, he's still seen as a good dude. Right. Cause he own it. Any, any worked through it and he, and he didn't not talk about it. And then there's what tiger woods did, which is runaway hide, uh, not admit anything. And he, tiger woods went through four or five years of just complete chaos in his life before he finally even, I think now he still places in the bottom 50. I think he's at the PGA. He still plays, but he probably just plays to pay the bills now. He was worth $1 billion at one point and he lost it all because of not owning a fuckup. You'd probably still would have lost a lot of it because his wife took half. But regardless, sponsors dropped him. He himself as a human being, couldn't look himself in the mirror, I'm sure. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:20:53       And Blah, blah, blah. So I said, okay, well this is my tiger woods or David Letterman moment, like going on the radio. I thought, was it, now we're two weeks later, whatever it was. Yeah. Like two weeks later. And I'm like, well, either I never drink again or I continue down the path of bullshitting myself into saying, well, I'll just get better when I'm ready. And, uh, this journey I've been on for since I left, uh, what did I leave? I forget Jan, 18 or 19. I left Ottawa and I've just been driving. I've, I wanted to drive route 66 since I was a teenager. And, uh, you know, I talked to the kids, I talked to Atlanta, I talked to my mom, I talk to everybody that matter and I said, I'll be back first city council is January 31st after our Christmas break anyway. And I said I'll be back.

Speaker 3:          01:21:47       I'm going to go visit some people that are going to look me in the eye and tell me if I'm full of shit or not. You guys be in some of them. And, uh, when I get back, I'm going to my therapist. I already have an appointment. My, uh, my doctor's for my legs, cause I'm going back to basic training to learn how to use prosthetics again. So I don't go through those issues again. I'm gonna talk about my addiction issues. I'm going to talk about why I'm not. I'm going back to the gym. I have a diet plan already have a trainer waiting. Um, I'm, I'm going back to the base. I'm back. I'm in basic training to be a human being again. And I, I was, I was laughing this morning listening to your show about the basic training at Marine Corps base in Parris Island because I was like, fuck man, I just, I keep doing this every three or four years.

Speaker 3:          01:22:35       I got to go back and relearn what it's like to be Jody Mitic because I am evolving. B, I had to evolve beyond the soldier and then I had to print it a citizen and then out. Now I'm a turning into something else. I think, uh, because I had a plan until I was 44 I thought at 25 years in the army or 28th was 27 years, retire, become a contractor, teach shooting for the rest of my life and just be that grumpy old guy that, you know. Well, if you want to know about shooting, you talked to that guy. Be Good, decent money, right? I didn't want to get rich. I just wanted to have, pay my bills and hang out with my, my dream retirement was going to be to hurt Alpacas around on my horse with my rifle, shoot coyotes and, and listen to like gangster rap and read books.

Speaker 3:          01:23:22       Like that was it. That was what I wanted to do. But, but life has a funny way of pointing you in directions that maybe you need to go in there. You didn't know you had to go. And I'm back on the Jocko podcast, spilling my whole life and my soul out for everybody. And I hope somebody to learn this. If we keep one troop from like, listen, I have, even if you're on the road where you know you're fucking up, pull over, call in air support, like Jocko said, like you got, we have so many resources we don't know about. And uh, you know, we all, uh, I'm the, I'm the lone wolf. Well, even the lone wolf runs in a pack. And I think that that's how I've, I've thought like, you know, the soft guys, you know, we're all Alphas but we're in teams, you know, and I rolled in a team of three hardcore guys.

Speaker 3:          01:24:12       There's me and my boys and, but we at the same time I knew I had artillery support, I had air cover, I had this, I had another sniper team covering the flank over there and Ricky platoon over there and you're never alone. And even last night, like I, I felt bad. I sh I'm still in a tee shirt. I drove in all day from the tee shirt I wore the day before and he showed doc, I've never seen Jocko dressed up and I'm like, Oh shit, Jocko is like in a button down shirt and he's wearing shoes. Let's not get crazy. I had on a pair of jeans, van's a tee shirt and a flannel shirt that's, you were dressed up, dressed up. But I'm like, technically I'm like, I'm like, okay. So I haven't seen it. Seen you in two years ish, give or take a few months we've talked, but it's not like we've been on the phone for hours and been like, hey bro, what's going now?

Speaker 3:          01:24:59       Like, you know, you were busy dudes. We kept in touch the way guys I guess do. But we sat down and I'm like, okay, do I eat dinner and then tell him tomorrow or, and I just basically threw up all over you and you and you were awesome and I love you for it and I appreciate it. But I needed that hour of just talking about myself and I felt bad about it because I'm like, I haven't even asked him how his kids are. You have, I have friends that'll do, you were willing to do that. And I've done that for hundreds of guys. But then when it's you doing the talking man, it's tough and I get it now. I get it now more than anything. So guys, you need, you gotta pull over, you gotta like you just gotta take a knee and let somebody else take point for a bit.

Speaker 3:          01:25:47       And that's just the way it is. You know, all your set, you said you kind of understand when people feel suicidal, you know when you said that, no, I know and I've said that a bunch of times since it happened, but what's your question? Sorry. Let me like, do you, do you, cause I think about that too sometimes where that's the only time that we were at that thought. I don't think about me. I'm thinking like other people, like what does it take to be like, you know what I'm going to in my life. My question is, do you think that it's like that feeling is like, it's almost like this immense boredom with the, you know, how like you just don't have, it's not like this pain that I got to end. It's more that like there's really no reason for me to, it's like you're going up this hill but the hill isn't that steep, but it's just so wrong.

Speaker 3:          01:26:32       Yeah. You know, I think that's part of it. Yeah. Like it's, it's like from what I've read, the few suicide notes that I've seen when you know, when you find, like we had one, uh, I don't know if I talked about it on the show last time we, I was teaching on a sniper course and one of the guys, I was talking to him at one moment about what we're going to do Saturday cause they're all guys you work with, right? It's kind of like, I'm sure it's the same as the seals. So a lot of them that come on to sniper course anywhere guys you've picked out of the platoons and then you know, even if they pass, you still have a meeting where you go, okay, do we really want to work with echo guys? Like I know we gave him the badge, but are we going to let them into the teams?

Speaker 3:          01:27:10       And then, so this is one of the guys sold, you know, I'm getting to know him a little bit more. He's from the other battalion and a, yeah, cool man. I know this girl in town and this and that and okay, right on. And 20 minutes later, we're like, where the fuck did he go? We're doing roll call. Where the fuck is he? And we found him hanging from one of the, you know, the pavilions are out in the training area, forget shade during lectures. So he was out there and we find this letter on his pillow and I'm reading and it's about they, they feel like they're in this pain that's never ending. Yeah. And I don't think it's boredom. I think it's just this, it's The no light at the end of the tunnel feeling.

Speaker 1:          01:27:43       Yeah. Yeah. As you were asking that question, um, that the word I wrote down was, was cause we've been talking about, or we've heard from it from the last couple podcasts that we did, and it's the same thing you just said. It's hope. So when you don't have any hope that this is going to end, when you don't see any light at the end of the tunnel. And like I said, when you're, when you're stuck in this storm and everywhere you look, you don't see the light at the end of the time, you don't see that the cloud end, somewhere in the book thundering lightning will subside. You just are in a storm no matter where you look. There's a storm and they say, you know, if there's no hope of getting out of this storm. And I think that's where, that's where they started having those.

Speaker 3:          01:28:19       Luckily though, when it, when the thought entered my mind, like I get it and what I, again, I never thought of suicide, but I had the thought go through my brain where I go, I get why some people might see this as an option. Cause I did see like, cause I'm texting him, I'm texting rob, I'm texting. Uh, you know, my, my buddies in the cans off. Um, uh, at my regimental friends, my mom, my dad, my brother, most of the people that should be aware there's a problem. We're aware. Yeah. So I still had lots of light coming in, but it was my, now it's your choice. Are you going to go towards it or are you gonna stay floating where you are, I guess is a like are you going to reach

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       for the line or are you going to sit there and be like, Eh, it's just at an arm's reach. Yeah, I know. I talk about detachment all the time and this is like another situation where obviously when you're, when you're wrapped up in those kinds of emotions, right? You, you, you can't see anything else. Somebody that's outside, they're perfectly clear, can help guide you out of that. Even though it's going to be hard. And there's things that knock, understand and all that, but they can at least they know that they're outside that and they can see it just like on the battlefield. Somebody that's at elevation, you know, you get getting, rebuilding her position. Yeah. Some guys go left, go, left, go left, go right. And you're like, fuck. Yeah. So if you can reach out to somebody that can, that has a little bit better, uh, altitude on the battlefield, but you're in then end.

Speaker 4:          01:29:48       If you can reach out to them, say, hey man, I can't see what's going on, and all I see is darkness point me in the right direction and they're going to tell you some dumb shit like, hey, okay, let's get you to a doctor. Let's get you stopped drinking. Let's get you in the gym again. They're gonna tell you some stuff. That sounds stupid. It sounds well, it sounds way too easy. Yeah, it sounds way too easy. You think it's that easy fro a fuck. But you know what I what I like what you said is you're like, man, I keep having to go back to bootcamp. Yeah. And it's like, that's really, if you think about what bootcamp is, what is bootcamp? They're like, okay, put your shoes on like this. Make your bed like that. Eat this food, do this workout. That's what they do.

Speaker 4:          01:30:28       They get you on the program that Lee, it's, it's at least a success and it, and it leads to having your life somewhat sorted out. And once you get that, then you look around and you go, okay, now these bigger problems. I, if I can control these little things, I can control this, this thing that's a little bit bigger, and if I can control that, I control this thing that's a little bit bigger. If I can control that, I control this other thing that's a little bit bigger. But when you're not, you know, it's the same thing I talked about all the time with the sh the Chechens and the Russians not, you know, failing on that first war and it all started when they stopped shaving all at the same thing with your personal life, when you, when you disregard these, these fundamental things that you would do in bootcamp.

Speaker 4:          01:31:06       Yeah. When you start letting them go, well then if the little things fall apart, then the bigger things fall apart. But contrary to that, when you put the little things together, you can start putting the bigger things together and have you're doing right now, podcasts I've talked about, what did I stopped doing? I stopped, oh well fuck, I'm gonna eat pizza tonight and sit my prescribed diet that I've done for years and it makes me feel good and keeps me in good shape because fuck it today. And then the next day it's like, well, I did it yesterday. I'm going to have cocoa puffs for breakfast. And it was just a downward spiral of, ah, I don't need to go see my therapist. He's all the way on the other 10 is town. And I know my life sucks right now. Don't want somebody to tell me that my life sucks are, you know, hey, what do you talk about with a therapist? What do they talk about? What do you do there? So I'm assuming you've never know, uh, honestly, like you just bounce life off them. Or what I'm saying is if you got a guy that's listening

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       right now, yeah. That's like, oh, is it embarrassing? Not even embarrassing. If you've got a guy that's listening right now that's going, well, what the hell would a therapist tell me? Why would I not just, you know, write in a journal or, or do something like that? Do that too. Okay. I write in a journal, which I again, which I stopped doing again. The writing in the journal is like yourself check cause I go back, I was reading through my journal, I kept a journal throughout the year, Kinda, but you know, not as often as you should. And I was reading through it and I'm like, wow, I'm even bullshitting myself. And this, my last therapy session, which is right before the downward angle started, um, he said a few things to me that needed to be said. And I kind of took it to heart.

Speaker 3:          01:32:43       Like I was like, Oh shit. But basically he said, you're putting a lot of work into be in Jody medic. And I was like, fuck you man. You don't even know. You don't even know. But to like listen, like this is over a year ago. And right now I'm like, I'm still like, ouch, that hurt. But he was right. And it took me this whole time to get to the point where I'm leveling off now. But therapy is, you know, um, I think I said this to you last night, it's like tiger woods, tiger woods, bad example on how to mitigate crisis but had a golf coach his whole career. And guess when he started sucking, when he stopped seeing his golf coach. No one is an expert on life. Um, I didn't have PTSD when I got wounded. I was cleared to different therapists and a psychiatrist both said clear to PTSD, massive depression, which is normal for losing even a loved one.

Speaker 3:          01:33:37       Right. And when they you, when you lose a limb they say it's like losing a loved one. So two loved ones died when it, but whatever, whatever. But PTSD can come back. We in Canada we call it operational stress injury, which I was diagnosed with, which is like an injury. So if you sprain your ankle or break your ankle, it's an injury. One heals differently from the other right left alone. They both lead to failure. Your ankle will completely deteriorate and fall off and have to be cut out of the body or replaced if you don't treat it, if you're, um, I dunno, what do you guys call the Humvee or what do you call it? Truck. Yeah, Humvee. Humvee. Palmer. If you're a hammer blows and axle, do you yell at it and tell, just toughen up and go have a fucking drink? No, you send it in for fucking maintenance.

Speaker 3:          01:34:22       Yeah. And I used to say this to troops all the time. I'll say it again and I've said it before. I've said this to colonels and generals like, Dude, man, if you need maintenance, go and go to the fucking maintenance shop. Which is in our case, the fucking mind guy. I had a talk with the chief of defense staff, which is our not sect of a chief of staff, of the chairman of the joint chiefs. Yeah. And we were talking about combat units and I said, well, you know, and we were both getting on the floss philosophy, nickel situs things. Um, Samurai used to meditate and practice and they do practice calligraphy to perfect it. And the tea ain't a warrior. Monks of Europe would meditate or pray and fast. Um, the Mongolian hoards even had their ceremonies where they purge the demons and let it, uh, what do our modern soldiers do?

Speaker 3:          01:35:13       There's no self reflection. There's no meditation. There's no, we got to start from basic training. I've said, and I don't know if I said this on the last podcast, if I did, I apologize. I forgot my own advice again. What's rice? Rice for your body. Oh, rest. Ice Compression. Elevation. That's taught to you the first day of basic training because you're on, I remembered it. Ah, right. But that's your vehicle, right? And your vehicle is your body that gets you into combat, which is where the unit needs you, which is where your country wants you. What's race for the mind? And this is where we all as a society have to go back and think about these things like Jujitsu. Jujitsu is, it is, it is surfing. But this is my point. So when you go to a therapist, if you have no Jujitsu in your life, you don't have surfing, you don't have calligraphy, you don't know how to meditate.

Speaker 3:          01:36:06       This could be the beginning of you learning how to be of the beginning of learning rice for your mind. And that's how I look at it. But even still, I know enough about medicine that I can take care of myself for the most part without going to the doctor. But guess what now and then I hit something and I go, fuck, I need a doctor. So therapy doesn't mean you have to go every week on order like clockwork, but have someone that you're, that's your therapist or your psychiatrist or whoever, whatever level you need or you qualify for and your benefits and that doesn't mean you go see them all the time. I had a guy that I saw when I had to, but a lot of it is up to you to the individual is still a big part of this. I as an individual, this is where it hit me really hard.

Speaker 3:          01:36:54       And when you heard the emotion in my voice on the radio that day I stopped even paying attention to myself and I as an individual failed myself, my friends, Mike, Sorry, myself, my family. So my daughters, my aunts, my mom, my dad, everyone who loves me for who I am, no matter what I do. And then I failed everyone around me that, um, my friends, you guys, and this is how you feel because I didn't as an individual, take ownership of the problem. So now I am and I'm going back to therapy and born back to the gym. I'm back on my diet. I know I don't look it, but hey, I'm on the road and you know those little powdered donuts in the little thing with a coffee while you're driving. Delicious. Outstanding. You're talking about the chocolate covered ones are the those ones too.

Speaker 3:          01:37:42       I found those ones at a gas station and like Texas somewhere and they are gone. That's a pro. We don't have those things in Canada. They have them in America, but Dunkin donut donuts might be better than Tim Hortons. I'm going to go ahead and say they're better. Oh, Danny Canadian then wants to fight me. Tim Morton's is owned by a Brazilian company now. So whatever the point is, um, I'm getting back to that life that led me, that kept me in check because getting your legs blown off as a rough go. And I'll tell you that right now, but it's not impossible. But like any injury, I have a spot in my back, like mid back, just below the shoulder blades that I hurt when I was 14 and I felt didn't basic, I felt that throughout my whole career. But you work on the muscles around it and you learn to mitigate its impact on your daily life.

Speaker 3:          01:38:28       Mental injuries are the same. And I can tell you I was cleared of Ptsd, which is like the extreme mental injury. But I did have a mental injury and I forgot that. And then I had physical injuries on top of it that I basically ignored. You know, like even the mayor of Ottawa, he'd be like, hey Jody a, your Olympian today, what's going on? I didn't think you're gonna make it to this event. This is before the wheels fell off I go, yeah, Mary, uh, you know, I was feeling a little pain and I know I don't have to be here today, but then I remembered, yeah, I'm not a pussy, so I'm here. And he'd laugh. They're like, oh, Jody, you're unique collocation, that's for sure. But what I'm saying is like, I'm too stupid to stay home tonight so that tomorrow morning I can feel better and go to the gym and play with my kids like that. You know what I mean? Like it's too, too, too tough to be that dumb.

Speaker 4:          01:39:16       A lot of this clearly is ego. Oh Bro, you go as a motherfucker. And it's funny because, and I talk about this all the time, but like obviously you wouldn't be who you were and have done what you've done if you didn't have an ego that drove you, that made you want to be the, I mean, why would anyone subject themselves to going to sniper school of, yeah, it sounds like a cool job. It's, it's a shitty job at socks. It's hard to do, but guess what? Your Ego, you're like, I want to do that. I want to do the best. Donny Walberg shows you the sexiest part of the job, which is shoot bad guys, which is like so rare by the way. Like yeah, the rest of the job saw so, so you wouldn't have done, I mean that the books, the politicians, the pocket, everything that you've done, there's, there's some element of ego that drives it.

Speaker 4:          01:40:05       Obviously you want to serve and it will, you wouldn't be if it was just pure ego, you wouldn't be able to do it either because you have to have the will to serve and a desire to serve your country and your brothers in arms. So that's true too. But to take it to the next level, you've got to have some ego driving and then what? That's that thing that can drive you to success can also drag you down when you start saying, I can do anything. I can get through this. I can get through this. I don't need any help. I can keep on this path. I can quit drinking whenever I want. Those are all things that your, your, your, your, your ego is your

Speaker 3:          01:40:36       biggest enemy, but you are your own biggest critic as well. Jocko, I'm sure you have these thoughts like any other human being. Like if I fail anyone today, the person I don't want to fail is myself because you have an expectation of yourself. And I know, I know enough about you and I've, you know, we are the enough of the same guy. As much as we are different that the biggest person I'm trying to live up to expectations or my own. So when you get up at 4:00 AM every day again, God dammit. I wish I could, but I'm not built that Bro. I like to sleep. I don't have to, if I don't want to do anyway. But they'd see, listen, right now, like I can get up at three 30 the fuck wanted to. Okay. I just don't want to, I don't have to.

Speaker 3:          01:41:18       I can get all my shit done in eight hours. Cake Jocko. Uh, but your ego is the one that goes, I can do that. And then your critic is the one that goes and he can't bitch. And if you fail, the first critic that's they're looking at is the one when you look in the mirror and you go, I would do it, man. I would fucking do. I would look in the mirror. I stopped like the like, cause you know I like, I keep a bit of a beard. Most Times my beard got big and then it started growing in here and that's when you know something's up with somebody when the group, no, I'm serious right now. I know. That's like, cause I wouldn't look in the mirror. Yeah, because when I looked in the mirror, I, I saw somebody who went, you drank last night again, didn't you? Fucking loser. Good job. Yeah. Why don't you shower and go and work.

Speaker 3:          01:42:06       So this, this started coming in because even if I looked in the mirror is just enough to be okay. I'm not a complete mess. Run out the door. My hair grew. It's, it's, it's weird man. I can, I'm going, I'm trying to write this down because I, even if it doesn't come out for anybody but myself, it's, yeah, I didn't go through with the legs losing the legs and I did go through losing my legs again, but whole other thing, bunch of stuff was happening, like realizing, I know I said to soldier is dead, but maybe I didn't really realize and I had all these people looking up to me and also turning to me to have, okay, hey my buddy's in trouble. Go talk to Jodi, this guys that she's in trouble like and you're taking on all this other stuff. And honestly man self, I don't know what they call it.

Speaker 3:          01:42:58       Self care I think is what they call it. Self care is your first priority. Self-Aid we call it self self. But that's like your first person you got to take care of. And luckily my daughters are so awesome that, you know, I talked to them on the trip every day and like you okay when you get back. Yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll kick it off right where we left it off. But they're the first ones that are going to forgive you if you asked for it. And so I've asked my daughters, I told him daddy's going through some stuff. Right. You've noticed they're both like, yeah, cause kids don't get, you don't give a shit echo. You've got kids, right? Yes. Yeah. How many you got again to their, their first ones going to tell you when they were the first ones to tell me like, hey, how come you're not coming around as much as you said you would like.

Speaker 3:          01:43:39       God dammit. Daddy's really busy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You've always been busy. We want to go to the park. Um, but yeah, man, I'm on, I'm just trying to rebuild everything and, and stay, stay on the finally I think, I hope when I'm 50 I'm not going through something again because by then I'm just going to be tooled to want to deal with Shit, you know? I'm like, I'm not saying that's old, I'm just saying like, you should have your shit together by the time you're 50 I think. Or maybe I will, but at least I'll have these lessons learned over the last, since 2007 or so. You're trying to write these down. You mean you're writing down what you're going through right now? I'm writing it down and also because I am in the position I'm in, right? You know, we're, we're authors now out of anything else, like we talked, we talked about this last night, doesn't make us artists, but Kinda does write writing is an art.

Speaker 3:          01:44:27       Um, but people, if people can learn from what I'm going through, and I know others have written books and done the, gone through the exact same thing, but we all have a unique way of presenting things. Maybe I turn it into a lesson, maybe I turn it into something I read. Like I've read your book four times since it came out. I'm rereading Tim Ferriss's book again, a four hour work week because that's the direction of life that I would like to go in politics or not like doing it your way, but in a way that's smarter, not harder. And in the army, right? We learn there's the smart way. There's the hard way. And then there's the army way or in the navy, I'm sure it's the same and sometimes none of them make sense, but you get it done. But I, you know, I want to spend more time on myself, my kids, my loved ones, my friends.

Speaker 3:          01:45:16       And I think, and I said, it sounds a little conceited and a little bit egotistical and a little bit selfish, but I've realized that getting my legs blown off, maybe I've earned the right to just do it, kind of what I want a little bit more than I did in the last 10 years. And I want to hang out with my friends, do something constructive for society still. But if I want to go shoot, I want to go shoot. If I want to drive my car across America long, I just want to do that. And I think I've earned the right to have a little bit of flexibility in life to just throw my kids in the car and go, well, I actually know you've earned that. Right. And, uh, I told you that the first day I met you whenever, when you were talking about what you're doing.

Speaker 3:          01:45:55       And I was like, man, you're, you're doing way more than I'd be doing. You know, I'd be, I'd be spending a lot of times my kids, but you know, you have goals and aspirations and, and you've achieved those, you know, and you've done a great job up there and, and so that's good. You know, it's awesome to see. And if that changed directions and now you can focus on, you know, taking care of your family, taking care of yourself, which yeah. Have you earned it? How? Yeah, you've earned it, man. Well, I think what we always forget and what I forgot and I've continuously have to remind myself is I'm the beginning and the end of everything in my world. And that sounds like a self, uh, what do you call itself? Self fulfilling prophecy? No, no, no, no.

Speaker 3:          01:46:37       Self involved. A little too self involved. But if I'm not up and ready to go at 8:00 AM my kids don't get to school on time. And if my kids are late, their teacher's mad at them and then it's a snowball in their life. If I'm late, they wonder where I am. If, if I'm not at the office, my staff has to tell someone, hey, where's counselor medic? Uh, he's not here right now. Where is he? I don't know. Or they may have to make them a bullshit excuse. And even if you tell them your job is to lie for your boss, no, no, it's not. Your job is be on to work on time Jody. So self care and self help and all that stuff is, and taking care of yourself is the beginning of taking care of everyone that you feel you have a duty to.

Speaker 3:          01:47:18       Yeah. And that's ultimately what I wanted to talk about here and what I want. You know, so you know, when I, when I bust your balls about getting up at three 30 in the morning, that's what Jocko does to make sure that everything in Jockos life falls into place for those. You have four kids, Bro. I don't know how you keep up with them all. I only have two and I can barely do it. And, and so what I'm saying, when I go back to my, having my legs blown off, earns me the right to be a little bit selfish about what I do with my time. Well, I'm going to be selfish and take care of myself more, which I haven't for a decade. Well, I would expand that to, to really to everybody. I'm going to tell you what I mean. You owe it to yourself, everybody, whether you've been wounded or not, right.

Speaker 3:          01:48:00       Wherever you are in life, because the fact of what you just said, you got to remember this. If you don't take care of yourself, you can't take care of the other people around. Right? And, and so you have to take care of yourself. My simple thing, and my wife knows this about me, like if I don't work out, I'm, I'm not. Uh, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not the same person right now. Good. [inaudible] you know, but, but really, if I'm not taking care of my health, then everything else kind of starts falling apart. And so yeah, you've got to take care of yourself. And if you don't take care of yourself, then you can't take care of the people that you care about. And so that's the duty really. And that's what I wanted to talk about a little bit today and what I was saying before about if you're feeling it pull over and that's the thing, like you can't expect anything of anyone else if you can't, if you can't show up at work on time, like why should you, your staff and if you don't take care of yourself then, then why should you expect to take care of anyone else.

Speaker 3:          01:48:57       And we all have support, you know, and I'm, I'm, I know him, I don't know, I'm hammering this little too hard, but dude, I'm, I'm, I'm learning a hard lesson here and I'm trying to avoid, we all I think have to learn it, but there's like, there's, you can learn it harder than others and I think I'm learning it the really hard way because I am a public person, like, like a private in a, in Canada we call them blogging. Blogging is like Smith in the army so if blogging is having a rough time, he doesn't have to go on the radio until the world. He doesn't have to go on the Jocko podcast and tell the world, but he has to tell somebody and that's the biggest thing you think. You think it's scary to go to a therapist who is a trained professional like think of a therapist like going to the rifle range and learning from the masters sniper.

Speaker 3:          01:49:44       That's what you're doing. You're going to learn how to shoot except for for your mind, would you not go to the range to learn from a master sniper if you want to be a better shot, of course you fucking would. I F I'm a master sniper and I'd go to the range and learn from Masters Navy right now. That's what a therapist or psychiatrist or psychologist or counselor, any of them are professionals in the mental game of life. Now I'm not saying all are equal as well. If you don't like one, fire him and get a different one, but start there and start looking for the help that's available and don't put it all on yourself. And again, if you think that's embarrassing, going to a stranger, which is actually pretty easy when you actually get in the room and start talking, you find you might, they might have told you to shut up because the hours up. Um, try going on the radio or the Jocko podcast or writing a book like a, you know, I put out a lot of my warts in that book too and I'm still learning and I've got all these resources so you know, it's not, it's not, it's not. No one's too proud. No one's too tough. And I'm about done like talking. Let's talk about something fun right now bro.

Speaker 1:          01:50:51       No, it's all good man. I think you know I'm, I'm, as we were talking and I didn't, I didn't know if we were gonna do a podcast or not when you came down here. I didn't know if you want to talk about in this stuff,

Speaker 3:          01:51:00       we're just going to hang out. I appreciate this cause the whole drive, I've been thinking and talking to myself and listening to other podcasts, I'm like, I needed to do this.

Speaker 1:          01:51:08       Yeah, and really like what you're saying is going to, it's obviously it's going to help people, especially the idea, and I'm glad you talked about this a little bit, you kind of food in there, but like looking at yourself in the mirror, looking at yourself in the mirror and saying to yourself, you know what? I need some fire support here. I'm going to reach out and I'm going to get it from some people and there's not a damn thing in the world in the world wrong with that. And that's how you sort of, that was the thing. That was the thing that made you go, okay, I need help. I'm gonna go make this happen. And so it may be that can help some other people that aren't feeling too good right now. Go look in the mirror and admit to yourself, you've got some problems. Maybe the problems are a little bit bigger than you. We've been in combat situations that were bigger than us. You have to call in fire support. There's nothing wrong with it. There's no shame in it. Go make it happen.

Speaker 3:          01:51:58       Yeah. And uh, and take care of yourself. Take ownership. Extreme ownership. I like the way you think. Ah, know.

Speaker 1:          01:52:06       Um, yeah, I think that's a good place, man. I think that's a good place to chill. If we want to talk about something different, we can do that really easily. All we do is we just ask echo to talk for a little bit. Yeah. Getting some, some philosophy stuff. Charles. Yes. You, uh, you know, we want to talk about something good. Can you talk about something good? Like maybe how to support ourselves and if someone wants maybe how someone could support this podcast if they want, which we should, yeah. Juggle Krill oil and joint warfare. Here's the thing. You know how like my joints have been hurting me lately. Yeah. And sometimes you can be to some joint warfare for sure. Yeah. It helps.

Speaker 5:          01:52:45       Not In a non drug fair far pharmaceutical way. It's good. Yeah. It's interesting. But it does work, especially if you're getting physical and whatnot. General joint disintegration or degeneration. Degeneration, not disintegration. Yeah, I don't, I don't know how much you would tell with this integration. Nonetheless, Jocko. Some supplements, they're good supplements. Therefore your joints. One is Krill oil. Super Krill oil. The other one's called joint. Where for glucosomine could Jordan. Yes. Curcumin and curcumin. Desperate like cartilage. It's all right. It's joint war. No, cause you know how like when your meniscus or like your elbow like big words just talk about, I'm telling you this is, this is the truth, the real deal. So if I take this, the knee I tweaked the other night, this will help it with the meniscus around my kneecap. Yes. The, the, the joint warfare will I'm into it. Yeah. Fully. Also what we kind of talked about earlier, Jocko discipline preworkout we call it pre workout, but it's a pretty mission cause as cognitive enhancers.

Speaker 5:          01:53:53       Pretty mission. I love this. Jodi's checking it out, fired up about it nonetheless. That's good. That's good for anything you're about to do. So we say pre workout, it can be pre study, pre exam, pretest, three, uh, three podcasts, podcast, whatever you, whatever you like. It's good. Unless you can get two scoops. Don't be a pussy. Take two scoops guys. I come on led. What are we saying here? Sorry. Sorry. No, not at all. I had, I had a real long right. The other night of of work. Did you take them and I took three. Yeah. Yeah. What do you normally take? Two. Two. So what do you, what are you weighing in now to 20 no, probably two 32 32 scoops is enough for you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So I'll stick to two scoops for now. Yeah. But I might ramp it up to four if I really have to be careful.

Speaker 5:          01:54:45       Make sure you have something to do like a project. Like don't just take like writing a bucket. Yeah. That's due to right. No, that's a great time. Yeah. If you have to. Right. And then do you find it, does it make you jittery? No, no, no. [inaudible] smooth. But you got the energy. It's got caffeine is pretty low. Caffeine is very low. The same caffeine is Jocko. White tea is the same amount, so per scoop. So you'll get double that. But it's not. It's 15 milligrams, so it's meant to not make you all jittery because you can't, that's not good. Everything else I'm reading in here and what little I do know about nutrition. This is all stuff for focus and longterm, like energy release. Yes. The only thing missing that I, I don't, I don't know. Science is B vitamin. Is that in there already?

Speaker 5:          01:55:30       Missing it. That's what I know. So turning 40 means I have to wear glasses now too, by the way. Perfect. I know what to smaller, my perfect just in case sniper vision I think is good for long distance, but now I'm like my dad. I'm like, yeah, you got to find the sweet spot. That's what it is in there, right? Because your eyes can't like f l two S or whatever. I'll be taking, can I have a case? You can have that right. The street. I'll just keep, I'll just keep this right here. Actually. That's good. And surprisingly, tastes good. You wouldn't expect doctors to be like [inaudible] very hyper about making things taste tastes like crap. Then my life is hard. Food should be tasty. Yeah. I dig it and I understand that. But you would, why chalk then you can drink. So you're saying it's out of character for me to watch them in line.

Speaker 5:          01:56:15       I think that's the dichotomy of you, cause I heard that before. Even like with how you said you don't drink coffee, you're like, I just, I don't like the taste of coffee. Why would I drink? I'm like, oh, all right. You don't like there's taste not rough. You don't like the taste. You don't like the taste. Right. And I made fun of when I did drink, my friends who drink beer because that's Canadian is to drink beer and I'm like, beer tastes like shit. I'll drink cider. Ooh, the apple juice. I'm like, it's got more alcohol than beer bitch. Like it's what, what do you like if he doesn't like coffee? He likes white tee. I think white t sucks, but I'm not Jocko, we got this, I'm making this protein powder right now and like criteria number one was you had has to be good protein and all that.

Speaker 5:          01:56:57       But the strong second criteria was it's got to tastes so damn good. Which I forget you're drinking protein. I the first sample tasted really good. Like I was shocked at how good the first substrate. We tweaked it a little bit. The second sample came back. It tastes even better. I mean, one, hang on, how much sugar we talking, there's no sugar. Oh No, there's no guy that used to be the trick. Just proteins. So good, but it's 30 grams of sugar, no sugar, and then the F we've got one more coming back, but the second iteration of it tastes delicious and equity. The samples left no echoes yesterday. He's like, he's like, well, you know, I don't never really liked protein powder, and I'm like, Bro, this has nothing to do with you wanting to drink protein powder. You'll be drinking this like you want a drink.

Speaker 5:          01:57:41       It'd be like, it'd be like chocolate milk. It's so good. Yes. Yeah, so we'll see about that one. That one. It's where can you get all this Shit Echo? The proof is going to be in the pudding as they say, or Jim [inaudible] dot com that's where you get it. also@originmain.com you can get you, we'll get Keith rash guards is for Jujitsu by the way. Oh yes sir. Made in America. I know Jody is from Canada. Better than made in somewhere else. Yeah, I know a lot of us have a candidate. We don't have time to make geese and stuff like make it in America. There's 10 times more people down here. Yeah, I dig it and all this stuff on there. It's made in America. That's good. Yep. Go there. See if you want something, get something good way to support also fitness gear. Jocko got a new kettle bell that is heavier than mine.

Speaker 5:          01:58:31       Does it? His head is it, is it, is it your little head that you got on this? They might as well be doing. My Dad is the greatest. If nothing else comes from this, from this little Avatar of you because I want him to Jocko approved like an amulet of your head. Yeah. This shirt. It has one right in the back. Okay, cool. Yeah, it's good. Yeah. They'd kettle bell should be his head. Cause the reason he got it was because I had a heavier Kettlebell by happenstance. By the way, I didn't get there. Everyone just, sorry. Is this a Kettlebell I can buy from Jocko? Jocko bought a bag or your kettle was about to say, which it reminds me every time I'm about to talk about kettlebells. Kettlebells I have, you know the ones from Onnit. Yeah, I got all of them. Yeah, me too.

Speaker 5:          01:59:11       Except I don't have the big foot one, two bad eggs. I can't pick that one up. It's just too heavy. Yeah. Prosthetics. Yeah. No I dig it and I haven't picked up anything for over a year anyway. So that's what I was trying to imply to Jocko that like since mine is heavy I can pick it up. He can't pick it up, et cetera. Two pounds. Everything is. So that's why he got the heavier one. Roger that. Yeah, I'm tracking now. I'm dragging her in six pounds. Yeah. Congratulations. Yeah. Cause this was a custom made kettlebell. No. Got It from rogue fitness. Rogue, right? Yeah. My boys at rogue fitness. But it's like made in America. It's like the boring round one. You know, you said you have the, um, I got the ones. Yeah. That's why I thought you meant the Jocko was coming out with a, with a Kettlebell.

Speaker 5:          01:59:50       I, she will obviously it's going to be shaped like Jockos. [inaudible]. That's my, that's my, because they could do that and now I think a product was just born. Yeah. Maybe. Actually someone, someone said that a couple of times. Anyway. I agree. I agree. It was the longest commercial. Everybody, it's not a commercial you, we deviated from the commercial to Roger, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, we're supposed to do that. Okay. That's part of the Deere, right? I know. I forgot. I told you I'm in basic training for life again. Nonetheless. Back to the kettlebells. If you get kettlebells.

Speaker 2:          02:00:20       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:00:20       In a way that's not competitive with your friend or if it's competitive with your friend, whatever, the ones from on it. That's the cool ones. Judy, as a whole set. I have the whole set. If you have the whole set, you're cool. Like us, not like Jocko. Also when you get Jody's new book, of course chocolate's book. Any of the books we read, go or go over on the podcast. I made it easy for you got a section on the website? Yeah. Books from the website. Got them all listed by episode by the way. Nice. Speak through there. Get them through there. Real easy. A good way to support as well. That'll take you to Amazon. Just say sorry real quick. Unflinching the making of a Canadian sniper and everyday heroes. Yeah, my two books. They'll both be on the website. Yeah. Write down your website and they are available through Amazon and what's the kindle? They have recalls on kindle. Kindle. That's Amazon too a think. Yeah. Everywhere at like audio book. Yeah. This stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well I'll have it all on the website, so yeah, when you get that boom, click through there. It's way easier for you. Fence, good way to support. If you want to continue shopping on Amazon to buy your weed whackers and what else? We buy an Amazon. Go ahead and do that too. Good way also.

Speaker 2:          02:01:30       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:01:30       subscribe to the podcast. If you haven't already. Seems normal. Seems obvious. Itunes, if you want to subscribe as far as subscribing those, it's about like what you listen. Do you listen to iTunes? Oh yeah. That's what it is. Exclusively. Exactly right. Some people they listen to Google play. Can you subscribe on Google play though? Okay. That's what I was getting at. I don't know where else I get to spend. It's the same thing. Yes, I do that and then now there's different apps now. Like they're basically stopped. You're confusing. This is, okay. Consider it this way and I, this is, I'm new to this too. Where iTunes when you think podcasts. Yeah, I iPod podcasts. So podcasts are exclusive to iTunes. It just feels that way. Right. Where do you listen to podcasts? Well, on iTunes obviously. Here's the thing, podcast, the podcast, just cause I tuned has, it's like if you watch out, if I just went to the website, what's your website again?

Speaker 5:          02:02:22       Jocko podcast.com. So if I go to Java, podcast.com could I listen straight from the podcast? From the story? From the website? Yes. On my computer. Yes. Bob's, your uncle. Boom. There it is here. And uh, I did. Yes, I did not know that. There's basically all these different ways to listen to it and it whatever way you choose to listen to it, there's where you subscribe in the event of these things offering the subscribe option, which I think they all do. I'm not sure cause I don't explore all of them. It's just how it works. So what I'm saying is if you want to subscribe, subscribe, good way to support also on Youtube, which we have a youtube channel by the way, Judy medic Roger that not just the video version of this podcast, but excerpts and various creative videos here and there and some outtakes.

Speaker 5:          02:03:11       By the way, I'm not many, but a few. I'll put more up there. Also, Jocko has a store, it's called Jocko store chocolate store.com. Obviously that's where we get, or we make these shirts. Jody see this shirt Jocko has on right now the victory MMA and fitness. Yeah. He always says that turned on by the way. He does that. Well, not last night. That's why I was there was underneath my Roger that. Yeah, I was gonna say, how did you even recognize? That's why I wore my friends. So this is a tactical beaver shirt and it's a Canadian company. Started by cans off guys could dudes. I was going to wear this last night. Yeah, but I didn't, I thought jogger would show up and tee shirts so I stayed in a t shirt. Yeah. Yeah. And anyway, so now he's in a tee shirt and I'm in the color.

Speaker 5:          02:03:54       You're all dressed up. Damn man. Anyway, that's the tactical beaver was my last podcast. If you listen. Yeah, they were on the show. It's good. It was pretty dope. You know what else is dope? The shirt Juncos on and the shirt I have on with chocolate hit on it. And if you want this shirt, Jocko, store.com there's a lot of shirts on their disability. I have a green and black one in my suitcase back in the hotel of that one. Boom. I thought it'd be weird where and your shirt hanging out with you though. Yeah, I thought so. But there's a deeper meaning. I think the fact that Jockos head is on my shirt and I'm sitting now, you're part of this show, so you gotta wear it. Oh, I'll wear it if there's an echo shirt. I need five immediately. I have four friends and myself that want that shirt.

Speaker 5:          02:04:35       Oh, all right. There you go. You got it. Sorry man. I've been, I've been unplugged since May. Basically. Sorry man. You got to unplug sometimes. That's my, that's it. You know what? And that's going back. Yeah. I think plug, I'm going on Facebook while personal. I'm going to keep the business side, but you got personal stuff is goes anyway. Can finish what you're doing. I'm sorry. I know you're part of what we're doing. I'm not gonna read a list of things that you should or should not do. I'm gonna be, I'm gonna ask you about it. I'm massive Jocko about it. Chocolate. Tell me to hurry up. I may or may not hurry up and whatever. That's how it, that's how it always works. Nonetheless, Jocko, store.com any shirt you want and I need to shout, I'm going to go into that right after the show.

Speaker 5:          02:05:13       Yes. There's also some patches on there, some hoodies, rash guards, hats, women's stuff on their kids. Stuff on there. It's a good, good thing he's a beanies are on their way. If you go like well, you figure well, beanies could very well be on there. They're on there. Do you wear a beanie when it's cold outside? When it's cold out? It's not a fashion statement for you. Okay. Just checking. I was here to win, man. Here. The wind, no fashion. No, sure. It looks good though, Bro. For sure. Anyway, chocolate store.com I'm not saying go buy something. I'm not saying that, but you should, but if you like something, you get something that's a good way to support. Also, I don't know if you know about this. You might, I dunno. Psychological warfare. Is that ringing a bell? I mean, I know what it is.

Speaker 5:          02:05:56       Is this something that's an unfortunate statement? Yeah, so psychological warfare is an album that we created with tracks. Jocko turn. Ah, playlist. Yes. A platelet playlist. Yeah. I prefer mixtape. Mixtape. Yeah. Yeah. Mix tape of Jocko was hurt. Yeah, essentially. But here it's for a specific reason. Right, right, right. It's not him playing the Ukulele. Ukulele. No, indeed. It's him telling you how to get through certain weak moments. Oh, is it his is his moment, his videos? No. No. Better. More specific. So here, here's what it is. Good. I'm actually glad you don't. You don't know the specifics of it because they'll can talk about it for 28 minutes. It's actually number one on iTunes by the way. But you know, oh that guy downloaded that. I never listened to it though. Sorry Bro. You don't need it. I just wanted to for my friend [inaudible] you gave the support.

Speaker 5:          02:06:48       Yeah, that's okay. But I probably should have let it support you too. I probably should have this really what it's for to support you. I used to, you know how like, you know when you work out and you don't feel like working out or you go to workout and you don't feel like Philly that for the last 18 months with, you know what? I'll do it tomorrow. Yeah, I've been saying that his last October. All right, with you. Well they over 2016 I've been saying that. So they got, I thought that was my biggest weakness. I come to Jocko, I said, what are you doing? You don't feel like working out. I mean I know. Cool. Your top work out. Yeah. And then will show, but there's more to it than that. It's not that simple. You know? And he explained it. I said, you know what we're going to do?

Speaker 5:          02:07:24       We're going to record that. And is that, that was the birth of the psychological warfare. Exactly what it is. I did download it actually when it came out, I just, I forgot I even had it look at the tracks. Here's what you do. Look at the tracks and be like, cause it's not just missing workout. It's like procrastination, uh, on a pro at that now. Yeah. So like I got my black belt and procrastination bro. Yeah. So consider one that you're like, okay, not only will it help, it will 100% get you through it, Roger that it's been the case for me anyway. Get in. You can get that on iTunes of course, and anywhere where they sell mp3s, Amazon music, whatnot. It's a good one.

Speaker 1:          02:08:03       Couple other things on Amazon. You can get Jocko white tea. It's no big deal unless you want to dead lift 8,000 pounds minimum. Then you drink Jocko white tea and you're there. No questions asked. 100% guaranteed that though if you want to get some books, you can get Jody mix books. There's two of them. Unflinching the making of a Canadian Canadian sniper and also his latest book, Everyday Heroes, which is war stories from the generations edited by Jodi. You get way of the warrior kid so you can teach kids to do the right things in their lives. You know things like beyond the path, it's all, I'm going to say discipline equals freedom field manual. That book. Yeah. It's about getting on the path and staying on the path. That's what it's about. Not going to say anything else about that one. I will accept for that.

Speaker 1:          02:08:58       The audio version of that book is not on audible. It is on anywhere. You can get an MP three which means iTunes, Amazon music, Google play, and then of course the first book, extreme ownership, combat leadership. There's a new version out. It's black, which makes it a little bit cooler. You can get that. Learn how to lead. Also beyond the books and the podcast. If you need leadership, let's say leadership guidance and direction at your company, at Your Business or at your team. I have a leadership and management consulting company. It's called echelon front and that is what we do. We'd come to your organization. We assessed the situation and we get problems solved through leadership. It's me, it's my brother Leif Babin that wrote extreme ownership with me who was one of the platoon commanders that served with me in the battle of Ramadi.

Speaker 1:          02:09:58       It's JP Denelle who was the point man and the lead sniper of Delta platoon in the battle of Ramadi. It's Dave Burke, who was an f 18 marine corps fighter pilot, top gun pilot, top gun instructor, top gun, senior instructor, F 16 pilot f 18 pilot f 35 pilot f 22 pilot first. He sounds like he's pretty good at his job. He's not bad. He's the first operational squadron commander for the [inaudible]. He's the only man in the world qualified to fly all those aircraft. But none of that matters because what he did was cool was he was on the ground with us in the battle of Ramadi as a Anglico team leader with his team and was, uh, with what, what is an Anglico? It's, it's the guys that call for fire. They, yeah, they're Jay tax book. The Marine Corps has Anglico, but they call it Anglico air naval gunfire liaison.

Speaker 1:          02:10:59       Roger that. Yup. And that's what he did for us. Outstanding Guy. He's been on the podcast number 60, number 69, I believe. So he's part of the echelon front team as well. Also on top of that, there's the muster is the leadership seminar with us, the Echelon Front team again, uh, in 2018 we're only doing two masters. People think we're going on with rock and roll tour. We're not going on a rock and roll tour. We're not going city to city is not going to happen in Cleveland. It's not going to happen in Milwaukee. It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen in San Diego this year. It's an alert. Can we go to places? It's going to happen in Washington DC, May 17th and 18th so that's where you go. If you're on the east coast, east of the Mississippi, you come to DC, what day?

Speaker 1:          02:11:53       May 17th and 18th if you're west of the Mississippi, you come to San Francisco October 17th 17th and 18th that's it. Like I said, we're not going anywhere else. So the reason is because we don't have time to do them. It's to get all the echelon front team together and set it all up. It's very hard to do because we're working with clients all over the country and all over the world. So we can't just do musters all the time, so that's where we're doing two of them. If you want to come sign up, all the four of them we, we, that we've had so far have all sold out. These are going to sell out to 100% so if you want to come, you've got to go and register to attend extreme ownership.com can I reserve two spots where you knew in Washington? Yes, you can. All right, cool. Cool, cool. We do. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:12:46       Jody plus one until then, until the muster. If you have questions or answers for us or you just want to check in and share your wins. I noticed people do that now on social media. You share the wins. Yeah, I got this promotion. I overcame this little situation. They give a little brief on the situation. Hey, I had this guy that was acting wrong. I took ownership and boom, problem solved. I lost weight, I gained weight. I got a stripe on my white belt in Jujitsu and I'm proud and I am proud. I'm stoked when you get that stripe on the white belt or the blue belt. Sometimes people get the black belt brown belt. But what we see is progression. Yeah. Like I said, people lose weight. People gain weight. People stay clean. People stay off the sauce. People stay off the drugs. People stay on the path. And if you want to check in with us about that stuff, you can do it on Twitter, on Instagram and on Dat Pham Bull Hace Blah. Jodi is at Jody Mitic, j. O. D. Y M. I t. I c echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jockowillink Echo. Any closing thoughts? No. Thank you for coming on and it's great to see you again. You too bro. Mr Jody Mitic, you got anything else?

Uh, I know you did this cause you didn't have to cause you wanted to and I appreciate that and I need to do this. Let go of, uh, as always, you should stop drinking, by the way. Um, I mean, now that I'm a reformed drinker, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's the answer to everything. Yeah. Just stop it. Just stop drinking. Surprisingly. It's the, it's the big answer. It's a good, a lot of philosophy. I agree with, you know, if you look at that study that comes out, I forget who does it. I think it's the UN at the most destructive force on earth is alcohol above coke, heroin, speed, crack at all.

Speaker 3:          02:14:53       Put together. Booze is still 10 times worse, like when it comes because it's available to everybody. Right? Yeah. Um, I should thank everybody that been with me through this. You know, sometimes you think you're alone and you're not a, I've had friends and family that have not stopped. Basically, you feel like they're bugging you, but they're not. They're keeping an eye on you. Um, uh, and all the supporters and the fans and the, and just the, the, the Jody Mitic fans. Thank you for being there for me. Thank you for being honest with me and thank you to my friends. And my family for putting up with me. And, um, I fell off the path if I lost my bearing pretty bad. Uh, but now I've reoriented the map and I'm back on track and, uh, give me, give me some time. The Jody Mitic podcast, we'll be back up and running in short order.

Speaker 3:          02:15:46       Give me six weeks ish and we should have to be pumping out some episodes. Who knows? Maybe I'll fly Jocko up to Ottawa and we'll do an episode. I don't know. The point is something will be coming and there's a few hardcore, I'm talking granite hard fans that have like stuck it out and they send us at least a tweet a week to be like, where are you bitches at? And we're coming back quick. Um, just real quick, shout out to my friends at tactical beaver. If you want some of their stuff, just go on tactical beaver. Yes, like the animal. Uh, you can get some of their gear. It's pretty cool. A Canadian twist, a Canadian flavor. And if you're, if you're the one guy in your unit that has it and you're not Canadian, you might be a, you might be popular for a minute.

Speaker 3:          02:16:25       But, um, and uh, you know, and the last thing, uh, goes out to my kids ala and Kira Ala's nine peanut curious, six squeaky. Uh, they're waiting for me at home very patiently. And uh, as soon as daddy's home, we're going to go to Jujitsu because daddy needs to learn too.

You can edit that in, right? Sure. Um, I know I've said sorry before I'll say it again and again. Thank you. I will say over and over again for supporting me and it's because of people like Jocko and rob who you'll meet who's a green baret and some other very special people in my life that I am found a reason to get back to being myself in.
