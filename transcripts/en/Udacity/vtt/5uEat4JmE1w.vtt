00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.990
Now, not every fraction is so easy.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.510
Some go on forever.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.870
For example, let's say we want to
convert one-third to a decimal.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.510
Let's try doing the same
method we did before.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.050
So this is the same
thing as 1 divided by 3.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.420
And again for precision,
we'll add a few trailing 0s here,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.480
and we'll add a decimal
point right here.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.602
So how many times does 3 go into 1?

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:30.901
0, and how many times does 3 go into 10?

00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:31.880
That'd be 3.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.413
3 times 3 is 9.

00:00:33.413 --> 00:00:36.571
Let's do our subtraction, and we get 1.

00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:38.495
We'll bring our 0 down.

00:00:38.495 --> 00:00:42.500
And now how many times
does 3 go into 10 here?

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.010
Once again, it'll go in 3 times.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.826
And we get 9, we do our subtraction,
and what do you know?

00:00:47.826 --> 00:00:49.530
We get 1 again.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.393
Bring down our 0 and same as before,
3 goes into 10 3 times,

00:00:54.393 --> 00:00:56.660
and it looks like
there's a pattern here.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.225
It looks like we could just
keep going on forever and

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.580
we would just keep adding more 3s.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.050
And in fact, that's true.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.910
This is called a repeating decimal.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.770
It's called a repeating decimal
because the 3 here repeats on forever.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.638
So we can write this a couple of ways.

00:01:13.638 --> 00:01:22.060
The fraction one-third is equivalent
to 0.3 with a bar over it.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.217
The bar over the top here means
that the 3s go on forever.

00:01:26.217 --> 00:01:30.120
But because there's a bar,
we don't have to keep writing the 3s.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.127
Sometimes this is also written
as 0.33 with a bar over it.

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:36.630
It's the same thing.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.960
We could also use rounding, and if we
decide to round to two decimal places,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.710
that means we look at these two 3s,
and we move over to the right one.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.313
And because this is less than 5,
we can just ignore it.

00:01:54.313 --> 00:02:02.178
So I will use this symbol which
means about equal to 0.33.

00:02:02.178 --> 00:02:06.220
We rounded off all the 3s
after the first two decimals.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.697
We can write one-third is
approximately equal to 0.33.

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:14.475
Now can you tell me what is
one-seventh as a decimal?

00:02:14.475 --> 00:02:17.600
Round your answer to two decimal
places and enter it here.
