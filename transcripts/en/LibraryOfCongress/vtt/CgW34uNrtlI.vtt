00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.190
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.690
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: I'm
very pleased to introduce

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.930
to you today Nora Ikstena.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.210
To give a few biographical
details about Nora,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.170
she was born in 1969 in Riga.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.990
After obtaining a degree in
Philology from the University

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.810
of Latvia in 1992, she took courses

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.640
in English literature
at Columbia University.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.850
In 1998, she was guest
editor of "The Review

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.650
of Contemporary Fiction" issue
dedicated to Latvian fiction.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.950
Nora Ikstena is the author of
a number of novels including

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.790 position:56%
"Celebrating Life", 1998, "The
Virgin's Lesson", 2001, "Amour Fou",

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.340
2009, "Besa", 2012,
and she has a new novel

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.980
out called "The Mother's Milk".

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.550
And so, I think that's five novels.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.400
Is that what-- is that the count?

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.230
But she's also written books of
fairy tales, biographical fiction,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.440
nonfiction, essays and so on.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.070
She's won many, many literary
prices which I won't name them all.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.710
Her books have been translated and
published in Lithuania, Estonia,

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.450
Sweden, Denmark, Georgia,
and Canada and I also heard

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.640
that she's just been translated
to Hindi for the first time.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.940
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: Yes--

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.170
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: So,
that's quite an achievement.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.650
She has one book that has been
translated into English and that is

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.450
"Life Stories" and we'll
be hearing more about

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.000 position:56%
and from this book in a few minutes.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.200
And with that, I introduce the
translator of "Life Stories"

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.960
which is Margita, who
is Margita Gailitis.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.170
A few details about her.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.510
She was born in Riga, Latvia.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.800
She's a poet in her own right

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.630
and she's the translator
of many Latvian works.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.890
She immigrated to Canada as a
child, hence, her bilingual ability

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.680
in both Latvian and English.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.250
And she returned to Riga in
1988 to work at the Translation

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.110
and Terminology Center as part

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.880
of a Canadian International
Development Agency initiative.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.900
So, we have both author
and translator here.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.610
And we have the book
that's available

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.130 position:56%
for purchase down in the sales area.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.640
Now, your program list, it says,
this is going to be an interview

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.930
but we have a pleasant
surprise for you.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.900
We are going to actually
have a reading.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.640
This book, this briefly, is a
collection of eight short stories.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.770 position:56%
And Nora is going to read one of the
short stories here, a part from it.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.560
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: So, the
two of us are going to read.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.860
&gt;&gt; Margita Gailitis:
Two of us, yeah.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.160
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: Together.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.460
That is so much the better.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.890
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: Good evening,
it's an honor to be here.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.480
So, we will be reading from
my story "White Handkerchief"

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:10.350
and this is a story about old man
living in a suburb in America,

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.420
who went exile from
Latvia after World War II.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.590
And it's a kind of
story about living

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.020
with your own language
in a different context.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.730
When your-- Language is around
is different and you need to be

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.150
in your new context but somehow
you fail your own language

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.840
as your own home.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.780 position:56%
And I think this is a very important
case because I think not only

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.360
for the writer, for
human beings in general,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.800
language is their only home.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:54.670
And of course, it's also about the
freedom and the cage in the same--

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.620
as a same thing, like
you are feeling yourself

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.800
in a cage being trapped
in another language

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.680
and you feel yourself free being

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.690
in your thoughts with
your own language.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.040
And we will be reading
together with Margita.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.120
Margita will read the English part

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.050
and I will read some
Latvian words just for you

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.540
to hear this very old
and poetic language.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.210
The roots come back to Baltic
languages Indo-European languages

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.030
and also to Sanskrit.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.570
So, we will read that
kind of a part.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.500
Almost all short story and then
we will make some conversation.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.800
So, enjoy.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.950
&gt;&gt; Margita Gailitis:
"The White Handkerchief".

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.520
The morning mist drifts as
yet slowly over [inaudible].

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.080
Soon, very soon, the
sun will cut through it.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.410
That's how it is, at
least, until Martinmas,

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.090
the day that marks the end
of the period of all souls.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.560
After that, the mist vanishes
somewhere, it turns colder

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.220
and sometimes, the first snow
falls even before Christmas.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.250
Alone, he does his morning
chores in the large empty house.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.360
Only Bagar [assumed spelling] the
large black tomcat rubs himself

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.010
against his legs.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.730
Bagar came to them from the woods.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.040
In the beginning, he
was timid then kept

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.660
to the machine shop devouring the
food left for him only at night.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.920
Then slowly, he grew friendlier,

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.310
until finally he became
a regular house cat.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.600
[ Foreign Language ]

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.090
He talks to the tomcat in German.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.910
Alzheimer's has made his
German wife's mind childlike

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.800
and she is now in an
old folk's home.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.880
The home is not far,
only about 10 miles

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.500
from Vanattan [assumed spelling].

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:10.080
He often drives there but there's
not much sense in his visits.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.850
She just sits in her
comfortable wheelchair

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.150
and stares at some distant point.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:23.340
The doctor says that her brain
is like a moldering autumn leaf.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.140 position:56%
But the care she gets there is good.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.260
He had tried to look after
her right here at home

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.110
but she fell and broke her hip.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.670
It can't be helped.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:40.680
Each of us must carry our
own cross to the bitter end.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.250
The mornings and evenings are sad.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:49.910
The days he feels in somehow,
now and then his sons visit him.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.010
With them, he has to speak English
because they've forgotten German.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.320 position:56%
When they were small, his wife tried
to teach them German but as soon

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.600
as they started to attend American
school, the language vanished.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.170
He talks in Latvian to himself.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:13.040
No one else in his life has
had any use of his Latvian.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.030
That's how it's turned out to be.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.050
He lost his legs serving
in the Latvian legion.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.510
Latvian women didn't
want a cripple like him.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:31.140
[ Foreign Language ]

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.170
So many words for cripple
in Latvian.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:39.430
He found himself a German
woman and took her to America.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:44.120
She was very much didn't want
to go but whoever asked her.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.760
On the whole, he hates the
Germans as much as the Russians.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.000
Deep down, he can't rid
himself of the feeling.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.840
Between them, they
made minced meat of us.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.830
His inner voice bluntly tells him.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.730
The worst was the first half
year in the New York suburb

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.580
on the other side of
the Hudson River.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:10.220
The days spent on those stones with
the blacks who hated the whites,

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.260
the whites who with hate
turned away from the blacks.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.820
On Sundays, he was able to meet
with some old work [inaudible]

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:22.660
who would then stuff themselves
with sauerkraut and sausages,

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.920
get drunk in wine about the past,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.010
but nothing could be
changed anymore.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.780
So, he stopped meeting them.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.800
He started looking for
cheap land in some remote

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.080
out of the way American
village, and he found it,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.010
the mountainous Manhattan.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:47.550
He came here for the first time
in autumn, pristine countryside,

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:52.010
farm colored fields, mountains
clad in purple and gold.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.630
A heavy mist momentarily pierced

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.760
by the sun not a house
for miles around.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.990
This was the place.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.620
He bought land here and
started to build a house,

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.940
everything would be their own.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:12.630
Fall asters, potatoes and
black currants in the garden,

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:18.660
a piglet in the sty, roosting
chickens, two dogs and a cat.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.020
Having fried up two eggs with bacon

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.060
and brewed some chicory
coffee, he feeds Bagar.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:29.800
And then goes out on the small
terrace to eat his breakfast.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.180
There's still no one
in the vicinity.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.650
Sometime, after buying the original
piece of land, he had bought more

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.710
so as not to be disturbed.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.300
Across the fields and the corner
of the forest, the view looks

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.080
out directly to the mountains.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.270
He had merely cleared
some bushes and tidied up.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.540
On the other side stands
a gigantic lilac,

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.510
which he had planted
that first spring.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:02.090
[ Foreign Language ]

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:08.460
The many names for lilac in
Latvian roll off his tongue.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.760
A jumble of words clutter
his head not allowing him

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.620
to eat his breakfast of
eggs and bacon and peas.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:22.090
That language has him grab by
the short hairs asleep or awake.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:26.930
Later, he was lucky enough to
get good work repairing cars.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.850
His bosses understood
nothing about engines

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.160
and were ready to pay
for golden hands.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.440
Later, still, he set up
a machine shop at home

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.660
and they came to him then.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.710
From time to time, he had a
good luck to buy an antique car

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.550
which he repaired to look like new.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.610
Now he can, in a given week,

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:54.880
drive out with three different
cars worthy to be museum pieces.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.120
They set right there in the shop.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.340
Once on Christmas day, his
wife wrapped in a cloud

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:07.130
of gingerbread wafers, entered
the workshop and said in German,

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.930
"You'll live under cars."

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:14.690 position:56%
In German, he replied, "I'm coming."

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.590
He only had to tighten
that last screw.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.270
He turned the screwdriver, while

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.650
in his head words turned
round and round.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.700
You live, I live.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.830
No, I live, he, she leaves.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:32.820
You live. No, we live.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.050
"I'm coming, I'm coming,"
he shouted twice in German

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:44.240
so that the screw would
stop tightening in his head.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:51.030
On the way to the store, he
also stops at the church.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.380
He doesn't even know the
denomination of the church.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.790
Generally, he never used
to attend to church.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.870
But once he came into the church

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:03.520
because his oldest boy
was ill then he entered

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.280

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.300

rows of church pews listening

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.440
to how the burning
candles sputtered.

At that time, upon
living the church,

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:22.280
he stopped at the wooden
pulpit covered in red velvet.

To it were pinned small white notes.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.030
On all of them, something was
written each in a different hand

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:34.230

a phrase, "Please remember

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:39.320
in your prayers," followed
by the name of a person.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.150
Deep down in his heart, he
didn't believe in such help.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:48.240
But he picked up a pencil and wrote
on piece of paper about his son.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.580
The next time, when his
son was already better,

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.700
he stopped here again.

stopped at the pinned notes

He had written his
request in Latvian.

Since that time, he now and
then stops by at the church

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.830

to be remembered in prayers

one understands here.

in the church for a while,

hundred and first note asking

him, "What a heavy rain."

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.590
it opens your new experiences
in everything.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:20.420
But as a writer, you need to
stick to your own language

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.890
because that's your home,

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:25.650
that's when you are
feeling yourself very deep.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:32.070 position:56%
And for Latvian language, the mind--

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:36.440
so to say, my source when
I was looking every time

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.440
for my writings is
Latvian folks songs

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.500
because it's a huge poetical world

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.310
where you can find all the
synonymous, as you heard also

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.240
in this English translation.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.170
And I'm very, very happy
about my translator, Margita.

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:54.880
She's a poet herself too.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.370
And I think it's very important

00:23:56.370 --> 00:24:01.240
because you cannot be only
translator if you translate fiction

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:07.680 position:56%
or poetry that you somehow in this
translation you show also the levels

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.640
and the depths of this
original language, so.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.420
And this is very important for me.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:21.240
So, when I was living in New
York in 1999 to 2000 and being

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:25.490
in Columbia University, you
know, time by time I thought,

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:30.310
maybe I need to start to write in
English because it opens you more.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:33.660
Of course, the big
audiences never think

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.690
and visit translation,
it's always very hard.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:42.170
But I couldn't imagine to do
this, because I feel like I've--

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:45.650
that with Latvian language,
I feel this real--

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:49.060
that of thinking of
poetical world of--

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:55.180
so I feel so free in Latvian
language that there is no boarders.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:59.960
So, when I'm writing now, I don't
feel any boarders in this language

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.090
and that's amazing feeling.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.390
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: Very good.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:08.060
Did you add an anything
on the Latvian language?

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.360
&gt;&gt; Margita Gailitis: Yes.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:13.770
I have two languages
obviously, Latvian and English.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:19.750
And I started writing
poetry in Latvian.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:27.280
And it has a totally different,
very-- I would say, very,

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:33.780
very spare haiku type quality
and also a childishness

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:40.600 position:56%
which reflects my Latvian childhood.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.780
And then I switched to
English and I basically write

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.910
in English-- my poetry in English--

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:48.210
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: OK.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:51.980
&gt;&gt; Margita Gailitis: -- and have
grown up in an English context.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.420
But I should say, I
always dream in Latvian.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.720
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: OK.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.020
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: Yeah.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.970
And the thing what I want to add,
when you are like, of course,

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:05.250 position:56%
English for me is a language of
communication, language of education

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:09.390
and also language of
the big literature.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:14.360
But I'm always so afraid to
fail in English language.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.900
I'm not afraid to fail
in Latvian language.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:22.360
And I think it's also a very
nice feeling that you can win

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.960
and you can fail too, so.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.260
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: Very good.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.560
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: It's
a nice feeling.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.450
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: Let me
shift the focus a little bit

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.280
to something else that's
in the story.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:40.950
And that is your seeming
fascination with illness,

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.280
both mental and physical.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.710
Here, you have the wife, the man
is healthy although he does--

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.750
he did lose his leg in the war,
but his wife has Alzheimer's.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.470
And then in your other New York
story, the New York City story,

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:57.730
there's a dementia
case of the woman,

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:59.030
the main character has dementia.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:04.030
And then you have cancer and the
woman who thinks she has cancer

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.740
but really doesn't in so on.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.710
I shouldn't spoil it for--
those who didn't buy the book.

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:14.580
So, where did this fascination
with-- and I would just say,

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.270
one of the-- it seems to be that
illness ties the families together.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:22.310
You have these families and
they're sort of united by caring

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:26.710
for each other and so on, where did
this fascination that you have come

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:29.200
from and is this real
or is this metaphorical?

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.670
Maybe say something about that.

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:31.970
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: Yeah.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.840
I don't think that it is a
fascination about illnesses

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.300
but I just think that--

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.290
nevertheless, that the
title is "Life Stories".

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:45.620
So-- But I think just-- there
are moments in our lives

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:50.940
like when you are first
facing some illness or death

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:55.780
or losing your very beloved.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:28:01.070
So, you are turning-- You're
having another point of view.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:05.670
So, it opens you something,
what you did not expect,

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:09.250
what you didn't know
before that, so.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:14.360
And I think it's like in a good
drama, you need this turning point,

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:20.490
so-- and maybe, in my stories,
these illnesses and maybe these not

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:28.780
so positive things are kind of
opening the other dimension, so.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:36.160
And I also need to say that
in our world, in magazines,

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:40.970
in yellow press, you always
have this positive thinking.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:46.550
And you need to be positive and
you need to be the perfect women,

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:50.850
you need to be perfect man,
need to be perfect, so.

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.620
But it is not like
that in real life, so.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:58.890
And I think that's good to
understand that we are not perfect.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.520
Human beings, we are not perfect.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:08.350
We have our hidden-- the places
and we are dealing with this

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:14.720
and we are living this wonderful
life, so in spite of the illnesses,

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.460
in spite of the deaths, in
spite of the terror act,

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:20.050
so we live this wonderful life.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:21.350
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren:
Yeah-- Go ahed.

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:22.650
&gt;&gt; Margita Gailitis: Excuse me.

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.490
I'd like to add to that because I--

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:28.120
in having translated all
the stories, they're--

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.410
most of the characters living here,

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:37.330
were living during the
Soviet occupation period

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:41.410
or had actually left
Latvia during that.

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:45.820
So for me, the illness here
is relatively metaphorical

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:51.130
that shows an eroding society.

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:55.270
And I think, there's a
metaphorical value to it.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:30:02.040
I don't think I have translated her
fairy tales et cetera, et cetera.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:09.400
And I've translated many Latvian
writers and this erosion comes

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.780
through in a lot of
Latvian literature.

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:16.250
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: And the thing is
when you are writing the story,

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:19.900
I don't know about all the
writers, but I think it don't think

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.700
about this symbolical level,
really, I don't think about it.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:27.350
And sometimes, I'm very
surprised at the end.

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:33.360
So, when I'm reading my
stories, it has this some kind

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:38.040
of a symbolical level too, because
it's-- but the writing process,

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:42.310
as all you know, it's
very complicated.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.020
And sometimes, you don't
know what will come.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:50.970
And then Joyce Carol Oates said
today that she always knows what is

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:53.820
in the beginning and
what is in the end,

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.190
but she doesn't know what
is in the middle, so.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:58.750
And that's how it happens.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:02.120
I think it's pretty as
this writing process.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.820
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren:
So, just to be clear.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.890
So, you're saying it is
metaphorical as you said

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:08.530
but that it isn't intentional--

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.120
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: But I
like your interpretation.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.420
Margita--

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.720
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren:
But isn't intentional,

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.020
it just happens that way.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.320
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: Yeah.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: Yeah, that's
what-- how I read this metaphorical.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.460
&gt;&gt; Margita Gailitis: And I
think if people read this book

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:24.900
and the short stories, it
gives a bit of a perspective

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.690
on what this world is like.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:29.060
People don't really know Latvian.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:33.090
And the Latvian of 50
years being occupied--

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:40.770
the Soviet occupied and so on,
don't really know this country.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:44.620
And the goodness of
traveling literature

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:49.940 position:56%
and translated literature is that it
opens the door to different worlds.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:56.060
And perhaps gives us Latvian's
an opportunity to be known

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:59.860
to have our history
and our context known.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.030
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: And I should
say that it is a very long

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:05.470
and difficult, right,
actually, also with translation.

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:09.250
So, because today, when I
was standing in the basement

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:14.530
in the book signing and almost
nobody came, so I said to me,

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:18.910
don't worry Nora, because before
Joyce found his publisher,

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:23.380
that he had 17 publishers refuse
"The Oasis" so, don't worry.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.790
This is your first
steps in America, so.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:30.030
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: I'm sure,
yeah, that's-- that will improve.

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.780
But let me get back to
your own autobiography

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:37.010
or you own biography if I may.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:39.060
You were born in 1969.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:46.200
So, you can basically came of age,
you grew up in this Soviet system

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:52.330 position:56%
and then really started writing just
in the early time of independence.

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:56.410
What difference did independence
and the collapse of, I mean,

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:59.470
suppose the Soviet Union
hung on another 10 years,

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:02.270
which it could easily have,
under a different scenario.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.560
And so, you would have been
maybe 30 or 32 or whatever

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.870
when the system collapsed.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:08.990
Would you still become
a writer, I mean,

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:11.270
did you always want to be a writer?

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:17.990
How did that momentous event
in the life of your country,

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.610
in the life of everybody
who lived in that country?

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:21.210 position:56%
How did that affect you as a writer?

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:24.720
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: I should say thank
you to my parents that I was born

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.870
in 1969 because it
was a perfect timing.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:34.890
So, for me as writer, because I
spent my childhood and also use

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:38.560
under Soviet regime and then
we had this independence

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.520
and completely changes everything.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:46.430
And how did it affect
literature, very, very seriously

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:53.060 position:56%
because in Soviet times although we
had brilliant nice poetry and prose,

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:58.970
that was the saying under lines and
that this truth about independence

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:02.680
of Latvia, what also was
tried to say on the lines.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.450
And somehow, it also traps them

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:09.710
because it was not literature
written because of literature

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:14.690
but literature return also because
of saying something under lines

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:18.720
and run-- then my generation
started in the beginning of '90s--

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.020
&gt;&gt; Margita Gailitis: Subtext.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.460
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: Yes subtext, yeah.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:24.370
When we started, we
started to write literature

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:27.920
because of literature,
we felt ourselves free.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:33.530
And also, we had this access
also to English literature also

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:38.440
to exile literature which was
not possible during Soviet time.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:42.730
So, and I should say, it
is really perfect timing

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:45.400
because without knowing
the Soviet system,

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.930
the Soviet [inaudible] regime,

00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:51.070
I would not be a writer
as I am now, so.

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:55.270
And also, without not having
this possibility to live

00:34:55.270 --> 00:35:02.950
in a free democratic world is also
the difficulties and mistakes.

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:06.740
So, I would not be a
writer as I am, so.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.040
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: Very good.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.160
But it's interesting that
you do write sympathetically

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.460
and understandingly about
some Russian characters,

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.880
you have at least two,
you have Olga--

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.180
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: Yeah.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.330
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: The
mistress or girlfriend or whatever

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:23.840
of the man who's-- Francis, the
man who spent time in Syria--

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.920
in Siberia, rather, I'm sorry.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.670
And then you also have Nadejda
[assumed spelling], the fog woman

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:31.830
or whatever who's Russian.

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:34.480 position:56%
And you write very
sympathetically about these Russian.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:39.920
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: Yeah, because
I mean, it's a real stupid thing

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:45.570 position:56%
to hate language or to hide a nation
or peoples because of regimes.

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:50.120
So, I never did that
because I'm very happy

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:56.300
that I know this rich Latvian--
Russian literature and culture.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:00.510
And then, I can speak
Russian and it was also regime

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:06.460
because Stalin deported not only
Latvians, Estonians, Lithuanias,

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:11.240
he deported the Russians,
Byelorussians, Polish people.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.020
It was a regime who made it.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.660
So, of course now,
speaking politically,

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:23.630
we have really big troubles being
neighbors with Russia but also

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:27.490
because of regime not because of
people and not because of culture

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:29.600
and not because of language.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:34.670
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: I
wanted to ask you about nature.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:37.800
You also seem to be
a great nature lover.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.050
And it seems like everybody
lives on the edge of the woods.

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:42.400
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: Yeah,
because I'm a witch.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.700
&gt;&gt; Margita Gailitis: That's true.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.000
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: I'm a witch.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.300
&gt;&gt; Margita Gailitis:
You're very observant.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.710
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: And
I-- This is very-- I know--

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:52.480
It probably ties in with the fairy
tales, yes-- which I haven't read,

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.940
but you've done several
books of those.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:56.240
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: No,
because you know,

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.050 position:56%
Latvians are crazy about nature, so.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.550
And we are mushroom pickers.

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:03.560
So, we are crazy mushroom pickers.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.580
We go to the woods and pick
up mushrooms and pick herbs

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.880
and teas and everything, so.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:14.000
And it's still like this, so it
comes from tradition in families

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.080
but I'm-- I really, I feel--

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.890
nature, I feel myself
that everything is opening

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.860
and so very close to nature really.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:25.510
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren:
That's very nice.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:27.810
We're-- OK we're actually up.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.040
Sorry, sorry we're
getting involved here.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.020
Are there questions
from the audience?

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.770
I want to make sure we have
a chance to get questions in.

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:38.170
Anybody? Yes, please?

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.810
&gt;&gt; Well first of all, I'd like to
thank you for bringing, you know,

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:43.970
Latvian literature to the
United States in translation.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:47.090
I think, it's a reach
opportunity for those of us

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:50.130
who know a little bit about the
Baltics to see the inner life,

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:51.430
a little bit of the Baltics.

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:55.510
And the story that we read
this evening and I think some

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:58.530
of the other stories in your
book relate very much to the--

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:00.360
I think, the idea of identity.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:04.350 position:56%
And I know that the idea of identity
in Latvia right now is very fraught.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:08.550
And as you touched upon the Russian
identity, the Latvian identity,

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:11.960
you know, previously, you know, the
Hanseatic identities that you have.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.300
And I think it's a rich
vein to mind in terms

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:19.200
of what is it to be a Latvian.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.010
And I'm wondering if you
could touch upon that

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:24.880
and how you approach
it in your writing.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:29.310
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: You know, we
are being the small nation.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:33.950
We have this, I think, the bad
things that we are always telling

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:36.460
that we are a small nation
and we are struggling

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.800
about our identity
and so and so, and so.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.720
But look, we are still
here in about 2 million.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:48.410
We are speaking Latvian, we are
in EU, we are more than society.

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:53.970
And I think that's how it goes
and being Latvian feels like,

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:57.810
I don't know, being English,
being German, being Finish.

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:03.570
So, I think it's a very
interesting place to live actually.

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:06.940
So, because you are
coming from a small nation,

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:10.850
you have to be very open, you
have to learn many languages,

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:13.460
you have to lead many literatures.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:17.290
And it just, you know,
it opens you up and you--

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:22.680
or you are becoming richer,
richer and richer, so.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.980
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren:
Other questions?

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:30.590
&gt;&gt; And so, I had a question about
the story and about the encounter

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:32.650
between the unnamed man

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:35.710
and the Latvian woman
speaking on the telephone.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:39.330
I was wondering as you were reading
whether the man was going to strike

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:42.010
up a conversation with
the woman on the phone.

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:43.890
And that's not what happened.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:48.810
Could you talk about
that part of the story?

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:50.510
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: I didn't get.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:52.960
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: He sees her
on the-- it's not on the phone,

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.430
he sees her at the bus station.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:55.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:57.540
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: He sees
her at the bus station

00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:04.320
and he hears Latvian language
first time in his life live, so.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.230
Because before that he was living--

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:10.220
the Latvian language
was living inside him.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:17.860
So, he didn't speak in Latvian
with his sons and the wife, so.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:22.980
And now, it becomes that the
language is alive somehow.

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:25.410
He hears his language
and he's like, you know,

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:29.890
he's like amazed that
it is possible, so.

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:31.420
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: But
the question, it's a question,

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.920
why doesn't he talk to her?

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.220
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: Why
doesn't he talk to her?

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.000
Because he's a shy man.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.180
He just, you know, he
just shows her the sign.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.480
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: Yes.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.780
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: But
I needed it for story.

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.080
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: Yes.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.380
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: Sorry.

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.680
&gt;&gt; I can see that.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.710
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: You know, because
if he starts to talk with her,

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:52.070
it's another story, so sorry.

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:54.500
&gt;&gt; Yes, it could have
been another story.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.800
You're right.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.100
Well, thank you.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.850
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: Very good.

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:00.150
Please.

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:03.170
&gt;&gt; This is your fifth book,
so I have two questions.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:06.670
One is why did you choose this book

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:09.730
to be translated as
oppose to any other.

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:14.000
And second question is, what
are your other books about?

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.970
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: Yeah, so actually,
I didn't-- it was like, you know,

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:21.880
I had my first novel, "Celebration
of Life", which was a kind

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:29.180
of a national bestseller and
then I had many translations

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.480
but not into English.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:37.370
But when we started to work
together with Margita so she said

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.470
that short stories,
although it's very hard

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:44.430
to publish short stories,
because novel is easier.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:48.520 position:56%
So she said that she liked this book
very much and that's how it went.

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:53.610
But now, I'm expecting
in 2017 my novel,

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:56.430
my latest novel "Mother's
Milk" published

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:59.140
by very good publishing
house in London

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:02.960 position:56%
by Ana Press [assumed spelling] and
Margita already did the translation.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.750
So, that will be my
second book in English.

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:13.830
But my other books so it's, you
know, a celebration of life,

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:16.210
"Life Stories", "Mother's Milk".

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:20.890
I think about essential
things of life so, in short.

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:25.360
So, it's hard to, you
know, to talk more now

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.840
but that's how its, you know.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.140
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: Very good.

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.440
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.740
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren:
We have another question?

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.900
Maybe-- Oh, go ahead.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:42.970
&gt;&gt; I'm first going to ask how
much communication was there

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:45.280
in the translation process?

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.860
What did you just [inaudible].

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.510
&gt;&gt; Margita Gailitis:
I didn't hear, excuse.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:50.920
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: How
much communication was there

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.770
in the translation process?

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.480
&gt;&gt; Margita Gailitis:
Actually, I only--

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:02.600
I have translated poets and
Nora, quite a few writers.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:09.740
I only communicate with the writer
at the end of the process and odd

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:15.750
as it may sound, I try initially,
to find the music of the book

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:22.500
because even prose has a certain
music and a voice and so on.

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.800
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: Yeah.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.970
But for as the author, I should
say, that I have this experience

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:31.130
like working with Margita that
I know English and then we are--

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:33.830
it's much more easier because we--

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:36.410
sometimes, we can work
together and so and so.

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:40.050
And this is a very interesting
process for the author too,

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:42.650
because know I have
two books in Hindi.

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:47.420
And I don't have any clue of what's
it translated and what it look

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.750
like so-- and what is it about.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:55.300
So, and you can be
really lost in translation

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:58.830
and that's the worst
thing for writers, so.

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:05.080
But I was enjoying so much
working together with Margita

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:08.410
of "Life Stories" and also
"Mother's Milk" because it's

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:15.380
like re-writing your own novel
and also what translators sees

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:23.160
in this text, you didn't even
expect that you wrote something

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.540
which is not so good, so perfect.

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:30.430
You just said it like, you know,
ta-da-da-da-da-da in Latvian.

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:32.710
And then you need to
translate it, you need more--

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:36.040
be more precise more
perfect and so and so.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.700
It's very good for a writer, too.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.490
&gt;&gt; Margita Gailitis:
It can be tough, too.

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:46.140 position:56%
There are things in Latvian that are
non-translatable in English and so.

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.910
&gt;&gt; Margita Gailitis: Like
I asked today Margita,

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:53.520
how can you translate
[foreign language] in English.

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:59.110
You cannot translate it, it is
something that protects you.

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:03.140
But this odd Latvian word [foreign
language] you cannot translate it

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.440
in English.

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:11.310
So, you have to some how to tell
the big story going back to history

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:13.500
about one small thing, so.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.800
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: Very good.

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.640
OK. Well, I think we're--
really quick John, we're--

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.710
I got my red sign coming here.

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:24.820
&gt;&gt; I'm very sort of fascinated
by the creative-- I'm very--

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:28.780
always fascinated by the
mystery of the creative process.

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:34.590
And I'm sort of wondering, what
stimulate your sort of creativity?

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:37.460
What creates the idea
for the next book?

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:42.520
Could you touch on your
creative-- what creates--

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.950
generates your creative juices?

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:48.440
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: You know, I
think of course, in general life

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:55.140
but also memories because I
believe in memories and I believe

00:45:55.140 --> 00:46:02.200 position:56%
that only real historical true facts
what we relay on our old memories.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.410
So, that stimulates me.

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:10.340
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: Well that
is a perfect way to end a session--

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.810
a wonderful session with
the writer Nora Ikstena

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:17.960
and her primary kin and
talented translator.

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.610
So, thank you very much
and lets join in a--

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:20.910
