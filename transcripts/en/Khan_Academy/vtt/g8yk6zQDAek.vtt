00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.600
We've already seen that
a fraction like 2/9

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.884
can be interpreted
as 2 divided by 9.

00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:10.300
Let me do the 2
in the same color.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.920
That if we have a
fraction, it could

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.080
be interpreted as the numerator
divided by the denominator.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.710
And this leads to all sorts
of interesting conclusions,

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.180
some of which we've already
seen, and some of which

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.750
are a little bit new.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:35.780
So, for example, if I
had the fraction 7/7,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.790
this can be interpreted
now as 7 divided by 7,

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.270
as our numerator divided
by our denominator.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.070
And 7 divided by 7 is
of course equal to 1.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.350
And this is consistent with
what we've already seen.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.190
7/7 would get us to
a whole, and a whole

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.260
is the exact same thing as one.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.880
But we could do things a little
bit more interesting as well.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.580
We could take something
like 18/6 and realize, wow.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.610
This is the same thing
as 18 divided by 6,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.350
which we know is equal to 3.

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:19.360
And we should do a
little reality check.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.410
Does this make sense, that
18/6 should be equal to 3?

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.560
Well, we could rewrite it.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.830
We could rewrite 18/6.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.140
Let me make the sixths
that same orange color.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.480
That's going to
be the same thing.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.320
18 is 6 plus 6 plus 6.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.070
And then all of that over 6,
and then that's the same thing.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.950
That's the same thing as
6/6 plus 6/6 plus 6/6.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.420
And I could make this
right over here in orange.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.840
And we've already seen, or we've
seen many, many videos ago,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.990
that 6/6, just like 7/7, these
are each equal to a whole.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.330
These are each equal to 1.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.370
And we can now view
this as 6 divided by 6,

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.050
which is the same thing as 1.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.490
So this is 1 plus 1 plus 1,
which is, of course, equal

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.519
to 3.

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.560
But this starts to raise
an interesting question.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.220
This all worked out just fine
because 18 is a multiple of 6.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.640
6 divides evenly into 18.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.710
But what happens if we
start having fractions where

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.620
the denominator does not divide
evenly into the numerator?

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.588
Let's say we have a
fraction like 23 over 6.

00:02:46.354 --> 00:02:48.020
Well, we know that
we can interpret this

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.852
as 23 divided by 6.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.230
And if we actually divide
23 by 6-- let's do that.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.665
So we divide 6 into 23.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.770
We know 6 goes into
23 three times.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.290
3 times 6 is 18.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.900
And then when you subtract, you
end up with a remainder of 5.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:23.717
So we might say, hey, 23 divided
by 6 is equal to 5 remainder 3.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.446
But that's not that satisfying.

00:03:29.446 --> 00:03:30.820
What do I do with
this remainder?

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.153
This really isn't a number here.

00:03:32.153 --> 00:03:35.130
This is just saying that
we're going five times,

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.750
and then we have a
little bit left over.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.640
What we can do now is
manipulate this a little bit

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.720
so that we can realize that this
is a number, and in particular,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.480
a mixed number.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.560
So for example, we could
start with a 23 over 6,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.280
and we could divide
it into-- or we

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.570
could decompose the
numerator into one part that

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.810
is divisible by 6,
evenly divisible by 6,

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.300
and the remainder.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:11.750
So for example, 23 over 6 we
can rewrite as 18 plus 5 over 6.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.070
Notice I decomposed the
23 into one part that

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.200
is a multiple of 6, and
it's the largest multiple

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.209
that essentially
fits into 23, or that

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.060
is less than or equal to
23, and then the remainder.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.310
When you divide 6 into 23,
you get a remainder of 5.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.940
You could view it
as, I divided it

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.297
into the remainder
and everything else.

00:04:31.297 --> 00:04:32.880
And the reason why
this is interesting

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.170
is because we know that this is
going to be equal to 18 over 6

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.060
plus 5 over 6.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.830
Well, we already
know that 18/6 is

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.220
the same thing as 18
divided by 6, or 3.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.560
So this is the same thing as 3.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.020
So we know that 23 over 6,
which is the same thing as 18

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.320
plus 5 over 6, is the
same thing as 3 plus 5/6.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.500
Or, if we want to write
it as a mixed number,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.700
we could write it as 3 and 5/6.
