{EXPLOSION}

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.320
{Nostalgia Critic Theme Song}

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.620
{Explosion}

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.360
Hello I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to!

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.080
And yes, you read that correctly. We are reviewing Jurassic World.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.380
But you might be wondering, how the hell can we do that if it's still in theaters?

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.100
Well, this ought to explain it.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.760
{Snaps Fingers}

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.960
{Upbeat Banjo Music}

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.360
Oh, hello! I bet you're wondering why we're reviewing this movie now instead of waiting for it to come to DVD.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.280
Well the answer is quite simple.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.240
You see, Hollywood now sees us as a threat.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.020
Taking down several of our videos on YouTube because they forgot reviews are part of Fair Use.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.740
Some of these videos have been put back but others are just seen as, "too dangerous" for your fragile minds to handle.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.280
Thus, every single time we've done a Jurassic park movie, even if we end up praising it, Hollywood has always taken it down.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.920
But Mr. Glasses!? I have a question!

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.340
Why?! If it isn't my good friend Mr. Puppy the puppy.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.720
What's on your mind Mr. Puppy?

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.840
Hasn't Hollywood realized that by doing this they look incredibly desperate and unprofessional?

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.140
I mean, even your reviews of bad movies have led to higher sales due to your exposure.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.960
Oh Mr. Puppy, Hollywood has more important things to worry about than that!

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.380
Well what's more important than freedom of speech being threatened by insecure goons?

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.100
Complaining about how THEIR freedom of speech is being threatened by a bunch of insecure goons!

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.100
You're kidding right?

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.140
But as we said before, the review must go on.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.860
I mean, do they know the meaning of irony?

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.000
So rather than do a review just to have it taken down anyway...

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.880
They do remember SOPA and Napster right?

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.800
We're going to re-enact scenes from the movie to give you a better idea of what we're talking about.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.580
But Mr. Glasses, the clips allow people to judge the film for themselves!

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.180
Won't the re-enactments leave an emotional, even bitter mark on the material being reviewed?

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.120
None!

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.420
None whatsoever!

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.320
Gee, I guess the only thing we can do now is wait for Hollywood to finally grow up!

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.400
I'm not holding my breath.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.040
So enjoy our incredibly "unbiased" review of Jurassic World!

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.420
You know, you're accent sounds a lot like Cary Elwes with a dump truck shoved up his nose.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.720
{Smacking Sound}

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.960
Enjoy!

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.380
You heard the man, reviewing the Jurassic Park movies has been a big tradition around here, and we're not going to let Hollywood stop it.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.360
So, rather than wait for it to come out on DVD, we're just gonna jump right into it.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.820
This is our take on Jurassic World!

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.360
{Upbeat Music}

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.020
The movie opens up with our main star of the film.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.140
Not Chris Pratt as Owen.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.960
Not Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.860
Not even really the dinosaurs.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.520
No, the star of the movie is the park.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.000
The amount of detail they put into this place is incredible.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.920
We finally see it open, it's like Disney World only less people probably die.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.840
It's phenomenal. So I know what you're thinking.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.640
If the park looks this good so many years after the original,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.620
imagine what the goddamn dinosaurs must look like.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.200
It's been 22 years since the first film's ground breaking effects, so how the hell are they gonna look now--

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.360
They suck. Like...

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.560
Wow, do they suck!

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.420
It's some of the worst CG the movies have EVER cranked out.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.860
They look like cardboard cutouts.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.720
No! Wait, even that would have some three-dimensional qualities to them.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.140
They look like mist. Like, a cloud of fog in the shape of a dinosaur.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.680
There's a scene where a kid is looking at dinosaurs through a view-finder which by the way, you're 13.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.180
What the fuck are you doing looking through a view finder?

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.980
And even THEY look more three-dimensional than the ones in the movie!

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.780
And you wanna know why?

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.140
Because it was really there. It was really fucking there!

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.440
I mean okay, they're little models and they don't look very convincing but I feel like I can touch them.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.660
I don't feel like I can touch any of these dinosaurs.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.960
And... I don't wanna touch dinosaurs, but nevertheless.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.140
OH SHUT UP!

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.540
I wanna be able to feel like I can pet a dinosaur.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.620
That's the wonder of Jurassic Park!

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.640
And here's the thing.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.500
I'm actually not anti-CGI.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.320
I mean,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.520
Ex Machina, she looked like a real robot.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.320
Madagascar totally made me believe that David Schwimmer could act.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.660
But with the other Jurassic Park movies they used animatronics and CGI, this fools the eye.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.420
It makes a more grand illusion.
We've gotten too used to CGI.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.280
So when we see it we know it's CGI and we know it's not there.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.040
But here's the other weird thing.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.940
They said they used animatronics in this movie.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.880
But outside of a scene where Littlefoot's mother dies they all look so flat and unconvincing.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.620
How can this be if they used animatronics?

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.140
In my opinion they CG-ed over the animatronics.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.360
They look at the animatronics of say, the raptors in the muzzle cages and say,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.300
"You know what, I want the eyes to blink a little different or the mouth to move a little more."

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.000
Let's paint CG all over that shit and now there's a veil of fake all over what used to be believable.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.560
But I know what you're thinking.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.760
Who cares?

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.320
I mean, really in the grand scheme of things, who cares?

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.720
We want to see to see cool dinosaurs do cool dinosaur things.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.600
Even if they look kinda fake, we want them to do cool things, right?

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.180
Well,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.620
I'm gonna take that argument and store it away here for later because, trust me, it'll come back in a bit of time.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.880
But, let's actually get to the story.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.480
Now that the park has been opened for a while, people it seems, have gotten too used to dinosaurs.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.260
Oh my God! This black chick who's a white chick is a white chick.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.360
I found somebody rude on the Internet!

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.200
Oh my God!

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.700
Noooo!

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.260
That's right. They've actually gotten bored with them.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.300
The CEO of the park named Simon and the manager of the park named Claire to try to figure out how to fix this.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.360
We need to up the sales.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.440
I need you to make me a dinosaur so badass that if it escaped, we couldn't possibly stop it.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:34.400
Okay, now we're talking. We've seen raptors and stegosauruses before. This is creating a brand new dinosaur specifically to look awesome.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.120
They don't have to follow any rules, it's not like they did before anyway.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.100
I mean, the Dilophosaurus, yeah, you nailed that.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.200
But they're using science to create whatever the hell they want.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.540
By God, imagine what you could do with this!

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:51.200
The body of a T-Rex, the wings of a Pterodactyl, the neck of a Brontosaurus, the head of a Triceratops, lions for hands!

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.440
And hey, just to sell more tickets, give it bazooka boobs.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.720
C'mon, we're clearly in bullshit science here, we can do whatever we want.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.860
Okay, I know they're not gonna make something quite like that but it's gonna look amazing.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.180
And they've been building it up in this movie for quite a bit.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.260
So after tricking the security guard like an 80's prison movie, no really, he's got the sandwich and everything.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.300
What does this monstrous, terrifying, abomination of science look like?!

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.560
Critic: A big Raptor.
-- I'm a new dinosaur.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.860
Yep, it's about as unimpressive as you can imagine.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.400
You know that Photoshop tool you can use to make things bigger?

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:29.740
That's pretty much all they used, except they gave him a few more bumps on the back and made him a little paler.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.440
Oooohh!!

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.540
Even the made up name is a bore.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.600
We're calling him Indominus Rex because it's easier to pronounce.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.440
You know what's even easier to pronounce?

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.160
Coke 2.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.700
And that's what I'm calling him.
I'm calling him the "Coke 2-asaurus."

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.420
Hey, they openly admit it's trying to be something bigger and badder than the T-Rex.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.920
But it looks so boring and fake it can't measure up.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.880
But actually to Coke 2's credit it can do some cool things.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:57.120
Like camouflage, lower its body heat... which of course, the scientists have no fucking idea about.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.200
Oh my God! We've watched him from birth, kept him in captivity and know everything there is to know about him!

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.660
How can we possibly know everything there is to know about him?

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.380
{Punching Sound}

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.380
This is where the two kids come in because, by shit, we always need fucking kids in these movies.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.140
But to their credit, they're not that bad.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.040
It's more the idiot adults that surround them.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.980
You see, their parents are getting a divorce...

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.680
Oh, yeah... sorry.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.200
So they're spending the weekend with their Aunt Claire who's obviously a little busy herself.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.940
Hi Claire! I just wanted to make sure the boys are OK.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.020
Oh! They're actually not around me right now. So...

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.260
{Crying loudly}

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.060
Whoa! Jesus...

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.100
I just thought you'd bond with my boys!

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.040
Listen, sis, I'm trying to make sure that the park doesn't eat itself.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.380
It's just really hard with my divorce hearings right now.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.320
You're calling me during your divorce hearing?

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.180
Actually, they're telling me to hurry up right now.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.720
Yeah... don't call me when you're busy with that. That's a touch more important.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.360
Not as important... as my want... {sobbing} for you... to like... kids.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.540
Oh no... a T-Rex ate a baby, got to go.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.260
CLAIRE!!!!-

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:02.180
Of course the kids aren't all right because they're written like little dumb asses that go off into restricted areas

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.440
in their American Gladiator ball that for some reason, has no track.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:11.680
Okay, taking out the obvious safety of the two people inside, especially two children without an adult in a ball without  a track.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.740
How is this safe for the Dinosaurs?

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.760
You've seen people in Go-Karts, imagine throwing animals in that!

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.460
{Smacking Sound}

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.160
{Laughing}

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.400
Hit it again!

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.560
{More Laughing}

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.620
Hit em' one more time!

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.120
{Smacking Sound}

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:22.940
{Light Laughter}

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:28.660
But Coke 2 grabs them, and, again because you don't believe anything is there, it's not the least bit frightening.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.540
Yet, the boys end up escaping.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.200
So Claire tells Owen the raptor trainer about our missing kids and Coke 2.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.500
Oh, after they share some AMAZING on-screen chemistry!

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.260
-We dated once, remember?
-Sure do.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.880
And that's it! That was the on-screen chemistry!

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.420
On the one hand, I'm happy they didn't argue like those dysfunctional pussies in Twister,

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.200
But on the other hand, why have them interested in each other at all?

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.960
I mean, I'm not gonna act like the chemistry in the first film was that great but they at least talked

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.820
and hugged and smiled and shit like that!

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.120
Here, they barely even look at each other.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.360
They share ONE kiss in the middle of the film but they go back to acting like they're not a couple again.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.080
It's entirely pointless!

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:10.300
I mean, fucking bizarre concept, but if you have a dude and a chick in a movie they don't always have to hook up.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.420
If you got a romance, great, but it's not like a check list.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.100
In "Aliens", Ripley doesn't need to turn to Bishop and be like, "I love you."

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.620
It'd be totally out of nowhere and just wouldn't fit.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:25.600
And I know what you're thinking, that's as crazy as the park's CEO flying a helicopter into certain death!

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.480
You probably weren't thinking that, but I needed a segue.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.480
The owner decides he wants to help stop Coke 2 by flying a helicopter to shoot at it.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.400
They even played this triumphant music like, "Yay! He's doing the smart thing!"

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.800
But despite everyone telling him he's going to end up dying...

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.040
He eventually ends up dying...

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:40.720
{Simon Masrani} Oh no!

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.760
{Explosion}

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.780
Yeah, for a businessman... that was a pretty dumb move on his part.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.380
{Nostalgia Critic Theme Song}

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.940
{Nostalgia Critic Theme}

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.520
This leads to a bunch of pterodactyls being released and... okay, remember that argument I was talking about

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.180
having the dinosaurs only do cool stuff? Well here, let's bring that argument back in.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.540
This is the cool stuff I'm talking about, the pterodactyls are attacking people.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.700
Why is this awesome? Because it's taking it to the next level.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.420
We've seen dinosaurs eat scientists and people with guns in the jungle and we're sick to death of it.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.760
Here, even if it's still obviously fake,  it STILL look really cool!

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.600
They do legitimately create some really awesome stuff.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:31.440
They pick up civilians, fight over them drop them into the water only to have OTHER dinosaurs eat them there!

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.140
It's fucking fantastic!

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.840
Even Claire machine-guns down one of them, saving Owen's life.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.600
But of course, the little kids are like,

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.660
"We want to go with you."

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.220
"Aww thanks, that's really great to hear!"

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:41.900
"No... I meant him."

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:48.000
Fuck you, you little shits! If I saw my aunt machine-gun down a pterodactyl you bet I'd hide behind her skirted ass!

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:56.980
So... okay. All the people in the park are in one location, an all-you-can-eat dino buffet just waiting to be ripped to shreds.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.820
The opportunities write themselves.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.800
What terrifyingly awesome thing...

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.680
{Buzzer sound}

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.100
Nothing! We never see those people again!

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:11.760
They just stay in this one giant spot, this fucking salad bar of deliciousness and we never, ever touch them again!

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:17.780
What did they do next? Well, something COMPLETELY different and REALLY new! You've NEVER seen this in a Jurassic Park movie!

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.640
They go hunting dinosaurs in the jungle!

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:21.680
RIGHT?!

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.420
RIGHT?!

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.680
Pushing the fucking envelope here!

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.240
Because hey, remember, there's an evil scientific hybrid that needs to be stopped!

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.280
Oh, I'm not talking about the dinosaur. I'm talking about Vincent D'Onofrio being successfully combined with John Malkovich

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.860
and every early 90's villain EVER.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:45.580
I want to weaponize these raptors because I'm the obvious bad guy. I adjust my belt buckle, ALL the time.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:50.200
No... no... we don't care, we don't care. He just had a scene where pterodactyls played hot potato with people's heads.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.180
Why would we care?

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.000
We know he's the bad guy, we know he's going to die, we know that "man sucks".

00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.140
So can we stop repeating what we've seen a fuck-ton of times in the other films?

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.400
Can we please get some new developments?

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.180
{Laughing}

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.340
What am I talking about?

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.120
One of the biggest developments in the film is coming up.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.920
And I mean... this is like a HUGE twist they've been building up.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.320
They use the raptors to find Coke 2 and...

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.580
somehow they think these tiny things are gonna take it down.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.980
When they finally put 2 and 2 together, and remember this is a BIG shock.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:30.520
{Owen} My God, that dinosaur that looks like a raptor... acts like a raptor... sounds like a raptor... and moves like a raptor...

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.420
{Suspenseful Music}

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.980
I THINK IT'S PART RAPTOR!

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.060
{Drops Glasses}

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.100
No...

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:36.940
No!

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:37.860
NO!

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.300
No...no...no...no...no...no...

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.000
NO!!

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.060
NO!!

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.040
NO!

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:42.580
NO!

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.140
NO!

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:43.700
NO!

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:44.200
{Crying}

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.540
You can't be this stupid!

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.660
You cannot... BE... THIS... STUPID!

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.780
I mean...

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.740
LOOK AT THAT DAMN THING!

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.280
OF COURSE IT'S PART FUCKING RAPTOR!

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.260
IT'S LIKE 90% FUCKING RAPTOR YOU GOD DAMN MORONS!

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.380
You know those sponge dinosaurs, the ones you just add water to make them grow bigger?

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.480
Well, don't show that to anybody here it'll completely blow their minds!

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.860
They'll be like, "Oh! What's that?" "Oh, that's a triceratops. C'mon, everybody knows that."

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.640
"Oh, you're gonna add water, well I don't know what that... OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT!?"

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.680
"WHAT IS THAT?! OH MY GOD IT CHANGED INTO SOMETHING COMPLETELY UNRECOGNIZABLE!"

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.060
"I MEAN, I'M AMAZING AT WHAT I DO BUT THIS?!"

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.640
"THIS IS BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION!!"

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.920
"OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT?!"

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.880
{Lots of girlish screaming}

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:37.440
So big shock, a raptor attacks D'onofrio off-screen where he's PG-13'd to death.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.360
Leaving only our main stars left.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:40.200
Well,

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.480
them and thousands of other people next door,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.040
But pfffft...

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.580
That'd be no fun involving them.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.000
But suddenly, Claire goes to this giant door and says,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.940
"Unfunny computer comic relief, open up the door."

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.740
{In nerdy voice} You're insane! You're insane!

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.760
"Just do it!"

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:54.780
{Keyboard Clacking}

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.480
Suddenly, the door starts to open up.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.060
There's nothing but darkness facing her.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.060
{Gasp}

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.080
Holy shit! Could it be?

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.300
She stares into the black unknown while lighting up a flare.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.120
Oh my God!

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.400
Is it? Is it?!

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.220
♪ I'm a mutha fucking T-Rex! ♪

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.200

IT'S THE MOTHERFUCKING T-REX!!!!!

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.280
Claire throws the flare towards Coke 2 and original Coke is like:

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.740
"FUCK YOU BITCH! I'M A MOTHER FUCKING T-REX!"

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.680

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.360
So there they are: Raptors, giant Coke 2 raptor and the motherfucking T-Rex.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.220
All in a kick ass, incredible showdown!

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.100
Hang on! If we're gonna do this, we gotta do this right!

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:49.800
{Presses button}

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.420
{Static}

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.640
{In Movie Announcer Voice} Oh, uh... hello.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.580
John Bailey, I know you're used to doing the Honest Trailer voice and your own reviews on your own channel(plug),

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:58.880
But I need your help!

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.600
Uh, with what exactly?

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.880
I need a voice as epic of yours to narrate the climax of Jurassic World.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.580
The motherfucking T-Rex scene?

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:07.300
Mmhm.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.240
Done.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.760
The T-Rex takes a bite out of the Pussysaurus, but then Pussysaurus bites baaack.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.180
The T-Rex slams that bitch into a building but then the bitch trips him to the ground.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.260
T-Rex then starts taking several bites to the neck.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.680
{Imitating Mickey from Rocky} GET UP YA BUM!

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.280
Suddenly, one of the raptors jumps on top, freeing the T-Rex.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:31.540
She then knocks the head back, smashing Pussysaurus into one of the overly priced restaurants.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.700
The T-Rex then says,

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.180
"You cannot defeat such awesomeness!"

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:36.720
Wait, wait, wait...

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.060
The T-Rex is female, isn't she?

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.840
Well, she's a female who happens to sound like Optimus Prime.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:42.880
Yeah, okay.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.700
"You cannot defeat such awesomeness!"

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.340
"My amazing kickassery cannot be contained!"

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:55.860
Her opponent roared, then the motherfucking T-Rex roared then the mechanical T-Rex came in and burned them alive.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.080
Okay, I KNOW that didn't happen in the movie.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.440
Who's got the cool voice?

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.020
OK, sorry.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.920
But they survive the blast and blow him up with their own fire breath.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.720
T-Rex then gives her opponent one more chance.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.940
Surrender or face the "Age of Extinction!"

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.280
No response.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.800
Thus, the motherfucking T-Rex replied:

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.600
"Then Go-Fish!"

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:21.140
Suddenly that cool "JAWS" dinosaur we saw earlier comes up and eats the living hell out of that piece of shit.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:30.420
The battle is over, T-Rex and raptor... 2 sworn enemies, acknowledge that their honor has been satisfied.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.620
And live to fight another day.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.380
Oh and some stuff with human characters happens, but who cares?

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:42.320
The T-Rex climbs to the tallest building, on the tallest mountain overlooking the park.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:48.080
Let's out one more triumphant roar, turns to the camera and says,

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.260
"I am a motherfucking T-Rex."

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.520
{Triumphant Roar}

00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:05.040
{Insane Laughter}

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.980
God damn you movie! God damn you!

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:16.360
Not only did you create one of the coolest scenes, in any Jurassic Park movie EVER,

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:22.340
but you totally made up for that shitty ass fucking idiot sequence in Jurassic Park 3!

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:27.060
Yeah, remember when the T-Rex dies to the "who cares-asaurus" just so they could sell more toys?

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:32.160
Well, this scene takes all the fucking idiots who thought this was a good idea, grabbed them by ear and says,

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.800
"Come here! Come here! No! No! That is not how you do a T-Rex fight, movie!"

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.740
"That is not how you do a T-Rex fight! THIS is how you do a T-Rex fight!"

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.200
"You bad idiots! Those are bad! Bad idiots! GOD!"

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.800
Damn it movies! I was just about done with you. I swear, it was over.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.340
I was just about to head out the door and be like,

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.660
"I'm sorry Jurassic Park sequels, this abuse can go on no longer."

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.800
"You promised so many wonderful things for us and instead you hurt me! You hurt me time and again!"

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.540
"Well, no more..."

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.880
"Goodbye Jurassic Park sequels!"

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.460
"But what if I made the greatest T-Rex fight ever?"

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.800
"I'd say I'm falling for your bullshit all over again."

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.900
"LOVE ME JURASSIC PARK SEQUELS!"

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:14.680
"Yes..."

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:23.060
It's like Frost/Nixon, the majority of the interviews aren't very good, but the last few minutes practically makes up for all of it.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:30.660
I guess really the film's not the worst... I mean, it is well acted, it looks nice and it does have some remarkable scenes.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:35.420
I just wish I didn't have to sit through so much boring stuff to get to those scenes.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:40.020
If you want to do a suspense film, great. Make the effects better and give us more scary scenarios.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:44.900
If you want to do a B-film, great. Go all out, make some totally insane choices.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.580
Make the whole film as good as that last 10 minutes.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.040
But this half and half thing?

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.120
*sigh* Why can't I quit you, Jurassic Park sequels?

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.140
I guess as the films go, it is the second best out of all of them.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.720
But given the other two, that's not a phenomenal feat.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:05.420
A lot of choices they make do still piss me off but I'm not gonna be shocked if other people like it.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.060
For a lot of people, it's stupid in all the right ways.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.160
For me, I didn't think it went far enough.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.920
Except for that ending, which like I said, is totally worth the price of admission.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.400
Yeah I realize this review is all over the place. "Should you see it, should you not see it?"

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.400
But hopefully you've been getting some idea if this is the right movie for you.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.180
So...

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.440
Is that it then?

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.920
Yeah, pretty much.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.380
There's nothing else to re-enact.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:34.980
Though the studio that owns this does also own "50 Shades of Grey", it's unlikely they'll let me use the clips for that.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:41.680
NO!

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.480
NO!!

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.320
Okay, no.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.760
{Both groan in disappointment}

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.120
My inner goddess is about to explode.
