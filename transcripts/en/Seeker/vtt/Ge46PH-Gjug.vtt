00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.110
Scientists in Switzerland are working on an
alternative to antibiotics - and the impact

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.700
this has on medicine could be enormous.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.309
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and we’ve
talked a lot over the past couple of years

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.410
about the overuse of antibiotics, and how
it’s been leading to new strains of antibiotic-resistant

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.410
bacteria.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.820
According to the World Health Organization,
over 50,000 people in Europe and America alone

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.030
- die of drug-resistant bacteria every year.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.370
But finally, there is good news on the horizon
- a team of scientists in Switzerland is currently

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.120
working on developing an alternative to antibiotics
- that can treat several bacterial infections

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.030
and eliminate new strains of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.210
The team has managed to engineer nanoparticles,
composed of liposomes - which are small fluid

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.750
sacs enclosed in a lipid bilayer.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.410
Typically, these kinds of liposomes are used
to deliver medication into your body - but

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.850
here, they’ve been designed specifically
to attract bacterial toxins.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.490
The nanoparticles composed of these liposomes
closely resemble the membrane of host cells

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.080
- meaning that once they’re injected in
your body, bacterial toxins will mistake them

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.330
as naturally occurring lipids and try to infect
them.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.650
At that point, the nanoparticles will consume
those toxins, trap them inside, and neutralize

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.830
them - preventing the spread of toxins.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.940
Without those toxins, the host bacteria will
basically be rendered defenseless - and once

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.560
that happens, your body’s natural immune
system will easily be able to eliminate them.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.490
The team has already conducted successful
studies on mice, in which they’ve induced

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.479
septicemia - a fatal blood infection - by
injecting mice with various forms of Staphylococcus.

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.650
All of the untreated mice, died within 33
hours.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.360
But those who were administered this new drug
within 10 hours of the initial infection - managed

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.360
to live.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.369
Not only that, but they were protected against
pneumococcal pneumonia - which can occur as

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.480
a complication of septicemia.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.280
Scientists warn that while this isn’t a
cure-all for every infection - since each

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.860
species of bacteria requires its own tailored
solution - they do believe it could eventually

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.970
be used to treat MRSA infections.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.310
And they plan to make it freely available
worldwide, very soon.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.200
What do you guys think about this?

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.370
Could you see this changing the way we think
about medicine?

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.310
Let us know your thoughts in the comments
down below - and as always, thank you guys

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.879
for watching!
