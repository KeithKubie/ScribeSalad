00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.850
It will take 150 days for
Kavita's fern to grow 20 inches.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.050
Using our algebraic proportion,
we can cross multiply.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.750
So 15 times 20 is equal to 300.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.880
2 times x is just 2x, and we set both
of these equivalent to each other,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.210
and we get 300 is equal to 2x.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.093
Divide both sides by 2 to isolate x, and

00:00:23.093 --> 00:00:29.501
we are left with x equals 300
divided by 2, which equals 150
