00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.160
And the last fix that I wanted to perform was to add a title, so

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.220
that our reader of this chart knows what they're looking at.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.600
As we saw in lesson one, we can manipulate both SVG and HTML elements with D3.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.850
So let's add a header tag using D3 and then changing the text of that.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.260
We want the title to come before our chart.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.620
So right before SVG element we can append our header.
