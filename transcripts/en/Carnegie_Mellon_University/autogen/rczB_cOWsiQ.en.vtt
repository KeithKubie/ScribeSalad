can drag around to pull points based

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529
can drag around to pull points based
 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.859
can drag around to pull points based
upon certain values and this was cool

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869
upon certain values and this was cool
 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:30.909
upon certain values and this was cool
but i didn't think it was all that

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919
but i didn't think it was all that
 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.069
but i didn't think it was all that
tangible you're using a mouse you have a

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079
tangible you're using a mouse you have a
 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.330
tangible you're using a mouse you have a
monitor in front of you it's not

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340
monitor in front of you it's not
 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.700

terribly physical on the other hand we

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710
terribly physical on the other hand we
 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.889
terribly physical on the other hand we
have something like this an ipad which

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899
have something like this an ipad which
 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.020
have something like this an ipad which
is physical you can tilt it you can

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030
is physical you can tilt it you can
 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.480
is physical you can tilt it you can
touch it you can interact with it in new

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:43.490
touch it you can interact with it in new
 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.400
touch it you can interact with it in new
ways and so i thought why don't we

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410
ways and so i thought why don't we
 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.020
ways and so i thought why don't we
interact with data using an ipad in

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030
interact with data using an ipad in
 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.260
interact with data using an ipad in
completely different ways tangible ways

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270
completely different ways tangible ways
 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.060
completely different ways tangible ways
so i present to you touch phys which is

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070
so i present to you touch phys which is
 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.230
so i present to you touch phys which is
an interface for interacting with

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.240
an interface for interacting with
 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.060
an interface for interacting with
multivariate data when I say

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070
multivariate data when I say
 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.280

so you see here a bunch of points each

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070
so you see here a bunch of points each
 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.640
so you see here a bunch of points each
point is in this case a brand of cereal

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650
point is in this case a brand of cereal
 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.880
point is in this case a brand of cereal
and a large data set about cereals and I

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890
and a large data set about cereals and I
 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.130

can do things like I can attract them

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140
can do things like I can attract them
 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.960
can do things like I can attract them
based upon certain values so ones that

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970
based upon certain values so ones that
 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.429
based upon certain values so ones that
are higher in protein get pulled to my

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439
are higher in protein get pulled to my
 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.609
are higher in protein get pulled to my
finger faster I can filter them so right

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619
finger faster I can filter them so right
 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.770

now I'm setting anyone with less than

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780
now I'm setting anyone with less than
 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.569
now I'm setting anyone with less than
100 calories it's going to pass through

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579
100 calories it's going to pass through
 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:20.919
100 calories it's going to pass through
this filter i'm dragging between my

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929
this filter i'm dragging between my
 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:24.370
this filter i'm dragging between my
fingers i can then set a wall to keep

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380
fingers i can then set a wall to keep
 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.770
fingers i can then set a wall to keep
them from passing through i tilt iPad

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780
them from passing through i tilt iPad
 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.190
them from passing through i tilt iPad
and I can allow them through or not and

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200
and I can allow them through or not and
 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.330
and I can allow them through or not and
finally once you've gotten a set of data

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340
finally once you've gotten a set of data
 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.459
finally once you've gotten a set of data
you can then set a histogram which is a

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469
you can then set a histogram which is a
 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.109
you can then set a histogram which is a
statistical way to see the distribution

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119
statistical way to see the distribution
 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.300
statistical way to see the distribution
of your data so now I want to find it

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310
of your data so now I want to find it
 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.800
of your data so now I want to find it
cereal that are higher or lower in fat

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810
cereal that are higher or lower in fat
 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.199
cereal that are higher or lower in fat
and they automatically self-assemble

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209
and they automatically self-assemble
 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:44.020
and they automatically self-assemble
into this structure so now you know I

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030
into this structure so now you know I
 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.789
into this structure so now you know I
have some that are low in fat and have

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799
have some that are low in fat and have
 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.770
have some that are low in fat and have
few calories i can double click oh look

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780
few calories i can double click oh look
 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.449
few calories i can double click oh look
maybe shredded shredded wheat is a

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459
maybe shredded shredded wheat is a
 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.760
maybe shredded shredded wheat is a
serial for me that's way cool but this

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770
serial for me that's way cool but this
 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.349
serial for me that's way cool but this
will let you do even more than that so

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359
will let you do even more than that so
 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:55.330
will let you do even more than that so
i'm going to turn up the gravity push

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340
i'm going to turn up the gravity push
 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.949
i'm going to turn up the gravity push
everything down to the bottom just to

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959
everything down to the bottom just to
 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.859
everything down to the bottom just to
clean up my workspace now i'm going to

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869
clean up my workspace now i'm going to
 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.899
clean up my workspace now i'm going to
draw a histogram of calories this is

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909
draw a histogram of calories this is
 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.819
draw a histogram of calories this is
going to graph all the points out based

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829
going to graph all the points out based
 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.529
going to graph all the points out based
on how many calories they have some

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539
on how many calories they have some
 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:06.819
on how many calories they have some
cereals at the top have a lot of

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829
cereals at the top have a lot of
 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.279
cereals at the top have a lot of
calories like raisins in this one some

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289
calories like raisins in this one some
 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.800
calories like raisins in this one some
don't I can then do a traction to see

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810
don't I can then do a traction to see
 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.260
don't I can then do a traction to see
all sorts of interesting effects so I

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270
all sorts of interesting effects so I
 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.640
all sorts of interesting effects so I
can find out that ones that are high in

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650
can find out that ones that are high in
 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.700
can find out that ones that are high in
fat get pulled to my finger up here more

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710
fat get pulled to my finger up here more
 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.080
fat get pulled to my finger up here more
so than the ones that down here which

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090
so than the ones that down here which
 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.280
so than the ones that down here which
are low in calories

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290
are low in calories
 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.500
are low in calories
so high calories means high fat on the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510
so high calories means high fat on the
 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.300
so high calories means high fat on the
other hand I can see more interactive

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310
other hand I can see more interactive
 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.440
other hand I can see more interactive
things so the ones that are low in

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450
things so the ones that are low in
 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.119
things so the ones that are low in
calorie and high in calorie get put on

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129
calorie and high in calorie get put on
 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.920
calorie and high in calorie get put on
my finger when it's dragging on proteins

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930
my finger when it's dragging on proteins
 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.110
my finger when it's dragging on proteins
and so eventually you can dig into your

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120
and so eventually you can dig into your
 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.000
and so eventually you can dig into your
data and discover all sorts of really

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010
data and discover all sorts of really
 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.640
data and discover all sorts of really
neat features just by doing very

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650
neat features just by doing very
 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.289
neat features just by doing very
physical things they're real physical

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299
physical things they're real physical

these various sources okay so I was
inspired by the a tree map which is a

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:47.260

the various parts are and so i forked an
 

00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:58.050
the various parts are and so i forked an
old open source project and sort of

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:58.060
old open source project and sort of
 

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.550
old open source project and sort of
modernized it for iOS and what i have is

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560
modernized it for iOS and what i have is
 

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:09.740
