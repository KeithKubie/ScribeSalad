00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.319
Do you have a friend who just…

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:02.540
INHALES their food?

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.540
You know what I mean?

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.549
Like, you've had one bite and THEIR WHOLE
BURRITO IS GONE?

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.850
What are you doing, man?

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.740
Did you even taste it?

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.210
Turns out, she probably didn't.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.550
foodies
Food is incredible. I love it. I love to eat

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.600
it, I love to cook it, I love shopping for
the ingredients!

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.630
There's nothing worse than spending hours
shopping, prepping, cooking, and serving,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.599
just to have someone scarf it in three bites
in seconds. And a new study confirms what

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.130
I'd knew in my foodie heart… people who
eat super fast, don't taste their food; not

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.130
really, anyway.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.280
The study was published in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences under

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.850
the appetizing title, "Optimal directional
volatile transport in retronasal olfaction,"

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.570
because science, while great at mise en place,
has no sense of presentation. Translating

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.690
the title into layman: they wanted to know
how smells got to our nose, from the outside

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.640
or the INSIDE. And their study found, the
latter was actually more important. Our tongue

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.970
tastes five (maybe six) flavors, but food
can have any number of smells to add to those

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.970
perceptions!

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.070
Using a model of the human mouth, throat and
nasal cavities, researchers found when we

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.259
inhale through the nose, we create an "air
curtain" which keeps volatile -- or airborne

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.200
-- molecules from going into the lungs. But,
when we exhale, food volatiles trapped in

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.580
the back of the throat swirl upward into the
nasal cavity, where we sense them with our

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.009
olfactory systems!

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.210
If you eat fast, the air curtain doesn't form,
the volatiles don't have time to get trapped

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.420
in the back of your throat, and thus you don't
smell and taste together!

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.950
There's definitive science for slowing down
to savor a meal, for sure.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.149
Sometimes, you just want a good scarf, a satisfying
guzzling of comforting carbohydrates can make

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.670
us feel really good once in a rare while,
but making a habit of it is the dangerous.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.610
This MAY be supported by a 2006 study of nearly
5000 people in the Journal of Epidemiology

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.899
which found, the rate of food intake heavily
correlated with rate of obesity!

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.210
And another study in the Journal of American
Dietetic Association discovered, when people

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.370
eat fast, they take in more calories, but
feel less satisfaction from their meal!

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.230
If you look at how complicated our alimentary
canal really is, this makes more than a mouthful

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.230
of sense.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.900
The stomach is a highly connected organ in
the human body. It has a direct connection

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.330
along the vagus nerve right to the brain stem.
When you put food in your belly, the stomach

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.620
has mucosa and muscles which detect the mechanical
feel and overall volume of food, as well as

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.930
how much the stomach compressed or stretched.
When it's empty, a hormone called ghrelin

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.569
is secreted -- called the hunger hormone,
to trigger appetite. Once you eat, the stomach

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.530
stretches, and ghrelin is suppressed; causing
your vagus nerve to signal your brain stem…

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.300
and that signal tells the intestinal train
to get moving!

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.349
Obviously, this is SUPER simplified, there
are hormones, enzymes and nerves being tripped

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.400
and squirted all over the tube running through
the middle of your body, but like that corn

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.909
you ate yesterday… let's try to get through
this in one piece.

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:04.019
Next, food moves into the intestine and another
hormone called leptin comes into the picture.

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.390
Leptin is one piece of the nutrient satiation
puzzle, the idea that what you're eating has

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.750
fulfilled your body's nutritional requirement.
Scientists don't entirely understand the whole

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.909
thing, but they know, as food continues through
the system, the ileum, colon and rectum will

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:26.060
cause secretion of MORE hormones called PYY.
A 2006 study found, when mice were deprived

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.060
of PYY, they wouldn't control their intake,
and became obese!

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.739
So scientists figure, PYY (along with all
these other hormones, nerves and triggers)

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.720
eventually work together to tell your brain
OKAY Y'ALL. WE'RE GOOD DOWN HERE. STOP EATING.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.720
[[whew!!]]

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.720
Complicated, no?

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.720
It's important to be cognizant of the fact,
humans are not robots. Many people try and

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720
control every aspect of their lives, including
eating to take in calories, but being mindful

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.720
of WHAT you're eating, is just as important
as HOW you're eating. When we eat like a machine,

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.720
our body doesn't have time to suppress or
secrete these myriad of compounds, or trigger

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.720
these processes. It takes time for this sack
of meat to know when it's got food in it!

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.810
So, science says it's best to eat slowly.
You'll taste your food better, you'll decrease

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.049
your portion sizes, and feel better about
what you've eaten!

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.629
You might even lose weight!

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.150
Don't eat TOO slow… if you eat so slow that
you stop eating altogether you'd eventually

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.400
die. Eventually… ever curious about what
would happen in between?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.400
So was I!

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.060
How long could we survive without food or
water?

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:15.959
Don't worry, we DNewsed 
it.

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:16.979
Do you eat fast?

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:17.979
Why?

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.240
Don't tell me you're punching your brother
or sister for a seat at the table. Think about

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.330
it for a second and answer with something
introspective, why do you think eat at the

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.540
speed you eat?
