00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.050
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Hello,
my name is David Plylar

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.780
and I'm a music specialist
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.390
And it is my great pleasure to be
here with Kristian Bezuidenhout,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.140
who gave us an amazing
fortepiano recital last night

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.770
where he played works
by Beethoven and Haydn.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.280
And today we managed to
corner him and keep him here

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.090
for a little bit longer so that we
can show him a few of our treasures

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.750
from our holdings at
the Library of Congress.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.440
We have a bit of a kind of
Viennese and Austrian special set

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.120
of selections that we're
going to take a look at.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.610
So thank you for being with me.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.910
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Great pleasure.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.210
Thank you, David.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.570
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I thought
we would start with a piece

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.560
that you have recorded
with Petra Mullejans.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.860
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Yeah, that's right, yes.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.440
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Who is a cofounder
of the Freiburger Barockorchester.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.970
And it was a lovely recording.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.700
And this is Mozart's violin
sonata in G major K379.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.050
And we happen to have it here,
so I thought that would be.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.350
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Extraordinary.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.650
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.100
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Wow.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.870
You know, I have to
be really honest.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.490
I'm not one of these people
whose involved in this repertory

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.730 position:56%
who has spent a lot of time
actually looking at the manuscripts.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.570
So it's I think when you unveil the
first page of something like this

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.270
that you've actually seen in
digital PDF versions many times,

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.820
it's actually quite overwhelming.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.300 position:56%
379 is really -- how can I put this?

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.260
Even straight off the bat, you see
that this is a sonata for violin

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.460
and piano, which is extensively
this kind of very polite,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.850
delightful entertainment
for amateurs to be playing.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.780
It should be quite
easy to deal with,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.350
technically not too challenging.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.610
It shouldn't be anything too crazy.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.610
And yet Mozart sets up this part
on here where he starts a sonata

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.910
for violin and piano

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.420
with an unbelievably richly
scored elaborate adagio movement.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.430
Which then immediately leads

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.980
into this wild G minor
allegro in the beginning.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.190
So extraordinary.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.510
You see also that there's
this sense I always think

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.220
with these manuscripts
with Mozart's penmanship,

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.880
that there's a level kind of
built in to the DNA detail

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.870
that just is immediately there from
everything, from every pen stroke

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.710
to every slur to the trace of every
slur to the end of every measure.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.650
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Great clarity
on the staccato marking.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.530
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Absolutely.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.840
That's really true, in
fact, the articulation even

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.010
in this stage really is just,
it's like it actually is part

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.710
of the basic character
of the notes themselves,

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.530
how they should be played, and
not just getting the pitches down.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.690
You see that with the level of
specificity with the slurring

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.960
and staccatos, exactly as you say.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.030
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: This is
the first time that both

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:35.900
of us are taking a look at this, so
we're exploring it together here.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.040
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: What's
very interesting about this piece,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.050
just from a historical standpoint,
Mozart is in Vienna in 1781

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.570
and he is obliged to
play a private concert

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.010
for his patron, the Archbishop.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.240
And I think it's really important
to realize that this is a point

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.460
at which Mozart is
really fighting the fact

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.360
that he desperately
wants to be soft-spoken.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.190
And so I think this is
probably the one moment when all

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.200
of this gets put into sharp relief.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.520
Because Mozart is forced to
play this private concert

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.270
for the Archbishop, and it's
exactly this piece that he plays.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.740
And we have a letter that
he describes this situation

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.740
in which he plays this piece
with Brunetti, who was the leader

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.510
of the court orchestra in Salzburg,
and Mozart wasn't a big fan

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.970
of Brunetti and kind of complained
about his playing, in fact.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.260
But then pulls out
a sonata like this.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.760 position:56%
And 379 is I think really one of the
pieces that puts Mozart on the map

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.790 position:56%
of kind of reshaping what the violin
sonata is capable of as a genre

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.010
in the sense that it would then
be taken up later by Beethoven.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.630
I mean, this is a piece that starts
with an adagio and then moves

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.340
on to this allegro and
is a theme in variations.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.180
[inaudible] totally, right.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.910
It's kind of fantasy-like in a
sense because it moves a coda

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.090
from movement to movement, and
also ends with a set of variations,

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:13.140
which we'll also see later.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.860
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Was he already --

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.770
he's newly in Vienna or just
right on the cusp of that?

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.820
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: I
think break hadn't yet happened,

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.100
I think it happened
in May, maybe 81.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.410 position:56%
This was right before that, if I'm
not mistaken, I could be dead wrong.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.820
But it was all about
to go horribly wrong.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.130
And I think this, this piece
really is emblematic of that.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.060
Because I think there's this
comment that Mozart makes

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.060
where he feels really put down
by the fact that he has to sit

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.300
with the servants at this function,
or perhaps it's another function.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.810
But all of this stuff is
happening at the same time.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.800 position:56%
And you see him also in a piece like
this, like let's say particularly

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.000
with G minor, that there's all
this -- how can I put this?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.340
Nostalgia for Amadeus.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.660
And how much of a breakthrough
that was

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.390
for him musically and artistically.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.150
I think it comes through
very strongly in this piece,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.480
alternation between
G major and G minor,

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:15.990
these kind of dramatic pauses,
Amadeus style writing and kind

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.100
of wild virtuosity as well.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: You know,
speaking of that, part of what comes

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.610
out of this to me when
I'm looking at it is that,

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.120
we always have this image of Mozart
and Mendelson as being perfect

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.780
from the very moment that
they write something down .

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.220
But there's very clearly
some alternative thoughts

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:46.560
and some vacillation perhaps in the
process, which is both humanizing

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.460
but in the end still amazing work.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.510
But it also, you know, it
offers something of a --

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:02.240
I always think with these
composers that we hold so highly

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.590
that there's a -- whenever people
say you couldn't change the notes,

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.540
I always think, well, they probably
could've come up with something

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.660
that was equally as good, just
a different variation of it.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.360
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: This
brings up such a good point, David.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.670
Because, especially with Mozart,
we're really trapped by this,

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.430
the tyranny of this idea that every
note is preordained by the heavens

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.410
or the cosmos, and Mozart
just sort of writes it down.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.540
But you see this really
with everything,

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.200
there are very specific examples
like the C minor piano marcato,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.090
which is one of the messiest,

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.400
most fraught manuscripts
that you'll look at.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.210
And like things that you see
here in 379 where Mozart crosses

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.250
out certain things and revises them

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.210
or changes the figuration a
little bit, like the actual notes

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:52.010
that he wants played, you see that
constantly in a piece like 491.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.620
Where he is actually still very
much in this kind of process

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.730
of figuring things out even in
this stage of the manuscript.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.500
That is unusual for Mozart.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.570
And you see, it sort of
changes character in a way.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.420
Like the first page is sort of
very Apollonian and kind of perfect

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.720
and everything in its place.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.840
And then somehow I like to
think when we get to G minor

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.520
and things get fraught and
a little bit more dramatic,

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.110
it gets a bit messier and a little
more disorganized in a sense,

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:26.160
or a tiny bit more
unsure of itself in a way.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.350
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: You know,
another thing I noticed,

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.190
maybe in this region right here,
you know, one of the other things

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.790
that composers who write by hand --

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.540
there still are some who to
this day still write by hand.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.400
Which I appreciate,
especially at the Library,

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.320
we appreciate when they
give us those scores.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.950
Is the order that you
write something

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:48.980
and if it's not a finished thing,
that does have an impact on then

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.660
when you realize after you've
written four bars of something,

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.860
that, you know, with long
notes and then you have

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.250
to fill a bunch of short notes in.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.550
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Absolutely.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.800
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: It seems
like that's a kind of problem

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.050
that composers have never outgrown.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.320
And you can see that perhaps
Mozart was slightly afflicted

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.620
with that here.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.920
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Definitely.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.220
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: In some of
the tightness of the writing.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.770
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
[inaudible] that he can really fit

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.090
in those 30-second notes, isn't it?

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.390
Absolutely.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.040
You see this especially with
Mozart, he runs into this problem

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.120
where he has memory issues.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.380
Because you'll see that he'll write
out certain things, let's say,

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.710
in a piano sonata, like he'll
write up certain keyboard notes,

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:31.800
and then he'll go back and write
-- he'll go back and fill in,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.580
let's say, the second violin
or something like that.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.520
Or they'll be some voice that
has to be dealt with later,

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.200
and he'll forget what he's written

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.240
in another voice, and
they'll be clashes.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.150
In the C minor piano
sonata, there are tons

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.800
of places whether there are just
literally wrong notes together.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.200
Because the stage of composition
is so delineated by Mozart,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.370
was separated, that he writes
things at different times.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:10:00.770
And his memory doesn't allow him
to keep up with what he's written.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.170
And he's not really
checking vertically.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.770
He's still really just writing
in this direction, horizontally.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.070
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: That's
very interesting.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.370
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: And, of
course, it's not such a problem

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.700
in a piece for three lines, like
one violin and two piano staves.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.150
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: But
problematic in an orchestra.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.560
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Hugely problematic,

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.420
especially when you add
trumpets and timpani and yeah.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.780
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: And there
are different keys, right.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.480
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
It's also very interesting

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.780
to see how things look.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.120
You know, when you step back and
you see moments that are really --

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.590 position:56%
you know, where the ink really comes

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.350
across as really sharply
black or very delineated.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.790
And then these other places that --

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.700
it has such a beautiful
kind of pattern into it.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.090
It's really.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.440
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah, and I'm
not an expert in this at all.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.740
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Nor am I.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.590
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: It does
have this look of --

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:58.050
also you can kind of see the ebb
and flow of dipping or something

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.270
like that, that's my supposition

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:05.650
for how it might attain
this type of a look.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:10.440
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: I think
it's really it's very touching

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.530
to see this actually, because
you start to see that --

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.990
I don't know how I
can put this quite.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:21.220
But this sense that -- around
this time, Mozart is beginning

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:27.780
to understand the latent
artistic -- how can I put this?

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.420
Artistic potential for a genre
like this, like the violin sonata.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.050
Which is really locked
kind of trapped away

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:40.260 position:56%
in this bourgeois amateur mileur
[phonetic], where it's just supposed

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.250
to be delightful entertainment for
people playing at dinner parties.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.260
And I don't know why
I'm so stuck by that.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.160
Maybe because it's a triple
timepiece in G minor preluded

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.660
by an adagio, that it really
seems like he's saying,

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.650
but possibly unconsciously while
this is going to be a genre

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:02.590
that will become very attractive to
Beethoven as a real art form genre,

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.100
much like the piano sonata
becomes for Beethoven.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:11.910 position:56%
And yet, after this shocking
movement in G minor which ends forte

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:16.190
with octaves and tremblers in the
right hand, then you turn the page

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:21.600
and you have this incredibly kind
of innocent rococo genteel set

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.100
of variations in andantino
and two four time.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.840
And you also see that Mozart
is still saying, oh, well,

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.990
it's still very charming actually.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:37.070
Now, don't be too shocked
by what I've just done.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.500
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: That is
fascinating because the notion

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.820
that it doesn't quite
fit into its function,

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:49.840
its assumed functional role, yet
so much energy, whether, you know,

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.970 position:56%
maybe for Mozart it wasn't as much
energy as it is for other composers.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.490 position:56%
But the amount of thought and
energy that goes into the production

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:01.870
of any work, I think that
that's always worth respecting

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:03.840
and thinking about, like you are.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.140
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: For sure.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:10.220
Interesting that -- you're
absolutely right what you say

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.300
about these space issues.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.540
This is surprisingly kind of
jammed together in places.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:21.280
I mean, like many of these
variations that's for violin

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.060
and piano, Mozart always has
a variation for solo piano.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.680
It just has such an --
It's a very, I don't know,

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.600
always struck me as
very modern idea.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.940
It's like, okay, thank
you for the theme,

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.860
but now let me be the
first to do this.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.330
It's quite combative.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.690
It's a little bit like, okay,
now let's see what you can do.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.730
But he does really jam
a lot into this first --

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:47.840
I can tell you, this is
such an alarmingly --

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:53.650
this is a very a tricksy
movement, let me put it that way.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.130
The theme is very charming
and not easy to play,

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:00.000
but it seems like,
okay, this is lovely.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.870
And I can tell you,
the first variation

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.890
from the keyboard is so awkward.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.050
Very awkwardly written.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:10.690
For Mozart, surprisingly
difficult to play,

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.010
even though it sounds very easy.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:16.540
It's a very curious piece, and
it just takes you by surprise.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.860
He sets up this structure in
the theme where the beginning

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.140
of the theme is quite
lyrical and easy-going.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.250
But then he has these moments of
mini drama when he goes to A minor

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.780
and then back to C major.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.230
And in all of the variations,
that moment becomes more

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:36.250
and more dramatic, and I think more
and more technically challenging.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:39.730
So in the first variation, it's
actually these octaves and the bass

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:44.000
and the piano all the sudden, and
then hand-crossing without warning.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.180
And then the violin does
its first variation,

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.820
which is also sounds
really chirpy and charming,

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.620
but is very awkward actually.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:59.250
And then you can see that
Mozart has to fit in all

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:05.570
of these tiny demisemiquavers
in the third variation.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.590
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Here's
an interesting moment,

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:17.950
where there's a lot of
crossed out [inaudible].

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.270
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Yeah.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:25.970
So I think -- this is
really interesting.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:31.400
It doesn't seem to be
space-saving so much as it looks

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.690
like Mozart finishes
the G minor variation,

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:39.390
which then in real time
leads right into the adagio.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:43.680
But what's so telling is that
he writes the adagio variation

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.770
without the violin line above it.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.480
So I think he's really
treating this, again,

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.160
like a keyboard variation
in a sense.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.630
I think clearly not
-- the idea is not

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.300
that he wrote the keyboard
variation and thought,

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.830
this will be a variation for
keyboard alone and then decided

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.660
to add the violin line later.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.640
But the fact that the violin
line is sort of relegated

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.850
to this tiny space
on the other page.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:16.380
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: It's
a coda, so yeah.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.040
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
That's exactly right.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.020
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: It doesn't have
as much of a motivating role as.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.320
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
That's exactly.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.620
Yes, this is true.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:28.770
And it's like what you see
in Mozart's notational style

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:33.020
or structural settings for
things like the piano sonatas,

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.050
the way the staves are aligned,
the idea of the bass line

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:40.380
on the left hand corresponding
with the cello and bass department,

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.960
and then you've got
the violins at the top,

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.810
and everything gets
filled-in in a sense.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:48.750
Mozart is very clear about the
most important structural elements

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.090
of what he's writing
being put in place first

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.930
and then filling-in the blanks as
it were as a kind of shorthand.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.230
And that's very.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.160
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: That's
something that I think carried

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.340
over to composers like
Schubert and Brahms.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:04.890
My understanding was that Schubert
would often write melodic line

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.420
with a piano bass line.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.900
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Exactly.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.400
It's so wonderful too
because the way the structure

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:16.770
of this variation works, which is
true of many Mozart variations,

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:21.230
the last literal variation
is this adagio variation.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:25.850
Which is really -- again, this
is one of those moments in Mozart

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.590
where you realize that things, like
the universe, sort of just opens

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.640
up like this in one moment.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.080
It's an extraordinary piece.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.860
You've got this pizzicato
line from the violin.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:44.640
This unbelievably fluid, incredibly
finely wrote adagio variation

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.800
from the piano with
incredible scales going all

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.420
up and down the keyboard.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:54.280
Once that variation is over,
Mozart literally writes,

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.590
play the theme again
[foreign language].

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.000
Which is so charming in a sense.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.010 position:56%
Because, well, okay, we're done
with that now, play the theme again.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:05.760 position:56%
And once you finish playing the
theme, oh, I've got this little coda

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.060
that I'd like to add on to that.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.570
And here it is on the last two
lines, and then just play that

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.450
and that's the end of the piece.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:16.180
It's sort of so, I don't know,
it's so riant, touching in a sense.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.150
It's like this is so
gorgeous and romantic

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.990
and completely from another planet.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:24.840
But then it's back to business.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.370
Play the theme again, but don't
forget to play this legato.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:31.000
And there's a delightful little bit
of semiquaver stuff from the piano,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.650
and that's the end of the piece and
it finishes piano with short notes.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:35.950
That was that.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:39.550
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah, he
just kind of grounds it.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.450
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
You see this in --

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:47.090 position:56%
I really like this idea that when
Mozart repeats a theme in this stage

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:50.170
of the gestation process,
he'll just say, look,

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:51.470
just play the theme
again [foreign language].

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:54.500
You see this in the C minor
piano sonata four, five,

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.900
seven, in the middle movement.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:59.210 position:56%
The theme comes back again and
again in the course of the movement.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:03.100
And this is through composed
movement, it's not like a series

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.300
of discrete variations like this,

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.180
where he has to really
make this clear.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.970
And he just says, play
the theme again.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.390
And, of course, when the piece
is prepared for publication,

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.350
he realizes that he needs to
give his audience some idea

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:19.450
of what they might do with those
varied returns of the theme.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.560
So then he writes up ornaments
for us, for the layperson.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:28.450 position:56%
And it's wonderful, very tantalizing
sense of, okay, play it again,

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:31.150
but what might you do
differently the second time.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:36.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So would Mozart
have that sort of an expectation on,

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.520
say, a repeated thing like this?

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.830
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
I think so.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:43.730 position:56%
Bear in mind, this is one of those
pieces we really know Mozart played.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:48.500
Mozart played a lot of
his music, but he also --

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.820
we know that there's music that
he didn't get a chance to play,

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.790
or was possibly played by other
people, or that he really wrote

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:58.640
for other people in mind, like
Barbara Ployer, his student.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.220
This is a piece that we
know Mozart really played

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.170
at a real event in 1781.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.440
In the same way that we
know Mozart played 454,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.860
the B flat sonata for
violin and piano.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:15.460
So I think there's this very strong
sense that there is the sense

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.440
of the unknown, that the
theme has to come back

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.740
and Mozart plays it again.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:23.590 position:56%
And it's imbued with ever new
levels of fantasy and ornamentation.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:28.760
And there's this possibly erroneous
myth surrounding this piece,

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.830
and that is that Mozart really had

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.300
to write this sonata
incredibly quickly

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.750
for this private concert
for the Archbishop.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.190
And that the reports
are that he played

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:43.800
from basically the vaguest
sort of piece of paper

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.320
with no real information on it.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.510
And I think the message
that that is sending is

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:54.270
that possibly Mozart gave Brunetti,

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.440
who played this, clear
notes to play.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.420
Like here's the adagio
and here's the allegro

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:04.300
and here's the variation set,
and here's what you have to do.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.390
But I like to think -- and this
is probably a little romantic --

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.790
but I think possibly Mozart didn't
really know what exactly was going

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:13.120
to happen in the variation
movements, let's say.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.150
He had some idea of
what the basic character

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:17.460
of each variation would be.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.080
But possibly he had a very,
very rudimentary sketch

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.180
for himself to play from.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.060
Which ties into issues
with Beethoven

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.540
as well relates this
is really a case

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.250
of a composer should be involved

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.020
in the performance of
something of later.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.240
But this is really a case of a
composer actually being involved

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.540
in the performance of something.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.010
And that this being the manuscript
stage of a text like that --

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:40.920 position:56%
which is probably compared to what
he played from in the performance --

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.130
even a much richer, more fully
documented version of that.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.650
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: This
is fascinating.

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:49.820
Why don't we compare this -- well,
we don't have a direct comparison.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:55.180
Why don't we take a look at some
works that straddle this here,

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:58.050
in terms of we have
a recent acquisition

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.810
of a new Haydn manuscript and also
one that we've had for a while.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.090
So a Haydn crescendo
and a Haydn sonata.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.240
If you can kind of situate them.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.800
And these are the.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Fantastic.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.820
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: The next piece
that we're going to take a look

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:16.430
at is a very recent
acquisition, as in last week.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.470
So it's very new to
us at the Library.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:28.940
This is the Haydn Capriccio
dating from I believe 1765.

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.690
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Sounds right, yeah.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:34.030
In fact, I think I got an
email last week saying,

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:36.490
we've just got this piece,
might you consider playing this

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.550
in your recital.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.450
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah,
we apologize for that.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:41.960
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
No, don't be silly.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.580
It's just it's actually it's
quite a thorny and tricky

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.260
and difficult to negotiate piece.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:51.650
It's one of those pieces that you
think, oh, this looks charming.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:57.640
But there's a lot of very
thorny stuff in this piece.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.940
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah,
and it's also --

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.040
it might not have been the
most appropriate selection

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.960
for the program as well.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.260
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: I know,

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.930
because the program is very
serious and kind of very, yeah.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.130
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: But
this is I believe based

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:13.940
on an Austria folktale.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.530
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
We think so, yes.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.500
It's a little unclear exactly
what, but, yes, that's right.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.320
And it does kind of -- I don't
know exactly what the text is,

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.210
but it's outrageous, one
needs [inaudible] castrations

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:25.510
or something like that.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:31.220
It's really probably kind of
really toilet humor stuff I think.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:35.010
I've not played the
piece, but right.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.600
It's very interesting the few
shorter works that Haydn has --

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.650
the one I played last night, the
set of variations in F minor,

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:55.730
and the C major Fantasia
and other pieces like it,

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.390
it's so fascinating how
these pieces are so different

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.370
from the so-called serious
pieces in sonata form.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:06.410
And Haydn I think really
takes that to a degree of kind

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:11.160
of comic absurdity that's just
-- that oscillates between that

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.120
and a piece like the
F minor variations,

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:18.250
which is so deeply serious and kind
of structured and thought about

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:25.040
and really like just a real
piece of art music in a sense.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.300
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I mean,
not to divert to the program

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.360
that you played last night, but
you almost have an inverted sense

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.660
of Haydn the jokester

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.530
versus Beethoven the
jokester in the second sonata.

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:37.500
Which I think is hilarious
in many ways.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.190
Then you paired that with
the very serious Haydn work.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.190
So it was nice to see all that --

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.100
of course, all these
composers are very --

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:50.410
you know, have multiple things
that they offer, more than we tend

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.730
to describe them generically.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:55.500
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
That's very true because I mean,

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.050 position:56%
Beethoven is very humorous at times.

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:03.690
But often people are more drawn to
the kind of pathos rhythm writing

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.320
in the keyboard sonatas perhaps
than they would be to the jocular,

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.070
like let's poke fun at things.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:13.050
That's a nice point, absolutely.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:17.090
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So around 1765,

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:20.350
what kind of an instrument
might Haydn have been looking

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:21.920
at or playing on?

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.550
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Well,
Haydn is one of these people

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.580
who plays just every possible --

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:30.200
or he's exposed to every possible
keyboard through the course

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.220
of the trajectory of his
career as a composer, pianist.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.790
Let's say a composer who
plays the piano and writes

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.700
for keyboard instruments.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:46.210 position:56%
I'm only saying that because I think
Haydn is one of these genius types

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.310
who writes for instruments,
but it's very clear

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:53.640
that Haydn doesn't identify himself
as a keyboard player when he goes

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.300
to bed at night or
wakes up in the morning.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.620
And I think people like Mozart
and Beethoven really do and did.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:04.240
Mozart really, the whole of his
career, and Beethoven pretty much

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.470
until the early 19th century,
when he starts to realize that --

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.920
let's say possibly until the fourth
piano contatto when he realizes

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.790
that the reality of
playing in public

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:18.090
as a virtuoso pianist suddenly
is not an option anymore.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:21.110
And I think Haydn really never
thinks of himself like that

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.590
but happens to write for
keyboard instruments.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:27.220
So I think if you look at the
keyboard sonatas, there's the sense

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:31.500
that he's writing certainly
with the clavichord in mind,

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:36.710
possibly not as any vehicle for
any kind of real performance

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.320
but as an imaginary
stage full of performance

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.510
in which the clavichord would
be the mode of expression.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:48.230
So that's the first stage where
you have maximum intimacy,

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:53.570
kind of private theater of
exploration with the clavichord.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:59.070
And then you go to his music,
which is clearly inspired

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.480
by the harpsichord, or could have
been played on the harpsichord,

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.640
or the harpsichord may have been
the instrument that he was using

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.750
to actually bring these
pieces across.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:15.400 position:56%
And then we go from that to the late
18th century five octave fortepiano,

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.670
or the very early 19th century,
five octave Viennese fortepiano.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.670
The piano I played last
night, the Schultz,

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:23.710
copy by Tom and Barbara Wolf.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:28.530
Haydn was a huge fan of those
pianos and cherished their sound

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.140 position:56%
and their articulation possibilities
and the color possibilities

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.670
that they have to offer
as well enormously.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:36.900
And then as we'll get to in
a minute, you go from that

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.840
to the pianos that Haydn
got to know when he was

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.640
in London for his visits there.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.660
Which are completely different
beasts from Viennese instruments.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.790
They have a kind of
denser, richer sound.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:53.340
They have a less scientifically
Viennese perfect approach

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.640
to damping.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:28:00.380
So the sound is a lot more kind
of air and hallo around it.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.420 position:56%
So the thing with Haydn is that you
have to sort of situate every piece,

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.530
every sonata, every
shorter work, and try

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:09.390
and find the logic
from where to put it.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.850
Feasibly where it was played.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:13.020
What keyboard it might
have been played on.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:19.000
And a piece like this Capriccio is
so interesting because it's so kind

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.220
of extensively folksy and banal.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:28.820
You have to find a way of coming up
with a program for understanding,

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.800
okay, which instrument what
was he playing this on?

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.180
Which instrument did he
imagine this to be played on?

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.550
Does it make sense to
take it to the fortepiano

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:39.260
if it may have been
a harpsichord piece?

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:44.680
It's pretty clear I think that
Haydn was not in this stage

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.280
where he was really
exposed to keyboard,

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.380
like real piano instruments,
at this stage.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.380
So it must've been some kind
of intersection of clavichord

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.720
or harpsichord, possibly
harpsichord.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:03.650 position:56%
But Haydn is a fascinating -- it's a
fascinating journey that he goes on.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:07.710 position:56%
Because he's -- I mean, historically
speaking, we're talking about 1732

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:10.690
to 1809, and that is
like the transformation

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:13.410
that one witnesses in
that period is just.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:15.890
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Amazing.

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:17.190
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
But you see also,

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:21.060
I think it's so interesting
that this is a folk song

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.030
so one's not expecting
mega sophisticated

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.490
or complicated notational extras.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:30.510
But there's really no
articulation of any kind.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.860
It's just the notes.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.400
There isn't a dynamic
marking in sight.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:41.690
I thought it was interesting
in the 379, in the Mozart,

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:44.700 position:56%
Mozart begins with not a huge amount
of information about dynamics.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.830
He doesn't say, you know, dolce
or mezzo forte or anything

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.300
like this or forte or piano.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:55.140
But the articulations are cared
for in such a deeply detailed way.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:56.960
But here we have nothing.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.080
We have moderato to tell
us what the character is.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.980
It's probably forte because most
pieces begin forte unless you

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.280
hear otherwise.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.170
[inaudible] Exactly.

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:12.590
A kind of wedge here or
there to show likeness.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:17.410
But it's really just it's kind
of presentational in a sense.

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:25.110
And it's a very -- I don't know,

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:30.270
I think I'm definitely
way over-analyzing this.

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:36.580
But it's a lot more --
it's very ordered in a way.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.640
Everything is very neat.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.660
The script doesn't
really change very much.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:47.180
The density of the notes,
in a sense, it's very.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.400
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah, I
almost wonder if there's --

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.750
I know no idea if this is
just out of left field --

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.980
but it looks the bar lines are
almost pre-ruled or something.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.280
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Yes, yes.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.700
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Because
there's such uniformity.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.000
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Right.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.630
I mean, I guess he's
in a handy situation

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.620
because he's got a triple
time variating Capriccio here

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:08.030
where he's not -- it's not like
the Mozart where he is sort

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:10.280
of figuring out as he goes along.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:14.090
It's like, oh, dear, I need to
read in 30-second notes now,

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:19.250
that's going to be challenging.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:26.650
One thing that's so vividly clear
about this, when you see it,

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.070
is how much Haydn is so
interested in playing

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.570
around with texture as
a form of variation.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:37.170
So I think becomes so
attractive for Beethoven as well.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:43.100 position:56%
Mozart is too, but it's kind of very
vividly visual here, when you see,

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.310
okay, here we have triplets
in the left hand now,

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:47.290
and now we have triplets
in the right hand.

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:52.500 position:56%
And this is sort of a textual device
that's really used for, you know,

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.320
for big, big lines of music.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.620
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.660
And you then you have those
like the sudden pop-outs

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:58.960
of register [inaudible].

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.890
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Yes, absolutely.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:06.000
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah, it's quite
theatrical but also effective just

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.850
in terms of setting
up that kind of --

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:12.070
not a swampon [phonetic]
sound but something.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.700
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Well, that's the thing is,

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:18.850
I guess when you've got --
he's got this theme obviously,

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:24.520
but it becomes the charm of these
variations, a capriccio like this,

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.410 position:56%
or any type of thing where
something is repeated over and over,

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:33.840
and it gets objected
to these modifications.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.300
This sort of delight
in the simplest means,

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:43.130
but the most graphically-varied
textual devices is such a --

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:46.040
I think 18th century audiences
would've found this absolutely

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:52.080
so charming and almost like
a Disney movie in a sense.

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:55.060
It's like, oh, wow, that's amazing.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.070
How did you come up with that?

00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:00.610
And who knows what the
intersection is between how much

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:02.740
of it was really improvised
or how much of it was kind

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.820
of quasi-improvised, and
then people go home and say,

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:10.030
that was a great idea, let
me just tweak it a bit more.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:13.860
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: You know,
another thing that's interesting

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:18.070
about this just thinking of your
performance last night of the --

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:20.990
trying to think exactly where
this happens in the variations.

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:24.910
But where he'll do a figure,
like a broken octave figure,

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:31.150
in one register, and then
emulate it in another one as kind

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:37.280 position:56%
of a reference point but also as a
developmental tool and also a sonic.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.960
It's very -- I always find
it fascinating with Haydn

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.740
and Beethoven especially
does that as well.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.040
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Yes, that's very true.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.800
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: But you can
kind of see that happening.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.630
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Yeah, very clearly.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:57.080
It's interesting too, we've
got G major to G major 379,

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:05.510
I don't think we really
planned that that way.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.690
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: You know, one
thing that pops out here also is

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:13.230
that there's this stretch of
about six or seven bars where --

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:18.270 position:56%
and it's going a little bit -- where
the ink seems distinctly different.

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:19.570
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: It does.

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:21.180
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: And
it's not that clear

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.220
that it's a re-inking situation

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.280
or rather maybe something
an over-writing,

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:32.160 position:56%
just because there is some
distinct coloration between the two.

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.460
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Yes.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.890
And we haven't seen that
kind of variety before or --

00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:38.820
I mean, it's not like the
Mozart where there are sort

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.010
of more intense places,
and, you know,

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:42.840
it's kind of all mixed in together.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:48.160
It's very -- the coloration is
very clearly different here just

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.910
for a small stretch, and then.

00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:52.210
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah.

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:53.510
And I'm not sure whether
this was something

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.740
that was amended later
just to bring clarity.

00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:59.070
Because it doesn't look
like there are changes

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.370
in pitches or anything like that.

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:01.670
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: No.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.010
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I don't
know whether it was

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:05.120
in Haydn's hand or not.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:10.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Also
interesting that you suddenly get --

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.550
and it's true in the F
minor variations as well.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:16.980
And it was always hard to know
what to do in these pieces where,

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.790
you're playing a piece that's
actually a variation set,

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:24.340
so the suspension of disbelief
is that the audience is trying

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.040
to convince themselves that
you're actually improvising it.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.640
But then there are these places in
the piece where you actually do get

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.930
to a place where you have to say,
well, what do I do now actually?

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.710
Like, do I add something here?

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:38.270
And invariably, these are the
places in the Mozart variation set

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:40.540
or in a piano connata or something
like this where there's a fermata

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:45.340
over a chord and then there's an
arpeggio here between the hands

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:46.920
that goes up the keyboard.

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:50.280
And one then has to do
decide, okay, is this a place

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.260
where I add something else?

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:56.530
We know that Mozart plays
lead-ins in piano cantatas to get

00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:01.420
from the dominant back to the
theme, or in many situations,

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:05.030
and he rarely writes those

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:07.920
out unless he's preparing
something for publication.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:13.170
But it's really it's a big kind
of a quandary in a way, because.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:18.200
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: What would your
instinct be, like say in this case?

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.080
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: It's
funny, my instinct would be not

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.940
to do something there actually.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:27.680
And I don't know why,
because normally I'm always

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.240
for careful connective
tissue like that.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:37.480
Like in 379, I think there are
probably missing lead-ins as well

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:40.270
to get from the --
it's a tough call.

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:42.660
But possibly when you arrive
on D major before you get

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.040
to the G minor movement,
there's a case to be made

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.340
for doing something there.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:49.250
But, again, there's not a
seventh chord, so maybe not.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:53.870
I don't know, I think some
of Haydn's rye charm is

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:57.880
that you're playing this piece
that's a variation piece,

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.180
and then when you get to one place

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.990
where you might actually
really do something, no.

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:06.090
I don't know, and that's
possibly way too sophisticated.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:12.840
Apparently when I think it was when
Czerny played the Beethoven quintet

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.740
for piano and winds,
I think maybe he --

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:22.430
the story goes that he improvised
a lead-in of some kind or some kind

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:26.630
of unsanctioned improvisatory
material happened.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:29.620
And Beethoven was furious with him.

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:34.710
Because, he said, I mean, look,
you weren't playing what I wrote,

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.720
that's just -- you know,
why did you do that?

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.800
And I think sometimes
there's this sense

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:43.750
that when Beethoven writes music
that he wants to sound improvised,

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:46.100
he wants to control
exactly how it sounds.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.720
And this is why he
starts doing things

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:51.390
like in the second piano connata
where he writes out the cadenza

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:53.960
or in the emperor connata,
because he doesn't want to leave it

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.210
to chance because he's
such a control freak.

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:59.710
I'm sure Haydn wasn't
quite as maniacal as that.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:03.650
But it's hard to know,
we don't have much to go

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:07.000
on about Haydn's specific
thoughts about the subject.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:18.760
Right, and I mean,
these tropes, as well,

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.700
you see these variation movements.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.000
They have everything.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.300
They have triplets.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.600
They have a minor variation.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.390
They have broken notes
in the octaves.

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:29.590
They have octaves with
seconds as well.

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:33.840
All these kind of stock virtuoso
devices that are really --

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.560
I mean, I hadn't though
of it until now,

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:41.690
but the fact that this is really so
early, really shows you where a lot

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:44.540
of these default settings
come from for someone

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.720
like Mozart 20 years later.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:53.080
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, I mean, to
make a large contrast with this,

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.380
maybe we should look
at the [inaudible]

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.710
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Yes, absolutely.

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.400
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: From
about 30 years later.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.020
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: That's
extraordinary to even think of,

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.290
that it could be 30 years later.

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:07.740
I mean, Schubert has one year
of life left, Mozart has five.

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:14.100
Yeah. So Haydn -- it's
so tantalizing,

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.830
all these concurrent events.

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:21.430
Because Solomon invites
Haydn to come to London.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:25.330
It's kind of a big
celebrity star composer.

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:29.400
I mean, in some sense
this is kind of one

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:33.980
of the first times this happens,
that a composer is invited to come

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:36.540
to a foreign city as
a celebrity composer.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:39.390
I mean, Haydn is not coming
to London to play private --

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:41.330
I mean, to play concerts
as a pianist,

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:43.560
because he's a well-known virtuoso.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:47.040
He's coming because
he's a celebrity.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.910
And they want him to write music
specifically for the London visit,

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:54.050
which is played in
London for the first time.

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:56.800
I mean, someone like Mozart
travels around to cities,

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.840
but he's writing music
for those cities in a hope

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.620
that they might give
him some position.

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:02.380
And Haydn is not doing
that in London.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:06.020
He's just there to kind of sit
tight, get paid a lot of money,

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:10.240
and write music and enjoy
a kind of paid vacation.

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:16.870
And what's so interesting is that
it seems like Solomon was desperate

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:18.600
to get Mozart to come
to London as well.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:23.530 position:56%
And Mozart was an avowed Anglophile.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:27.960
He loved English things and
was very interested in English.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:36.770
So, I don't know, it's kind of
wistful to think might've come

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:41.810
of a Mozart London visit, you
know, at that stage of his life.

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:46.030
Because, of course, he
was there in the 1760s.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.330
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Forgive
my ignorance on this.

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:51.400
But would he -- so Mozart would
not have had as great exposure

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.780
to the other types of
keyboard instruments as Haydn?

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.570
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Well,
this is a very good question.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:59.850
I mean, it's very clear

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:03.830
that Mozart's training is very
much organ and harpsichord based.

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:06.390
I don't know how much clavichord
Mozart would've been playing.

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:09.940
And I'm not sure that Mozart
ever had a very clear sense

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:13.060
of the clavichord as being a
kind of expressive tool for him

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:19.610
in the same way that we know it was
for [inaudible], also for Haydn.

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:24.910 position:56%
I think what happens with Mozart,
my theory, is that Mozart goes along

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:32.640 position:56%
as a super well-trained keyboard pro
from the harpsichord and the organ.

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:39.190
And then in around
let's say 1775/6/7,

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:43.180
he starts to change
his thinking in a way.

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:48.030
And that coincides with
the fact that he gets

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:50.590
to know these South German
fortepianos built by Stein.

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:52.130
And I think they kind of --

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:55.060
things lock in in a
certain way where he kind

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:59.030
of has a very strong idea of what
the sound that he wants to create

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:00.960
from his music because
of this new piano

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.170
and the possibilities
that it affords him.

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:06.680
He played square pianos when
he was in London in the 1760s,

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.770
when he was touring around and
had met Johann Sebastian Bach.

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:14.030
But I think it's that moment in the
middle of the 70s when he realizes

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:16.900
that he doesn't want to be
a violinist anymore really,

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:20.620
because it represents the tyranny
of his father and Salzburg.

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:22.560
And he finds this gorgeous
new piano.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:26.680
And he says, okay, I could write
lots of music for this piano,

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.850
which is deeply idiomatically
designed for it.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:34.220
And then maybe I can move to
Vienna later and become a big star,

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.560
and maybe I could play public
concerts on this instrument

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.050
and become a -- and then I could
get a job as an opera composer

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:43.130
because foot in the door.

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:45.750
But Mozart doesn't play
English instruments.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:49.370
And that's what's so fascinating
about this visit to London,

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:55.450 position:56%
is that Haydn meets these newfangled
English/French style pianos.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:58.910 position:56%
Which are so, as we said earlier, so
different from Viennese instruments.

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:01.750
And then he has to come up
with a way to write for them

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:05.180
that makes sense for
the English public.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:13.110
So you see -- and, again, this is
all -- you see these richly-scored,

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:17.460
richly-scored left hand chords,
full notes, really densely --

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.250
I mean, look at the second chord,

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:23.240
this E flat seven chord
leading to E flat major.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.680
I mean, that is really
thick business down there.

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:32.680
It's really the chocolate,
deep, full fat, chordal writing.

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.800
Which is curious, because, in fact,
these English pianos are known

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.270
for a much kind of denser,
richer sound anyway.

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:45.540
So you might think, well, wouldn't
Haydn write less dense chords?

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.270
Yeah, but he's sort of.

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:48.570
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Embracing it.

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:49.870
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Totally.

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:51.300
He's like, okay, we'll
really do this.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:59.690
But you can tell that his
sense of textural awareness,

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:04.750 position:56%
vis-a-vis what the instrument has to
offer, is just instantly in place.

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:09.820
You've got thick chords around the
tenor region, nothing too high.

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:14.320
But then immediately, he transfers
some of these motives and themes

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.540
to an octave higher, and crucially
with the left hand playing

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:22.630
in this very light kind
of hop-like guitar area.

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:29.240 position:56%
And then even higher than that after
that in thirds sort of non-music

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.720
in a sense, like just
a little motive,

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.970 position:56%
repeat it again and repeat it again.

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:38.240
And then thirds kind of cascading
down, which return to some kind

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.420
of thematic material again.

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:45.740
But the whole thing is very
choreographed, very visual,

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.670
very theatrical in a sense.

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:50.260
And you can just sort of see it.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:55.320
It's like -- I mean , even when you
step back, it really looks like --

00:44:55.320 --> 00:45:00.270
it looks a story is
being told in a sense.

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:03.320
And also, notice how -- I mean,
compared to the capriccio,

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:07.310
how super fussy Haydn
is in this piece.

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:09.970
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Start
with the dynamics.

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:14.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: And slurs
that are sometimes in curious places

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.520
that go curiously long as well.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:23.430
Accents in metrically
weak parts of the bar,

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:26.670
very specific two note
slurs that are then followed

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:28.820
by wedges and short notes.

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:39.690
It's clearly very cultivated, very
thought about, really artfully put

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:43.400
down on the page, not just
the material as they were.

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.700
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah.

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.550
And I guess I didn't think
to look at another edition

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:49.100
of this before coming over.

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:52.800
But just speaking of what
you're saying, but the clarity

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.710
of the slurs that he's writing.

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:58.100
We have it there but then
they're suddenly absent.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:02.760
Would the assumption be that he
meant that to be a simile type of?

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.060
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.460
This is such an amazingly
good question with Haydn.

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.270
I mean, you see like
in the Capriccio,

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:10.600
the lack of articulation
cannot stand

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.860
for the idea there is no
articulation going on.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.240
The question is just what
is the basic character

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.540
that he's trying to convey?

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.310
And what is the articulation
that you use to bring

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:20.860
that across in the best way?

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:24.100
Haydn, I think Haydn is really one
of these people who tries to set

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.840
up a basic paradigm notationally
or within articulation

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:31.720
and then he tries to say, okay, now
go out into the world and figure

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.110
out the rest for yourself.

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:35.110
Mozart very rarely does that.

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:37.840
But that's a wonderful
example of that.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:43.540 position:56%
We can get a bit caught up in our
kind of vortex mentality when we see

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:46.110
that slurs are not there, then
we stop playing connected.

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:48.640
And I think that might be
a little bit too literal

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.740
of an interpretation
of a lot of his stuff.

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:52.650
On the other hand, it's
all shades of gray.

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:56.030
One has to be very careful
about coming up with any rule

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:59.700
that suits any -- that suits
way too many situations.

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:03.350
I think it's all really case by
case in a situation like this.

00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:08.360 position:56%
Although these last -- these English
sonatas are fiercely detailed

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.910
by Haydn's standards, both
articulation in the matters

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:15.520
of articulation, and also dynamics.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.220
There's this theory that's positive

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:22.780
that Haydn writes these
English sonatas.

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:26.510
And then the idea is, well, what
happens when you get back to Vienna

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:28.010
and you want to play
this gorgeous new piece

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:29.310
that Haydn wrote in London?

00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:32.540
But we haven't had the
chance to play it here yet.

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:34.500
And what do you do?

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:38.800
Like how do play a sonata like
this on a Viennese instrument

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.550
from the same time, versus those
people who got to play this

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:45.190
in London on a broad wood
or something like that.

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:50.310
It's a wonderful sense of fun about
people discovering these pieces

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:52.580
and thinking, gosh, what
is Hadyn thinking here?

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.880
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Right.

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.850
They would have had more variety
kind of at their fingertips,

00:47:56.850 --> 00:47:58.840
depending on where they are
regionally, than we do today.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.580
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
That's right, absolutely.

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:03.370
That's very well put.

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:09.420
I think too, when you
look at these --

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:12.270
when you look at something like the
E flat sonata, the C major as well,

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:18.440
you can just really see how
much of a theater of gestures,

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:24.000 position:56%
kind of absurd comedic stuff,
wildly differing textures and moods,

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.790
just built into the
rhetorical style of this music.

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:29.810
And which becomes -- which is
so beguiling and attractive

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:31.160
for someone like Beethoven.

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:34.160
I mean, we don't really
have any kind

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.170
of gorgeous melodies
to latch onto here.

00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:40.360 position:56%
It's just sort of these kind of
almost second Viennese school style,

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:44.020
like little snippets of things and
then stop and now new this thing.

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:47.550
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Like even here,
like in this moment in here

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:51.790
that strikes you as a
very Beethovenian type.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:56.340
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Totally, totally.

00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:58.050
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Approach.

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:04.650
Just to kind of isolate
dramatically.

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:06.580
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
That being said, it's, again,

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:13.580 position:56%
super Beethovenian in the sense that
the basic setting that's established

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:17.700
in a movement like this, which
is kind of grand marshal E flat,

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:20.420
dotted rhythms, but then
these weird textural contrasts

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:25.390
in the upper treble, combined
with sort of flippant short notes

00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:29.410
and then intimations of
melody in the tenor regions

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:31.010
but never really fulfilled.

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:35.130
Is then completely contradicted in
the second movement in this image.

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:39.640
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Which
in itself is a strange.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.940
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Again, like what does someone

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:44.580
in 1793 make of that, that choice?

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:47.310
I mean, this is something
that Mozart would never

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:50.730
in a million years even
consider as a key choice.

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:55.850
But then you've got this kind

00:49:55.850 --> 00:50:01.690
of richly lyrical heartfelt
melody in image.

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:06.110
I mean, it's a melody but then
it's also fragmented and it breaks

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:11.880
down into these shorter notes that
you see It's kind of a little bit

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:15.210
like Beethoven in the sense that
it's just kind of a state of being.

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:17.590
It's this kind of psychological
position that you're

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:19.260
in in a movement like this.

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:23.490
And not so much this beautiful
melody that has, you know,

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:24.790
antecedent and consequent

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:26.440
and exactly you know
what you're going to get.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:32.740 position:56%
I mean, the fret structure is clear,
but it's always very so theatrical,

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:37.410
so like not grounded
in reality somehow.

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:43.920
And also, Hadyn's incredible
fussiness with writing

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:50.550
out these very strange,
hugely idiosyncratic,

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:56.550
ornamental material styles that
he introduces in this movement,

00:50:56.550 --> 00:51:01.010
also the back-and-forth between
E major and the minor modes

00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:04.890
that we also were talking about
in the F minor variations.

00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:08.370
Just you start in E major and
then you just go to E minor.

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:11.020
You don't really --
you just are there.

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:17.080
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: And this might be
a little bit too technical point

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:21.920
for this conversation, but
you notice things like his use

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.980
of octaves as a color,
it almost feels --

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:27.610
as opposed to any sort of
reinforcement type of thing.

00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:29.880
When he lands on a
semimelodic octave

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.850
and then quickly pivots
away from that.

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:35.770
And it's just so beautiful
to see that kind of thinking.

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:37.070
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
That's right.

00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:39.190
And you have to understand
that hearing --

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:42.210
we see these, this kind
of a chord and we know it,

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:44.230
because we know what
happens in the 19th century.

00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:49.800
But a chord like this really
sends shockwaves through the earth

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:53.820
because it's a new sound.

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.020
Like certain sonatas that
Beethoven comes up with.

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:59.430
They're invented in that
moment and then they open doors

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:02.200
for future experimentation.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:07.050
It actually ended up being
a really, I don't know,

00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:10.500 position:56%
serendipitous, the choice of pieces.

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.150
I don't know why necessarily,

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:18.500
but this idea of 379 being
this three movement piece,

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.440
but actually functioning
as a two movement piece

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:24.820
in the sense it's almost
identical to 109.

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:27.360
That you've got this
intersection of fantasy

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.950
and sonata happening at this point.

00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:32.630
I mean, in the 1820s when
Beethoven is writing this,

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:35.780
he doesn't want the
sonata to feel like --

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.080
he doesn't want it to feel

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:40.500
like a formal four-movement
affair like his earlier pieces.

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.770 position:56%
Where you've got a first movement in
sonata form, second movement adagio,

00:52:43.770 --> 00:52:46.370
third movement scherzo and
trio or minuet and trio

00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:49.450
and then last movement
some kind of virtuoso romp.

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:55.530
It's supposed to be this sort of
slithering creature that just goes

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:57.850
in and out of these
various states of being.

00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:01.570
And then you write this first
movement, which is a sort of --

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:05.330
I mean, 109 is extraordinary
because it feels like it could be

00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:08.640
like a Chopin prelude for a
while or a bagatelle maybe,

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.950 position:56%
and then it breaks down into fantasy
with all these diminished chords.

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:14.150
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: It
also feels like to me,

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:15.710
it feels like it starts
in the middle.

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:17.180
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Totally, yes.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:20.800
As if you're in a recording session
and you're kind of in mid-take.

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:28.620
It's so fascinating in the sense
that 110 and 111 have very --

00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.640
their different ways,
but they really --

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.940
they're pieces that really begin.

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.030
You really know, okay.

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:36.760
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Right, right.

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:39.240
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
And also --

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.940
and this is just so
amazing because --

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:45.570
it's so weird how in terms

00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:47.740
of spacing how counterintuitive
this is.

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:51.080
I mean, the music that's
happening here

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:54.450
at the beginning [sounds]
is actually really small,

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:58.060
like it could take
up half that room.

00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:01.650
And yet it really it
takes up a lot of space.

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:06.460
It's like every note is kind of
being found and written down.

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:14.470
And then as things get louder,
like the strokes get more intense,

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:17.230
and there's a bit more
ink and little messes here

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:21.490
and there, and then it sort of.

00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:23.660
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah, I have
a colleague here, Ray White,

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:28.130
who always says that -- especially
with Beethoven and with others --

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:30.190
you get a sense of that
personality from the way

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:32.290
that they annotate things.

00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:35.290
And you also get a sense
of where they are --

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:39.740
I mean, it's only one supposes
that one has the sense,

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:41.320
it may not have been that way.

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:44.690 position:56%
But you have the sense of where they
are in their compositional moment,

00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:50.700
that they maybe have
some degree of excitement

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:59.250
about an idea or some [inaudible].

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:02.030
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Right.

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:03.490
And so it really looks
like what it sounds like.

00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:05.310
It's kind of searching

00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:10.880
and improvisatory bagatelle
meets fantasy meets kind

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.620
of moving prelude.

00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:17.110
It's everything that a first note
of sonata should not be doing,

00:55:17.110 --> 00:55:20.490
even in the 1820s in a sense.

00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:27.040
But then the thing is, with the
ensuing E minor material, you know,

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:29.140
are these supposed to
be separate things?

00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:32.520 position:56%
They're actually literally linked in
the way that the pedal is held down.

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:36.650
But this sense of, you know,
is this three movements,

00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:41.160
or is it kind of two little
mini movements and then linked

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:42.930
to those set of variations
at the end?

00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:47.640 position:56%
But as we were saying with 379, this
wonderful sense that you have kind

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.920
of a first movement
that's finding itself

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:54.000
in a little bit lost improvisation,
and then you've got something kind

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.370
of slightly more nailed
down in the minor mode,

00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:57.670
in this case, in E minor.

00:55:57.670 --> 00:56:02.730
Like 379, something in triple
time structured with a theme

00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:09.300
and a real sense of more kind of
classical structure and rigger.

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:15.310
And then you sort of finish that
and then you've got this kind

00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:20.410
of really serene heavenly set
of variations in E major, again,

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:24.850
in triple time that
defy expectations

00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:26.580
of what a keyboard sonata
should be doing at this time.

00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:29.890
I mean, Mozart -- Beethoven had
already written variation movements

00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:32.060
in sonatas before, as had Mozart.

00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:34.930
But it's a really -- it's
still a really strong gesture

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:38.530
of questioning what the
form is capable of doing.

00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:43.170
It's just it's so touching.

00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:48.260
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I'll just point
out, I think goes quite along

00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:53.020
with your notion of this looking at
like a fantasy and fantastic thing.

00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:54.460
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Yes.

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:58.530
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: It's one thing
to have extensions that go

00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:00.960
into the margins where
there's a scale that's going

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.260
to be [inaudible].

00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:05.490
That doesn't strike me
as compositionally as,

00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:07.890
you know, unusual to see.

00:57:07.890 --> 00:57:09.190
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Yes.

00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:10.490
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: But there
are other places where --

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:12.970
like here, where it looks like
there's an insertion of a measure.

00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:14.270
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Right.

00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:16.090
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: From
what was already composed.

00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:19.940
That actually creates
quite a different --

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.440
I can't say for sure that
it was meant to not have

00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:25.660
that original piece, but if it
was, that's quite a difference

00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.850
on the take of the whole apparatus.

00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:29.150
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
That's very true.

00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:33.190 position:56%
Like a completely new sort of new
thinking about something in a sense.

00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:35.650
And not, oh, I just have to
sort of fit this in somehow.

00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:37.350
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: And
it's not that it's --

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:41.020
it's a simple edition
that's in character

00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:42.990
with the rest of what's going on.

00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:44.830
Which means it could
be also [inaudible],

00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:46.850
copying slip, that happens.

00:57:46.850 --> 00:57:51.630
Let's take a look at
one or two more pages.

00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:53.930
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Yes.

00:57:58.350 --> 00:58:00.220
Yeah, these, it's so amazing.

00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:03.280
These places where the piece really
breaks into these fantasy moments

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:06.170
where you have these cascading
[inaudible] down and up.

00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:08.930
They just look like that.

00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:15.660
They're appropriately
hectic or fraud.

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:17.720
They just really look like trouble.

00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.020
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah.

00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:22.270
And then you have this
literal writing

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:33.680
out of forte that's almost angry.

00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:34.980
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Yes.

00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:36.280
[inaudible]

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:43.080
And yeah, it's just
pure emotion somehow.

00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:53.200
Yeah, it's just so extraordinary
how much space these bars take up.

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.860
I mean, it's like every
one is a real --

00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:58.410
like is sort of etched like down.

00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:01.430
And there's no fluidity here,

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:04.450
even though the music actually
is very fast and sounds

00:59:04.450 --> 00:59:05.870
like it's really going
along, you know,

00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:10.110
like a duck just sort
of gliding along a pond.

00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:16.560
But there's a sense of every bar
being kind of fought for and won.

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:21.240
And here's the andante.

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:27.250
And, again, you know,
somehow this sense --

00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:29.000
I think Hadyn and Beethoven
are really lined

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.130
up about how they think
about keys so strongly.

00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:35.580
Like this could be -- you
know, this is absolutely cut

00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:39.350
from the same cloth as the
flat sonata from the 1790s.

00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:43.180
You know, it's this sense of
hymnal devotional E major,

00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:50.340
a piece of great reverence
and internal kind of struggles

00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:53.390
with divinity or spirituality.

00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:55.300
These are really strong
ideas for Beethoven.

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:58.690
And I think maybe not -- he didn't
literally get them from Hadyn

00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:04.290
from it on a philosophical level,
but they're the same struggles,

01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:09.340
and E major is a very strong
choice of key for him I think.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.370
And also you see this
sense of the crescendos,

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:24.050
the hairpins really having a kind
of -- they're just, you know,

01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:26.170
you can feel the emotion
in them actually.

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:30.030
It's sort of like -- the expression

01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:32.690
of these places is actually
he's trying desperately

01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:36.580
to actually just build it
in here and show it and as

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:41.050
if he's actually doing it with
you, with it, as he's writing it.

01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:42.350
Damn it.

01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:45.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: It's
performative aspects to the writing.

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:51.930
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Totally, totally.

01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:57.900
Yeah, and again, like what
we've been talking about,

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:03.260 position:56%
this Beethoven suddenly exposed
these worlds of texture, like trills

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:08.370
and repeated notes and arpeggios
and all manner of almost

01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:14.190
like Impressionist,
swimmingly liquid types

01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:19.370
of new piano sounds in
a movement like this.

01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:24.520
He sort of just abandons all
fear about what is possible

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.010
in these last three sonatas.

01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:31.380
Any type of new figuration that's
possible, especially in 111,

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:34.070
but also crucially here in 109.

01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:37.890
And, again, like the
trajectory of that through the

01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:39.890
through three pieces is really --

01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:42.730
the four pieces, is
really fascinating.

01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:47.530
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, I'd
like to thank you so much.

01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:48.830
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Thank you, David.

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:50.140
What a pleasure.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:54.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: To be able to speak
here with Kristian Bezuidenhout.

01:01:54.730 --> 01:01:59.460
And it's been a great pleasure to
hear him on fortepiano last night

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.870
and also to speak with him
about these manuscripts.

01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:03.170
So thanks again.

01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:04.770
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Thank you, David.

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:08.630
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
at the Library of Congress.
