- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.
Bipedal, naked, large-brained. Long the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.670
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.660
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.150
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.540
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.360

forget to write down your questions and

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.690
pass them down to the points where they
can be collected so that we can progress

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.440
pretty quickly at this point to the
question-answer period. I've been asked to

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.720
try to wrap this up, which I suppose means
provide a summary and an appraisal of

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.780
what's been said. This is certainly not an
easy task given all of the information and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.550
interpretations. We've had a lot of very
interesting presentations during the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.430
afternoon. I certainly can't hope to do
justice to all of this material. Let me

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.450
just run down the list quickly for you.
Bernard Wood and Bill Kimbel spoke to the

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.090
difficulties associated with recognizing
and studying the genus homo, and I agree

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.570
of course, we all realize that the record
is imperfect. Bill Kimbel also filled us

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:14.030
in the important new discoveries from Ledi
Geraru in Ethiopia. Earliest homo now, a

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.000
small mandible at 2.8 million years.
That's very fine material to have.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.320
Dan Lieberman spoke about hunting and
gathering as facilitated by double B&amp;B,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.430
brawn and brains and of course the
interactions between those two. I did the

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.310
best I could to tell you a little bit
about the fascinating discoveries from

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:48.650
Dmanisi, first humans out of Africa into
Asia. Pascal Gagneux gave us a little

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.270
shift of gears which was very fine indeed.
He spoke about the sialic acids and the

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:04.700
possibility that an immune mechanism could
have driven speciation in homo between two

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.950
and three million years ago. Steve
Churchill spoke to endemism, the

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:17.130
importance of endemism in southern Africa.
And he spoke again about olive baboons as

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:25.750
a possible model for Homo erectus. Carol
Ward, again, spoke to deficiencies in the

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.910
fossil record. There aren't very many
postcranial remains for earlier homo.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:41.050
That's the case, we do the best we
can...or she does the best she can. Leslie

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:49.520
Aiello gave us her latest synthetic
thinking on life history patterns and

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.670
Hominins, spoke to the importance,
probably, of cooperative behavior.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:04.460
Certainly I agree. Herman Pontzer spoke
again about energy as Dan Lieberman had

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.620
done earlier. A little bit of point and
counter-point. Herman spoke about the

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:18.350
Hadza project. The Hadza turned out not to
be so energy-expensive after all. Herman

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:26.120
also spoke to the benefits of fat, which
is a fine thing.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:33.170
Let me end, I don't want to wrap up at any
great length, but let me end on an

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:40.180
optimistic note. Yes, the fossil record is
imperfect and we've all known that for a

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:47.290
long time, but it is getting better. We
do, in fact, have a huge amount of

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:54.010
information. There are literally hundreds
of Hominin fossils in the record and we

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.080
now have some very sophisticated
techniques that we can use to study them.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:07.000
This is progress. Our understanding of
human or Hominin evolution as it is now in

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.780
2016 is very different from what was
thought about the Hominins 50 years ago.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:21.860
We are making progress. Leslie Aiello said
that she was pleased she wasn't born a

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.160
Neanderthal, I suppose we all are, but at
the same time we now know that we all

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:35.610
share genes with the Neanderthals. Two or
3% at least. We didn't know that 10 years

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:45.180
ago. So you see? Things are not so bad
after all.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.310
- [Steven] Okay, well we've now reached
the question and answer period, and I'm

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:57.570
madly sorting through questions down here.
I've got some questions directed at the

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:06.140
speakers in the first half of the
symposium and I'll call you each down and

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:14.000
grill you with the questions one-by-one.
So why don't we begin with Pascal? If you

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.110
would come up. I saw a few good ones in
here for you. Okay. First question reads,

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.940
"Do you have any idea what the pathogen
could be that was driving the sialic acid

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.720
shift, the sexual selection... ?" It's a
two-parter, you want them one at a time or

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.170
you want me to hit you with both of them?
Okay, you can take them both? All right.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:41.070
Number two, “Is it possible to retrieve
glycol molecules from fossils that are

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.090
greater than two to three million years
old?”

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:49.510
- [Pascal] Great question. Which pathogen
might have driven the change in sialic

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:54.010
acid? I mentioned one possibility:
malaria. Another very intriguing

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:59.210
possibility is actually pathogens from the
many species of prey animals that were

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.160
being slaughtered. If you slaughter an
animal bare-handed with stone tools,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.810
you're likely to have a lot of scratches
and cut yourself. So I don't have a good

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:13.790
candidate, but there is no shortage of
pathogens known to bind sialic acid.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:19.210
Tellingly, the ones that bind pig sialic
acids don't bind human sialic acids.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:23.810
E.coli, there's a famous E.coli that makes
pigs very sick, it cannot infect us

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.960
because it's not looking for the sialic
acid we have. So I think the slaughtering

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.250
and hunting connection, as a top predator,
your pathogen regime really changes,

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.020
especially when you start transporting
meat. The second question was can you

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:41.190
retrieve a sialic or bits thereof in
fossils. The good news is yes, actually

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:45.280
Ajit and his team looked at the
Neanderthal type specimen powder left over

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:52.980
after DNA extraction, and found that just
like humans, it also had only the AC, the

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:58.870
new 5AC sialic acids. Ann Bergfeld, who
went back to Germany, a former post-doc in

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:03.730
the Varki lab, has been able to find
traces of sialic acid in bones from east

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:08.730
Africa provided by Meave Leakey that are
three million years old. So we hope that

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.430
we might actually get at fossil sialic
acid, which are the size of...maller than

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:18.000
one base of DNA. You don't need the long
chain.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.760
- You're not off the hook yet. One more
question for you. “Roughly 15% of

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.680
infertile couples have an unknown cause.
First, could female testing of male sperm

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.380
account for part of this? And two, could
tests be developed to diagnose?”

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:37.450
- So that's an interesting idea looking
forward, or to the present. We have

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:42.600
actually just found evidence for the
presence of that antigenic sialic acid on

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.830
sperm of only fertility patients, not
normal fertile men. And we find the

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:55.090
presence of antibodies against it in the
fluid washed from the endometrium of women

00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:00.020
undergoing fertility treatment. So there
is the distinct possibility of a very

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:05.060
delayed liability of abolishing part of
what used to be self that is now seen as

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.300
non-self.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:15.340
- I have no further questions for the
defendant. So Bernard Wood, we'll call you

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:22.010
up. “Does using the concept of adaptive
grade as a means of recognizing genera

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:26.970
increase the taxonomic problems caused by
homoplasies? For example, the genus

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.290
paranthropus may be polyphyletic.”

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.950
- [Bernard] Yes and I agree.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:54.630
- That's the only question I had for you,
so... Dr. Lieberman, come on down. So one

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:59.390
person asked, "How much does culture
affect anatomy? For example, texting with

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.950
thumbs. Does that increase that
representation in the brain?"

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:11.510
- [Daniel] Aye aye aye. It's an
interesting question, actually, because

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.990
there's two kinds of evolution that's
going on. There's evolution by natural

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.060
selection, sort of biological evolution
that we think about all the time. But

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:23.470
cultural evolution is also a very
important kind of evolution. And over the

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:28.550
last, I would say, 20 or 30 years there's
been an increasing appreciation about the

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.880
interactions between cultural evolution
and biological evolution. So a good

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:37.830
example might be that as humans starting
moving into temperate zones, right, we

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:44.400
started having to deal with colder nights
and we evolved the ability to make fire

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:51.680
and clothing. But that in turn permitted
selection to act on other aspects of our

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.630
phenotype. For example, maybe skin color
that could then respond to those

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:02.600
environmental challenges. So there's a
strong, important interaction between

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.450
culture and biological evolution. There
are no simple rules about them, but

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:12.130
they're important. Now whether or not
texting is gonna cause your thumbs to

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.870
change, that would only be the case if A
there was an inheritable variation in how

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:23.510
you texted that not only maybe improved
your performance, in terms of texting, but

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:30.690
also affected your reproductive success.
And my guess is...for example, yesterday I

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.270
was going to class, actually, I was
rushing to get to class and there was some

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.110
undergraduate who was texting while
walking on the stairs. And I suspect he

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:41.790
might've been lowering his chances of
surviving and reproducing. So you might

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.320
argue that if there's a genetic proclivity
to want to text in the first place, it

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.290
might lower your reproductive success. But
then again, there's Tinder and all those

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:53.000
other things, so I don't know.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.860
- Hold on, more questions for you, Dan.
“Do you consider food processing to be

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:07.360
cooking?” So like I take it that chopping
and grinding, you were talking about. And,

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.060
“When did cooking with fire begin?”

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:18.070
- Good question. Okay, so I would say that
cooking is a form of food processing. So

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:22.140
there's mechanical food processing and
thermal food processing and chemical food

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:28.440
processing. So it is one of several
important forms of food processing. The

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.740
evidences to when cooking became
important...well let's just say it's a hot

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:40.200
topic. It's a hugely debated... The oldest
evidence that I know of that archeologists

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.950
accept for fire, that is we accept as
being sort of human-made, that couldn't be

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:51.480
brush fire is about one million years old,
from Wonderwerk Cave in southern Africa.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:58.070
There are some older possible sites and
they're debated. But it's not really until

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.230
about 400,000 years ago, actually with
sort of archaic homo, homo

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.380
heidelbergensis, whatever you want to call
it, that we being to see regular evidence

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:09.250
of cooking. So the question really is, is
absence of evidence, evidence of absence?

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:15.050
And there's sort of a big debate about
that. I tend to think that...there's been

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:19.410
a lot of effort to find early cooking in
the archeological record, and I suspect

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:24.800
that the absence of evidence really is
evidence for absence, but that's highly

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.370
debated. But that said, there's no
question that when cooking became

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:33.480
important, it had a major, again, another
evidence of cultural-biological

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.540
interaction, it had really major effects
on our biology and transformed our biology

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.130
in all kinds of ways. And I highly
recommend that you read Richard Wrangham's

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.270
book “Catching Fire” if you want a nice
account of that. So cooking is important.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:58.130
When it evolved? If you ask 10 people,
you'll get, I don't know, 10 answers.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:02.940
- “If homo originated about 3.3 million
years ago, why do you think that fossil

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.830
evidence of homo would be nonexistent
compared to Australopithecus from the same

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:07.908
time?”

00:15:07.908 --> 00:15:13.550
- [William] I don't necessarily think
that's true. And I also think they'll be

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:22.370
very hard to recognize at that time. One
of the things we understand since Darwin

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:26.290
is that species very close to branching
points should be expected to look a lot

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:30.190
more like each other than they look like
their respective descendants. So the

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:35.010
further you go back in time we go to a
root, the more difficult it is going to be

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:44.030
to distinguish the species on diverging
branches. But I am happy to be prepared to

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:50.380
accept Australopithecus as a stone tool
maker if that's what the evidence is going

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:56.180
to suggest. And let's not forget that
brain size increase did not start with

00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.760
homo. The mean brain size for
Australopithecus is fully 30% bigger than

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:07.330
a chimpanzee's, and that is not a small
amount. So something is going on that's

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:12.070
driving brain size earlier than what we
think in the genus homo. Whether that is

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:17.420
tied to culture, I haven't a clue, and
that is obviously an area for

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.380
investigation.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.700
- “Some argue for the placement of homo
rudolfensis and Homo habilis in the genus

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:41.110
Australopithecus.” I'm looking at you,
Bernard. What would you say to them?

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:55.690
- Well I'll tell you. Since you asked. You
see this title up here? It says Origins of

00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:10.920
the Genus Homo. A genus is a taxonomic
category. Homo is a taxon. Let's say that

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:17.460
we follow the prescription that
Australopithecus, I'm sorry that homo

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:25.660
habilis and homo rudolfensis are primitive
enough in their adaptive suite that

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.830
they're much closer to some
Australopithecus ancestor than they are to

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:34.040
homo sapiens. And we take them out of the
genus homo for that reason. We could put

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:39.000
them in Australopithecus, we could come up
with another genus, it doesn't matter. The

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.860
problem is is that doing that exercise
does not actually move them off the tree

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:52.840
branch that leads to us. That is a
separate question relating to monophyly.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.860
And we can move the taxonomic boundary
between the genus homo and the genus

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:05.340
Australopithecus until the cows come home,
but until and unless we have solid

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.660
evidence that they do not belong at the
root of the lineage, we actually haven't

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:15.050
addressed the interesting question, which
is the origin of a lineage, not of a

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.592
taxon.

00:18:24.616 --> 00:18:31.090
- Dr. Rightmire. “If all the specimens
from the Dmanisi site are classified as

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:35.020
the same species, how can we explain the
great variation in them? What are the

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:39.980
implications that these specimens are
classified as one? Should we reconsider

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.000
the existing taxonomy within the genus
homo?”

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.040
- Well indeed, one of the big questions at
Dmanisi has been since we had Skull 5 come

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:57.430
out, one of the last items in 2005, how
indeed there could be such a lot of

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:03.850
variation within the assemblage, as we
refer to it, from Dmanisi. We did not

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:09.980
start with the assumption that just one
species is represented. We tried to reach

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:18.650
that conclusion by working through a lot
of material. We did resampling analysis

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:24.260
which I don't really want to talk about at
this point. There are a number of them and

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:29.220
they all point to the same conclusion. The
variability or variation within the

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:35.760
Dmanisi sample as nearly as we can assess
it from the body part in question: teeth,

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:43.440
mandibles, cranial form and so on, that
variation is about comparable at Dmanisi

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:49.260
to what you'd find in some of the most
dimorphic of the large apes. Gorillas, for

00:19:49.260 --> 00:20:00.240
example. So I would say on that basis we
can't rule out Dmanisi as a single

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:08.210
population. A population belonging to a
single taxon. As far as the systematics of

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:15.190
homo are concerned, of course there are a
lot of questions. Everything should be

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.070
reassessed from time to time.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:22.290
- One more for you. “The fossils from
Dmanisi seem, in many respects, more

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:27.770
primitive than African Homo erectus. Is it
possible that Homo erectus evolved outside

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:32.090
of Africa and moved back in later?”

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:38.560
- Good question. Yes indeed, it is
possible. We don't understand exactly how

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:44.860
all of this came down. We know that Homo
habilis is in the record in Africa and

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:54.020
Africa only. We know that Homo erectus is
in East Africa, certainly by 1.65 million

00:20:54.020 --> 00:21:00.610
years ago. The best examples of African
Homo erectus, the more complete specimens

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:06.330
are about that age or perhaps a bit later
in time. There are some bits and pieces.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:11.480
There is the backend of an occiput, for
instance, which is probably earlier,

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:16.850
although it's from a lag deposit. One
can't be certain that the date applied to

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:28.530
it is 100%. Dmanisi comes into the record
in West Asia at about 1.85, not human

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:32.890
material as I said, but stone tools
certainly indicating the presence of a

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:44.630
human population. Just what happened after
Homo habilis appeared and evolved and Homo

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:51.360
erectus flowered, both in Africa for a
time and certainly later in the Far East

00:21:51.360 --> 00:22:00.080
is uncertain. I can't claim to know at
this point whether there was an anagenetic

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:05.020
evolutionary process going on in Africa, I
think it's likely: Homo habilis to Homo

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:12.220
erectus. Homo erectus then a primitive
form of Homo erectus at any rate.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:18.890
The first Hominins out of Africa, we see
them at Dmanisi at 1.5 million years. The

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:26.040
other possibility is that it was an
earlier version of homo that left Africa

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:34.930
probably before 1.8, 1.9 million years ago
for which we have no evidence whatsoever.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:45.260
Hominins evolved further in western Asia
and homo erectus as an Asian species then

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:52.830
moved back to east Africa, for example, as
we see it in the Turkana Basin. And indeed

00:22:52.830 --> 00:23:00.170
African Homo erectus is more derived, or
more like Homo erectus than are the

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:12.740
Dmanisi Hominins. We have a couple of
questions for you. The first one is,

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.100
“Overall are humans getting larger?”

00:23:18.339 --> 00:23:24.580
- Overall are humans getting larger? That
is an interesting question. First off, as

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:30.810
I think was alluded to, I forget where,
perhaps in Dan Lieberman's talk or Herman

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:37.270
Pontzer's talk, we need to be careful to
sort of distinguish between what we might

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:43.080
call our lean body mass versus our fat
body mass because we are very, very good

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:50.610
at putting on fat and we live in a very
calorie-rich environment where, you know,

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:55.610
off the dollar menu at McDonald's you can
buy more calories than most hunters and

00:23:55.610 --> 00:24:02.370
gatherers are able to capture in a day. So
we're definitely getting larger in the

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:08.750
sense of our fat body mass is increasing,
but I think the record suggests that

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:14.780
humans kind of hit their apogee in the
middle Pleistocene. Because we have

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:20.570
individuals from places like the Sima de
los Huesos in Spain, there's an individual

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:25.410
there who looks like had a relatively lean
body mass of about 93.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:29.710
And here I'm not talking about fat-free
body mass, I'm talking about sort of like

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:34.950
hunter-gatherer natural body mass,
probably about 93 kilos. There's a middle

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:40.470
Pleistocene individual from [inaudible
00:24:36] in Spain which also is about

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:47.050
that: 91, 93 kilos. And these individuals
are not necessarily super tall, they're

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:53.160
just relatively wide and stocky, and to me
that's kind of the apex of human body

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.730
mass, or size, and we've been going down
since then.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:08.290
- You spoke to olive baboons as a possible
example for early homo. Why is that?

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:14.740
- Well again there is a suggestions on the
basis of the genetic evidence that they're

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:20.330
a hybrid species. I'm not necessarily
saying that Homo erectus evolved in a

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:29.490
hybrid zone between two species, but there
is a suggestion that what happens when

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:38.140
closely related taxa hybridize is that
sometimes structures get smaller in the

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:42.670
hybrid offspring, the F1 generation. In
other cases, structures get larger. In

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:47.940
some cases there are examples of hybrid
vigor, in other cases the hybrids do worse

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:53.320
than the pure strains of the two parent
species. So it's very hard to know what

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.650
can happen in cases of hybridization, but
it looks like in the olive baboons that

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:01.440
they were particularly successful and that
they'd been expanding their range and

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.130
they'd been swallowing up variation in
smaller populations of baboons that they

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:11.660
encountered. And I just think to me it's
interesting that it gets very, very

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.650
difficult to really nail down who the
ancestor of Homo erectus is.

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:22.240
I think in some regards, homo habilis
makes a great candidate ancestor, but

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.990
there are these other morphological groups
out there which share features with homo

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:31.940
erectus that homo habilis doesn't. And so
I just think it's worth it to sort of say,

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:36.170
"Hey, what if we're looking at an olive
baboon-type situation with Homo erectus?"

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:46.443
- Okay, thank you. Carol Ward, there are
some questions for you.

00:26:46.443 --> 00:26:49.760
- [Carol] Can I just hijack things for
moment to address the body size question

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.800
again? What's really cool actually, a
million and a half years ago in some of

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.020
the [inaudible 00:26:54] isolated
postcranials and actually on the west side

00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:01.860
of Lake Turkana too, we have a few bones
of individuals that were at least, if you

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:07.610
compare them to modern people for example,
maybe 6'3” or so, there's a hand bone,

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:11.620
there's a radius, there's distal humeri.
There were some really, really, really big

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:16.130
people...weirdly big, bigger than most
people are today, a million and a half

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:21.180
years ago. I don't know why. They seem to
be homo, I don't know why they got

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.720
smaller, why they were so big then, but
there's weird variation of body size

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.970
throughout the fossil record, but now I
can listen to the questions I'm supposed

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.720
to answer.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:37.260
- Okay. “When did childbirth mechanics
change from presumably a chimp-like

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:44.560
situation to a modern human-like situation
necessitating fetal rotation? Head

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.410
rotation?”

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:50.630
- That's a great question, so the question
is when do the mechanics of childbirth

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:55.250
change? When you look at great apes, great
apes have big pelvic inlets, so the bony

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:59.140
hole in the middle of the pelvis is really
large, the babies are fairly small, and in

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.680
terms of getting the baby through, that's
not very difficult. When you get to

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:07.470
Australopithecus, the pelvis is, in
comparison, very short and it's also very

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.230
broad so the idea is the baby has a
tighter fit, but since the pelvis is

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:15.040
broad, the baby's head fits sideways, it
fits sideways all the way and there's

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.690
non-rotational birth.
When you get to modern humans, what you

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:22.470
see is there's a change in the birth canal
from the top of the pelvic inlet to the

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:26.690
pelvic outlet. And the baby's head
actually rotates so the baby comes out

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:31.550
facing away from the mother, usually, in a
normal birth process. And that seems to

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:36.900
have happened partly sometime with the
increase in brain size. From something

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:41.790
like an Australopithecus up to something
like a modern human, that you would change

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:46.180
the pelvic shape and you would change
rotational birth. So when, in the fossil

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:52.080
record, do you see something like that?
Well you would need a pelvis to see birth

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.170
canal size. We have australopith pelvises
which seem to be very wide, they all seem

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:02.030
to follow sort of a theme. We don't really
see in many fossil pelvises until we get

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:06.810
to something fairly recent. For example,
in China, except for one, which is maybe

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:12.910
0.9 to about 1.4 million years old from
Ethiopia from Ghana, it's probably homo

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:16.220
erectus although it's unassociated with
anything, and we don't know what a boisei

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:21.520
pelvis looks like, so...caveat. But it has
a very wide birth canal. Also has a very

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:26.590
large anterior posteriorly expanded, front
to back birth canal. So the whole thing is

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:32.390
big, both from the top and the bottom, and
so that individual wouldn't have had that

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:38.150
sideways non-rotational birth we see in
Australopithecus, so maybe about that

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:43.900
time? It's a little bit hard to say. The
other way that paleoanthropologists infer

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:48.510
things about the birth process is to just
say, "If you're getting a really big brain

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:52.380
and babies are born with a big brain,
that's gonna naturally take up more space

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:56.950
in the birth canal." So as we see brain
size increase, we saw that graph over and

00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:00.570
over again where you get an exponential
rate of brain size increase, that's gonna

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:05.200
affect the birth process as well.
So you have probably multiple factors

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.990
changing. There've been energetic
arguments that affect timing and size of

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:13.160
babies during birth, all of those things
seem to happen sometime during the genus

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.380
homo, probably not at the origin of it
nearly as much as sometime during that

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.860
process, after the origin of the genus
homo leading up to the time we have larger

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.007
brains.

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:34.740
- One question is, “If sexual isolation
takes about five million years, how could

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.850
growth rates of species vary so quickly?”

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:48.300
- So yeah, again I don't really understand
what the question is asking. My comment

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.980
that it takes about five million years on
average for a large bodied mammalian

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:55.700
species to really become reproductively
isolated, that was based on work that

00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:03.430
Trent Holiday did where he looked at pairs
of closely-related mammals where we had

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:09.030
either generally good genetic divergent
states, and he looked whether they were

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:14.380
truly infertile, if they followed
Haldane's rule where one sex was

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:18.990
infertile, or if they were fully
inter-fertile. And what he found is there

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:23.810
was a good amount of variations because
I'm sure that there are molecular things

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:32.260
that happen like the sialic acid, did I
get that right? No I didn't, anyway. But

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:37.350
on average it takes about five million
years. So how could growth rates of

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:47.030
species vary so quickly? That one, I would
basically say that it is probably a trait

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:50.990
which is controlled by many, many genes.
And when you have traits that have many

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:55.930
genes, you've got a lot of underlying
variation. Things like stature, going back

00:31:55.930 --> 00:32:01.500
to body weight again, and body size are
also probably controlled by very many

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:08.600
genes, and so those traits actually are
very evolutionarily malleable and I would

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.330
suspect that's going on with growth rates,
although you would probably know better

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:13.663
than I do.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:21.690
- [Leslie] Just following on from that,
the question about are we getting bigger

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:30.480
or smaller. It's all of the above. Because
your growth process depends on a number of

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:38.890
factors as I was talking about in my talk.
So depending on the energy coming into the

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:46.760
system, you're going to grow more rapidly
or not. And growing up in California here

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:52.330
in the 1950s, we used to call it the
orange juice effect, and I'm three inches

00:32:52.330 --> 00:33:01.880
taller than any other woman in my family.
And that's a very good sign of how you can

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:06.840
modify the size of populations. And there
is very good evidence that during the

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:12.920
agricultural revolution, there was quite a
crash in body size because the low quality

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:19.350
of the diet they were eating. Okay, I have
a second question and it says, "Is it fair

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:24.090
to say that primitive man had childlike
cognition? How would you describe the

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:30.760
cognitive process of the genus homo?" Now
what this immediately made me think of was

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:36.720
Allen Walker who used to say "If you
stared into the eyes of the Turkana boy,

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:41.790
would you see a human staring at you or an
animal?" And that's a question we really

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:47.850
can't answer. And in terms of childlike
cognition, we're talking about different

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:55.210
species. Probably a good comparison is
your dog and how would you describe the

00:33:55.210 --> 00:34:01.160
cognition of your dog who can be
tremendously smart in some areas and very

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:08.900
stupid in other areas? And the answer to
this question is we really don't know, but

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:13.050
it's probably more on the animal side
particularly when we're talking about the

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:18.370
origin of the genus homo.
But I always used to tell my students:

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:23.220
Whatever erectus was doing, they were
doing it right because they lasted for

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:29.100
over a million years and they spread
throughout the old world. So if that's

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.198
smarts, they were very smart.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:43.820
- First question: “Can humans lower their
metabolic costs by reducing brain

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:52.180
activity? Less worrying, being more
meditative.”

00:34:52.180 --> 00:35:02.580
- [Herman] My students try that every day.
No, actually, there's not a lot of great

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:07.120
data on the energy costs of the brain at
different activity levels, so thinking

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:12.550
versus not, but as far as we can tell, the
brain ia burning the same number of

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:18.090
calories whether you are intently figuring
out a math problem or playing chess or if

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:24.510
you're meditating. And that's actually
because most of what your brain does is

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:29.290
stuff that you're not aware of. They say
you only use 10% of your brain, but that's

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:33.190
absurd, you're using all of your brain all
the time for all the different things that

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:38.880
your body's doing and managing. So just
because you turn off, or it seems like you

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:45.660
turn off the conscious part of your brain
or turn that down, probably has very

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.830
little effect on the overall calories
spent. It'd be very hard to measure that

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:52.760
and be sure, so I don't know, but I
suspect not.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:36:00.610
- Any comments about the microbiome, the
intestinal microbiome and energy

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:04.090
metabolism?

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:09.270
- Yeah, so there's lots of great work now
looking at other factors that affect

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:14.120
energy expenditure and obesity for that
matter and the microbiome, this sort of

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:19.050
rainforest that we carry around in our
guts has been a topic, a really hot topic

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:24.830
recently. Two things: First, none of this
stuff on energetics means that you don't

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:29.880
have to exercise. So people often say
like, "Well, this means I don't have to

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.610
exercise." Nope, what this means it that
exercise is going to do different things

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:37.380
to your body than were kind of maybe
taught. It's not gonna ramp up your

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:42.230
calorie expenditure every day necessarily,
because your body's going to adapt if you

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:45.430
start exercising than doing something
differently. Your body's going to adapt to

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:49.060
that metabolically. But that adaptation
itself might be really good for your

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:55.990
health, and in any case, there's all sorts
of non-metabolic things that exercise does

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:59.850
that keeps us healthy, so you still have
to exercise. You still have to exercise.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:06.800
You still have to exercise. Okay,
microbiomes. We don't know enough yet

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.670
about the function of the microbiome in
terms of its effect on our overall

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:18.430
metabolism. We know that people who are
fat or thin tend to have different

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:23.000
microbiomes. Mice who are fat or thin can
have different microbiomes, you can make

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.610
them fat or thin by giving them different
microbiomes. So really interesting stuff

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:30.090
and it has to do with metabolism for sure.
Exactly how all those things link

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:34.630
together, we don't know yet.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:48.640
- Thanks a lot. I believe we've completed
the question period, so time for remarks.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:55.360
- [Ajit] I'd like to take the opportunity
to thank those who made the symposium

00:37:55.360 --> 00:38:01.230
possible. To the symposium chairs,
speakers, the supporters and the audience

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:10.640
for attending and your great questions,
give yourself a round of applause. The

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:15.140
mark of a great CARTA symposium is that it
raises more questions than answers and I

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:21.490
think we really did that today. And as
Steve pointed out, it's really a mystery,

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:26.390
and in fact all of exploring anthropogony
is like solving a murder mystery. So I'd

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:30.710
like to leave you with the words of the
great detective. "When you have eliminated

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:38.790
the impossible, whatever remains, however
improbable, must be the truth." Thank you

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:40.819
all very much for coming.
