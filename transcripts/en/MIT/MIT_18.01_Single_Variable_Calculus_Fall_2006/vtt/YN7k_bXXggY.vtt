00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.340
PROFESSOR: In the twelfth
lecture, we're going to talk

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.110
about maxima and minima.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.110
Let's finish up what
we did last time.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.710
We really only just started
with maxima and minima.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.100
And then we're going to talk
about related rates.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:49.210
So, right now I want to give you
some examples of max-min

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.540
problems. And we're going to
start with a fairly basic one.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.540
So what's the thing about
max-min problems?

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.150
The main thing is that we're
asking you to do a little bit

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.580
more of the interpretation of
word problems. So many of the

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.970
problems are expressed
in terms of words.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:18.650
And so, in this case, we have
a wire which is length 1.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:29.610
Cut into two pieces.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:38.150
And then each piece
encloses a square.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.400
Sorry, encloses a square.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.170
And the problem - so
this is the setup.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:02:02.650
And the problem is to find the
largest area enclosed.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.910
So here's the problem.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:10.570
Now, in all of these cases, in
all these cases, there's a

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.600
bunch of words.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.700
And your job is typically
to draw a diagram.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.890
So the first thing you want to
do is to draw a diagram.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.340
In this case, it can be
fairly schematic.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.400
Here's your unit length.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.590
And when you draw the diagram,
you're going to

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.370
have to pick variables.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.700
So those are really the
two main tasks.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.665
To set up the problem.

00:02:35.665 --> 00:02:37.170
So you're drawing a diagram.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.330
This is like word problems of
old, in grade school through

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.410
high school.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:50.020
Draw a diagram and name
the variables.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.900
So we'll be doing a
lot of that today.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.950
So here's my unit length.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.770
And I'm going to choose the
variable x to be the length of

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.280
one of the pieces of wire.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.240
And that makes the other
piece 1 - x.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.430
And that's pretty much the whole
diagram, except that

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.210
there's something that we
did with the wire after

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.710
we cut it in half.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.370
Namely, we built two little
boxes out of it.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.520
Like this, these are
our squares.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:25.020
And their side lengths are
x / 4 and (1 - x) / 4.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.710
So, so far, so good.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.390
And now we have to think, well,
we want to find the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.450
largest area.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.170
So I need a formula for area
in terms of variables that

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.490
I've described.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.790
And so that's the last thing.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.400
I'll give the letter a as
the label for the area.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:47.080
And then the area is just
the square of x/4 + the

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.940
square of 1 - x.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.720
Whoops, that strange
2 got in here.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.780
Over 4.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.110
So far, so good.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.720
Now, The instinct that you'll
have, and I'm going to yield

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.520
to that instinct, is we should
charge ahead and just

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.430
differentiate.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.870
Alright?

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.460
That's alright.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.430
We'll find the critical
points.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.995
So we know that those are
important points.

00:04:12.995 --> 00:04:17.840
So we're going to find
the critical points.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.780
In other words, we take the
derivative we set, the

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.390
derivative of a with
respect to x = 0.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.690
So if I do that differentiation,
I get the,

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.240
well, so the first one,
x^2 / 16, that's 8.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.870
Sorry.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.060
That's x / 8, right?

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.570
That's a derivative of this.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.050
And if I differentiate this, I
get well, the derivative of 1

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.930
- x ^2 is 2 ( 1 - x)( a - 1).

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:03.170
So it's - (1 - x) / 8.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.420
So there are two minus signs in
there, I'll let you ponder

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.900
that differentiation, which
I did by the chain rule.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.730
Hang on a sec, OK?

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.960
Just wait until we're done.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.480
So here's the derivative.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.890
Is there a problem?

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:29.060
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.320
PROFESSOR: Right, so there's
a 1/16 here.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.850
This is x^2 / 16.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.870
And so it's 2x / 8,
over 16, sorry.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.360
Which has an 8.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.790
That's OK.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:56.080
Alright, so now, This is equal
to 0 if and only if x = 1 - x.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.170
That's 2x = = 1, or in
other words x = 1/2.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.280
Alright?

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.530
So there's our critical point.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.710
So x = 1/2 is the
critical point.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:18.570
And the critical value, which
is what you get when you

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:26.260
evaluate a at 1/2, is (1/2)
/ 4, that's 1/8.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:38.030
So that's (1/8)^2 + (1/8)^2
which = 1/32.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:45.480
So, so far, so good.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.050
But we're not done yet.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:56.850
We're not done.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.070
So why aren't we done?

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:04.590
Because we haven't checked
the end points.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.370
So let's check the end points.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.540
Now, in this problem,
the end points are

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.650
really sort of excluded.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.530
The ends are between
0 and 1 here.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.740
That's the possible lengths
of the cut.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.580
And so what we should really be
doing is evaluating in the

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.950
limit, so that would be the
right-hand limit as x

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.160
goes to 0 of a.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:39.450
And if you plug in x = 0, what
you get here is 0 + (1/4)^2.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.000
Which is 1/16.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.660
And similarly, at the other
end, that's 1 - 1 from the

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:56.650
left we get (1/4)^2 + 0,
which is also 1/16.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:02.160
So, what you see is that the
schematic picture of this

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.840
function, and isn't even so far
off from being the right

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:12.120
picture here, is that it's level
here as 1/16 and then it

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.800
dips down and goes up.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.020
Right?

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.970
This is 1/2, this is
1, and this level

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:19.960
here is a half that.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.070
This is 1/32.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.660
So we did not find, when we
found the critical point we

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.740
did not find the largest
area enclosed.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.060
We found the least
area enclosed.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.060
So if you don't pay attention
to what the function looks

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.760
like, not only will you about
half the time get the wrong

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.980
answer, you'll get the absolute
worst answer.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.420
You'll get the one which
is the polar opposite

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.680
from what you want.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.970
So you have to pay a little
bit of attention to the

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.440
function that you've got.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.530
And in this case it's
just very schematic.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.780
It dips down and goes up, and
that's true of pretty much

00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.560
most functions.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.430
They're fairly simple.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.980
They maybe only have
one critical point.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.550
They only turn around once.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.680
But then, maybe the critical
point is the maximum or maybe

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.760
it's the minimum.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.670
Or maybe it's neither,
in fact.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:15.820
So we'll be discussing that
maybe some other time.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.010
So what we find here
is that we have

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:26.260
the least area enclosed.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.420
Enclosed is 1/32.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:35.880
And this is true when x = 1/2.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:44.190
So these are equal squares.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:55.970
And most when there's
only one square.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:00.480
Which is more or less the
limiting situation.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.490
If one of the pieces
disappears.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:09.840
Now, so that's the first
kind of example.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.560
And I just want to make one more
comment about terminology

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.600
before we go on.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.690
And I will introduce it with
the following question.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:31.510
What is the minimum?

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:39.640
So, what is the minimum?

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.120
Yeah.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.430
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.740
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.640
The lowest value of
the function.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:52.600
So the answer to that
question is 1/32.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.770
Now, the problem with this
question and you will, so that

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:07.100
refers to the minimum value.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.420
But then there's this other
question which is

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:15.950
where is the minimum.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:22.390
And the answer to
that is x = 1/2.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:31.360
So one of them is the minimum
point, and the other one is

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.640
the minimum value.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.840
So they're two separate
things.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.210
Now, the problem is that
people are sloppy.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.180
And especially since you usually
find the critical

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:48.620
point first, and the value
that is plugging in for a

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.980
second, people will stop short
and they'll give the wrong

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.010
answer to the question,
for instance.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.760
Now, both questions are
important to answer.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.040
You just need to have
a word to put there.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.490
So this is a little
bit careless.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:03.900
When we say what is
the minimum, some

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.060
people will say 1/2.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.030
And that's literally wrong.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.800
They know what they mean.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.890
But it's just wrong.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.410
And when people ask
this question,

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.520
they're being sloppy.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.210
Anyway.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.660
They should maybe be a little
clearer and say what's the

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.850
minimum value.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.320
Or, where is the
value achieved.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:27.080
It's achieved at, or where is
the minimum value achieved.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.280
"Where is min achieved?",
would be a better way of

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.050
phrasing this second question.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:37.900
So that it has an unambiguous
answer.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.910
And when people ask you for
the minimum point, they're

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:45.490
also - so why is it that we
call it the minimum point?

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.510
We have this word, critical
point, which is what x = 1/2

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.330
is in critical value.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.840
And so I'm making those same
distinctions here.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:13:01.250
But there's another notion of
a minimum point, and this is

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:09.340
an alternative if you like.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:19.540
The minimum point is the
point (1/2, 1/32).

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:25.350
Right, that's a point
on the graph.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:29.640
It's the point - well, so that
graph is way up there, but

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.740
I'll just put it on there.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.780
That's this point.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.010
And you might say min there.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.166
And you might point to this
point, and you might say max.

00:13:38.166 --> 00:13:42.540
And similarly, this one
might be a max.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:47.970
So in other words, what this
means is simply that people

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.520
are a little sloppy.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.860
And sometimes they mean
one thing and

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.770
sometimes they mean another.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.850
And you're just stuck with this,
because there'll be some

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.020
authors who will say one thing
and some people will mean

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.130
another and you just have to
live with this little bit of

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.150
annoying ambiguity.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.690
Yeah?

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:08.280
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.735
PROFESSOR: OK, so that's
a good - very good.

00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:16.710
So here we go, find the
largest area enclosed.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:22.290
So that's sort of a trick
question, isn't it?

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:28.410
So there are various - that's
a good thing to ask.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.530
That's sort of a trick
question, why?

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:36.460
Because according to the rules,
we're trapped between

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.320
the two maxima at something
which is strictly below.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.300
So in other words, one answer to
this question would be, and

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:48.000
this is the answer that I would
probably give, is 1/16.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.640
But that's not really true.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:56.560
Because that's only
in the limit.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.380
As x goes to 0, or
as x goes to 1 -.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.840
And if you like, the
most is when you've

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.830
only got one square.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.550
Which breaks the rules
of the problem.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.290
So, essentially, it's
a trick question.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:13.670
But I would answer
it this way.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.900
Because that's the most
interesting part of the

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.840
answer, which is that it's 1/16
and it occurs really when

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:28.920
one of the squares disappears
to nothing.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:34.180
So now, let's do another
example here.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:41.660
And I just want to illustrate
the second style, or the

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.260
second type of question.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:43.480
Yeah.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:51.750
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:56.540
PROFESSOR: The question is,
since the question was, what

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.090
was the largest area, why did
we find the least area.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:04.050
The reason is that when we go
about our procedure of looking

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:10.220
for the least, or the most,
we'll automatically find both.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.730
Because we don't know
which one is which

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.730
until we compare values.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.530
And actually, it's much more
to your advantage to figure

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:21.360
out both the maximum and minimum
whenever you answer

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.340
such a question.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.790
Because otherwise you won't
understand the behavior of the

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.590
function very well.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:27.850
So, the question.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.500
We started out with one
question, we answered both.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.750
We answered two questions.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:35.610
We answered the question of
what the largest and the

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.290
smallest value was.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:40.834
STUDENT: Also, I'm wondering
if you can check both the

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:47.540
minimum [INAUDIBLE] approaches
[INAUDIBLE].

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.130
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.470
One can also use, the question
is, can we use the second

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.480
derivative test. And the
answer is, yes we can.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.070
In fact, you can actually also
stare at this and see that

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.590
it's a sum of squares.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.850
So it's always curving up.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.710
It's a parabola with a positive
second coefficient.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.670
So you can differentiate
this twice.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.670
If you do you'll get
1/8 + another 1/8

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.450
and you'll get 1/16.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.540
So the second derivative
is 1/16.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.730
Is 1/4.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:21.540
And that's an acceptable
way of figuring it out.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.580
I'll mention the second
derivative test again, in this

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:24.950
second example.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:32.580
So let me talk about
a second example.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.070
So again, this is going to
be another question.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.950
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:43.660
PROFESSOR: The question is, when
I say minimum or maximum

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.880
point which will I mean.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:50.570
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.100
PROFESSOR: So I just repeated
the question.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.040
So the question is,
when I say minimum

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.580
point, what will I mean?

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.100
OK?

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:05.860
And the answer is that for the
purposes of this class I will

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.090
probably avoid saying that.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:13.340
But I will say, probably, where
is the minimum achieved.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:14.680
Just in order to avoid that.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.160
If I actually sat at I often am
referring to the graph, and

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.300
I mean this.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.870
And in fact, when you get your
little review for the second

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:25.860
exam, I'll say exactly that
on the review sheet.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.750
And I'll make this very clear
when we were doing this.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.800
However, I just want to prepare
you for the fact that

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.720
in real life, and even me when
I'm talking colloquially, when

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.700
I say what's the minimum point
of something, I might actually

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:48.730
be mixing it up with this
other notion here.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:54.380
So let's do another example.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:58.750
So this is an example to get
us used to the notion of

00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:59.880
constraints.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:08.250
So we have, so consider
a box without a top.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:16.860
Or, if you like, we're going to
find the box without a top.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:35.380
With least surface area
for a fixed volume.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.616
Find the box without a top with
least surface area for a

00:19:40.616 --> 00:19:42.360
fixed volume.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:47.940
The procedure for working this
out is the following.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.480
You make this diagram.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.220
And you set up the variables.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.390
In this case, we're going to
have four names of variables.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.890
We have four letters that
we have to choose.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.330
And we'll choose them
in a kind of a

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:05.680
standard way, alright?

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.260
So first I have to tell
you one more thing.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:13.000
Which is something that we could
calculate separately but

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.080
I'm just going to give
it to you in advance.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.920
Which is that it turns
out that the best box

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.420
has a square bottom.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.710
And that's going to get rid of
one of our variables for us.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.970
So it's got a square bottom,
and so let's draw

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.500
a picture of it.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:36.860
So here's our box.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.180
Well, that goes down like this,
almost. Maybe I should

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:49.620
get it a little farther down.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.070
So here's our box.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.900
Let's correct that just a bit.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.760
So now, what about the
dimensions of this box?

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.270
Well, this is going to be
x, and this is very

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.180
foreshortened, but
it's also x.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.130
The bottom is x by x, it's
the same dimensions.

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:12.190
And then the vertical
dimension is y.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.750
So far, so good.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.620
Now, I promised you two
more letter names.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:21.040
I want to compute the volume.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.440
The volume is, the base is x
^2, and the height is y.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.780
So there's the volume.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:33.060
And then the area, the area is
the area of the bottom, which

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:37.940
is x ^2, that's the bottom.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.510
And then there are
the four sides.

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.230
And the four sides are
rectangles of dimensions xy.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:49.500
So it's 4xy.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:53.630
So these are the sides.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.680
And remember, there's no top.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.610
So that's our setup.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:03.290
So now, the difference between
this problem and the last

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:06.690
problem is that there are two
variables floating around,

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.710
namely x and y, which
are not determined.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:17.670
But there's what's called
a constraint here.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:22.920
Namely, we've fixed the
relationship between x and y.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:30.880
And so, that means that we can
solve for y in terms of x.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:40.650
So y = v / x ^2.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.660
And then, we can plug that
into the formula for a.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:23:00.960
So here we have a which is
x ^2 + 4x ( v / x^2).

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:01.410
Question.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:15.100
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.720
PROFESSOR: The question is,
will you need to know this

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.350
intuitively?

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.630
No.

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:20.830
That's something that I would
have to give to you.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:26.070
I mean, it's actually true
that a lot of things, the

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.040
correct answer is something
symmetric.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.730
In this last problem, the
minimum turned out to be

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.450
exactly halfway in between
because there were sort of

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.900
equal demands from
the two sides.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.750
And similarly, here, what
happens is if you elongate one

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:44.930
side, you get less - it actually
is involved with a

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:46.050
two variable problem.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.980
Namely, if you have a rectangle
and you have a

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.380
certain amount of length
associated with it.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.720
What's the optimal thing
you can do with that.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.660
But I won't, in other words,
the optimal rectangle, the

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.400
least perimeter rectangle,
turns out to be a square.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.230
That's the little sub-problem
that leads you

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.960
to this square bottom.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.270
But so that would have been a
separate max-min problem.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.900
Which I'm skipping, because I
what to do this slightly more

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.240
interesting one.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:22.110
So now, here's our formula for
a, and now I want to follow

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:27.340
the same procedure as before.

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.320
Namely, we look for the
critical point.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:35.530
Or points.

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.260
So let's take a look.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:43.430
So again, a is (x
^2 + 4v) / x.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:49.800
And A' = 2x - (4v / x^2).

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:59.510
So if we set that equal to
0, we get 2x = 2v / x ^2.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.620
So 2x^3.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:07.270
How did that happen
to change into 2?

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:09.590
Interesting, guess
that's wrong.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.950
OK.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:28.010
So this is x ^ 3 = 2v. And so
x = (2 ^ 1/3)( v ^1/3).

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:36.230
So this is the critical point.

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.040
So we are not done.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:38.670
Right?

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:40.790
We're not done, because we don't
even know whether this

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.960
is going to give us the worst
box or the best box, from this

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.410
point of view.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:48.350
The one that uses the most
surface area or the least. So

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:51.990
let's check the ends,
right away.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:54.030
To see what's happening.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:56.490
So can somebody tell me what
the ends, what the

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.060
end values of x are?

00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.520
Where does x range from?

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:05.480
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.040
PROFESSOR: What's the smallest
x can be, yeah.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:16.520
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.400
PROFESSOR: OK, the claim was
that the largest x could be

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:23.500
root a, because somehow there's
this x ^2 here and you

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.685
can't get any further
past than that.

00:26:25.685 --> 00:26:28.700
But there's a key feature
here of this problem.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.050
Which is that a is variable.

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:40.630
The only thing that's fixed in
the problem is v. So if v is

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:47.440
fixed, what do you
know about x?

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.810
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:51.160
PROFESSOR: x &gt; 0, yeah.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.060
The lower end point,
that's safe.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.440
Because that has to do
geometrically with the fact

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.430
that we don't have any boxes
with negative dimensions.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.360
That would be refused by the
Post Office, definitely.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.310
Over and above the empty
top, which they

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:05.510
wouldn't accept either.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:13.330
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:17.260
PROFESSOR: It's true that x
&lt; square root of v / y.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.250
So that's using this
relationship.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:26.850
But notice that y = v / x ^2.

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.270
So 0 to infinity, I just
got a guess there over

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.080
here, that's right.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.350
Here's the upper limit.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.750
So this is really important
to realize.

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:38.940
This is most problems. Most
problems, the variable if it

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.800
doesn't have a limitation,
usually

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.370
just goes out to infinity.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:45.790
And infinity is a very important
end for the problem.

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:51.690
It's usually an easy end
to the problem, too.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.030
So there's a possibility that if
we push all the way down to

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.240
x = 0, we'll get a better box.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.230
It would be very strange box.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:01.620
A little bit like our
vanishing enclosure.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:05.550
And maybe an infinitely
long box, also very

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:06.840
inconvenient one.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.990
Might be the best box.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:10.390
We'll have to see.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.810
So let's just take a look
at what happens.

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:18.740
So we're looking at a, at 0 +.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:25.890
And that's x^2 + 4v
/ x with x at 0 +.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:26.760
So what happens to that?

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:35.220
Notice right here, this
is going to infinity.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.500
So this is infinite.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.250
So that turns out
to be a bad box.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:45.730
Let's take a look at
the other end.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:51.930
So this is x ^2 + 4v / x,
x going to infinity.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:58.320
And again, this term
here means that

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.930
this thing is infinite.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:02.730
So the shape of this thing,
I'll draw this tiny little

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:05.000
schematic diagram over here.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.110
The shape of this thing
is like this, right?

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:14.200
And so, when we find that one
turnaround point, which

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:20.790
happened to be at this strange
point 2/3 , (2 ^ 1/3)( v ^

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:24.440
1/3), that is going
to be the minimum.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:30.090
So we've just discovered
that it's the minimum.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:31.690
Which is just what we
were hoping for.

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:38.200
This is going to be
the optimal box.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:45.240
Now, since you asked earlier and
since it's worth checking

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:51.740
this as well, let's also check
an alternative justification.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:30:04.320
So an alternative to checking
ends is the second derivative

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:14.750
test. I do not recommend the
second derivative test. I try

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:17.140
my best, when I give you
problems, to make it really

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.840
hard to apply the second
derivative test. But in this

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.930
example, the function is simple
enough so that it's

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:24.570
perfectly OK.

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:29.110
If you take the derivative
here, remember, this was

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:34.760
whatever it was, 2x
- (4v / x ^2).

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.730
If I take the second
derivative,

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:43.610
it's 2 + (8v / x ^3).

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:45.310
And that's positive.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:49.580
So this thing is concave up.

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.290
And that's consistent
with its being, the

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:59.840
critical point is a min.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.840
Is a minimum point.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.790
See how I almost said,
is a min, as

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:05.180
opposed to minimum point.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:05.870
So watch out.

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:06.280
Yes.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:12.920
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.860
PROFESSOR: You're one
step ahead of me.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.080
The question is, is this the
answer to the question or

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:20.090
would we have to give y and
a and so on and so forth.

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:24.060
So, again, this is something
that I want to emphasize and

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.220
take my time with right now.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:30.030
Because it depends, what kind
of real life problem you're

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:33.360
answering, what kind of
answer is appropriate.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.010
So, so far we've found
the critical point.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:38.080
We haven't found the
critical value.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.190
We haven't found the dimensions
of the box.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:45.680
So we're going to spend a little
bit more time on this,

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.920
exactly in order to address
these questions.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.170
So, first of all.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:51.470
The value of y.

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:55.120
So, so far we have x =
(2 ^ 1/3)( v ^ 1/3).

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.610
And certainly if you're going
to build the box, you also

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:00.350
want to know what
the y value is.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:04.970
The y value is going
to be, let's see.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:12.110
Well, it's v / x ^2, so that's
v / ((2 ^ 1/3)( v ^ 1/3) ^2,

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:19.770
which comes out to be (2
^ - 2/3)( v ^ 1/3).

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:22.580
So there's the y value.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:29.580
On top of that, we could figure
out the value of a.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.880
So that's also a perfectly
reasonable part of the answer.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.840
Depending on what one is
interested in, you might care

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.200
how much money it's going to
cost you to build this box.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.330
This optimal box.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.370
And so you plug in
the value of a.

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.370
So a, let's see, is up here.

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:47.740
It's x ^2 + 4v / x.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:58.010
So that's going to be ((2 ^
1/3)( v ^ 1/3) ^2 + (4v / (2 ^

00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:02.330
1/3)( v ^ 1/3)).

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:07.300
And if you work that all out,
what you get turns out to be 3

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:13.730
( 2 ^ 1/3)( v ^ 2/3).

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:18.330
So if you like, one way of
answering this question is

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:23.160
these three things.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.010
That would be the minimum point

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:26.490
corresponding to the graph.

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:28.950
That would be the answer
to this question.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:31.710
But the reason why I'm carrying
it out in such detail

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.840
is I want to show you that there
are much more meaningful

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.150
ways of answering
this question.

00:33:37.150 --> 00:34:02.810
So let me explain that.

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:07.290
So let me go through some more
meaningful answers here.

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:14.770
The first more meaningful answer
is the following idea

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:29.780
simply, what are known as
dimensionless variables.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:33.050
So the first thing that you
notice is the scaling law.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:36.120
That a / v ^ 2/3 is
the thing that's a

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.260
dimensionless quantity.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:42.150
That happens to be
3 ( 2 ^ 1/3).

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:43.970
So that's one thing.

00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:46.220
If you want to expand the
volume, you'll have to expand

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:49.220
the area by the 2/3 power
of the volume.

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:54.800
And if you think of the area
as being in, say, square

00:34:54.800 --> 00:35:00.000
inches, and the volume of the
box as being in cubic inches,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.450
then you can see that this is
a dimensionless quantity and

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:04.440
you have a dimensionless
number here, which is a

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:09.310
characteristic independent
of what a and v were.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:15.710
The other dimensionless
quantity is the y:x.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:19.640
So x : y.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:23.680
So, again, that's inches
divided by inches.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:33.160
And it's (2 ^ 1/3)( v ^ 1/3) /
( 2 ^ - 2/3)( v ^ 1/3), which

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.150
happens to be 2.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:41.390
So this is actually the best
answer to the question.

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:46.120
And it shows you that the
box is a 2:1 box.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:50.200
If this is 2 and this is
1, that's the good box.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:56.900
And that is just the shape,
if you like, and

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:02.670
it's the optimal shape.

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:05.010
And certainly that,
aesthetically, that's the

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:12.460
cleanest answer to
the question.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:13.520
There was a question
right here.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:13.820
Yes.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:20.930
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:22.620
PROFESSOR: Could you repeat
that, I couldn't hear.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.460
STUDENT: I'm wondering if you'd
be able to get that

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:30.220
answer if you [INAUDIBLE]
square.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:31.870
PROFESSOR: The question is,
could we have gotten the

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:34.380
answer if we weren't told that
the bottom was square.

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:39.160
The answer is, yes in 18.02
with multivariable.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.370
You would have to have three
letters here, an x, a y, and a

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:43.470
z, if you like.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:48.170
And then you'd have to work
with all three of them.

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:53.440
So I separated out into one,
there's a separate one

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.550
variable problem that you
can do for the base.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:57.870
And then this is a second one
variable problem for this

00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:58.510
other thing.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:01.110
And it's just two consecutive
one variable problems that

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.170
solve the multivariable
problem.

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:06.200
Or, as I say in multivariable
calculus, you can just do it

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.990
all in one step.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.240
Yeah?

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.820
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:15.010
PROFESSOR: Why did I divide
x by y, rather than

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:17.830
y by x, or in any?

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:20.390
So, again, what I was aiming
for was dimensionless

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:22.320
quantities.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.640
So x and y are measured
in the same units.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.430
And also the proportions
of the box.

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:34.310
So that's another word for
this is proportions.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:37.980
Are something that's universal,
independent of the

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:39.980
volume v. It's something
you can say about

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.020
any box, at any scale.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:45.200
Whether it be, you know,
something by

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.950
Cristo in the Common.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:50.530
Maybe we'll get in here
to do some fancy --

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:55.540
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.630
PROFESSOR: The proportions is
with geometric problems

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:01.700
typically, when there's a
scaling to the problem.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.300
Where the answer is the
same at small scales

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.280
and at large scales.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.000
This is capturing that.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.070
So that's why, the ratios are
what's capturing that.

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:11.800
And that's why it's
aesthetically the

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.860
nicest thing to ask.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:18.730
STUDENT: So, what exactly does
the ratio of the area to the

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:21.910
volume ratio [INAUDIBLE]
tell us?

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:23.390
PROFESSOR: Unfortunately,
this number is a

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:25.490
really obscure number.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:28.100
So the question is what
does this tell us.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.300
The only thing that I want to
emphasize is what's on the

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.800
left-hand side here.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.050
Which is, it's the area to the
2/3 power of the volume, so

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.550
it's a dimensionless quantity
that happens to be this.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:41.760
If you do this, for example,
in general with planar

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:47.200
diagrams, circumferenced area
is a bad ratio to take.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.020
What you want to take
is the square of

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.170
circumference to area.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.910
Because the square of
circumference has the same

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:56.880
dimensions; that is, say,
inches squared to area.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.840
Which is in square inches.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.445
So, again, it's these
dimensionless quantities that

00:39:01.445 --> 00:39:03.440
you want to cook up.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.030
And those are the ones that
will have universal

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:06.810
properties.

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:10.870
The most famous of these is the
circle that encloses the

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:13.880
most area for its
circumference.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:18.290
And, again, that's only true if
you take the square of the

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.880
circumference.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:25.620
You do the units correctly.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.290
Anyway.

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.760
So we're here, we've
got a shape.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.560
We've got an answer
to this question.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:36.940
And I now want to
do this problem.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.410
Well, let's put it this way.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:40.350
I wanted to do this problem
by a different method.

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:43.430
I think I'll take the
time to do it.

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:46.100
So I want to do this problem
by a slightly

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.880
different method here.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:59.160
So, here's Example 2 by implicit
differentiation.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:02.420
So the same example, but now I'm
going to do it by implicit

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.720
differentiation.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.050
Well, I'll tell you the
advantages and disadvantages

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:08.880
to this method here.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:20.130
So the situation is, you have
to start the same way.

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:24.230
So here is the starting
place of the problem.

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:34.980
And the goal was the minimum
of a with v constant.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:38.540
So this was the situation
that we were in.

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:45.130
And now, what I want to do
is just differentiate.

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.970
The function y is implicitly
a function of x, so I can

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:54.550
differentiate the first
expression.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:41:00.570
And that yields 0 = 2xy
+ (x ^2 )( y').

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:07.570
So this is giving me my implicit
formula for y', So y'

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:13.080
= - 2xy / x ^2.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:19.660
Or in other words, - 2y / x.

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:24.990
And then I also have
the dA/dx.

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:28.750
Now, you may notice I'm not
using primes quite as much.

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:32.680
Because all of the variables are
varying, and so here I'm

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.750
emphasizing that it's a
differentiation with respect

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:36.790
to the variable x.

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:48.130
And this becomes
2x + 4y + 4xy'.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:53.140
So again, this is using
the product rule.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.450
And now I can plug in for
what y' is, which

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:57.450
is right above it.

00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:09.330
So this is 2x + 4y
+ 4x ( - 2y / x).

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:14.150
And that's equal to 0.

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:24.770
And so let's gather
that together.

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:25.960
So what do we have?

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:31.100
We have 2x + 4y, and
then, altogether,

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:36.550
this is 8 - 8y = 0.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:41.600
So that's the same
thing as 2x = 4y.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.100
The - 4y goes to
the other side.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:54.420
And so, x / y = 2.

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:59.260
So this, I claim, so you have
to decide for yourself.

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:03.630
But I claim that
this is faster.

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:08.170
It's faster, and also it gets
to the heart of the matter,

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:10.870
which is this scale in
variant proportions.

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:13.360
Which is basically also nicer.

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.720
So it gets to the nicer
answer, also.

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.970
So those are the advantages
that this has.

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:23.340
So it's faster, and it
gets to this, I'm

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:26.260
going to call it nicer.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:41.890
And the disadvantage is
it did not check.

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:59.540
Whether this critical point
is a max, min, or neither.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.280
So we didn't quite finish
the problem.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:11.640
But we got to the answer very
fast. Yeah, question.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.480
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:17.760
PROFESSOR: How would
you check it?

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.270
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:20.510
PROFESSOR: Well, so it gives
you a candidate.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:22.410
The answer is - so the
question is, how

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:23.390
would you check it?

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:27.900
The answer is that for this
particular problem, the only

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:31.300
way to do it is to do
something like this.

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:34.480
So in other words, it doesn't
save you that much time.

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:38.420
But with many, many, examples,
you actually can tell

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:42.010
immediately that if the two
ends, the thing is, say, 0,

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:43.650
and inside it's positive.

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:44.370
Things like that.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:53.640
So in many, many, cases
this is just as good.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:58.510
So now I'm going to change
subjects here.

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:03.590
But the subject that I'm going
to talk about next is almost,

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:07.550
is very, very closely linked.

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:10.850
Namely, I talked about implicit
differentiation.

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:12.770
Now, we're going to just
talk about dealing

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:13.920
with lots of variables.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.360
And rates of change.

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.610
So, essentially, we're going
to talk about the

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:19.680
same type of thing.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.570
So, I'm going to tell you
about a subject which is

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:25.220
called related rates.

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:28.150
Which is really just another
excuse for getting used to

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:32.510
setting up variables
and equations.

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:34.320
So, here we go.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.000
Related rates.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.370
And i'm going to illustrate this
with one example today,

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:44.350
one tomorrow.

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:47.600
So here's my example
for today.

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.810
So, again, this is going
to be a police problem.

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:54.090
But this is going to be a word
problem and - sorry, I'm don't

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:56.910
want to scare you, no police.

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:59.940
Well, there are police in the
story but they're not present.

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:05.070
So, but I'm going to draw it
immediately with the diagram

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:08.410
because I'm going to save
us the trouble.

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:11.580
Although, you know, the point
here is to get from the words

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:15.940
to the diagram.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:21.990
So you have the police, and
they're 30 feet from the road.

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:25.750
And here's the road.

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:36.910
And you're coming along, here,
in your, let's see, in your

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:39.420
car going in this
direction here.

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:43.760
And the police have radar.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.490
Which is bouncing
off of your car.

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:53.880
And what they read off is that
you're 50 feet away.

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:57.910
They also know that you're
approaching along the line of

00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:12.370
the radar at a rate of
80 feet per second.

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:19.260
Now, the question is,
are you speeding.

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:20.730
That's the question.

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:29.030
So when you're speeding, by the
way, up 95 feet per second

00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:32.090
is about 65 miles per hour.

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:35.890
So that's the threshold here.

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:41.360
So what I want to do now is
show you how you set up a

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.860
problem like this.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.150
This distance is 50.

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:50.170
This is 30, and because it's
the distance to a straight

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:52.030
line you know that this
is a right angle.

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:54.580
So we know that this is
a right triangle.

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:58.360
And this is set out to be a
right triangle, which is an

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:00.870
easy one, a 3, 4, 5 right
triangle just so that we can

00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:05.640
do the computations easily.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:09.320
So now, the question is, how
do we put the letters in to

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.510
make his problem work, to
figure out what the

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:12.310
rate of change is.

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:15.930
So now, let me explain
that right now.

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:18.590
And we will actually do the
computation next time.

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:22.140
So the first thing is, you
have to understand what's

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.850
changing and what's not.

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:30.880
And we're going to use t
for time, in seconds.

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:36.830
And now, an important distance
here is the distance to this

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:37.820
foot of this perpendicular.

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:41.310
So I'm going to name that x.

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:42.710
I'm going to give
that letter x.

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:44.480
Now, x is varying.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.360
The reason why I need a letter
for it as opposed to this 40

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.150
is that it's going to have
a rate of change

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:50.220
with respect to t.

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:55.300
And, in fact, it's related to,
the question is whether dx /

00:48:55.300 --> 00:49:00.460
dt is faster or slower
than 95.

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:01.890
So that's the thing
that's varying.

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:04.010
Now, there's something
else that's varying.

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:06.000
This distance here
is also varying.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.760
So we need a letter for that.

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:11.620
We do not need a letter
for this.

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:12.920
Because it's never changing.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.010
We're assuming the police
are parked.

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:17.820
They're not ready to roar out
and catch you just yet, and

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.420
they're certainly not in motion
when they've got the

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.880
radar guns aimed at you.

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.110
So you need to know something
about the sociology

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:28.160
and style of police.

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.950
So you need to know things
about the real world.

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:36.370
Now, the last bit is, what
about this 80 here.

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:37.770
So this is how fast you're
approaching.

00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:40.290
Now, that's measured along
the radar gun.

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:44.950
I claim that that's d by dt
of this quantity here.

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:46.910
So this is d is also changing.

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:49.200
That's why we needed a
letter for it, too.

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.090
So, next time, we'll just put
that all together and

00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:55.010
compute dx / dt.
