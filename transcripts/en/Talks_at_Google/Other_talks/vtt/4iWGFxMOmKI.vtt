00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:04.830
MALE SPEAKER: Nick, Google.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:05.290
Google, Nick.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.090
I'll do that again.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.508
NICK OFFERMAN: Welcome.

00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:14.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.590
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you
so much for coming by.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.890
NICK OFFERMAN: My pleasure.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.420
Oh Jesus.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.900
MALE SPEAKER: We're up in the
San Francisco office.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.360
NICK OFFERMAN: We're
on the Jumbotron.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:20.970
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.150
There are folks from other
offices who I think are just

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.850
peeking in.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.338
I'd like a higher angle, sir.

00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:30.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.370
MALE SPEAKER: So Nick's in town,
in northern California,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.860
just to stop through--

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.190
usually you come through to pick
up wood, but this time

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.910
you're actually coming through
for kind of dual reasons.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.250
One is for-- you have an
"American Ham" show tonight?

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.840
NICK OFFERMAN: That's right.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.180
MALE SPEAKER: And then there's
also a premiere of "Somebody

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.590
Up There Likes Me"
tomorrow night.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.290
NICK OFFERMAN: Tomorrow
at the Roxy.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.550
MALE SPEAKER: And how many
"American Ham" shows has it

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.440
been so far?

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.420
NICK OFFERMAN: I think it's
about four dozen.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.620
I got invited last year,
about a year ago to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.700
speak at some colleges.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.200
And I thought, by god, I have
some things I'd like to say to

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.120
the young people.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.200
And so I wrote this show,
and it was really fun.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.410
And then more colleges
invited me.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.320
And then the show ended up
being kind of humorous.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.320
So then we turned it
into a real show.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.720
And now I'm just playing at
legit theaters like the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.790
Masonic Center this evening.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.280
And it's also been super fun
because my wife has a new band

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.900
called Nancy and Beth, and
they're about as entertaining

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.220
as anything I've ever seen.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.550
And so they've been
opening for me.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.375
And it's quite a package.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.000
MALE SPEAKER: Is it something
that you had always wanted to

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.570
do as far as kind of a one man--
because you're not a

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.460
stand-up comedian as such.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.980
NICK OFFERMAN: No.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.570
I never--

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.370
I'm a trained theater actor.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.840
I never dreamed that I would
perform as myself.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.370
MALE SPEAKER: Is that tough?

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.490
Is it hard to play yourself?

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.290
NICK OFFERMAN: Well, no.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.270
Because as my dad always
said, I have a

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.180
good line of bullshit.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.830
My grandpa was the mayor of my
small town in Illinois, and my

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.840
dad is also kind of a
former politician.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.390
So I wasn't too freaked out.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.100
I think if somebody said, I need
you to go do an hour of

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.510
stand-up, that would
make me scared.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.270
Because I don't think
I'm particularly

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.310
much of a joke writer.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.640
I put together a show that's 10
tips for a prosperous life,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.150
and then I laced it with things
that make people laugh.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.400
And it seems to be
working out.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.190
But I always say that I'm a
humorist and not a stand-up.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.020
MALE SPEAKER: And then over
the course of the year and

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.750
plus that you've been doing
this, do you make adjustments

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.140
to the show?

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.140
Is it kind of originally what
it was and it still is?

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.350
NICK OFFERMAN: The skeleton
remains the same, the 10 tips,

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.480
and If I do a tight version
of the show,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.220
it's about 90 minutes.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.520
But usually, it comes in over
two hours, because I am known

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.380
to run off at the mouth
on something

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.280
that strikes my fancy.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.700
So every show has about 30 or 40
minutes of unique material

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.150
that I pull straight
out of my ass.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.400
MALE SPEAKER: Well, it's nice
that it's your show, so it's

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.450
your prerogative.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.070
NICK OFFERMAN: It is.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.520
It's really fun.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.290
And everyone seems to have a
pretty good time, unless

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.500
they're faking it.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.750
MALE SPEAKER: Now, as far as the
fact that you've been an

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.930
actor originally coming from a
theater background, now you're

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.520
a writer, and now a producer
with "Somebody Up There Likes

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.280
Me." How did that come to be?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.530
NICK OFFERMAN: I guess
organically.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.740
I've always, I guess, written
things that I--

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.980
little stupid funny things.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.550
There's a great group from the
Bay Area, and I think they

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.950
were prevalent in the '70s,
maybe into the '80s, called

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.020
the Firesign Theater.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.860
And when I was in college, they
were like a radio play

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.550
group, but sort of a pot smoking
version of a radio

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.490
play group.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.270
And they were super,
super funny.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.380
They had five or six albums
that were a big deal.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.190
And I was very inspired
by them.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.060
So when I was in college, I
wrote some stuff kind of

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.390
emulating that medium.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.850
And I've always been a big
fan of Garrison Keillor.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.070
But even on my show, I am by
far the one who's always

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.630
pitching a lot of--

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.990
for better or worse, I'm always
pitching stuff for

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.120
everybody to say, which I think
some people like and

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.020
some people might
find irksome.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.970
But so then eventually my boss
asked me to write an episode,

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.690
which was really fun.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.830
And this friend of mine that
I've worked on a bunch of

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.070
films with asked me to produce
this film that we're opening

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.890
at the Roxy tomorrow night,
"Somebody Up There Likes Me."

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.240
And it's all just
very organic.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.080
And then this year, my boss
also asked me to direct an

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.850
episode of "Parks and Rec."
And they don't come about

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.860
because they're things
that I aspire to do.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.820
They just come about because
we love collaborating as a

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.190
group, and there's a--

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.810
my boss decided he thought it
would be funny to see if I

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.990
could write one, or my
friend wanted me to

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.260
produce this movie.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.320
It wasn't that I had any kind
of resume as a producer.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.280
He just thought that my energy
and work ethic would help.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.460
And it's a small crew.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.130
It's 20, 24 people.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.570
It's a very low budget movie.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.580
And so I was a very
creative producer.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.430
We had a second producer named
Hans Graffunder who worked on

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.950
"The Sopranos," and now he
produces for Terrence Malick,

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.200
who's an up-and-coming filmmaker
you'll be hearing

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.590
more about.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.510
And he's the dad.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.610
He ran the office.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.200
He did all the paperwork he
knew where to find all the

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.510
money we needed.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.890
And I helped the wardrobe ladies
carry clothes from

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.180
their car to the set.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.170
I ran the set and he
ran the office.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:23.290
So I kind of learned how I am
a producer as I did it.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.190
MALE SPEAKER: And having those
dual roles, so not just being

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.840
a producer, but actually
being a lead in it, is

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.420
it difficult to--

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.740
or how is that different than
just having one role, on, say

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.800
"Parks," or in theater?

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.850
NICK OFFERMAN: Well, the
downside of directing or

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.320
producing is that they want you
to pay attention to the

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.820
whole goddamn thing, which takes
a lot more energy than

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.530
just working as an actor.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.850
I don't think I would
want to--

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.120
I don't know if I would want
to producer or direct

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.700
something that I had a
really huge role in.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.430
Even though I have a leading
role, I don't have long

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.360
monologues or any days that are
particularly strenuous,

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.755
beyond standing in the right
place and making funny faces.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.590
So I think if somebody wanted
me to direct myself playing

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:24.490
Hamlet, I'd probably demur, or
at least get a co-director,

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.710
get my wife signed up.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.940
MALE SPEAKER: As far as roles
that you really think you'd

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.950
like to tackle in the future,
are there ones-- whether

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.570
they're theater, whether
film-- that you'd

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.040
like to take on?

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.810
NICK OFFERMAN: Yeah, sure.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:40.640
I mean, I don't really fit the
mold it to play someone like

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.160
Hamlet or some of the greater
leading man roles.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.730
Wouldn't mind taking a crack
at Rozencrantz or

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.082
Guildenstern.

00:07:50.082 --> 00:07:54.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.260
NICK OFFERMAN: I'm keen to do
something with the role of

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.570
Theodore Roosevelt.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.290
I think that would
be a lot of fun.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:07.640
My friend Conan O'Brien really
wants to produce something in

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.280
the realm of Teddy Roosevelt,
but we're talking about--

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.900
we can't figure out what to do,
because we can't really do

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.170
something serious and have
his and my name on it.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:24.110
It'd be like, a dead-serious
biopic brought to you by the

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.980
funniest tall redhead
ever created.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.900
MALE SPEAKER: Well isn't John
Stewart actually now directing

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:29.870
something serious?

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.040
Maybe he's leading the charge.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.419
NICK OFFERMAN: Maybe.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:34.299
Maybe we'll--

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:34.830
who knows.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.760
I mean, it's something
we talk about a lot.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.490
I don't know if it'll
come to pass.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.789
There's a lot of roles
like that.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:46.990
There's this great character,
Ernest Shackleton, who Kenneth

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.480
Branagh beat me to.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.880
But maybe that'll fade from
memory soon enough that I can

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.440
take him on.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:02.060
He led an incredible South Pole
expedition in the very

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.900
early 20th century or
late 19th century.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.920
There's a lot of roles
like that.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.050
I'm not particularly
ambitious.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:16.320
I like seeing what comes
down the pike.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.530
MALE SPEAKER: It sounds like
"Somebody Up There Likes Me"

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.550
is something that booked
because you were asked.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.200
And actually, the genesis for
it started out here, right,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.980
just kind of outside of
this building, almost.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.960
NICK OFFERMAN: Well, yeah.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.200
The last time actually I was the
lead in the film was this

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:37.000
movie called "Treasure Island."
It's set in 1943, and

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.880
it's based when it was
a naval base out

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.990
there on Treasure Island.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.300
And the movie looks like it was
made in the early '40s.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.030
We shot it actually on a period

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.050
camera called a Mitchell.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:56.440
The filmmaker was a very
wonderfully weird old timey

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.780
meticulous filmmaker.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.060
And it's a delightfully
difficult film.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:07.750
It's like if David Lynch
made a film in 1941.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:12.190
There's a lot of kickass
sex in the movie.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.570
But we should we shot a scene
right out by the fire

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.090
department down there
on the water.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.430
There's like a piece
of decrepit pier.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.210
We shoot a pivotal scene with
the Bay Bridge in the

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:21.870
background.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.610
And we got them to turn their
lights on in the middle of the

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.250
scene, which was very
exciting for us.

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:34.040
It was one of my most Michael
Bay moments I've had to date.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.200
MALE SPEAKER: And then that led
to a friendship that then

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.380
evolved into him
asking you to--

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.690
NICK OFFERMAN: Yeah, Bob
Byington, this filmmaker who

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.870
wrote and directed "Somebody
Up There Likes Me" was the

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.560
script girl on "Treasure
Island," and

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.350
that's where we met.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.710
And we liked the cut of
one another's jib.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:54.020
His writing is really smart and
funny, and he has a great

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.600
dry sense of humor.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.550
So he kind of kept me around.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.390
Every couple years, I would fly
myself to Austin and do a

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.170
couple scenes in his movies.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.240
He finally wrote me a nice big
part, and then asked me to

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.590
produce it.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.770
MALE SPEAKER: And that's
coming out--

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.420
well, it's already come out,
but it's being premiered

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.670
tomorrow in San Francisco.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.920
NICK OFFERMAN: Yeah.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.300
We're having a big event.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.890
I'm going to be at all the

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.270
screenings at the Roxy tomorrow.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.580
And I believe I'm giving away an
Offerman Woodshop mustache

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:27.440
comb at each of three Q&amp;As.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.920
MALE SPEAKER: And speaking of
woodworking, as long as you

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.420
went there, oftentimes I think
you come up, you said, to

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.980
northern California to pillage
our wood and bring it down to

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.100
turn into whatever catches
your fancy.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.790
As you've evolved and have your
own woodworking shop,

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:48.020
where does chainsaw sculpture
fall in the pantheon?

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.350
Is that one you think
you might tackle?

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:50.710
NICK OFFERMAN: No.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.670
Never.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:58.670
I have a few very large
chainsaws that I love to use.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.760
But I don't--

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.920
there's actually a few small
tools known as power carvers

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.770
that are like a little right
angle grinder, but they have a

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.790
little circular chainsaw
head on them.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:17.570
And carving with a machine--

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.180
I'm not much of a carver
to begin with.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:24.090
But carving with a machine
doesn't appeal to me.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.760
If I was ever going to try
carving, I would do--

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.790
I mean, what little carving I've
done, I do with gouges,

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.620
and I do it by hand.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.700
MALE SPEAKER: And do you have
something that you eventually

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.310
are going to be working towards,
your Rachmaninoff

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.750
three that your big--

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.150
NICK OFFERMAN: Woodworking is
something I love doing and I

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:47.880
hope to continue to improve at
for the rest of my life.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.500
I don't have--

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:55.230
I suppose a pipe dream would
be to build maybe a wooden

00:12:55.230 --> 00:13:00.460
sailboat before I'm done,
but nothing too big.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:04.870
I don't want to ruin
my marriage.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:08.320
But right now, we're getting
ready to build some ukuleles

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.180
in the shop.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.580
And that's--

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.730
we love the ukulele, but it's
also with an eye towards

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.720
trying some acoustic guitars.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.920
If we get any good at that,
maybe we'll try some other

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.840
instruments.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.710
I have the luxury of--

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:29.840
because I have a nice waitress
job during the daytime, I

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.580
don't have to make kitchens for
people with my shop, and I

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.530
can kind of pick and choose
what I want to make.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.770
So I want to try some stringed
instruments.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.580
I always hope to build
more boats.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.510
Those are incredibly
satisfying.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.880
But who knows.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.580
Maybe a grand piano one day.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.280
We'll see.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.020
MALE SPEAKER: Well, if folks
want to start lining up in

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.410
front of the mic to ask any
questions, please do.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.840
But I wanted to talk a little
bit about your writing with

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.640
"Parks and Rec" and
how that evolved.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.380
Was it something that you have
been asking for, you wanted to

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.910
kind of try it out?

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.940
Or did it just come to be?

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.280
NICK OFFERMAN: I let my
boss know early on.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.570
I went in and said, I just want
to let you know that if

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.320
you ever have anything
more for me to do--

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.080
because I come from this theater
company in Chicago

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.150
where I generally would build
the set, and I would make the

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:26.056
props, with help.

00:14:26.056 --> 00:14:28.290
It's always a wonderful
collaboration, but I was the

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.450
technical director
of the company.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:31.570
I had all the tools.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:32.810
I was a makeup artist.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.740
I was a fight choreographer.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.320
And so when I get with a group
and we love making some sort

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.890
of entertainment together, and
they just want me to show up

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:46.940
and crack wise and then go back
to my trailer, it's not

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:47.550
how I'm trained.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.340
I'm like, well, I'm just
sitting in my trailer.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.100
Is there something else
I could be doing?

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.480
Can I sew buttons
on something?

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.480
So I told my boss early on
that, like, if there's

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.145
anything else I could do--

00:15:01.145 --> 00:15:03.080
and we love making each
other giggle.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.860
So a couple summers ago,
during the off

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.810
time, we had lunch.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.130
And he asked me if I wanted
to write an episode, and I

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:15.740
totally started crying in the
middle of this restaurant,

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.350
where I was like, yes, that
would be fine with me.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.610
NICK OFFERMAN: And I said of
course, I would love to.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:25.730
But why--

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.430
like, you can get
the greatest--

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.590
people really love our
show and hold it

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:34.260
at a very high level.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.430
You can get the greatest talent
to write an episode?

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.120
Why would you ask this guy?

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:45.960
And he said, because I don't
want to get somebody who wrote

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.490
a really funny movie.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.370
I love making the
show with us.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:52.290
And it sort of came from
the same vibe of just

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:56.780
collaborating as a group and
enjoying this lucky time where

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:01.170
we're allowed the freedom to
make the show how we want to.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.090
MALE SPEAKER: And making the
show by us, is that something

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.120
that's very much, during the
filming, there's a lot of

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.580
collaboration there in the way
which you actually shoot

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.950
scenes and try out dialogue?

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.020
How does that work?

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.910
NICK OFFERMAN: Well,
we're so spoiled.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:19.590
Because our writer's room is so
brilliant that none of us--

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:24.120
we could be really pretty lousy
actors and still come

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.790
out smelling like a
rose, because the

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:27.780
writing is just so good.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.460
They have that ability--

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.740
we get asked a lot of questions
in the sort of

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.100
bailiwick of, do you guys--

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.550
do you write everything
yourselves?

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.320
Or like, did you make
up everything

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.180
about Ron Swanson yourself?

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.900
Because it seems so much--

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.730
it seems to fit you
so naturally.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.430
And that's just what great
writers do, is they pick out

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:54.450
parts of your personality and
then writ it large as a sort

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:55.780
of cartoon.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.480
And they do it so well that
people are like, oh, Nick

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.250
obviously must have made
that up, because no one

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.080
could think of that.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.220
But in truth, they did
think of all of it.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.960
And so it is very
collaborative.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.619
We get on set, and we have
these beautiful scripts.

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:16.150
But then we're all goofballs
with our own skill set.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.230
And so Pratt is my favorite.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:27.230
He is such an amazing
combination of a boyish sort

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:31.190
of clumsy child,
combined with--

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.030
don't let him fool you.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:38.810
He is a fucking genius, when it
comes to coming out of left

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.060
field with improvisation,
nobody--

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.910
I mean, Amy is just
an amazing--

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.080
like, Amy is a corporation
all of her own.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.890
She's like a comedy factory.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.790
But Pratt's sitting over there
just waiting for the camera to

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:58.770
throw to him, and he floors
us with this cleverness so

00:17:58.770 --> 00:17:59.660
frequently.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:00.640
But everybody does.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.650
I mean, everybody has
their own flavor.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:06.370
And so that just-- when you
start with a great script and

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.640
then have all of these home run
hitters sort of throwing

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.440
in their additional ingredients,
it just makes it

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.980
for an incredibly fun
collaboration.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.310
MALE SPEAKER: And it sounds like
everyone trusts everyone

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.670
to step it up.

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:22.500
And because it's so fun, just
dive in with the best of what

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:22.870
they've got.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:23.320
NICK OFFERMAN: It is, yeah.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.720
It's a very safe environment.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:30.400
Greg Daniels sort of learned
this system on the American

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:36.720
"Office," RIP.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.720
My life was completely
changed by that show.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.300
And he created this paradigm
wherein when we started our

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.850
show on the very first
day, he said, this is

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.490
very important, everybody.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.060
If you ever feel like you want
to do anything or say

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.720
anything, you can.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.910
You have permission.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.810
We're no longer shooting
on film.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:00.850
We can shoot all day.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:02.710
We don't have to cut
the cameras.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.690
So if you feel like getting up
and going over there and

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:08.810
making a sandwich, you can, as
long as it's natural and it

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.460
feels like it's part
of the scene.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.390
And so the first couple episodes
then, of course, have

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:18.400
just hours of masturbation,
where I was like, well, Greg

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.510
said it would be cool if
I go over here and

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:24.240
take my pants off.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.070
And then the edits started to
come in, and we're shooting

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.900
hours and hours of footage for
a 21 and 1/2 minute episode.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:37.850
And so we quickly learned,
like, OK, maybe that's a

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:38.810
little indulgent.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.680
MALE SPEAKER: How to make
friends with the editors.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.820
NICK OFFERMAN: Exactly.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.320
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:43.840
Welcome.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.130
NICK OFFERMAN: Hello.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.340
Thank you.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:45.970
AUDIENCE: I had a question.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.550
You mentioned the writers kind
of pick up on aspects of your

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:51.440
personality to build the
Ron Swanson character.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.240
And you yourself just a moment
ago said you were really

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.790
interested in Teddy Roosevelt
and Ernest Shackleton

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:00.020
quote-unquote rugged
individualists.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.980
And I think Ron Swanson
falls into kind of a

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:02.940
subcategory of that.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:07.070
And I'm wondering what draws
you to those characters?

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.700
NICK OFFERMAN: Gosh,
I don't know.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:14.540
I grew up in a farm family
in Illinois, and they're

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.610
certainly rugged
individualists.

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:22.600
I grew up in the '70s, and
we were not doing great.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.100
And so there was a lot of
pulling ourselves up by our

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.180
own bootstraps and flying by
the seat of our pants.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.150
And then we get into a more
sort of middle class

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:38.850
existence, and then sort of got
swept up with the rest of

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:43.070
a lot of our society into an
incredibly comfortable world.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:47.520
And I think that I just
personally long for--

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.570
I would rather not be inside
in the air conditioning.

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:54.280
I would much rather be in a
canoe on a river, even if

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.140
there are mosquitoes, or even
if it is a little scary.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.710
That just feels more alive.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:07.870
And in the career that my tool
set led me on, I never

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.860
imagined that I would
become a performer.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.620
Going into the arts was unheard
of in my little farm

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:20.850
town, but inexplicably, I
managed to do it anyway.

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:24.120
And that was necessitated
being in an urban area.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.950
I went into theater, so you
had to be someplace where

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.450
there's an audience.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:33.450
And so as I've lived in cities,
I always yearned for

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.620
the sort of canoe of my youth.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.510
And I think that's a
lot of what led me

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.340
to maintain my woodshop.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.580
It makes me feel like I can
still hold my head up around

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.950
the farmers in my family
who are so badass.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:50.020
I mean, when people ask me,
like, if I'm manly or what do

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.580
I think about manliness,
I say, I'm

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.590
the sissy in my family.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:58.150
I'm the one that went and
took ballet in college.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.650
Go talk to my uncles, who are
still welding their own corn

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.850
wagons out of scraps
around the shop.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:10.970
And so I think in the world of
what I do for a living, I like

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:12.070
to choose things--

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:15.040
I would much rather go shoot
something where I'm playing a

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.150
lumberjack and I'm getting
to spend a few

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:18.850
months out in the woods.

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:23.580
Even though I'm going to work,
it's much more delicious to me

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.860
than working in a sound stage.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.160
And you know, the place
that our country is in

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.530
right now, I often--

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.630
whenever I get riled up,
certainly during election

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.010
years, and I want to do
something or I want to make a

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:43.960
difference, I always have to
say, well, the thing I can do

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.340
I think the most effectively is
reach the audience that I

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.480
already have in place.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.990
And so I try to choose subject
matters and characters and

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:56.410
stories that I think can have
a positive influence.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:01.180
In my "American Ham" show, I
talk a lot about encouraging

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.640
people to be more of a
rugged individualist.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.420
Even if you live in the city,
you can now become a

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.280
blacksmith on your back porch.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.170
Or you can set up a knitting
business and

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:16.640
sell things on Etsy.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.780
And I feel like that is the kind
of thing that's going to

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:24.520
help us keep from being squashed
by China, if we're

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.320
going to succeed
in doing that.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:28.780
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.100
NICK OFFERMAN: You bet.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.440
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.490
I love the show.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:35.740
One of my favorite parts
of "Parks and Rec"

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.860
is the Jerry jokes.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.960
And I was wondering how Jim
O'Heir is in real life.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.940
NICK OFFERMAN: I don't
talk about Jerry.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.310
NICK OFFERMAN: No, go ahead.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.520
AUDIENCE: I was just curious.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.590
Are those jokes written in
the script, or does it

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.960
just kind of happen?

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.940
NICK OFFERMAN: No, actually.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.930
We secretly hate him.

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:03.880
No, Jim O'Heir is the sweetest,
the greatest guy.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:11.270
He's in his early 50s
or his late 40s.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:15.990
And he's worked steadily as
just a character actor.

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:19.450
And for a guy like me or Jim
who's been in town, been in

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:23.900
the business for so long, to
land a spot on a show like

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:29.120
this, you could literally punch
me in the balls every

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.960
scene, and I'd be like,
I don't care.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.210
I'm so happy that I'm
on a show this good.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.770
You can have my testicles.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.230
It's worth it.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.530
And Jim talks a lot about
that, that he's

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.120
like, are you kidding?

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.310
I've got such a great part
on this funny show.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:51.410
But we do have to be careful,
the rest of us, not to let it

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:52.300
bleed over.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:57.530
Because it's so delicious, the
whole shitting on Jerry, like

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:01.560
Jerry as the Eeyore
of the group.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.420
We do have to remind
ourselves.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.540
And I'll send him random
texts, that I'm

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:07.620
just like, hey Jim.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:08.300
It's Nick.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.390
I just want to tell you
I really love you.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.330
I think you're great.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:19.210
Because otherwise, it's so
delicious and it so naughty

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.850
that we start--

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:26.030
There's a story coming up.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:29.640
It's hardly a spoiler
to say some bad

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.490
things happen to Jerry.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:32.970
Jerry gets some bad news.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:35.380
And we played this gag on him.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:39.630
Like, the producers and
everybody, we all just started

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:44.920
pretending that he was being
killed off the show.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.330
And we started sending him
messages of like, hey Jim.

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:52.440
I have to tell you, I've
loved working with you.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.460
I really think we
had a great run.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.550
I hope you'll come back and
visit us next year.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:05.170
And then we're like, OK, you
guys, we can't be mean to Jim

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:08.010
like he's Jerry.

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.800
He takes it all in stride and we
all have a lot of fun, but

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.180
we do have to be careful.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.170
Because he's the sweetest--

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:20.330
he's an amazing wonderful nice
guy, which, that engenders

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:21.220
that sense of humor.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.250
I mean, when I meet people and
they're incredibly nice and

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:27.640
soft-spoken and shy, it makes
me immediately want to be

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.980
shitty to them, in
a funny way.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.900
And I let them know that it's my
way of saying I like them.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.190
But I'm like, hey,
keep it down.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:37.790
Would you shut up please?

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:40.090
You're disrupting the room--

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.550
to the shy, retiring person.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:44.030
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:46.770
NICK OFFERMAN: You bet.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:46.882
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:26:46.882 --> 00:26:49.140
I recently bought tickets to
Sasquatch and noticed that you

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.630
were on the bill for that, and
was curious how you prepare

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.685
for an audience or a setting
like that, or if you've ever

00:26:53.685 --> 00:26:56.690
done any big festival-ish
kind of shows before.

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:00.020
NICK OFFERMAN: I've done my
show in a couple comedy

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.750
festivals in Austin last
year, and in Chicago.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.360
But they were still just
me in a theater.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.980
And so it was no different,
really, other than maybe a

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.125
slightly more drunk audience
than usual.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:19.430
I'm a little curious myself,
because a couple friends of

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.800
mine are also doing it
that are stand-ups.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.810
And they said that I'm going
to be in a comedy tent.

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:27.230
And I'm just envisioning--

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.410
I'm very excited to
see the Gorge.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:33.080
It's supposed to be the most
beautiful outdoor music venue

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.490
in Washington.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:35.110
Is it in--

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.455
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:35.455 --> 00:27:37.140
It's outside Seattle, like
an hour and a half east.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:37.680
NICK OFFERMAN: Yeah.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.120
It's over the mountains.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.050
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.820
NICK OFFERMAN: And I'm a little
nervous about being in

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.420
an outdoor comedy tent.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:48.835
I'm envisioning hearing Cypress
Hill playing a couple

00:27:48.835 --> 00:27:50.960
hundred yards away.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.860
And my show is kind
of thoughtful.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.790
It's funny, but it's like, OK,
we're going to talk about some

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:58.910
serious shit.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:03.390
And I think I depend
on silence.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:07.870
So I'm going to be putting some
thought into upping the

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.526
energy, like, what's
up, everybody?

00:28:09.526 --> 00:28:11.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.860
NICK OFFERMAN: So your guess
is as good as mine.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.980
I heard from some people--

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.440
is it true that you can only
buy the whole pass to that

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.370
thing, and it's like $400?

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:23.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.310
They used to sell single day
back a while ago, but now you

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:27.270
have to buy a four-day pass.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.260
NICK OFFERMAN: That's
terrible.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:28.900
AUDIENCE: That's how
all the festivals

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.530
are going these days.

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:32.100
NICK OFFERMAN: I'm new
to the whole thing.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:37.460
I mean, I went to Lollapalooza
in '96, I think.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:38.480
It was fucking awesome.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.060
NICK OFFERMAN: Chili Peppers
were the big headliner.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.740
AUDIENCE: Do you plan on being
there for the whole weekend

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:45.933
and seeing some acts,
or are you just

00:28:45.933 --> 00:28:47.000
going to do your show?

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.900
NICK OFFERMAN: I just wanted one
day-- oh, for Sasquatch?

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:49.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:50.180
Are you just going to
be there for your--

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.120
NICK OFFERMAN: My wife
and I are doing

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.570
a play in Los Angeles.

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:56.540
We had booked Sasquatch
before then.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.650
So we're keeping the booking,
but it's the kind of thing

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:00.790
where we're going to have to fly
in and do the day and then

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:03.020
leave, unfortunately.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.410
So we will do peyote
while we're there.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:07.700
AUDIENCE: That's encouraged.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.000
NICK OFFERMAN: I'd like to do
the full three day, the whole

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:10.910
vision quest.

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.050
NICK OFFERMAN: Maybe
next year.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:14.760
MALE SPEAKER: I think
we've got time

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.510
for two more questions.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:19.790
AUDIENCE: I was wondering, how
does your Midwest background

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.990
influence your time on
"Parks and Rec"?

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:26.440
Was that the dream casting for
you, or do you throw some

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.700
Midwest-isms in there?

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.480
NICK OFFERMAN: Interestingly,
I think it has a profound

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:38.380
influence that is subliminal.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:42.850
It's not something that
I'm cognitive of.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.040
It's what got me the
part, probably.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:46.980
It's funny, though.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.640
When I read the script and they
started talking to me

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.640
about the role, I showed up in
jeans and a flannel shirt.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.880
And I had pictured a guy-- they
were like, this guy runs

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.120
the parks department.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.810
I was like, fantastic.

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:03.450
I drive a dark green pickup
truck and I wear work boots

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:04.810
and I use a shovel.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:08.590
And they're like, oh,
no it's a city.

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:09.730
It's a small city.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:14.390
So you wear shitty clothes from
JC Penney, and you work

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:15.480
at City Hall.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.330
And I was like oh, wow.

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:20.160
OK.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.260
I guess I'll be cool
with that.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:31.430
So I think just by using my
natural Illinois demeanor, it

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:34.500
seems to be working
out effectively.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.720
But I don't really--

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.840
I mean, we talk about things.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.460
I pitched the scouting
episode were Leslie

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.570
and I each had scouts.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:47.790
And the basketball team with
the pyramid of greatness,

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:52.150
those both came from
me saying--

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:55.120
and it literally is this simple,
where I'm like, can I

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.690
please have a troop of scouts?

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:02.420
I take things from my youth
that I think it

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:03.410
could provide comedy.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:06.620
Or, can I please coach
a group of boys in

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.330
basketball or baseball?

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:13.500
And then the writers take it,
and they always extrapolate my

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.200
simple idea into something
much more complex and

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.000
delicious that I could--

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.880
they always put a twist on it,
where I'm like, of course,

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.300
I'll be badass and I'll cook
steaks over a fire.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:26.990
And they're like, no, you'll
suck, and Leslie will have--

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:30.120
they always come up with a much
better twist on whatever

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.060
my initial thing is.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:37.610
But beyond that, I keep saying
there's a ridiculous--

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:41.780
the show is ridiculously
bereft of fishing.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:45.160
There needs to be a hell of a
lot more fishing on the show.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.780
But LA doesn't have a lot of
great fishing locations that

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.610
can pass for Indiana.

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:53.080
So hopefully we'll remedy
that in the near future.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.920
MALE SPEAKER: So they do turn
to you for kind of a Midwest

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.210
gut check sometimes?

00:31:56.210 --> 00:32:00.010
NICK OFFERMAN: Some, but one of
our main producers, Morgan

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:01.540
Sackett, is from Iowa.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.805
There's enough of a Midwestern
sensibility.

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:09.630
It's not cloaked information.

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:13.390
People have a pretty good
idea of what's going on.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:14.880
But they will say--

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.860
things come up, like do you
guys say soda or pop?

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:21.570
Or just stuff like that, and
you find that that's

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:24.880
incredibly regional anyway.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.600
People from Muncie will complain
if you say it like

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.590
people from Indianapolis.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:34.660
You're screwed no matter
what you do.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.390
AUDIENCE: So we've got a bottle
of Lagavulin here.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:37.580
Can we interest you
in a drink?

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:38.810
NICK OFFERMAN: Christ
almighty.

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:43.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.350
NICK OFFERMAN: I will not allow
this occasion to go by

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:51.280
without imbibing, but I'll make
it a small drink, because

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.850
I have to keep my wits
about me for

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:57.750
3,000 people this evening.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:58.760
By all means.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.405
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:01.405 --> 00:33:03.065
MALE SPEAKER: Actually,
on that note--

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:08.340
NICK OFFERMAN: I see three
glasses, and I see a great

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.200
many people.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:13.144
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:13.144 --> 00:33:16.590
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, the
keg's in the back.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:20.190
We also have some parting
gifts that--

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:21.150
NICK OFFERMAN: Goddamn.

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:22.290
Google's all right.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:23.526
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:23.526 --> 00:33:24.970
NICK OFFERMAN: You guys
should stick around.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:25.930
I think you're going places.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:29.300
MALE SPEAKER: We hope it can
inspire you if you have any

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.560
downtime and need to--

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.730
NICK OFFERMAN: That could
have been really ugly.

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:34.230
MALE SPEAKER: This is
a wooden carved

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:36.660
Android, and one for Megan.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.520
NICK OFFERMAN: Thank
you so much.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.940
She's going to love that.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.980
And I love it too.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.350
I love cute things.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:47.040
Thank you.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.280
That's a beautiful amount.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.270
When I showed up, the first
time Ron had scotch on the

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:56.270
show, there was a bottle of
Lagavulin sitting on my desk.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:59.510
And I said, these people are
so goddamn good, they found

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.050
out what my favorite
scotch is.

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:04.300
Because it was a little
more obscure four and

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.630
a half years ago.

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:08.940
And a year later at Mike
Schur's birthday party,

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:10.850
somebody brought him
a bottle of it.

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:13.070
And I said, oh, great gift.

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.429
Ron's drinking Lagavulin
because

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:19.699
that's my favorite scotch.

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:21.719
And he said, no, you idiot.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:22.760
That's his favorite
scotch because

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.770
it's my favorite scotch.

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:26.630
NICK OFFERMAN: Which was
a delicious piece of

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.300
serendipity.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.657
To comedy.

00:34:29.657 --> 00:34:35.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:38.800
MALE SPEAKER: Once again, on
behalf of Google and the San

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.460
Francisco office, thanks
so much for coming by.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:44.340
It's my absolute pleasure.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.596
Thank you so much
for having me.

00:34:45.596 --> 00:34:47.580

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.470

some other shit now.
