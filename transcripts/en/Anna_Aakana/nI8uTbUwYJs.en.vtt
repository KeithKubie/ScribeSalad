00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
There are definitely some things that are bad.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.940
Did you read that article that came out today that said you should only eat six fries?

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.780
What? 
Are they delusional?

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.340
Who can only eat six fries?

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.940
I don't know, that's what the article said.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.000
Like over the course of my life or in one sitting?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.360
I mean what if I eat six fries every hour?

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.100
I don't know.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.220
Okay, but like what are the time parameters for six fries?

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.400
I mean six seconds? Months? Years?

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.080
I don't know, maybe read the article?

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.260
Okay, but you read the article and have now ruined my life

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.900
so I would like some elaborate answers beyond: 
"don't eat more than six fries."

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.880
[Sighs]
This is why you have no friends.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.760
I'm alone.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.880
I mean one thing we've been sort of trained to believe is that negative emotions are bad.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.240
Jealousy,  insecurity, doubt, paranoia.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.380
I mean the list goes on and on.
The positivity movement especially has this

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.520
mentality that you should cast aside these emotions in favor of the happy ones.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.680
Sort of like fake it to make it but feel it 
to...

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.940
make real it.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.220
Which I don't think works long term because then you sort of become detached

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.020
and disconnected with your emotions by just constantly dismissing them.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.880
All right everyone! After some recent discussions internally

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.220
we've decided to fire you all!

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.600
From now on it's all joy!

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.100
[All ARGUING]

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.560
You can't just fire us we live inside of you!
[Arguing]

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.580
Pack your shit and leave,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.720
Bye!

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.680
Then there's also the view that you need to sit with your emotions, right?

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.180
The idea of:

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.340
acceptance of negative feelings in order to let them pass through you.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.720
But I've found that when I do this I just get stuck in the bad feeling

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.980
and just ruminate because I'm allowing that emotion to take over my life.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.940
It's gonna be a terrible day.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.540
It's gonna be a terrible meal.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.480
HE'S GONNA DIE SOMEDAY
 AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE DEVASTATED!

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.920
And now I have found a brilliant technique that has helped me so much.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.200
Now bear with me because I know it's gonna sound a little cheesy,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.220
but if you're someone who deals with a lot of anxiety or insecurity or emotional pain of any kind

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.900
I urge you to have an open mind and try it.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.680
So, when you feel a negative emotion, let's say

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.740
insecurity.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.120
I want you to first think of what that emotion would look like,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.280
a physical representation of it.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.320
So for me,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.700
my insecurity would look like a jagged crystal formation.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.460
And once that image is really clear

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.820
I want you to mentally take that physicalized emotion from your body

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.580
and hold it in front of you and ask it:

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.700
Why are you here?

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.900
Because every feeling you have is actually trying to help you.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.620
It's trying to let you know something.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.000
I mean, that's why you feel it.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.740
It's this physical cue that shouldn't be just

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.800
ignored or blindly accepted but understood.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.780
OK. So what's up? What are you trying to tell me?

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.100
I don't want you to get hurt.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.920
What? Why would I get hurt?

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.720
Well you were at this party and everyone here is really cool and you like them a lot,

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.900
But what if they don't like you as much as you like them?

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.900
What if they think you're lame?

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.900
I just want to make sure that you're safe and you're loved

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.100
and that no one hurts you.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.640
Are you still with me? And isn't my crystal voice just like super adorable?

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.920
But seriously,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.760
literally every emotion you feel is trying to do something for you.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.400
Whether it's your anger trying to protect you,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.320
your anxiety wanting to motivate you to do better,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.820
or your feelings of unworthiness wanting to make sure that you get the love you deserve.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.300
You need to think of negative emotions as misunderstood,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.100
and then, once you really know why it's there, the next step

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.120
is to think of what you would rather feel.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.700
So for me, when I understand that my insecurity is trying to keep me safe from getting hurt,

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.980
I would think, "Hmm, well I would rather feel vulnerable.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.620
I'd rather feel like I can put myself out there

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.220
and take a risk and know that I'm enough just as I am."

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.760
And, once I have that feeling I make it a physical object as well.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.689
Pull it out of my body mentally and I merge the two together.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.339
So once you merge these two together, it becomes a new object and then, still in your head here,

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.570
you will put the new object back in your body and carry on.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.220
Now, I can feel your judgment through the screen.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.580
Like I feel it and I know some of you are like rolling your eyes and be like,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.480
"Oh my god, Anna so New Age LA now," and I want you to ask yourself,

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.800
why do you feel judgmental?

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.000
How is it trying to serve you and what does it look like? And I know this may not be for everyone but

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.149
it's literally come in handy so much of my life that I did want to share it, because now I understand that

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.380
every negative emotion is trying to do something for me.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.780
Instead of just pushing it away or succumbing to it,

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.120
I can now transform it into something that helps make my existence more bearable.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.200
If anything, I hope that this helps you in some way because,

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.940
you know, life can be really hard sometimes and I'm-

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:30.029
I'm really tired of being the person who makes me feel the worst. So I'm working on it. I'm Anna Akana, stay awesome Gotham!
