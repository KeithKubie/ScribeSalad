Here's our square with a few slider controls. I can scale the polygon to be

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.810
larger in either dimension. The texture stretches to fit. What's more

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.550
interesting is what happens when I change the u or v values. Here I'm changing

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.403
the u value of the two points on the right edge. The value starts at one. If I

00:00:16.403 --> 00:00:19.667
increase the value, this has the effect of putting more copies of the texture

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:25.162
along that axis. Let's switch to the mosaic texture. If I decrease the value of

00:00:25.162 --> 00:00:30.980
v, less of a texture is mapped to the square. I can do the same thing with u.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.432
This is how mosaicing works. Each triangle is given some fractional u and v

00:00:34.432 --> 00:00:38.864
values that select the piece of the texture needed. Give this demo a try and

00:00:38.864 --> 00:00:42.050
get a sense of how the values affect the rectangle and texture.
