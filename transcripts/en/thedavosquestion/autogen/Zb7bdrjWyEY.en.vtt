role models are very important for the

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230
role models are very important for the
 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.740
role models are very important for the
region especially in the area of

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750
region especially in the area of
 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.980
region especially in the area of
environment because the Middle East is

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990
environment because the Middle East is
 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.830
environment because the Middle East is
really suffering from very big

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840
really suffering from very big
 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.799
really suffering from very big
environmental problems especially the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809
environmental problems especially the
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.170
environmental problems especially the
contribution to global climate change

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180
contribution to global climate change
 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.220
contribution to global climate change
from the region is quite important so we

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
from the region is quite important so we
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.800
from the region is quite important so we
need role models that are basically

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810
need role models that are basically
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.259
need role models that are basically
advocating for the environment working

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269
advocating for the environment working
 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.070
advocating for the environment working
for the conservation of our marine

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080
for the conservation of our marine
 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.030
for the conservation of our marine
resources as well as our water resources

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040
resources as well as our water resources
 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.400
resources as well as our water resources
pollution is a big problem and the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410
pollution is a big problem and the
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.650
pollution is a big problem and the
certification as a result of climate

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
certification as a result of climate
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.940
certification as a result of climate
change is going to cause big drastic

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950
change is going to cause big drastic
 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.549
change is going to cause big drastic
problems for the future so we need to

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559
problems for the future so we need to
 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.260
problems for the future so we need to
take responsibility and we need to act

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
take responsibility and we need to act
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.569
take responsibility and we need to act
for this and role models are the ones

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579
for this and role models are the ones
 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.049
for this and role models are the ones
who can show us how we can act what we

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
who can show us how we can act what we
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.240
who can show us how we can act what we
can do in order to protect our

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250
can do in order to protect our
