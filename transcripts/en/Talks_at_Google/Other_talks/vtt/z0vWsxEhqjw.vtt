CHRIS WALLEN: Hey, everyone.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.910
Thanks for coming.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.910
My name is Chris Wallen.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.360
I'm an engineer here at Google.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.500
I work on the Maps team.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.690
I'm hosting today Walter Voit.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.670
We went to the
University of Texas

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.370
at Dallas together, got
our undergraduate degree

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.970
in computer science and
studied machine learning.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.470
Then Walter went
off to Georgia Tech

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:30.220
to get his PhD in material
science and engineering.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.099
And he's going to tell us a
little bit about this nerve tag

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:34.640
technology that he's
been working on.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.510
So I present Walter Voit.

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:42.350
WALTER VOIT: It's a
pleasure to be here

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.510
at Google this afternoon,
or at Alphabet.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.110
I don't know what
to say these days.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.900
But if it is
Alphabet, maybe this

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.770
will be an alphabet that you
guys can make in the future.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.462
But what I'd like to talk about
is a lot of the collected work

00:00:57.462 --> 00:00:59.420
that we've been doing
over the last half decade

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.610
or so in the area of implantable
bioelectronic medicines.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.340
But it's this idea that we
can build computer chips

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.380
onto plastics, we can put
them in the nervous system,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.350
and we can record, block, or
stimulate arbitrary nerves

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.100
in the peripheral or in
the central nervous system

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.880
and build closed loop feedback
systems with smart computers,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.910
with smart beds,
with smart doctors

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.850
to help understand
the connectome,

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.930
understand the body's
nervous system,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.930
and ultimately
treat debilitating

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.429
neurological conditions.

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:33.970
A lot of the work
that I present here

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.690
has been funded by some generous
grants from DARPA, the Defense

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.430
Advanced Research
Projects Agency,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.930
by Glaxo SmithKline, the
British pharmaceutical giant,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.790
and by the NIH and the NSF
and a host of other companies.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.310
I'm also going to spend a few
minutes at the end of the talk

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.310
and mention some of the
different companies that

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.220
have spun out of my research
lab over the last half decade

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.360
or so.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.170
And so we'll get to
those a little bit later.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.680
There's a picture of me with
some of my DARPA colleagues

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.280
at West Point sitting
on an Abrams tank.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.419
And here's a shot of
some of our group.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.562
And so I don't want to run
out of time at the end,

00:02:10.562 --> 00:02:12.790
a quick shout out to my lab.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.140
I've got about 12 postdocs
now and 12 graduate students

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.380
and about 50 undergraduates
at the university that

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.090
do a lot of the
heavy lifting day

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.810
to day, which ranges from
synthetic organic chemistry

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.710
to mechanical testing to
physics and interfaces

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.390
to electrical engineering
to applied neuroscience.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.750
And so these students from
many different disciplines

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.490
are all working
together to solve

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.150
some of these grand challenges
in synthetic biology

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.270
and neuroscience, but from a
strong materials background.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.880
So I wanted to start with
some slides from my colleague

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.730
Kris Famm, who's the Vice
President of Bioelectronics

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.310
Research at Glaxo SmithKline.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.180
GSK, over the last couple
years, has made a giant bet

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.950
in the field of
bioelectronic medicines.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.800
It's also called
electroceuticals or Pharma 2.0.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.610
But it's this idea that we
can use electrical signals

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.480
to modulate the body's behavior.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.330
So today, if you look
at how a lot of drugs

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.180
and pharmaceuticals work,
you're using small molecules

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.410
to really affect what
the body is doing.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.660
But the idea here is that we
can use closed loop feedback

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.010
systems with
miniaturized electronic

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.060
or magnetic or photonic
devices to begin

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.550
interacting with the body.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.140
And so it's a very
different paradigm

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.140
from using small molecules.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.790
Small molecule drugs are sort
of like giving someone a fish.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.880
You're giving the body
something that it needs.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.325
For a short period of time
it reacts to that drug,

00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:42.600
and in a lot of cases, then,
that drug leaves the system,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.650
and people need more drugs.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.310
Well, if we can get in and
control what the nervous system

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.120
is doing, we can teach
the body to overcome

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.150
some of these
debilitating deficits

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.720
and prevent the need for long
term drugs or supplement drugs

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.080
with being able to build
these closed loop feedback

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.530
systems with the nervous system.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.840
This ties into a lot of
really interesting research

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.870
areas today in
neuroscience, including

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.680
the study of plasticity,
or the brain's ability

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.810
to rewire itself due
to certain stimuli.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.180
And we are trying to
build these devices that

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.750
can help affect how the brain
is rewiring itself in real time.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.470
The nervous system
is highly complex,

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.140
and so I'm not
going to belabor you

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.930
with really any of the details.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.820
But we put up this
slide just to show

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.240
that there are a tremendous
number of peripheral targets

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.700
that have very large end
effects on especially

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.220
what your gut, what
your viscera is doing,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.300
and all these
different touch points.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.210
We'd like to really change
the paradigm for how

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.020
we're interacting with
the nervous system.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.180
Today, devices like cochlear
implants and pacemakers

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.390
give you one to 22 channels
of information exchange

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.860
with the nervous system.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.900
And I think the future, the
future that Google will likely

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.870
be a very big part of,
is big data analytics

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.140
of the nervous system.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.980
It's these miniaturized
injectable devices

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.870
that can wrap around
arbitrary peripheral nerves.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.800
And instead of having
one touch point

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.610
of what the nervous
system is doing,

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.480
you'll have these
distributed touch points

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.480
that really tell you a
lot about the real time

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.130
status of a patient.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.760
When you go into
a hospital today,

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.830
you get your heart
rate measured.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.820
You're measuring all these
physiological symptoms.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.440
But the nervous system
is largely untouched.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.850
If you had little devices that
were inexpensive to implant

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.780
that could give you
real time performance

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.860
metrics for the
nervous system, it

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.350
would really change some of
the fundamental assumptions

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.850
and paradigms in the sick care
world in which we live today.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.170
And the goal of
this talk today was

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.110
to separate out
some of this vision

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.669
and some of the science fiction
from the reality of what

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.710
some of the leading
scientists across the country

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.320
are doing today, what some of
the leading medical providers

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.160
across the country
are doing today,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.260
and try to paint a
picture for you guys

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.490
about when the
appropriate time to put

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.680
your might on the software
and on the big data side

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.560
into this area might
be appropriate.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.850
And so if I succeed in
the talk, maybe you guys

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.860
can tell me when the right time
to get involved in this is,

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.670
and so that's the goal.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.160
So today, we've got a
host of individual systems

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.900
that can stimulate the vagus
nerve, that can stimulate

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.040
the cochlea, that can stimulate
the spine, that can solve sort

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.800
of one-off biomedical problems.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.490
But the goal is to have these
miniaturized devices that

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.350
can do that across the body.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.100
So our solution from UT
Dallas are these devices

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.490
called nerve tags.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.630
But we envision these to
be these needle-injectable

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.510
microelectronics
that will be smaller

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.205
than a grain of rice that
will be able to come and wrap

00:06:45.205 --> 00:06:48.160
around arbitrary
peripheral nerves

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.460
and block, record, and
stimulate on those nerves.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.070
And so our objective is to
make these very inexpensive

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.290
so that a surgery is not costing
you $25,000 to put in a device,

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.490
but that it would be feasible
in a hospital environment

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.020
to put in a large
number of these devices.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.480
What becomes really
interesting is

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.690
it begins to sync up the
business model of big pharma

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.330
with the semiconductor
companies that

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.070
will likely make this possible.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.450
If you look at a company
like Texas Instruments,

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.540
they're looking at products that
are largely nine months to four

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.680
years down the pipeline, whereas
GSK spends 25 years developing

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.730
a drug, only to recoup
costs in the last few years

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.350
when these big blockbuster
drugs are on patent.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.180
And moving to these
small, inexpensive devices

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.460
allows us to get high volumes,
to get semiconductor companies

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.830
really interested, to reduce
the non-recoverable engineering

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.600
costs that go into
designing these devices.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.499
And it also allows us to
leverage tremendous resources

00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:49.040
that have been put
into these devices

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.300
already that companies
like TI and Intel

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.000
have spent toward the
Internet of Things.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.180
So what we can do
right now-- and then

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.230
I'll move to some data
and some pictures--

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.070
so this is the kind of device
that we can build right now.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.930
This is a little
PCB we've designed,

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.340
where we've been able
to sort of flip chip

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.830
or solder on maybe 11 different
Texas Instruments components.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.390
I keep mentioning TI.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.880
We're in the heart of
Dallas, and so they

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.460
are the Google of Dallas,
if that makes sense,

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.510
I guess, that you guys
are to Mountain View.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.739
And we're increasingly
miniaturizing these devices

00:08:23.739 --> 00:08:25.280
to the point where
we hope these will

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.630
be needle-injectable and
easy to put into the body.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.830
So my background comes in
this class of materials

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.039
called shape memory polymers.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.090
And these polymers
are plastics that

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.970
can change shape and stiffness
at different temperatures.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:37.980
So these are plastics.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.589
You can see a video
of one of these.

00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:42.140
This is being inserted
into a warm environment

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.410
through a 100-micron slit.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.100
When it heats up, these
materials can change shape,

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.440
can change stiffness.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.410
So in this case, we're
self-coiling a matrix address

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:55.570
transistor array around
a two-millimeter cable.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.580
Here is one of
these materials sort

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.230
of in the flesh in real life.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.330
So it's a material that
behaves like Plexiglas

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.490
at room temperature.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:06.340
If I just put it in my hands and
heat it up to body temperature,

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.860
it gets 10,000 times
less stiff, and I

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.710
can bend it or manipulate
it into some sort

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.046
of metastable shape.

00:09:12.046 --> 00:09:13.420
And then as soon
as it cools off,

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.690
it gets very hard
again in this shape.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.450
So our big idea was, could
we take these plastics

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.210
while they're really hard,
insert them into the body,

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.640
and position microelectrodes
right up against and around

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.300
nerves, but then have
these guys soften

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.230
and get 10,000 times
less stiff chronically

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:34.350
to avoid long-term inflammation
and scarring responses

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:35.190
in the body?

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.790
And I'm happy to say that a
lot of the preliminary work

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.900
that we've done with some of
this Google funding-- we just

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.720
got a big Army grant as well
in this area to really study

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.270
the extent to which
softening affects

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.890
the neurological responss--
shows that these soft materials

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.180
have a lot of promise.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.780
We've built devices to
go around the spinal cord

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.800
into the cochlea on
the DRG, and then

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.990
a host of different nerves,
mainly in the viscera

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.500
and in the four limbs.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.010
So broadly, what we do is we
design these materials called

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.180
shape memory polymers.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.620
I'm a polymer chemist from my
PhD training at Georgia Tech.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.770
But then we use
photo orthography

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.930
to build flexible electronics
onto these materials.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.040
We do things like control
the charge injection capacity

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.050
so we can get a lot of current
out of very small areas

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.390
by nanostructuring materials
like titanium nitride.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.640
We build devices with low noise
so we can actually understand

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.030
what nerves are doing.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.830
And the goal is to really
enable this hypothesis-driven

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.310
neuroscience research.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.660
So right now we're
providing research tools

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.970
for collaborators back in
Dallas and across the country

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:43.670
to help map the connectome
and understand debilitating

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.420
neurological conditions.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.490
In the future, we
hope to translate

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.980
this to be a therapy in and
of itself to treat patients.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.270
So how these plastics
work-- I won't

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.540
get too deep into
the chemistry--

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.020
but a lot of
materials, if you look

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.020
at them as a function
of temperature,

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.980
are fairly stable in
terms of their modulus

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.080
or their stiffness.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.810
But if you've ever
taken a racquetball

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.590
and dunked it in liquid nitrogen
and thrown it against a wall,

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.690
or taken a banana and
gotten it really cold,

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.830
you can hit a nail into
a board with this banana.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.180
A lot of polymers, when
they get really cold,

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.540
get really hard and stiff.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.140
When they get really hot they
melt or they get very soft.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.120
We can control
that modulus change

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.390
within a five-degree
temperature window.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.300
So we have these materials that
are right at a transition that

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.856
get soft very, very quickly.

00:11:31.856 --> 00:11:33.480
What we've also found
out how to do is,

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.800
we can have that
softening be triggered

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.330
by the absorption of
small amounts of fluid,

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.290
not enough to disrupt
our electronics,

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:43.820
but enough to make the whole
substrate network very soft.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.930
So what you see here
is a device that's,

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.960
when it's dry in
the black line, it

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.600
has this little transition
between 40 and 50 degrees.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.620
And when it gets
wet, that transition

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.935
moves to between
20 and 40 degrees.

00:11:55.935 --> 00:11:57.310
Now that doesn't
look like a lot,

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.455
just a little blip
on some random curve

00:12:00.455 --> 00:12:02.580
from an instrument in the
lab called a differential

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.970
scanning calorimeter.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.280
But what this allows us
to do is give surgeons

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.590
five or six hours to implant
these devices while they're

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:14.810
as stiff as PEK, poly ether
ketone, or a polyamide,

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.300
or parylene c.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.190
And then once they get to
physiological conditions,

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.280
they'll get a soft as silicone
rubber, or in a lot of cases,

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.950
softer than silicone rubber.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.090
And we've found ways, now,
to build microelectronics

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.300
onto these plastics.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:33.120
So here's another little
video of one of these polymers

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.524
that's been trained to
coil around a nerve.

00:12:35.524 --> 00:12:37.940
So we're using a hair dryer
here to show the effect pretty

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.700
quickly.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.660
But you can imagine a surgeon
putting this in and getting it

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.840
to self-wrap around a nerve.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.590
In fact, in the bottom
right of the screen

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.020
there, or bottom
left on your side,

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.770
you can see one of our thin
film electronic devices

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.070
that's wrapping tightly
around the vagus nerve.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.370
That's a two-channel electrode.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.280
We spend a lot of time
studying the failure mechanics

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.800
at interfaces to make sure
these devices are going

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.610
to withstand the
aggressive, high deformation

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.030
environments in the body.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.400
So this is a tool that
we built that allows

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.760
us to compress these devices and
measure the radius of curvature

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.560
of the electrodes.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.140
In this case, we built
transistors both parallel

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.790
and perpendicular to
that bending stress.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.830
And we did that on the inside
and the outside of devices.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.650
We can measure
electrical performance,

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.190
but we can also do
microscopy and understand

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.970
what's happening to, in this
case, the gold electrode,

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:34.440
or in this case, the DNTT,
the [INAUDIBLE] which

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.290
is an organic semiconductor,
what the deformation

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.940
mechanics looked like, how
to design devices that aren't

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.760
going to fail when
they're subjected

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.710
to a lot of these
kinds of conditions.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.810
And at first, we do
that dry, and then we

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:49.180
do it in moist, aggressive
biological environments.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.320
So this is a typical
pattern of what

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.700
one of our photo lithographic
processes would look like.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.930
We've came up with
some clever technology

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.910
to sort of begin building
devices upside down,

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:03.200
and then we can transfer
those devices off

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.120
onto a polymer substrate.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.000
So it's sort of like
if you were to take

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.850
super glue and scotch tape.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.130
If you imagine taking
a piece of super glue

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.880
that's already hardened and
sticking scotch tape onto it,

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.900
you could pull that
tape off pretty easily.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.540
But if you started
with scotch tape

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.490
and actually cured the super
glue under the scotch tape,

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:21.720
it sticks a whole lot more.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.270
You have to scrape off that
scotch tape with a razor blade.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:27.630
Well, in the same way, if we
can use our polymers not just

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:30.150
as a material that we're
building electronics on,

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.500
but we can integrate that
polymerization into the gate

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.530
stack processing
of the device, we

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.710
can get a lot of the polar
groups in the polymer

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.770
to stick to thin film metals,
to stick to insulators,

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.910
and really give
us great coupling

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.730
through these thin film layers.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:49.390
So we'll build between 20- and
200-nanometer layers of gold.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.900
We'll sputter on nanostructured
titanium nitride,

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.840
and then use this
transfer process

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.270
to basically get really
good electronics built

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.192
at very small size scales.

00:15:00.192 --> 00:15:01.640
And if there are
questions later,

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.900
we can go into that
process in more detail.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.590
We've hit some of
the high points.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.230
Each of these steps involves
several different photo

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.469
lithographic steps
in the clean room.

00:15:10.469 --> 00:15:12.260
So some of the early
animal work we've done

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.430
lends a lot of credibility
to this softening hypothesis.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.430
In fact, the Chair of
Bioengineering at George Mason

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.470
University, we were
able to convince

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.250
him to move to UT Dallas
about two months ago

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.840
to continue to work with
us to really prove out

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.700
this hypothesis.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.840
But Joe and I got this big Army
grant just a month ago or so.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.910
What you see here is an
immunohistochemistry plot

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:37.130
of a cortical probe that
was put into a rat brain.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.800
We were able to record
350-microvolt signals

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.920
after 77 days, so almost three
months in that rat brain,

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.150
with these PEDOT electrodes.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.530
A PEDOT is a conductive polymer
that we put, in this case,

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.340
on top of our gold electrodes.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.790
Then what we did is we stained,
we sectioned the rat brain

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.050
and stained it for
different cell types.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.830
And what you'll notice is that
there's very little scarring

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.950
right around the device,
and we can clearly

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.610
see different cortical
regions, the different color

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.980
stripes that are unperturbed
with these devices.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.720
So we put these devices in
while they were really stiff,

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.250
and then after a couple
hours, they got really soft

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:19.040
and didn't lead to that same
kind of scarring response.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.640
We've had a number of
generations of these nerve tag

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.760
cuff electrodes.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.770
We've worked very closely with
the Romero Lab at UT Dallas.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.920
Mario Romero is
a close colleague

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.990
who does a lot of the
animal work with us.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:34.010
And he's put our devices onto
a host of different nerves

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.630
and measured
physiological responses.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.520
This is a study
of baseline noise

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.580
and spiking activity
in a hypoxic rat.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.250
So we're able to reduce
the amount of oxygen

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.680
that the rat is breathing
at a certain time,

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.090
and cause the rat to
then-- certain nerves

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.890
to fire a little bit more.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:55.070
We've done work with Rob
Butera's lab at Georgia Tech.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.290
And so here's a picture of one
of our shape memory polymer

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.880
devices as an upstream
stimulating electrode, and then

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.000
as a downstream
recording electrode.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.770
And so this is the
stimulus artifact

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:07.609
that we get on our
recording electrode.

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:09.715
And then this is that
sort of ionic signal

00:17:09.715 --> 00:17:11.839
that's moving through the
nerve a little bit later,

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:14.290
something called the
compound action potential.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:19.680
We can also measure just
random noise or random movement

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.540
as the animal's
breathing, and then we

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.200
can use spike
sorting and filtering

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.190
to understand what
nerves are doing

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.772
in their ambient environments.

00:17:26.772 --> 00:17:28.230
This is a lot of
work that was done

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.080
on the sciatic,
the cervical vagus,

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.760
and then we've done a lot of
work on the splanchnic nerve

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.950
as well.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.530
Working with Ken Yoshida's
lab at Indiana University

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.710
and Purdue University
in Indianapolis,

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:44.890
we're doing some neat work
on depositing our electrodes

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:49.100
onto tungsten microneedles that
we can thread interfascicularly

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.580
through very, very small nerves,
and we can use that, then,

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.989
to position electronics
very carefully.

00:17:54.989 --> 00:17:57.280
I haven't talked a lot about
how we get the signal out.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.130
The next part of the
talk will be here.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.890
The beginning is just sort
of how we get devices in

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.940
and how we're interfacing
photolithographically

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.510
defined structures with
the nervous system.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.602
I'll also come pass around
a couple little samples

00:18:10.602 --> 00:18:11.560
while I'm talking here.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.964
Maybe Rommel can come
show these around.

00:18:13.964 --> 00:18:16.130
But these are just some of
the device configurations

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:19.300
that we've put together.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.060
One of the things
that's coming around

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.850
is some of these plexus
blanket electrodes

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.490
that we're working on
with Jay Pasricha's lab.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:29.030
Jay is one of the leading
gastroenterologists

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:32.030
in the world working at
Johns Hopkins University.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.320
And he's done a lot studying
the guts and the stomach.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.560
And we're working
on devices for him

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.440
that can help manipulate signals
moving to and from these nerve

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.400
plexi and understand those.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.270
So these self-wrapping
coiling devices that

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.095
can fit around the stomach.

00:18:49.095 --> 00:18:52.240
We're doing some really neat
work in cochlear implants.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.600
So this is a project
that we're working on

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.480
with colleagues at
UT Southwestern,

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.670
specifically a
fellow named Ken Lee.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.540
And so what you're looking
at here, in the video that's

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.240
playing in the top left,
is a cochlear implant

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.000
from a company like Cochlear.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.990
As that's inserted
into a cochlea,

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.780
you can see how this hugs the
outer wall of the cochlea.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.090
Often, that causes a
traumatic insertion,

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.060
and you're scraping cells,
and doing a lot of damage

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.630
as that cochlear
implant is going in.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.760
Well, with the
self-coiling shape memory

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.090
polymer-based electrode,
what we can do

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.820
is we can time the recovery
force of that material.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.180
What you'll notice is that
we're never really touching

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.420
either of those walls as
we're inserting this device,

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.260
and so we can have these
modiolar-hugging self-wrapping

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.820
electrodes that can position our
high charge injection capacity

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:44.550
electrodes in the scala tympani,
this region in the cochlear,

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.750
up against the organ
of corti neurons

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.880
that allows us to do
better stimulation.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.020
What we can also do is build,
for instance, robotic insertion

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.720
devices that will help surgeons
time this implant correctly

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.710
so that we can coil several
turns into the cochlea.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:04.410
So why is this a problem?

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.260
Cochlear implants are
perhaps the most successful

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.620
medical device in the
history of the world.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.480
There are 200,000
working cochlear implants

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.010
in patients today.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.480
It's a $2 billion
a year industry

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.521
that's been around
for almost 30 years.

00:20:19.521 --> 00:20:20.895
So what I'm going
to play for you

00:20:20.895 --> 00:20:22.746
is some different
sounds of what sounds

00:20:22.746 --> 00:20:24.370
might sound like in
a cochlear implant.

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:28.209
So if you only had one electrode
working [CRACKLING SOUND]

00:20:28.209 --> 00:20:29.750
that's what a sound
would sound like.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:30.940
If you had two electrodes,

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.606
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:32.797
[STATIC]

00:20:32.797 --> 00:20:33.380
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.713
WALTER VOIT: You start to get
a little bit of definition

00:20:35.713 --> 00:20:38.290
in the sound, but it's still
hard to pick out what's what.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.824
At four different
discrete frequencies,

00:20:40.824 --> 00:20:41.700
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.866
-A boy fell from the window.

00:20:42.866 --> 00:20:43.710
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.086
WALTER VOIT: And then at eight.

00:20:45.086 --> 00:20:46.002
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:20:46.002 --> 00:20:47.168
-A boy fell from the window.

00:20:47.168 --> 00:20:47.840
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.800
WALTER VOIT: And then at 16.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.030
So this is where modern
cochlear implants sort of are.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:51.696
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:20:51.696 --> 00:20:53.010
-A boy fell from the window.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:53.290
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:54.910
WALTER VOIT: So you can
probably hear the sentence.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:56.660
It's a weird
sentence, I apologize.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.510
It has the right balance
of consonants and vowels,

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:02.280
apparently, to be
used as a sentence.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.281
And then at 32 channels.

00:21:03.281 --> 00:21:03.946
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:21:03.946 --> 00:21:05.120
-A boy fell from the window.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.030
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.403
WALTER VOIT: And then
the unfiltered signal.

00:21:07.403 --> 00:21:08.150
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.680
-A boy fell from the window.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.459
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:10.459 --> 00:21:12.250
WALTER VOIT: So you
can see, even between--

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:12.916
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:21:12.916 --> 00:21:14.210
-A boy fell from the window.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.370
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.662
WALTER VOIT: That sort of
tinny, very processed sound--

00:21:16.662 --> 00:21:17.328
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:21:17.328 --> 00:21:18.630
-A boy fell from the window.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.895
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:18.895 --> 00:21:19.460
WALTER VOIT: --and
natural audio,

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.730
there's a huge difference.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.220
And we'd love cochlear
implant patients

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.520
to be able to really appreciate
sound, appreciate music.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.270
My wife, who's here
in the back, Felicity,

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.820
she's an ear, nose and
throat head and neck surgeon

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.220
at UT Southwestern.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.080
And so we're working with
her and some of her bosses--

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.500
Ken Lee is one of
them-- to really try

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.710
to understand these
self-wrapping atraumatic

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.850
insertion cochlear implants.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.320
But the idea is,
if we can position

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.820
these electrodes closer
to the nerves we're

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.420
trying to stimulate, we've
got higher charge injection

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.310
capacity, we can get more
current out of a smaller area,

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.660
we can get more
specificity, we've

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:59.680
got a lot better way to
interact with this complex part

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.100
of the body.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.760
So the way we can do a lot of
this in a university setting

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.560
is because we're, in
some sense, it seems,

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.890
some days, not in a
real university setting.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:11.790
Texas Instruments has
helped leverage close

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:16.260
to a billion dollars into UT
Dallas over the last 15 years

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.240
through some state projects
and grants and funding.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.240
This building that we
work in is a $100 million

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.190
facility that's built
around a $50 million

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:25.710
clean room facility.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.090
And so even though that's
only seven or eight years old,

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.140
these eight guys that
run our clean room

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.340
have a combined 200
years' experience

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.160
running clean rooms at TI.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.940
And so I can send
students like Rommel

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:39.000
down there to get trained by
experts who've been doing this

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.390
all their lives, and really
get all of the details right.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:46.450
We can focus our understanding
on polymers, on interfaces,

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:48.500
and really use this
as a core facility

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:53.090
to process complex electronics
onto shape-changing plastics.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.520
So our first generation
of these nerve tags,

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.030
this path towards
being able to get

00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:59.870
big data from the
nervous system,

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.880
looks a little bit
like a mini squid.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.940
We've got a-- and that's not
a quantum interference device.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.020
That's like a biological squid.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.130
We've got our antenna.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:13.480
This is a little copper
coil in the back.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.960
This whole thing is encapsulated
in a thin layer of silicone.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.140
We've got a lithium
polymer 10-milliamp power

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.380
battery on top, so we're
able to inductively power

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:27.450
this device at 13 megahertz from
a cage that a rat would sit in.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:31.350
And then we use that battery to
stimulate and to block nerves

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:32.190
in the rat.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.940
And then we've got a
channel for recording

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.066
and a channel for ECG.

00:23:36.066 --> 00:23:38.440
And so that's sort of what
the first generation of device

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.110
looked like.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:44.560
But the whole thing was made
very inexpensively for $100.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.210
And then we interface it
with our polymer electrodes.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.280
So that's maybe arguably
the more expensive part

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.730
here at the ends,
where we've been

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:55.370
able to photolithographically
define complex geometries

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.260
and then connect them
back to this device.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.590
In the future, we hope
that a lot of this

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.060
will be miniaturized,
maybe into a single die,

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:05.070
even, that will be
much, much smaller.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.370
So here you see a sample
of one of these devices.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:09.220
We're able to
wirelessly stimulate

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.860
the sciatic nerve of a rat.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.440
In the top you have
the device that's

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.170
just sitting sort of on top
of the rat, and on the bottom

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.070
you can see that
it's fully implanted.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.260
But if you look at
the relative size,

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.550
it's still too large to have
hundreds or thousands of these

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.440
positioned in across the body.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.690
And this is sort of the reality
of where we are right now.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:29.980
Where we want to go is
to have this be more

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.320
like sophisticated acupuncture.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.680
You would have these
smart, intelligent needles

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.480
that can put these grain
of rice sized devices,

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.370
maybe made out of our
materials, maybe not,

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.700
but made out of materials
that can intimately

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.580
interface with nerves and
serve as this chronically

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.510
viable, abiotic biotic
interface to get information

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:50.760
in and out of the body.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.640
And so some of the
large challenges

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.970
come in encapsulation,
and so we play

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.940
with a host of different
accelerated aging conditions,

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.820
both materials and
electrical, in PBS, phosphate

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.890
buffered saline, in
bovine serum albumin,

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:07.390
in water, also then in
animals, to really understand

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:11.350
how these materials behave
acutely, subchronically,

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:12.980
and chronically.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.160
Some of the related technologies
that have spun out of the lab

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.040
have to do with
building other thin film

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.730
sensors with these materials.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.264
This is a sample of one
of the temperature sensors

00:25:24.264 --> 00:25:25.430
that we've built in the lab.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.050
We spun in a company
this last year

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:30.010
called Pascalor, Pascal
for a unit of force,

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:33.460
and calore for calorimetry,
or heat, or heat flow.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.550
And we've built some of
the world's most sensitive

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:39.610
temperature sensors and pressure
sensors with some caveats.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.010
The temperature sensors
can measure a thousandth

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:45.010
of a degree change
in temperature,

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.506
but over a four-degree
temperature window.

00:25:47.506 --> 00:25:48.755
Now we can change the polymer.

00:25:48.755 --> 00:25:51.830
And in each four degrees,
we can measure something

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.340
with a thousandth of
a degree accuracy.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.640
But in areas where thermal
conditions are fairly

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.900
well-known, like in
and around the body,

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.030
this gives us a
lot of sensitivity.

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.760
So when a lot of temperature
sensors would have,

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.930
maybe, a 25% change
in properties,

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.800
we can get a 10
billion percent change

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.285
in that same property over that
four-degree temperature window.

00:26:13.285 --> 00:26:15.410
So what you see here is a
temperature sensor that's

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.300
put onto the brachial artery.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.940
And we can know that
the hand is going

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:22.150
to move before the hand moves
based on the heated blood

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.010
flow that's traveling
through that brachial artery.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.980
And we can get that
with extremely high

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.510
signal-to-noise ratios with some
of these temperature sensors.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.380
If you look on the
left there, we're

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.500
tracking finger
height in that plot

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.680
as a distance off of a surface.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.320
And so what we can
do is sort of wave

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.610
our fingers in front
of a screen and measure

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:42.360
the relative distance
of that finger

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.800
to the screen based on
the thermal gradient

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.500
between your finger and
that temperature sensor.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.320
If you look at that compared
to a conventional thermocouple,

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.290
we have very, very smooth lines.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:54.870
We have much, much higher
sampling and sort of much

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:58.900
better data rate than a
conventional thermocouple.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.650
We're combining this
with some of the work

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.050
we've done in thin
film pressure censors.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.370
So in the last two
years we've developed

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.050
what we think is
the world's softest,

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:08.820
fully elastic material.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.350
It has a modulus
of one kilopascal,

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:15.170
which is about 10 times softer
than most cortical tissue.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:18.450
We can spin this into a
20-nanometer thick layer.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:22.310
We can build interdigitated
electronics onto that material.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.740
So what we've built here
is-- the whole stack

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.830
is less than 10
microns thick, but it's

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:30.360
a transparent thin film matrix
address pressure sensor.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.390
So you can see when we're
pushing sort of on the pixel,

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.370
you can push and hold,
and you can measure

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:38.430
sort of the lightest finger
taps all the way to very, very

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:39.210
heavy forces.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.950
If we had a fly come and land
on one of these materials,

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:44.710
we could see how the weight was
distributed among that fly's

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.090
legs, which is really cool.

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.080
You can see if you're
pushing other pixels,

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.290
there's almost no
overlap in that signal

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:53.280
than when we're over sort
of the sensitive pixel.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.750
And we can build these pixels
with about 40-micron spacing.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.530
So we could have a screen.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.390
Imagine some sort
of touch screen,

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:03.270
that you could interact with
that screen in three dimensions

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.790
when you're outside
of the screen,

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.165
and then as soon
as you touch it,

00:28:06.165 --> 00:28:08.970
you can sort of interact
down into the screen.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.090
So we see a lot of
neat applications,

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.220
both for wearable and
consumer electronics,

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.770
but also for really
interesting new ways

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:19.260
to interface with
biology in terms

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.970
of pressure and temperature.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:25.020
Another company that we spun
out, Syzygy Memory Plastics,

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.200
is doing some neat
stuff in the audio world

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.550
and in the oil and gas world.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.230
What you see on
the right here is

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:32.930
something called a frac ball.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.320
But these help us do
hydraulic fracturing, which

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.040
is pretty big in Texas.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.540
But we want to be able to
maintain 5,000 PSI on top

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:43.930
of this frac ball, and then have
it completely degrade in a very

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:45.230
fixed amount of time.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:48.050
Most polymers have a
linear degradation profile,

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:50.280
so if the well temperature's
a few degrees off,

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.490
it will degrade too
quickly or too slowly.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.730
We have this logistic
degradation profile

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:57.940
that maintains its mechanical
properties for a couple days,

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.710
and then all of a sudden the
whole network falls apart.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:02.980
And so this gives us
a lot of specificity

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:05.600
to help keeping oil wells open.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.880
I gave a talk across
campus this morning

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.805
from our 3-D printing company,
Adaptive 3-D Technologies.

00:29:11.805 --> 00:29:13.180
And the problem
there we've tried

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.040
to solve is that most
industrially 3-D printed

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.280
parts can't be used for
direct applications.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.570
People print molds,
they print jigs,

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.770
and then they do manufacturing
around 3-D printed parts,

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:27.736
but not manufacturing
with 3-D printed parts.

00:29:27.736 --> 00:29:29.360
If you look at the
stock prices of some

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.880
of the big polymer 3-D
printing companies-- that's

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.170
sort of shown-- there was
all this hype leading up

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.430
to 2014 that they
could solve some

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:39.420
of the grand challenges
in additive manufacturing,

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.860
i.e., print a part that
goes into an automobile.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.350
Unfortunately, that hype
didn't quite pan out,

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:47.770
and you've seen a lot of
these stock prices dropping

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.240
in the last couple years.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.240
But it's not a
business model problem.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.880
It's a materials problem.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.210
You need to be able to
print materials, this layer,

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.410
then this layer, then
this layer, then this one,

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.090
that are as strong
in this direction

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.720
as they are in this direction.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.230
And with a lot of our
study of interface physics,

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:06.570
of polymer physics,
we've come up with ways

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:09.260
to delay that cross-linking
during 3-D printing

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.060
to build isotropically
tough materials.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.500
In materials that are
tremendously strong,

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:18.350
this is a stress strain response
that's very similar to nylon.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:23.760
We can stretch up to 400% with a
stress of 50 MPA, for instance,

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.280
and so we're really excited
about this next generation

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.840
of 3-D printable materials.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.910
Another company that
we recently spun out

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.170
is called Aeries Materials.

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:36.810
There's a problem in
semiconductor processing today,

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.180
and it's this thing
called CTE mismatch,

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.110
or the Coefficient of
Thermal Expansion mismatch.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.110
It's sort of a rule
in the industry

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:48.660
that you can't design materials
that are thermally mismatched,

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.360
or when you cycle them,
they will fall apart.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.810
So in this case, these
thiol ene acrylate

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.640
shape memory polymers
that we've built,

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.750
which have a CTE of almost
70 parts per million,

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.590
should fail miserably when
you put them in contact

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.570
with thin film metals.

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:06.940
But in fact, we can withstand
multiple thermal cycles

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.210
up to 270 degrees C,
and we have misalignment

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:13.400
of less than one
micron per centimeter.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.690
So if you compare
that with materials

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:19.810
up here, like polyamide, like
biaxally oriented polyethylene

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.990
naphthylate, like polycarbonate,
all these materials,

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:26.000
as you thermally cycle them,
they'll shrink and warp,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.070
and you'll not be able
to align transistors

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.150
on a photo mask
over a large area.

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:32.120
The reason we don't
have cellphones today

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.300
that you can crumple up
and stick in your pocket

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.110
is it's prohibitively
difficult to build electronics

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:40.120
onto plastics over
large areas and still

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.600
align all these components
with submicron precision.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.240
Well, people have thought that
CTE mismatch is this problem

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.440
that dominates that.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.440
But the reality
is, CTE mismatch is

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.370
a symptom of having
a lot of cure stress

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:55.730
built into your polymer.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.310
We've come up with materials
that, as they polymerize,

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:00.090
are completely stress-free.

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:02.450
So if that material
has the strain capacity

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:05.430
to accommodate that
mismatch, and we

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.970
don't have these local
stress concentrators,

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:10.870
we can build plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:15.210
deposited silicon nitride,
which has a CTE of 2.3,

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.890
onto a material
with a CTE of 70,

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:21.220
and thermally cycle this
indefinitely to 270 degrees

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.340
and not fail.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.330
And so we're doing
some interesting work

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:27.730
in building flexible
backplanes in materials,

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:31.220
again, based on solving this
very small interface physics

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.130
problem as related to how
polymers and metals stick

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:36.120
together.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.580
Lastly, something
that we've spun out

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.150
is something I'm
very happy with.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.430
Chris has actually helped
us with this a little bit

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:43.750
in his spare time.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:46.370
But we've written one of the
world's most comprehensive mods

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:50.360
for "Minecraft." "Minecraft"
is ostensibly the world's

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.120
most popular video game.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.550
It's been downloaded four
billion times in the last four

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:56.370
years.

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:58.940
There are more YouTube videos
about "Minecraft" than even

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.930
cats, which is surprising.

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:04.950
There are about 100 million
daily players of "Minecraft."

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:08.590
And so we've gone and written
a layer of material science

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.790
in and on top of
"Minecraft," not

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:14.480
to be educational-- it is very
educational-- but to be fun.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.740
Kids can build flame throwers
and jet packs and scuba gear

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.180
and pogo sticks
and bouncy castles

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.930
if they teach themselves
the underlying materials

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:23.900
processing.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.840
So we've added oil and
petrochemical refining and tech

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.470
trees and ways to make all
these sophisticated materials.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.500
But they're teaching
themselves what

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.570
we want them to learn in
college so that they can build

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:38.572
overpowered items to either blow
up their friends in "Minecraft"

00:33:38.572 --> 00:33:40.280
or get around the
world a little bit more

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.800
quickly, or show
off a better base.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.980
And so we've found
some really neat ways

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:49.380
to tap into these new modalities
of learning using programming

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.400
and using video games.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.400
And so we just launched
this a little while ago.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:57.240
UT Dallas is actually offering
weekly $5,000 scholarships

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.110
for the Polycrafter of the Week.

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:02.030
So if any you guys have kids
that are thinking about college

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:03.620
and want to win
some scholarships

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:07.600
playing "Minecraft,"
this is their ticket.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:11.139
So in review, I've shown
you some interesting things

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:13.440
on the implantable
sensor side of things.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:17.230
We have thin film transparent
sensors that are mainly

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:19.040
photolithographically defined.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.330
We've done work with
carbon nanotubes.

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:24.350
Here you see a high charge
injection capacity titanium

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:28.550
nitride interface with all
these little columnar posts.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.929
This is a dipole
fractal antenna.

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:34.530
We've got a laser system,
a neodymium-doped yttrium

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.429
aluminum garnet laser
that can cut out samples

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:39.780
within just a few
microns of electronics

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:43.420
and not redeposit sediment
on the electronics.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.920
And so we're doing
some neat things

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.310
to build devices to
help us understand

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:48.590
what the body's doing.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.130
Some other neat
capabilities we have

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:52.870
back at the University,
one of my colleagues--

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:56.230
he was the president of MRS,
the Materials Research Society,

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:57.700
back in 2013.

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.920
And he works on a
material called ultra nano

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.290
crystal and diamond, which is
one of the world's stiffest

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:04.130
materials.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.310
It has a modulus of
1,400 gigapascals,

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:11.050
making it more than 10
times stiffer than steel.

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:14.860
We can photo pattern UNCD
and build exoskeletons

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.570
in and around our devices
to make them anisotropically

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:21.570
stiff, but then very
flexible when they bend

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.650
and contort inside the brain.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:26.330
Another neat capability
we have back in Dallas,

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:27.830
this is Moon Kim,
and he runs one

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:30.500
of the 20 most powerful
microscopes in the world.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.190
This is an aberration
corrected transmission electron

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:36.880
microscope that can resolve
down to 78 picometers.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.450
So a single-carbon carbon
bond is about 150 picometers.

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:43.810
So we can see point defects
in [INAUDIBLE] disulfide,

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:46.520
in graphene, in
carbon nanostructures,

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.550
and really use this to study
things like single electron

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:53.360
transistors and high K
dielectric materials,

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.910
and a lot sort of in the
nano and the quantum world.

00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:59.799
And so in the end, we've got
great infrastructure back

00:35:59.799 --> 00:36:01.840
in Dallas that's really
been the driver for being

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.130
able to build a lot of
these sophisticated devices

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:05.410
on the plastics.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:09.680
And in Texas, we
like to think small.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.110
So with that, I'd love
to answer any questions.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:13.200
Oh yeah, one more comment.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.550
Yesterday we found out we were
picked as one of the panel

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.760
winners at the big
South by Southwest

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.494
music festival in
Austin, Texas in March.

00:36:21.494 --> 00:36:22.910
There's going to
be a forum called

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:26.670
Inner Space: Bioelectronics
and Medicine's Future.

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:30.570
And so I'll be there speaking
with Kris Famm, who's

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.420
the head there from Glaxo
SmithKline of Bioelectronics,

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.650
and the president of SetPoint
Medical from New York,

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:38.990
and then someone from the
Metropolitan Museum of Art

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:43.060
to talk about of the confluence
of art and neuroscience.

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:44.560
So I'd love to
answer any questions.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.100
Thank you very
much for your time.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:50.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:54.340
AUDIENCE: So after a few
months, you gave the example

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:57.270
with the rat with the implant.

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:59.820
Does the neural signal degrade?

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.820
You know, they get corroded,
like tends to happen

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.872
with some of these devices.

00:37:04.872 --> 00:37:06.330
WALTER VOIT: So
for the one that we

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:08.630
had in the rat for
three months the signal

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:11.390
was unperturbed for
those three months.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:13.510
Unfortunately, the
animal protocols we had,

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:16.480
we were forced to sacrifice
the animal at that time

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.490
and do histology and
immunohistochemistry.

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:22.410
So that big Army
grant that we got,

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:25.870
we are looking at that over
much longer time frames.

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:28.990
But in that case, we had
the 350-microvolt signals,

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:31.510
which are the same as
when the device started.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:34.560
Now the cortex is a little
bit different environment than

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.650
in the periphery,
and so we're trying

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:40.170
to study that phenomenon both
centrally and peripherally

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:43.140
to look at the effects
of immunocompromised and

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.909
non-immunocompromised areas.

00:37:44.909 --> 00:37:46.200
AUDIENCE: Thanks for your talk.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.440
Really great work.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:53.040
You are using supercapacitors
and some energy

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.372
harvesting tricks for the
power management of some

00:37:56.372 --> 00:37:57.080
of your systemms.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.910
So I wondered if you
could talk about that.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:59.330
WALTER VOIT: Sure.

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:00.000
Sure.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.440
So there are a lot of competing
approaches to getting energy

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.600
inside the body.

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.450
A lot of the devices that we've
done preliminary research with

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:11.930
are still wired devices, so
we use omnetics connectors,

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:14.490
and we have cables that
are bonded out straight

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:16.440
to our recording instruments.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.720
For the first generation
of wireless devices,

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.870
there are a host of
competing technologies

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:23.570
across the country.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:27.660
Purdue is doing some really
neat stuff in that area.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.810
There is some neat stuff that's
being done with optogenetics

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:35.260
and using power to power
lasers, and then using lasers

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.780
to communicate with light.

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.280
In terms of the supercapacitors
in the batteries,

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.480
we've chosen these
lithium polymer batteries,

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.580
these 10-milliamp power
lithium polymer batteries

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.470
because they've got
a small footprint,

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:49.020
we can charge them with
fairly simple circuitry

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:52.480
from inductive coils
that we can pattern

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.700
straight on to our plastics.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.590
Right now for the
larger devices,

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:59.500
we're still using coils
of copper or other metals.

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.390
But in the future,
miniaturized devices,

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:06.600
we've got some really neat
technology to photo polymerize

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:10.400
and photo pattern very
small antenna traces

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.250
that can behave like
much larger antennas

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.484
straight onto our
plastics, and that

00:39:15.484 --> 00:39:16.900
would be enough
to then power some

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.580
of these implantable batteries.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.857
Great Batch is a big company.

00:39:21.857 --> 00:39:23.690
They just moved their
headquarters to Dallas

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:24.715
a couple years ago.

00:39:24.715 --> 00:39:26.690
But they've got some
pretty sophisticated

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:30.160
implantable battery
technology that powers a lot

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:34.350
of the biomedical implants
that are on the market today.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:37.420
In terms of the
super capacitors,

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.400
we've done less work so far
in integrating our devices

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:45.440
with those, so I can't comment
more on those right now,

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.620
at least publicly.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:51.199
But for the devices we have,
the battery powered ones

00:39:51.199 --> 00:39:52.990
are the ones that are
working the best that

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.444
are fully wireless.

00:39:54.444 --> 00:39:56.860
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a little
bit about moisture barrier

00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:58.340
and encapsulation?

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.340
That's always one of the
issues that everybody

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.210
runs into with
implanted electronics,

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:04.190
and particularly
flex electronics

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:06.810
because you don't have it
in a hermetic enclosure.

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:08.470
WALTER VOIT: Absolutely.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:11.680
So as polymer chemists, we
spend a lot of time thinking

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.840
about how to protect
and properly package

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.170
these electronics.

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.140
And we have a number
of different approaches

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.160
we're exploring.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.540
So the most basic
approach for a lot

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:24.810
of these devices you've seen is
a thin film parylene c coating,

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:28.280
and that ranges anywhere
from 800 nanometers

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.180
to 10 microns in thickness
of that parylene.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.190
The problem you get
when you get parylene up

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.640
to 10 microns in
thickness, which

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.640
is sort of enough to prevent
pin holes and a lot of moisture,

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.720
is that size begins to dominate
the mechanical properties

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.670
of your device.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.160
In a lot of cases, these
electronics that we build

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.350
are-- the whole gate stack
is 10 to 25 microns thick.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:52.010
So if you put 10 microns
of parylene on either side,

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:53.640
that's dominated everything.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.350
So Rommel's actually been
heading up a research

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:58.430
into low stress nitrides.

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:00.390
We're doing work
with silicon nitride.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.400
We've done some work
with silicon carbide.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:07.100
We're doing work with
composite stacks of materials

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:11.260
to try to, in a very thin film
way, prevent shunt impedance

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.760
and prevent moisture from
getting into our electronics.

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.310
The parylene encapsulation
has been good enough

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:20.950
for our subchronic implants,
so lasting three months or six

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:22.050
months or so.

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:24.080
As we move into the
multi-year time frame,

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.800
though, it will be
probably more combinations

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.150
of these composite approaches.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:31.310
We've also designed
our substrates, though,

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:33.130
to be pretty good
moisture barriers.

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.550
We can tune the hydrofelicity,
or the hydrophobicity

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:38.280
of our polymer substrate.

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.980
We can position
these electronics

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.779
into the neutral
plane of our device.

00:41:42.779 --> 00:41:45.070
So we've got, let's say, 10
microns of our shape memory

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:47.100
polymer on the bottom
and on the top, which

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.700
has been tuned to be a
very good moisture barrier.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:54.050
Then we've got our gate stack
that has other very thin film

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:55.210
encapsulants.

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:57.999
A problem with things like
these low stress nitrides

00:41:57.999 --> 00:41:59.540
is they become
brittle and they don't

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.120
have a lot of strain capacity.

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.570
So if you want a material
that's flexible and bendable and

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:05.820
stretchable, you're
sort of at odds

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:09.020
with using ceramic
interfaces, basically.

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.090
So we try to accommodate
that geometrically

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:15.420
by building highly serpentine
traces where we can accommodate

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:17.520
sort of longitudinally
or torsionally

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.900
a little bit of that strain
so that these thin film

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:22.560
ceramics don't crack.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:26.480
And that's, I think, one
of the big challenges

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.170
in implantable
flexible electronics

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:31.840
is to be able to move away
from hermetically sealed tin

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:36.010
cans to devices that are
small enough and soft enough

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:38.780
to interface with biology
over long periods of time.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.990
And I don't want
to say for a second

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:42.640
that we've solved
that problem, but I

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.300
think we're attacking
that problem

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:45.990
from a lot of different angles.

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:48.670
And I think it's going to be
a lot of combined solutions

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:50.610
that get you a little
bit of the way there

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:53.400
that, in total, get
devices that are going

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.210
to be good enough for
subchronic and potentially

00:42:57.210 --> 00:42:58.916
chronic implants.

00:42:58.916 --> 00:43:00.040
Thanks a lot for coming in.

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.990
And we appreciate your
time and attention.

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:03.540
