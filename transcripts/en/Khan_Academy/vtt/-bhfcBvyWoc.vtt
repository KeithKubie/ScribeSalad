00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.227
- [Tutor] What I wanna do in
this video is give a primer,

00:00:02.227 --> 00:00:03.720
I'm thinking about when to use

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.750
a z statistic versus a t statistic,

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.500
when we are doing significance tests.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.776
So there's two major scenarios

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:12.940
that we will see in an
introductory statistics class,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.760
one is when we are
dealing with proportions,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.400
so I'll write that on the
left side right over here

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.270
and the other is when we
are dealing with means.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.103
In the proportion case,

00:00:23.103 --> 00:00:25.280
when we are doing our significance test,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.765
we will set up some null hypothesis,

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:31.060
that usually deals with
the population proportion,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.240
we might say it is equal to some value,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.760
let's just call that P sub one

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.890
and then maybe you have
an alternative hypothesis,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.960
that, well, no, the population proportion

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.060
is greater than that or less than that

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.893
or it's just not equal to that,

00:00:44.893 --> 00:00:46.090
so let me just go with that one,

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.300
it's not equal to P sub one

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.704
and then what we do to actually test,

00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:53.940
to actually do the significance test

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.478
is we take a sample from the population,

00:00:56.478 --> 00:00:58.287
it's going to have a sample size of n,

00:00:58.287 --> 00:01:00.790
we need to make sure that we feel good

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:01.910
about making the inference,

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.570
we've talked about the
conditions for inference

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.500
in previous videos multiple times,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.160
but from this we calculate
the sample proportion

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.000
and then from this, we
calculate the P value

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.209
and the way that we do the P value,

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:15.330
remember the P value is the probability

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.520
of getting a sample proportion
at least this extreme

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.290
and if it's below some threshold,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.680
we reject the null hypothesis
and suggest the alternative

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.560
and over here the way we do that

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.820
is well, we find an associated z value

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.847
for that P for that sample proportion

00:01:32.847 --> 00:01:34.820
and the way that we calculate it,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.580
we say, okay look, our z is going to be,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.050
how many of the sampling distributions

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.194
standard deviations are
we away from the mean

00:01:42.194 --> 00:01:45.350
and remember the mean of
the sampling distribution

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.320
is going to be the population proportion,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.290
so here we've got this sample statistic,

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.322
this sample proportion,

00:01:52.322 --> 00:01:54.905
the difference between that
and the assumed proportion,

00:01:54.905 --> 00:01:56.977
remember when we do
these significance tests,

00:01:56.977 --> 00:01:58.680
we try to figure out the probability

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.090
assuming the null hypothesis is true

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.250
and so when we see this P sub zero,

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.390
this is the assumed proportion
from the null hypothesis,

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.830
so that's the difference
between these two,

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.952
the sample proportion and
the assumed proportion

00:02:10.952 --> 00:02:14.410
and then you'd wanna divide
it by what's often known as

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.120
the standard error of the statistic,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.070
which is just the standard deviation

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.550
of the sampling distribution
of the sample proportion

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.000
and this works out well
for our proportions,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.220
because in proportions, I
can figure out what this is,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.080
this is going to be
equal to the square root

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.750
of the assumed population
proportion times one

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.824
minus the assumed population
proportion, all of that over n

00:02:39.824 --> 00:02:42.920
and then I would use this z statistic

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.342
to figure out the P
value and in this case,

00:02:44.342 --> 00:02:46.657
I would look at both
tails of the distribution,

00:02:46.657 --> 00:02:48.510
because I care about how far I am

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.023
either above or below the
assumed population proportion.

00:02:53.023 --> 00:02:56.860
Now with means, there's
definitely some similarities here,

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.750
you will make a null hypothesis,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.750
maybe you assume the population
mean is equal to mu one

00:03:03.948 --> 00:03:07.120
and then there's going to be
an alternative hypothesis,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.526
that maybe your population
mean is not equal to mu one

00:03:11.526 --> 00:03:13.581
and you're gonna do something very simple,

00:03:13.581 --> 00:03:17.540
you take your population,
you take a sample of size n

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.620
and instead of calculating
a sample proportion,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.169
you calculate a sample mean

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.280
and actually you can
calculate other things,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.560
like a sample standard deviation,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.760
but now you have an issue,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.730
you say, well ideally I
would use a z statistic

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.262
and you could, if you were able to say,

00:03:33.262 --> 00:03:37.040
well I could take the difference
between my sample mean

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.046
and the assumed mean
in the null hypothesis,

00:03:40.046 --> 00:03:41.449
so that would be this right over here,

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:42.480
that's what that zero means,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.040
the assumed mean from the null hypothesis

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.857
and I would then divide by the
standard error of the mean,

00:03:48.857 --> 00:03:52.480
which is another way of
saying the standard deviation

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.800
of the sampling distribution
of the sample mean,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.039
but this is not so easy to figure out,

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:00.810
in order to figure out this,

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.710
this is going to be the standard deviation

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.330
of the underlying population

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.150
divided by the square root of n.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.977
We know what n is going to
be, if we conducted a sample,

00:04:08.977 --> 00:04:12.160
but we don't know what
the standard deviation is,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.700
so instead what we do is we estimate this

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.930
and so we'll take the sample mean,

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.851
we subtract from that the
assumed population mean

00:04:22.851 --> 00:04:24.520
from the null hypothesis

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.073
and we divide by an estimate of this,

00:04:27.073 --> 00:04:29.860
which is going to be our
sample standard deviation

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.940
divided by the square root of n,

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.130
but because this is an estimate,

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.820
we actually get a better result,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.200
instead of saying, hey,
this is an estimate

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.600
of our z statistic, we will
call this our t statistic

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.620
and as we will see, we will
then look this up in a t table

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.570
and this will give us a better
sense of the probability.
