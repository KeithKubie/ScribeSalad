FEMALE SPEAKER:
In Tanzania, women

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.160
are waiting to see a health
care worker at an AIDS clinic.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.450
The women are terrified
of being recognized

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.230
and fearful that
their husbands will

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.130
discover that they have AIDS.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.670
If that happens, the
women fear their husbands

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.740
will beat them,
and worse, abandon

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.400
them and their children.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.150
In all likelihood,
their husbands

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.030
are the ones responsible
for infecting them with HIV.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.880
In a small, dirt floored
room in a Delhi slum, Nezia,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.890
a young Indian woman
is trembling with fear.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.689
She's telling a
woman's support group

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.650
how her husband tried
to kill her twice.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.490
He was attempting to
blackmail her family,

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.360
because the dowry he received
from them, a motorcycle,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.770
wasn't sufficient.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.830
What he wanted and was
demanding was a full sized car.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.200
My name is [INAUDIBLE], and I'm
an ongoing development program

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200
manager ING tech consumers.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.440
And I'm thrilled to be
introducing you to our speaker

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.100
today, Mark Tuschman.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.040
What I just read to you
were two brief excerpts

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.230
from a proposal from Mark's
book "Faces of Courage:

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.370
Intimate Portraits of
Women on the Edge."

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.425
A veteran freelance
photographer, Mark

00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:10.580
has traveled to parts of Asia,
Latin America, and Africa

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.560
documenting the struggle of
millions of girls and women

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.900
to have agency over
their bodies and lives.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.070
Through his
photography, Mark also

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.530
chronicles the relentless
doctors, midwives, teachers,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.880
and counsellors
who strive to bring

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.650
hope and independence to women.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.280
Mark has devoted much
of the past decade

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.280
to collaborating with socially
conscious corporations, UN

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.040
agencies, foundations,
and NGOs to document

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.680
global health and women's
human rights issues.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.470
Nonetheless, and I think
this is important to say,

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.410
this is not a book
about women as victims.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.750
Jill Sheffield of
Women Deliver writes

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.130
in the introduction
to "Faces of Courage,"

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.670
"Marcus combined sadness with
hope, problem with solution,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.450
and tears with smiles.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.430
We cannot just look
at the problem,

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.390
we have to inject hope and
possibility into this reality."

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.139
We're thrilled to
have Mark here today.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.662
Please join me in welcoming him.

00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:14.414
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:14.414 --> 00:02:16.330
MARK TUSCHMAN: Thank you
for the introduction.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.270
I'm very thrilled to be here.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.020
And I really published
"Faces of Courage"

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.810
to really help improve the
lives of women and girls,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.290
and to get people to help.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.480
Invariably, I get asked what
motivated me to undertake

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.180
this decade long project.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.850
And I earn my living as a
commercial photographer.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.920
And that satisfied my wallet,
but it never satisfied my sense

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.900
that photography should be
used to raise consciousness

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.272
and promote social justice.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.960
I grew up on the Lower
East Side in New York,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.600
and for the first five
or six years of my life,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.480
I lived in a tenement house with
my grandparents and my parents.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.710
And I don't know if you know
the history of Lower East Side,

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.870
but at the turn of last
century, it probably

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.460
was the most congested
place on earth.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.130
And it was filled with
great amounts of poverty.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.850
So I think I just became
very sensitized to the issues

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.630
of poverty and
people's struggles

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.760
to improve their lives.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.630
And in the late
90s, I was reading

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.390
a lot of Nicholas
Kristof's columns,

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.810
and I became very aware of
the plight of women and girls,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.980
and the struggles they had
every day to just to survive.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.640
And in 2001, I decided
to do something about it

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.270
and take some action.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.010
So I had a friend who was
on the board of directors

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.290
of the Global Fund
for Women, and she

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.300
arranged that I go to Asia, in
particular China, Mongolia--

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.189
[AUDIO OUT]

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.900
MARK TUSCHMAN:
--acted by the images.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.620
I want the viewer to see these
women as individuals, not just

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.740
another statistics,
that their life matters.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.010
They all have dignity, and
each and every one of them

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.540
is doing the very, very
best that they can.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.630
This image was
taken in Ethiopia.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:08:03.420
And how the women sold
possessions is in this room.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.300
This was in Northern Kenya.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.800
This was a woman
who was a survivor

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:15.140
of the genocidal violence that
occurred in, I think, 2008.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.120
Now having these
series of portraits

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.900
allows me to segue into a
very, very important topic,

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.940
and that's the whole issue
of maternal health care.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.780
In fact, every time a
woman or a young girl

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.100
gets pregnant in a
developing country,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.480
she's risking her life.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.620
And I've come across
many scenes like this--

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.190
this one is in
northern Nigeria--

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.750
where all these
women are waiting

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.930
to see not a doctor or a nurse,
but a health care worker.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.780
And they've had to overcome
many, many obstacles to just

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.670
even get to this clinic.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:57.860
There are financial obstacles,
there's lack of facilities,

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.000
there's cultural and
religious obstacles,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.190
many, many obstacles.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.870
And this was another
scene in northern Nigeria,

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.370
and all these women
are just sitting

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.910
in this dirt floor waiting
to see a traditional birth

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.710
attendant.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:19.430
And this is their total sum
of their medical facilities

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.500
in this little room.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:30.120
Now without contraception
or medical care,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.510
teenagers get pregnant at
a very, very early age,

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.740
unfortunately, and
basically, confining them

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.370
to a endless cycle of poverty
with very, very little choices

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.020
in their life.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.800
This young woman
is from Ethiopia,

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.940
and she's 17 years old,
and that's the second child

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.860
that she has on her back.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.950
This photograph was
taken in Bangladesh,

00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:00.200
and it was in a ward with
a lot of teenage mothers.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.120
And here, you can see the
mother's in the background.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.949
She's completely
detached from her child.

00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:07.240
And this was very, very common.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:12.350
It's the nurse who's
taking care of her baby.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.530
This was taken last
year in Meru, Kenya.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.030
That's Frieda on your right.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.760
And she's 16 years old.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.210
It's her first baby,
a baby out of wedlock.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.615
Now one of the consequences
of teenage pregnancy

00:10:27.615 --> 00:10:33.900
is that without
reproductive health care,

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.220
many teenagers are too
immature to really have a baby

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.410
and they'll have an
obstructed labor and they'll

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.021
develop a fistula.

00:10:41.021 --> 00:10:42.520
And for those of
you who don't know,

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.510
a fistula is a tear between
a woman's vagina and either

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.620
a rectum or urethra.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.300
And the consequences are
really pretty devastating.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.600
She will just be leaking
urine or feces uncontrollably.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.010
And unless it's
treated surgically,

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:03.960
she'll be ostracized, and
her life will be a nightmare.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.590
And there's about a
million young girls,

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.590
as far as I know, that
have untreated fistulas,

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.610
even though the
fistula surgery's, I

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.810
think, about $50 to $100 and
could easily be repaired.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:19.770
And this was in Malawi.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:26.440
This is Margarito, and
she's had her surgery

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.500
or is waiting for her surgery.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.930
And she's 15 years old.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.470
She had an obstructed delivery.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.060
Her baby died, but at least
she was fortunate enough

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.320
to get to this clinic
and get a repair.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.290
Now it turns out that females
are really the face of AIDS.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:47.220
They're much more susceptible
to getting AIDS than males.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.900
And this was Ana, and she was
mentioned in the introduction.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.250
And this was in Tanzania.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:59.070
And again, just to repeat, she
was just terrified of telling

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.520
her husband that she
had AIDS, because she

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.970
would be just thrown out of her
home, have no shelter, no food,

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.770
even though he's the
one who gave it to her.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.230
And she was even terrified
to be seen with a film crew.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.340
We had to go into a
small, little room,

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.840
so her neighbors
wouldn't even see her.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.820
And this was taken in Kenya.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.580
That's Ruth and
her daughter, Jane.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.280
And this is in one of
the slums in Nairobi,

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.990
and they both have AIDS,
but fortunately they're

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:32.910
being treated with anti-virals.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:40.590
And they have no symptoms.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.790
Now there's a big
chapter in the book where

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.520
I give homage to all
the health care workers,

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.880
because to me they're the
silent heroes of the book.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:56.250
They just work relentlessly
and for very, very little pay.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.270
They go to all these
rural communities.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:02.170
They're really on
the front of giving

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.930
maternal reproductive
health care.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.654
This was in Otavalo, Ecuador.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.000
Now there's a big section
on the book on contraception

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.660
and family planning.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.280
And let me explain
this photograph to you.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.640
It's very special.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.510
It's really the
only thing I've ever

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.890
documented that
really demonstrated

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.790
actual cultural change.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.560
This was in northern Nigeria.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.020
And this was an Evangelical
Christian church.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:40.000
And they really had
this very strong beliefs

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.670
that contraception and
family planning was taboo,

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:49.100
but there was an amazing
Planned Parenthood

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.750
officer that worked with the
unlikely name of Thankguy

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.910
[? Okesen ?], and he
worked with them for years.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.720
And he got them to
change their policies.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.440
And here they are, and
this is the congregation

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.730
in the background.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.767
And they have all these
different contraceptives

00:14:04.767 --> 00:14:06.600
that they're handing
out, and they've really

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.000
adopted these practices,
which is pretty amazing.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.490
And they're very
serious about it,

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.370
because even when you
go to a hairdresser,

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:20.260
they'll hand out a condom
just in case you need one.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.000
There's a chapter in the book
on peer sexual education.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.550
And I don't know, but you
haven't seen many scenes

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.410
like this in the United States.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.010
And it's a very
successful program.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.160
This isn't Cusco, Peru,
and that's Ophelia.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:39.910
And she's in front of her
parents' boarding house,

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:45.490
and she's just, basically,
handing out a contraceptive

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.500
to a student who's
boarding at their house

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.220
and explaining its safe usage.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:57.210
So anyway, the next
part of the book,

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.290
it really is the most
emotionally difficult part,

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.740
and it's all about
violence against women.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.550
And even though a lot
of these photographs

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.250
were taken in India, the
violence against women

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.770
really is pervasive.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.830
It's all over the world.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:16.660
And this is Kala, and she's the
cover of "Faces of Courage",

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.120
and she's a child bride.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.420
This was in Rajasthan, India.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:27.390
And she was married when
she was three months old,

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:28.630
which is hard to believe.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.710
I sometimes have to repeat that.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:34.860
And the deed was
signed, and she's still

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:39.370
living at home with her parents,
but as soon as she's old enough

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.970
to have a child, which will be
shortly, she was about maybe 13

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.130
when I took these photos,
she's going to be shipped off

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.470
to her husband's home.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:53.140
And while I was
photographing Kala,

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.960
her neighbor Mooney walked in.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.390
And it turned out that Mooney
was married when she was 15,

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.680
but when she was 16,
her husband died.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.940
And then she explained
to me that now she's

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.430
a widow for life,
which I also found

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:14.050
rather stunning, shocking.

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:18.570
And she's considered
bad luck in her culture.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.272
Nobody will marry her now.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.080
This is a section
on dowry abuse.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.270
And this is Nazia.

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.740
And she's here in
Delhi, and she's

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.600
telling her story of
how her husband tried

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.720
to kill her not once, but
twice, because the dowry wasn't

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.480
sufficient.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.700
And dowries, even though
the British outlawed it

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:47.740
when they were still
in charge of India,

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.340
it's still very, very widely
practiced more than ever.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:59.700
And dowries just, basically,
a continual system

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.530
of ongoing blackmail.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:05.859
And a husband who wanted a
car instead of the motorcycle,

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:09.089
and it wasn't sufficient, so he
pushed her off the motorcycle

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:13.700
while she was pregnant,
and she he lost a baby.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.780
And he went to get
her in the hospital,

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.930
and he tried to
poison her again.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.300
And the only support
she really has

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.490
is to go into this
women's group.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.369
And she's trying to
really get permission

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:28.900
to really get divorced.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:33.926
I took this portrait
of her after she

00:17:33.926 --> 00:17:35.300
was talking to
the group, and you

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.630
can see how tense she is just
in the gesture in her hands,

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.040
and she immediately broke
into tears afterwards.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.660
And it took a lot of courage
for her even to come to this

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.381
group to present her case.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:56.680
This is Rachna, and
this was Lucknow, India.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:04.520
And she had had a baby, and
there were some complications,

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.310
so she had to stay in the
hospital a bit longer.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:10.970
And when she came home,
her husband and her in-laws

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.100
told her it really
wasn't her baby,

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.640
and they beat and
threw in a closet

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.840
and tried to really beat her
badly, and she had to escape.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.100
And the husband,
basically, was using

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.870
her to get a baby,
because the woman he

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.870
wanted to have a baby
with couldn't have a baby.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.360
Again, I got most of these
stories through NGOs,

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:41.140
and a lot of them were supported
by a Global Fund for Women.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.290
And this was another case.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.490
This is Mira, and
again, this was Lucknow.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:48.600
And she was found
wandering the streets

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.830
just sobbing and crying.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:54.880
And she went to the
police originally,

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.470
and the police asked
her what's the problem.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.780
And she said, well, her
mother's a sex worker,

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.840
and her mother was
beating her, because he

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.610
wanted her to go
into the business

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.190
and drop out of school.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:08.470
And she didn't want to.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.286
And the police
said to her, well.

00:19:10.286 --> 00:19:12.660
You should just be a good girl
and listen to your mother.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:13.885
We'll even be your clients.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:20.200
It was only through
the intervention an NGO

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.010
that she was able to
get back to school.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:27.370
And she's living now with
her aunt and uncle, who

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.690
are her guardians right now.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.770
But in the book,
there are stories

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:37.020
of women who have had similar
experiences with the police.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:41.580
And I even recorded one
story of a woman who

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:46.150
was married to a police
officer, and she had no recourse

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:50.600
with the legal system at all.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.500
There's a chapter in
the book on trafficking.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.820
And this is Sanni.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.730
And this was taken in Indonesia.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:05.360
And Indonesia traffics 6
million women ostensibly

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.470
as domestic
servants, and she was

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:12.260
held in Saudi Arabia
for three years

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.660
without being able to
communicate with her family.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.450
And again, it was
only an NGO that

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.190
was able to gain
her freedom and have

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:23.820
her reunited with their
family, And you see them

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.650
in the background.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.780
And while I was
interviewing her,

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.350
I just couldn't
imagine what it was

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.550
like for them to be
separated for three years,

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:39.530
not knowing at all
if she was alive.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.160
It's just terrible.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.550
And unfortunately, it's
not a very uncommon story.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.284
So we're going to
switch gears now.

00:20:48.284 --> 00:20:49.950
I'm going to try and
tell you about some

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:53.200
of the more positive aspects.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:59.480
This is a big chapter
on economic empowerment

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.510
and rehabilitation.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.700
And this is Jolie.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.900
And this was in Nairobi, Kenya.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.710
And this was a program
called Heshima Kenya,

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:12.060
and it was sponsored by
American Jewish World Service.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:17.540
And Heshima Kenya
basically takes young girls

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:22.250
from war torn countries in
Central and Eastern Africa,

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:25.140
and almost all of
them have been subject

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:29.590
to physical and sexual violence,
and they rehabilitate them.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:36.310
And Jolie's become a very
successful textile artist.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:37.650
She's able to support herself.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.500
She has a new community.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.090
And I'm not going to go
into her whole story.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.690
I didn't get her story
until about two months

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.730
after I photographed her.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.010
But when I read her
story, in my mind,

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.250
she was like one of the greatest
examples of human resilience

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:56.480
I've ever read about.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:03.320
She was originally from
Rwanda, and just horrible,

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.190
horrible things happened to her.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.380
And I actually chose
to photograph her,

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:10.230
because she had so
much joy in life.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.740
And I just couldn't imagine this
was really the same person who

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.505
had endured so much tragedy.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.750
This is [? Royta ?].

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.730
She was a former
fistula patient.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.620
And this was in Dar
Es Salaam, Tanzania,

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.120
and it's another program that's
used to rehabilitate women.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.050
And she's a textile artist.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:36.610
I have a big section in
the book on microfinance,

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:38.970
and this was in Ghana.

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:42.530
And this is Sarah,
who was a very, very

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:44.710
successful entrepreneur.

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:49.280
And she took a small loan of $50
and was able to take more loans

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:55.240
and grow a very successful
bakery business where she bakes

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.940
3,000 loaves of bread a week.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.350
And she employs many people.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:02.560
And she's able to send
her children to school,

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.340
and she's making sure
they get a full education.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.330
This was in Gujarat, India.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:10.900
This is Kurivan.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:15.720
And it's sort of an example of
how maybe traditional education

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.810
doesn't work for all people,
but there are other methods that

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.690
are really empowering women.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:28.480
And Kurivan is very
tribal, as you can see.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.090
And it turns out that
a lot of these tribes

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:35.390
in the Kutch region a Gujarat
have tremendous textile skills.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:39.460
And a woman, Judy Frater, came
over there and started an NGO.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.790
And she taught these women
marketing skills and design

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:43.700
skills.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.850
So instead of just doing
rote trite work for tourists,

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.490
they actually can do very
high end creative work,

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:53.160
and they can sell
their work in high end

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.780
boutiques in Mumbai and Delhi
and even export them to Europe.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.370
And it was wonderful to see
the work they were doing.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:04.140
They were very excited
to be doing the work.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.530
They make a good livelihood.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:12.260
And so I think
every solution has

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.420
to be addressed
to the population

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.970
that you're trying to improve.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.750
It's not one shoe fits all.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.470
Now the biggest section of the
book is on girls' education.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:29.480
And really nothing gives
me more hope and optimism

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.650
than when I walk into
a classroom of girls,

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:35.700
and I see and feel
their enthusiasm,

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:41.220
and just their intensity to
learn is just really palpable.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.222
And I'm just going to go
through a few examples.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:51.760
This is a program in
India, again, in Rajastan.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:57.890
And in Rajastan, the
illiteracy rate of girls

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.780
is particularly high.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:04.570
And also, they have very, very
high child marriage rates.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:07.400
And Educate Girls
India, they're really

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.100
trying to get girls
educated and keep them

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.870
from getting married
as young brides.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.530
And this is Priya.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:24.250
And she was the very first young
girl that I photographed there.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:27.820
And unfortunately,
she really had

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:33.010
to stay home and take care
of the goats and her younger

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:37.420
siblings, but her neighbor,
Nishi, is with her mother.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.130
And her mother had
a chance when she

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.880
was younger to travel
outside of her village,

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.670
and she realized that she would
have a completely different

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:48.910
life had she been educated.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:53.380
And she is ensuring that
her daughter is really

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.230
getting a full education now.

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:58.760
And this is
[? Payelle ?], and she's

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.780
13 years old in maybe
sixth or seventh grade.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.580
She's not a child bride.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.780
She's in school.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.080
There's many, many
more photographs

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.640
of this program in the book.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.350
Now the microfinance
program in Ghana

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:16.480
also has a girls'
education project,

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.359
and they give scholarships to
100 of the best and brightest

00:26:20.359 --> 00:26:21.400
girls in their community.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:31.350
This was in northern Nigeria,
and this was a program,

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:34.940
I think, run by the
Bixby school out of UCSF.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.510
And these photographs were taken
in a small, little mud hut.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.230
It was raining, it was
muddy when we got there.

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:44.450
They had to sweep out the
water and put down a mat.

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:47.440
And a teacher basically
comes once a week.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.540
And they have a little book,
and all these girls just

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.840
take turns reading
from this one book.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.810
And they just follow
every word, every sentence

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.010
that each one of them is saying.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:05.160
Now I thought they were really
engaged until the teacher

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.210
brought out a computer.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:15.700
And I've never seen more
fascination, more focused

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.120
attention than anywhere.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.170
And to me, it's
really a great example

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:24.690
of how potential is
everywhere, but opportunity

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:26.170
is lacking in most places.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.510
This is Lynnette and Sharon,
and their Massai girls,

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.580
and this was in southern Kenya.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:39.880
And this was another
girls' education project.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:44.200
And it turns out that
Massai girls are also

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.090
forced to marry when
they're very, very young,

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:51.730
and even undergo the
barbaric tradition

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:54.190
of female genital mutilation.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:57.300
And American Jewish
World Service

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.690
is trying to educate
these young Massai girls,

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:01.940
and I really believe it's
having an effect in changing

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.000
the culture.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.450
There's a section in
the book on young women

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:13.490
who have grown up in very,
very difficult circumstances,

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:17.550
and through the help
of NGOs and foundations

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.500
have made successful
careers for themselves.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.610
And this is [? Ferita ?],
and she's an English teacher

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:26.260
in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:30.510
And she's here with
part of her class.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:32.810
Her class had about
150 students that

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:36.310
could hardly walk around
and move around in it.

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:41.490
Now I end the book with
another series of portraits,

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:45.290
and that's of young girls.

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:48.540
And I really like the statement
of purpose of the United

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.320
Nations Population
Fund, and that's

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.100
every pregnancy
should be wanted,

00:28:54.100 --> 00:29:00.690
and every child birth safe, and
every young person's potential,

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:04.640
especially those of young
girls, should be fulfilled.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:10.400
Now you look at these young
girls, and they're full of joy,

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:15.170
and they have absolutely no idea
of the dangers that await them.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.510
They're really
literally on the edge.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.640
They're on the edge of
getting an education,

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.590
being able to make
choices for themselves.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:26.540
Or are they going to face
some of these horrible things

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.150
that I mentioned earlier,
teenage pregnancy

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:33.470
and fistula and physical
and sexual violence.

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:35.850
It's really up to us
to really make sure

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:40.830
that they have a life that's
really full of potential.

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:45.320
And many people have told
me that "Faces of Courage"

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.340
is a very, very timely book.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:50.230
And my response to them
is that unfortunately, I

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.750
feel it's going to be
timely for far too long

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.770
into the foreseeable future.

00:29:55.770 --> 00:30:00.330
And I really published
"Faces of Courage"

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:04.830
to raise consciousness
and bring this issue

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:06.870
to the world's attention.

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:10.740
And it's really
my hope to really

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:15.240
get this book into high
school and college libraries,

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:19.540
really to educate and create
a whole new set of activists,

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:24.480
because I really feel young
people are very visually

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.450
oriented, and they respond
to compelling images.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:31.470
They're great at
social media, and I

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:37.370
believe they'll be a great
energy source to us, spread

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:40.000
the word that the rights
of women and girls

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.050
should be ensured
every place on earth.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.499
So thank you.

00:30:44.499 --> 00:30:48.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.330
I guess we can take
some questions now.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:53.610
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.420
It's really touching to
see all those pictures.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:00.700
And honestly, I get very
heavy hearted and overwhelmed.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:05.890
And I'm wondering if you have
any specific advice over how

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:08.330
we can make a difference,
because the problem feels

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:09.560
too big.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.810
MARK TUSCHMAN: I think that's
the most common question

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:12.730
I really get asked.

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.880
And it is a big problem.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.710
And the only way to
really address it

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:21.060
is really on a personal level.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.760
Everyone has a different
set of talents.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:29.300
I happen to be a photographer,
so I've approached it that way.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:33.150
But there are people who
are great fundraisers,

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:34.690
great communicators.

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.060
There are people who
may have the ambition

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.410
to start their own NGO.

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:41.910
In the back of the book,
there are all the NGOs

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:45.070
that I know of that I worked
for that are collaborated with,

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.790
and you can get involved
with any one of them,

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:51.210
and they'd probably be able
to volunteer to get started.

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:54.260
But it is a big
problem, and it requires

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.690
a lot of people really
getting involved.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:59.360
And it's hard.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:05.990
It's hard to really good
attention on this matter.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:08.630
I mean, just look at what's
happening in the world

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:09.440
right now.

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:17.840
Everything is about all that the
terrorists, and rightfully so.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.320
But there's really
a correlation,

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:25.057
because it turns out
that all these places

00:32:25.057 --> 00:32:26.890
where you have all these
religious fanatics,

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:30.520
they're the places that treat
women the absolute worst.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:35.570
So it's very important
to empower women

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:38.610
as a way of combating
terrorism, too.

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.970
AUDIENCE: I'd like
to ask perhaps more

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.660
technical questions about
the photography side.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:45.320
MARK TUSCHMAN: Sure.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.660
AUDIENCE: Seems like, obviously,
you make a good connection

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.650
with the gals,
because of the smiles

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:55.140
and the genuine portrayals.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:33:00.890
Could you talk about that
process, language barriers,

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.900
how do you approach it,
how does it work out?

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:08.390
MARK TUSCHMAN: That's also the
second most asked question.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:12.570
But years ago, I
was with my son.

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.320
He's an anthropologist.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.440
And I was photographing
with him in Peru.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.740
And he said, "Dad, how do
you get these pictures?

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.340
You're not communicating
with these people."

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.390
So I really had to
think about that.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:26.000
I really had to reflect.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.126
I really couldn't
answer right away.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.940
What I came up with, I
think it's just the energy

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:43.600
that I have when I'm
photographing anyone,

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.940
especially some of
these women and girls.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:49.820
Well, first of all, it took
10 years to do the project.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.850
And one of the reasons
it took so long

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:53.850
was that I always
had to collaborate

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.430
with the NGO or foundation.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.360
I just couldn't
get on an airplane

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.190
and just go off by
myself, because I really

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:03.360
needed to be accepted
into the communities.

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.830
And the way to do it
is to go with people

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.370
that-- first of all, I want
to record the work of NGOs

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:09.630
and foundations.

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:13.139
But I also wanted to gain
the trust of the people

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:14.480
that I'm photographing.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:19.510
So just coming in with
people that they know

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:21.570
and that they've developed
a relationship with,

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:22.449
that really helps.

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:25.980
So some of that trust must
get transferred to me.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:31.130
But I also think
it's my attitude.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:34.159
A lot of people-- I
teach photography,

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:39.100
and lots of times
people who are not

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.139
used to photographing people
are kind of nervous and tense.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:44.020
They don't want to
bother the people,

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.520
they want to get it as
quickly as they can.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:50.330
Well, people are
picking up your energy,

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:54.860
so I go in with the
attitude that I'm

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.800
going to do something special.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.300
We're going to take
our time if possible.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.620
And you're important
to me, and we're

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.670
going to try and
create something

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:11.490
that tells your story in your
really classic, beautiful way.

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:14.720
So I think people
just pick up my energy

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.610
that I'm really
serious and intense,

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:21.150
and I think I'm fairly
calm when I'm doing this,

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:23.087
and that I care.

00:35:23.087 --> 00:35:24.545
AUDIENCE: What are
the time frames?

00:35:24.545 --> 00:35:28.790
MARK TUSCHMAN: Boy, I have
to actually work really fast.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:32.270
Sometimes I have some
time, but lots of times

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.210
I have to work very, very fast.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:38.150
And I just have a
lot of experience,

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:40.215
so I know how to do it.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:48.220
I always like to have more time,
but it's usually with an NGO,

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:52.680
and they have an itinerary,
and we have to just move

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.099
from place to place.

00:35:54.099 --> 00:35:54.890
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:57.210
Thank you for speaking
today and sharing with us

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:59.310
all of these beautiful
images that you've really

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:02.860
used to capture so much more
than just the photographs

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:04.700
that we can see.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:09.260
So I'm wondering how you
capturing all of these women

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:12.930
and children has changed
your idea of what photography

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:14.440
is capable of.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.770
MARK TUSCHMAN: I've always
felt that photography

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:20.050
can be used to really raise
consciousness and promote

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:20.866
social justice.

00:36:26.676 --> 00:36:30.120
Just getting back to my
experience growing up

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.510
on Lower East Side
was I changed careers

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.260
to become a photographer.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:39.150
And I don't know if you know
the work of like Lewis Hines

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:42.260
and Jacob Riis, they
documented all--

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.050
I was very attracted them,
cause they were documenting

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:48.150
all the life of all the
immigrants on the Lower East

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.930
Side.

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:55.940
And there are many photographers
who's work does make an impact.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:00.780
I think the trouble right
now is that it's almost

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:05.290
like an overabundance
of media, and it's

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:08.310
easy for very, very
good stuff to get lost.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.710
And I really think
that's your real problem.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:15.220
I think we're just over
bombarded by too much media.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.360
And I think it's a
really big question

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.680
about how do you break through.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.510
I'd love for the book to
get much wider distribution

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:28.500
and become people become
much more aware of it,

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.970
but maybe that's where
you guys can help with

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:33.160
all your social media skills.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:39.410
But I do think photographs
to make a difference.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:43.740
And they make a difference
when they're very personal.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.280
What is it?

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.030
A month, six weeks
ago, I forget,

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:50.830
there was a photograph of
a little Syrian boy who

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:53.050
died off the coast of Turkey.

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:56.930
And all of a sudden, when
that photograph was published,

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:59.630
there was just a great
uproar about the rights

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.590
of the refugees.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:06.050
And I really think it was
such an effective photograph,

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:09.490
because it had a very
personal element.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:15.850
When people see a lot
of images of masses

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:19.560
of people and everything,
we throw up our hands,

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:23.230
we don't know what to
do, it's like too much.

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:26.740
In my work, and I think
what that photographer did,

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.610
he tried to make
it really personal.

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:32.270
So you have a sense of
empathy and compassion.

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:35.210
You can relate to the
people that you're seeing.

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:42.317
So I think good
photography will do that.

00:38:42.317 --> 00:38:43.400
AUDIENCE: Thank you again.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.210
So this is actually
very close to me.

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.430
I grew up in Rajasthan in an
all girls boarding school.

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:52.700
And I know girls wouldn't come
back from summer vacation,

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.070
and the reasons I heard was
because they were married.

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:56.820
So I relate to a lot of this.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:01.194
My own wedding was called off
two months before the first day

00:39:01.194 --> 00:39:03.360
I was supposed to get mine,
because of dowry demand,

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.050
so I relate to all
of this very closely.

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:08.310
I've actually taken
the next summer off.

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.150
I now have a
12-year-old daughter.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:13.850
And to basically show
her how privileged she is

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:16.990
and to go back to India
and Spain this summer

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.700
and actually working
with these NGOs,

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.220
I'm having a hard time
finding the right place

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:26.330
to go to, because maybe it's
easier for you, because you

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:26.880
have a name.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.546
But for me, how do I begin?

00:39:28.546 --> 00:39:29.670
How do I find a safe place?

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.310
MARK TUSCHMAN: I can help you.

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:33.565
I can give you the names
of some contacts in India.

00:39:33.565 --> 00:39:33.920
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:34.410
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:34.920
MARK TUSCHMAN: OK?

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.420
I'll be glad to
help you, especially

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.100
ones that work in Rajasthan.

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.140
This Educate Girls
India, I'll just

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.830
put you in touch with them.

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:45.480
[APPLAUSE]
