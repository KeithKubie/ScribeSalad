00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.180
In a couple, it's easy to get stuck in a position of not having much sex.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.740
Often we stop trying because of something that goes a bit wrong.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.980
Perhaps, there were some nasty arguments,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.660
or moments of impotence, or some kind of akwardness or discomfort.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.020
But what's worse is that failure in the past puts us off from ever really trying again.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.060
We become avoidant and shy around the whole topic,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.680
and then the situation gets really fraught, because a lack of physical contact quickly destroys trust and intimacy.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.720
Before we know it, we're in real trouble.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.080
There is one really relable way to break the deadlock.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.320
A technique pioneered in the 1980s by those legendary american sex researchers Masters and Johnson.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.520
It's called: sensate focus, and this is how you do it:

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.400
STAGE ONE

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.820
Firstly, stop all attempts to have sex.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.780
The idea is that what is stopping good sex is fear,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.300
and therefore you have to reduce any tension and expectations

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.400
by rewinding sexual intimacy to its very beginnings.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.440
STAGE TWO

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.720
So, one night focus wholeheartedly just on one thing: kissing.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.480
You can be as passionate as you like, but there should be nothing more.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.120
You can press against each other, but there is no nakedness allowed.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.660
It's like being back at school, making out, with all the accumulated excitement.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.500
Oddly enough, not being allowed to have sex is pretty erotic.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.680
STAGE THREE

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.660
Then, on another night, you can go a bit beyond kissing, but not a whole lot more.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.520
It's like being back on an early date.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.760
You can touch bodies, but not genitals or breasts, that's for the next time.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.720
STAGE FOUR

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.720
By which occasion you'll probably be getting pretty excited.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.780
Again, you can do lots of heavy petting and making out,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.040
but this time you could also go further and pleasure, and bring each other off, but, no more.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.220
STAGE FIVE

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.280
That's for the fifth stage of the sensate method, when at last you're allowed penetration.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.080
But again, with a bow to adolescence sex, only for a moment, and with no expectation of orgasm.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.360
You do that on a couple more evenings,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.220
STAGE SIX

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.600
and then, hopefully, you can go all the way and you should be back to normal sex.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.140
Though, at the slightest hint of difficulties, just take it back a stage.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.800
It's ultimately a sign of how much we care about one another in relationships that sex can get so tricky.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.760
The key is not to allow expectations to ruin things.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.520
In this area of life, like pretty much every other,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.740
it's extremely normal to think oneself abnormal

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.480
for things that are, in fact, poignantly common, just rarely discussed.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.000
That's one of the main functions of art,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.120
to show us what other people are going through and leave us feeling a little less bereft and freakish.
