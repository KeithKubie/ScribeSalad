00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.180
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Canon PIXMA Pro professional inkjet printers:

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.800
Exactly as you envisioned.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.670
3D printers have come a long way just in the
last few months; we're getting to a point

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:20.890
where I'm going to have to ask "what CAN'T
we print?"

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.160
Printing is not dead.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.440
Not at all.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.770
Midway through the last century, futurists
began to predict the death of paper, and they're

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.770
still wrong.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.759
In fact, we seem to be in a new industrial
age, where tiny factories can sit on your

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.170
desk next to your paperclipsâ€¦

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.149
I definitely don't have paperclips anymore.

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.480
3D printing has spurred a whole new creative
generation of makers.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.989
People who design and "print" their own creations
to satisfy curiosity, specific needs or even

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:50.989
SCIENCE!

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.870
3D printers are getting more varied, last
month, the World Advanced Saving Project unveiled

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.409
a printing robot which constructs whole houses
out of materials readily available in impoverished

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:04.159
countries: mud and natural fibers.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.479
Construction of this type has been common
for the millenia, and because the robot uses

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.979
triangles instead of solid bricks, the houses
are both stronger, and require less mud.

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.560
It can build houses 10 feet (3M) tall using
only materials found on site -- so they're

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.560
FREE.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.829
They say they got inspired by the potter wasp,
which builds it's houses of mud and fibers.

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.990
YET ANOTHER BIOMIMICRY EXAMPLE!

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.890
Speaking of copying nature though, a lot of
the 3D printing craze is prosthetics.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.650
Also last month, this 3D printed prosthetic
hand was created by the Range of Motion Project

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.770
who work in Guatemala and Ecuador.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.150
Using 3D printers and electromyographic electronics,
students from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.859
can create a prosthetic hand that senses the
sensory feedback from the brain and translates

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:53.659
it to movement in the hand.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.829
It can be custom created in a little over
a day for about 270 bucks and, with use, learns

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.130
more than the five motions in its original
programming.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.220
The researchers say thanks to 3D printing
technology, they were able to prototype YEARS

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.920
sooner than with traditional manufacturing.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920
It can even respond with electrical signals
back into the ARM!!

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.770
It's not all plastic hands and mud houses
though.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.000
Remember when they spent years learning to
grow ears on the backs of rats?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.150
Now, researchers at University College London,
3D print structures using biological 'ink.'

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.990
Using the ear as an example, they can scan
an ear, and then use a 3D printer -- create

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.010
a plastic cellular scaffold.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.250
They implant the scaffold under the skin of
the patient's arm, skin grows over it and

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.860
fills in the space with blood vessels and
tissue.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.640
The ear is then attached to the side of the
head! Bam! 3D printed ear!

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.210
They believe it won't be too long before people
can print the organs without implanting them

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.210
first.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.210
They can already grow some biological tissues
in the lab, included bone, skin and vascular

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.210
sections.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.210
It won't be long now.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.621
According to research firm Gartner, 3D printer
sales are going to double each year for the

00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:50.621
next three.

00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:55.010
By 2018, there could be almost two-and-a-half
million 3D printers out there.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.750
This could be the tipping point, and the future
so bright, I might have to print some shades.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.740
