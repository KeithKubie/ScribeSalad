00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:05.230
Factor 27x to the
sixth plus 125.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.400
So this is a pretty
interesting problem.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.900
And frankly, the
only way to do this

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.590
is if you recognize
it as a special form.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.260
And what I want to
do is kind of show

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.320
you the special form first.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.150
And then we can kind
of pattern match.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.960
So the special form
is if I were to take--

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.250
and this is really just
something you need to know.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.329
And I'd argue whether you
really need to know this.

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:26.870
But actually to do
this problem, it's

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.320
something you just need to know.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.560
And that's if you have a
squared minus ab plus b squared

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.331
and you multiply
that times a plus b,

00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:38.080
let's think about what
we're going to get.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.590
So we're going to take
a product right here.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.580
We're multiplying.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.980
So let's do some
algebraic multiplication.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.230
So let's multiply. b times
b squared is b to the third.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.000
b times negative ab is
negative ab squared.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.300
b times a squared
is a squared b.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.340
Now let's multiply
this top term times a.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.090
a times b squared is ab squared.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.480
a times negative ab is
negative a squared b.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.660
And then a times a
squared is a to the third.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.164
And then we just have to
add up all of the terms.

00:01:16.164 --> 00:01:18.580
We have a positive a squared
b and a negative a squared b.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.760
So these guys cancel out.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.350
We have a negative ab squared
and a positive ab squared.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.710
These guys cancel out.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.630
So all we're left with is an
a to the third here and then

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.560
plus this b to the third.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.110
Or another way to
think about it--

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.530
if someone gives you a to the
third plus b to the third,

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.480
this can be factored into
these two expressions.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.980
That can be factored into a
plus b times a squared minus

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.180
ab plus b squared.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.190
So this is essentially
the special form.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.630
If you have a sum of cubes,
it can be factored out

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.670
as the sum of the
cube roots times

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.290
this expression right here.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.950
And we just showed
that it works.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.630
So let's see if we have
that special form here.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.820
Well, 27 is definitely
the cube of 3.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.760
3 to the third power is 27.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.500
x to the sixth is also
the cube of x squared.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.100
If you raise x to the
sixth to the 1/3 power,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.590
you get x squared.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.440
So this first term
right over here

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.930
can be rewritten as 3x
squared to the third power.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.580
And the second term right here--
that's 5 to the third power,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.050
so plus 5 to the third power.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.680
And this might be a little
bit confusing for you.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.080
It never hurts to review.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.030
Let's multiply 3x squared times
3x squared times 3x squared.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.650
That is literally equal
to 3 times 3 times 3 times

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.850
x squared times x
squared times x squared.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.020
This part right here is 27.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.100
x squared times x squared is x
to the fourth, times x squared

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.006
is x to the sixth.

00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:03.380
Or you could just raise both
of these to the third power.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.960
3 to the third is 27.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.000
x squared to the third
power-- you take an exponent

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.742
to an exponent, and
you're going to take

00:03:09.742 --> 00:03:10.950
the product of the exponents.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.000
So it'll be x to the 2 times
3, or x to the sixth power.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.830
So now we know that
we have this pattern.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.280
So we can just use this.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.040
We have the sum of cubes.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.270
So just by using this
pattern right over here,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.620
that means that we
can factor it as.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.285
This is going to be equal to
3x squared-- that's our a.

00:03:31.285 --> 00:03:32.160
Let me make it clear.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.200
This right here is our a.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.450
This right here is our b.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.000
So it's going to be a plus b.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.360
So it's going to be 3x
squared plus b, plus 5,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.000
times a squared.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.250
Let me do this in a new color.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.900
So 3x squared squared-- let's
think about that for a second.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.630
3x squared squared--
well, that's going

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.000
to be 9x to the fourth.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.710
So it's going to be
times 9x to the fourth

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.720
minus the product
of these two things.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.500
So minus the product of 5 and 3x
squared, so minus 15x squared.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.590
And then finally plus
b squared. b is 5.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.790
So it's going to be 5
squared, so plus 25.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.139
And when I said b
is-- this is b, not

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:22.180
the whole 5 to the third.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.570
And when I say a,
just this part is a.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.650
And we're done.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.600
And I won't explain it
in detail in this video.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.200
But this right here, if we're
thinking about real numbers,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.540
we can't actually
factor this any more.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.200
So we are done factoring this.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.090
And remember, this is really
just a very, very, very special

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.942
case of being able to
recognize the sum of cubes.
