Speaker 1:          00:01          Great. You're listening to radio, the podcast from w. C. N. N. P. R. Hello everyone. This is radio lab, the podcast. I'm Jad Abumrad and I am Robert Krulwich and Jed sick. Yes. Here, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't explain to you the situation to you, the podcast Listener, r n there's been some confusion here among our our podcasts, which is exactly what's going on in the last five podcasts. You've listened to completely produced hour long programs. Yes. That's why we began radio lab as a radio show, our long programs, which we work very, very hard on. Yeah, I mean I think of us as having two. We have radio labs for the radio, which are hour long programs and you've just heard a bunch of those and then we have radio labs just for you sign up. Those are called the podcast and we could do stuff on the podcasts that are a little less formal and not that were, there'll be formed on the radio, but it's just a looser form so we can come short length shorter or longer or longer.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Yeah, yeah, that's true. That's true. We've ran, we ran conversations between you and various smarty pants that have run pretty, really wrong and have been, have been great or close to forever. But the point is, this is now the beginning of a podcast, so this is not, and if you're wondering where to find us on the radio, the issue there is that we're on the radio at different times all over America. So you have to ask your local station when they run radio labs, sometimes in the morning, sometimes in the evening, but the podcast is anytime you choose. That's right. And starting with this podcast, this post season five podcast, uh, I want to read to you Mr Kroll, uh, the second paragraph of a, uh, uh, an article that was recently in the New York Times. Okay. Have you heard about this? Uh, this fellow Brock, I know about the New York Times.

Speaker 1:          01:51          Oh Bro, yes, I heard him too. Okay. Well, new researchers have documented, I'm quoting here what they call an Obama effect, showing that a performance gap between African Americans and whites on a 20 question test administered before Mr Obama's nomination, all but disappeared when the exam was administered, after his acceptance speech and again after the presidential election. So to back up, that means it translated into normal English. Yes. Go ahead. That um, some researchers decided to give a 20 question test to a bunch of people. They were young people and older people do just that. You're going to take a test. It's a GRE test. It's a verbal test that you take to go to graduate school before they take the test, they have to list their race. Yes, they do. So you put down your race and then you take the test. Now the first time they administered the test was sometime last year before Barack Obama was a big deal. Yes. And blacks performed poorly. Poorer than whites. Yes. Eight poorly. So whites on average at that point answer 12 questions that have 20 correct. And black subjects answered only 8.5 on average out of 20. So that's a significant difference. Or that was a small sample. Then they gave the exact same 20 question test [inaudible] gres again, the

Speaker 2:          02:59          verbal to a group of people after Barack Obama had become the nominee of the Democratic Party, had given an acceptance speech in, in Denver, Colorado, and was a pretty famous and important guy. Yes. And then they give it yet again after Barack Obama had been elected president of the United States. So there's, there's these multiple of test takings. And what they noticed was after Barack Obama had become fabulous blacks taking the test, scored about the same as whites before Barack Obama had been fabulous, blacks performed more poorly. And there's a, there's a longstanding reason for the previous performance, but the new performance

Speaker 1:          03:38          that's very interesting. Pretty stunning. But I mean we should say, but as by way of caveat to that, this isn't really preliminary study, it's not been peer reviewed. You guys haven't looked it over. Not a huge number of subjects in the study, but there was a last very intriguing yes. And there is actually precedent for this, uh, for this, um, way of thinking. The precedence goes back to a psychology professor named Claude Steele.

Speaker 3:          04:03          I got a job offer. This is in the 80s at the University of Michigan and it was part psychology and part to administer a minority student program there. And um,

Speaker 1:          04:14          in the process I saw data that surprised me when he saw was a troubling trend. Two kids would enter Michigan, one was black, one was white. They come in at the exact same level, same skills, same sat scores. So theoretically they should do the same when they get to Michigan. But without fail or almost without fail, after one semester, the black kid was winding up with lower grades. How much lower? Pretty, pretty, um, pretty dramatic. At least two thirds of a letter. Grades, meaning if the white kid got an a, the black kid who should be getting an a too is instead getting a B or a B plus, that's significant. That's significant. That's significant. And he also, by the way, saw this performance gap between women and men when it came to match. At the same time,

Speaker 3:          04:57          same degree in advanced math courses, it was comparable. I learned this as a national phenomenon. If I was to walk into almost any college class in the United States, I'd have a very high probability of finding exactly that

Speaker 4:          05:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          05:13          what could explain these differences. There was something there that people didn't understand and that we certainly didn't understand till he figured he would start with the woman in math issue. He brought a bunch of women in and a bunch of men,

Speaker 3:          05:25          what brought them into the laboratory one at a time, gave them a half an hour section of the graduate record exam you take if you're a math major, very, very difficult math, and sure enough, the woman who had all the same credentials coming into that situation performed dramatically worse than the men. Worse as in it'd be a couple hundred points on an sat testing. It was a big effect.

Speaker 1:          05:47          So Claude Steele thought, all right, step one complete. I've got a lab situation that resembles the real world. Good. Now the next step is to tweak things a little bit. See if I can mess around with it.

Speaker 6:          06:00          Nope.

Speaker 1:          06:01          Normally in these situations,

Speaker 3:          06:02          the test giver has got a little white lab coat on and he brings in a big stack of cellophane wrapped tests. He puts a clock on the table. That's all. It's all you know. It's like that's it's gonna intimidate almost anybody.

Speaker 1:          06:17          Maybe that's what's happening. He thought, what if I took away the clock, took away the coat and most importantly right before the test I had the test giver. Instead of saying the normal, I'm going to give you a test pre test thing. Maybe instead say something like this.

Speaker 3:          06:35          You may have heard that a women don't do as well as men on difficult standardized math test. You may have heard that, but that is not true for this particular test. This particular test does not show gender differences. Never has never will.

Speaker 1:          06:50          He wondered if maybe saying that simple sentence before giving the test would have an effect

Speaker 3:          06:56          and sure enough, I wouldn't be here if their performance didn't go up and go up to match that of the equally skilled men, that performance gap totally vanished. She look at this thing, so we raced and did it very quickly. The same kind of an experiment with African Americans.

Speaker 1:          07:12          They're the pretest disclaimer went like this

Speaker 3:          07:14          is an instrument that we use to study problem solving and it is not diagnostic of individuals intellectual ability.

Speaker 1:          07:23          In other words, this is not a test of your intelligence. I repeat, not an IQ test, so just do the best you can with that simple disclaimer at the start. Same kind of an effect. The black students and the white students were now equal.

Speaker 5:          07:40          Just recently a Ryan Brown and Eric Day did a clever treatment. They, there is an IQ test which is nonverbal called the advanced progressive matrices has figures, very abstract. It got lines crossing that you have to match and so on. X, it's essentially pattern match diamonds with dots and totally visual and so they can represent that test as as it is as an IQ test. It's in fact seen as the gold standard of IQ test because it's cool culture free. There's no math, there's no reading because it doesn't involve language. Or You could represent the exact same test as a puzzle puzzle. Puzzle. Meaning you can give an IQ test to a bunch of kids and the blacks will perform worse. But if you give that same test, lose the word test, lose the word IQ. You just call it a puzzle. The black participants suddenly jump up in their performance. Basically, we got a reversal. When you represent represented as a puzzle, blacks perform as well as white. They did. Yeah. That's all it takes. Just change a few words.

Speaker 7:          08:41          [inaudible].

Speaker 8:          08:41          In fact, there's even better research on this, uh, by a guy named Jeff Stone at University of Arizona who's shown this with golfing tasks where he's had black and white golfers just putt. Wait, so this hightest can eat. We're talking about eating. Well,

Speaker 1:          08:55          think about, think about what it takes to putt effectively. Are you a golfer? No. Ryan's not either. So he doesn't know what he's talking. That's right. So I'm going to make this up. You have to constantly, what we did was we got a miniature golf situation where each hole changed and people had to work around obstacles. This is Jeff Stone. He runs the social psychology of sports lab at the University of Arizona. And here's what he did. He tested his black and white putters in two scenarios. Scenario one by using the word intelligence when we told them it was a measure of sports intelligence, black participants did about four strokes worse than white participants, but when he changed it took out the word intelligence and framed it instead as a test of your natural athletic ability there naturally, the results totally flipped, flipped, and we had now whites performance significantly worse than blacks by about four strokes. If you look at the recent a u s open that was played in San Diego, tiger woods and [inaudible],

Speaker 9:          09:47          a meeting went four days, 18 holes. They went to an 18 hole playoff on Monday. Yes, and still tied. Sudden death. We go on

Speaker 1:          10:03          tiger finally won it on the first playoff hole.

Speaker 9:          10:09          Tiger Woods. When's the third us open championship by one stroke. So when you talk about four strokes, that's a huge difference.

Speaker 1:          10:18          All right, so here's my question. Stereotypes are powerful. Okay, that makes sense now, but in terms of understanding how this works, can you make this tactile for me, like if the stereotype it's having all these effects is like a thing like a, like a little Gremlin that bites, like when in the test taking process does it actually like do it's damage. That's going to be way open to debate. What does seem to be clear from the data according to Eric Day and Ryan Brown and Claude Steel, is that the Gremlin only seems to appear totally when the test is sufficiently hard. If the test is easy, that's important to point out a these effects don't happen. It's not that the Gremlin is not there. Well, he walks in with you, but he doesn't speak necessarily until things get challenging. As soon as the test gets difficult, that's where the voices kick in, which means that for most of the tests everybody's doing about the same.

Speaker 1:          11:07          It's only at problem number 17 the one about co-signs and factorials and whatever where things start to go wrong, and at least that's the theory at that problem. The black student starts to stiffen up a little bit. That's right, and Claude Steele's measured this. Their blood pressure's elevated, their short term memory is impaired. It's that flicker of frustration through their body that wakes up the Gremlin who starts to whisper in their ear, I don't know if you can do this. Oh Shit is what they say about us. True. They don't think you can do it. All the usual stuff, and even if the student doesn't believe it, which is likely so you don't have to believe it. That's the kind of insidious thing here. Just the fact that he has now this extra bit of mental chatter, that little guy whispering, well, it's a distraction and that makes their performance go down just a little bit. Hold. This dialogue is keeping from being

Speaker 2:          11:53          a hundred percent focused on the task at hand, which is solving these problems. Who the real subtle

Speaker 1:          11:59          power of a stereotype isn't that it prevents you from doing the thing you want to do. It distracts you for just a beat from doing the thing you want to do. And that may be all the difference.

Speaker 2:          13:22          Oh, so we're almost done with this particular podcast, but before we go, I think we should have the letters section, which I'll do like this [inaudible] letters, they get letters. So we have a this letter Jad Abumrad yes. A number of people have wondered who we listened to our diagnosis show. For those of you who haven't listened to the diagnosis show, you'll have to listen to it to understand this question, but they're very curious what happened to patient x who was, um, had pancreatic cancer in the show. Yeah. We never quite explained to his fate what he's, or the outcome.

Speaker 1:          13:55          Yeah. Yeah. That's a, that's actually a really good question. Um, patient x, uh, had his entire pancreas removed and um, many years later, his is doing fine. He's still alive. Uh, although the pancreas being a very important organ, uh, when he was removed, he became a diabetic. So it's a pretty radical radical surgery, but it's, you know, arguably saved his life.

Speaker 2:          14:18          Okay. The next question [inaudible] this comes from your father and your mother. Yeah, this is good. What is wrong with you is essentially what they're saying. And I like to join them in that. For those of you who remember the show, uh, was a choice when you did this [inaudible] suddenly in the middle of the show and for no reason at the end of a segment, uh, Jed used a term of opprobrium to IX. He used the name that is normally associated with female dogs and just simply call the audience [inaudible] you just called. Okay. Bitches and then like all hell

Speaker 1:          14:52          broke loose. Yeah. And I thought at the time, what it's true you should eat. It's, it's true. You should go on record as being a dissenter from the beginning. You were like, why did you, why would you do that? Okay. So here's the thing. Um, uh, some people found, many people found it funny, many people did not find it funny. And I sincerely apologize. The people who didn't you look, I'm in my thirties. Okay. I grew up watching MTV, it's uh, you know, I, you know, you got with your friends and you're like, all right, but she was ready to go out to dinner a little. Still actually say that it's a term of endearment. Oh, it just popped out during one of the sessions. Do you remember this? It was really nice. 1,000 takes really insulting and stupid, but no know you didn't find it.

Speaker 1:          15:34          This, this generation card thing on me. So like, can I get like, I get scared. Yeah. Right. All right. So I see that's what all the young people are doing. You know what I mean? I got so many people come and say, what's wrong with him? Why did you do that? And a lot of them were your age or do I say it like 19 2021 so I think you're exactly right. I think it's generational, but it doesn't even matter at this at, at honestly. I, I, if I could do it again, I would take it back. No offense, no offense meant, I mean, where it came from, from me. And I think people who are my age, they, you know, it, it wasn't an attempt to be have, it's just something that happened in the booth. It was funny. And so we left it in. We probably shouldn't have come here cause my parents will not let me forget it. They're always like, at dinner they're like, can you pass the salt bitch? What do you think of the chicken roast?

Speaker 10:         16:28          All right mom. I get it and get it. There's such good care.

Speaker 1:          16:34          Anyhow, I guess we should go. Good. All right, so radio lab is funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, the corporation for public broadcasting and the national science foundation also by nurse Nestle, who will try to get back to bed and totally into sleep as soon as possible. Right. I'm Jeddah boomers and this leads, like I said, I don't know why. I never know what you're going to say. No, I don't. I really don't. I'm Jad Abumrad I remember crawling, I guess catch up with you in two weeks.
