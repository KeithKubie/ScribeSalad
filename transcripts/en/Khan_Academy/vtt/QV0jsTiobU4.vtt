00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.670
I have this 4 by 4
matrix, A, here.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.120
And let's see if we can figure
out its determinant, the

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.530
determinant of A.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.370
And before just doing it the way
we've done it in the past,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.530
where you go down one of the
rows or one of the columns--

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.890
and you notice, there's no 0's
here, so there's no easy row

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.250
or easy column to take
the determinant by.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.430
We could have gone down this
row and do all the

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.510
submatrices, but this becomes
pretty involved.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.740
You end up doing four 3 by 3
determinants, and then each of

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.880
those are composed of three
2 by 2 determinants.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.030
It becomes a pretty
hairy process.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.230
Let's see if we can use some
of the realizations we've

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.720
discovered in the last
two videos to

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.250
simplify this process.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.270
Well, one of the realizations is
that row operations, or if

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:50.470
you subtract-- let me write it
this way-- if you replace row

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:58.590
j with, let's say, row j minus
some scale or multiple, times

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:07.200
row i, it does not change
the determinant of A.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.300
We saw that, I think it
was two videos ago.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.880
So this is a pretty
big realization.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.810
We can do these type of row
operations and it won't change

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.700
the determinant.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.730
The other realization we had
was that these upper

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:26.220
triangular matrices, you can
figure out their determinant.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.940
So what does upper triangular
look like?

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.900
Let me just review it.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.370
The upper triangular--
everything below the diagonal.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.850
So let's say the diagonal has--
let me just draw its

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.710
terms like that.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.380
These are some non-zero terms.
Oh, they don't have to be.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.920
Then upper triangular,
everything below the diagonal

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.630
is a 0, and everything above the
diagonal probably isn't a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.740
0, but you never know.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.400
But they're non-zero terms, so
all the red stuff here is

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.940
non-zero, all this stuff
in green is 0.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.270
And I didn't touch on it in that
video, but there is also

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.630
such a thing as a lower
triangular, that you might

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.800
have guessed how it looks.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.370
Everything above the main
diagonal is 0, so this is the

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.810
main diagonal right here, all
the way down like that.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.060
All of these guys are going
to be non-zero.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.730
All of that's going to be
non-zero, and then the 0's are

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.630
going to be above the
diagonal, like that.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.660
We saw in the last video that
the determinant of this guy is

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.130
just equal to the product of the
diagonal entries, which is

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.050
a very simple way of finding
a determinant.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.160
And you could use the same
argument we made in the last

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.540
video to say that the same is
true of the lower triangular

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.640
matrix, that its determinant
is also just the product of

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.170
those entries.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.030
I won't prove it here, but you
can use the exact same

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.980
argument you used in the video
that I just did on the upper

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.300
triangular.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.880
So given this, that the
determinant of this is just

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.780
the product of those guys, and
that I can perform row

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.250
operations on this guy and not
change the determinant, maybe

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.070
a simpler way to calculate this
determinant is to get

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.860
this guy into an upper
triangular form, and then just

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.360
multiply the entries
down the diagonal.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.060
So let's do that.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.085
So we want to find the
determinant of A.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.870
Let me rewrite A right here.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:30.740
It's 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4,
2, 2, 7, 5, 2, minus 1, 4,

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.650
minus 6, 3.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.950
Now let's try to get this into
upper triangular form.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.570
So let's replace the second
row with the-- so I'm just

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.630
going to keep the first
row the same.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.790
1, 2, 2, 1.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.900
And let's replace the second row
with the second row minus

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.230
the first row.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.100
The second row minus the first
row is going to be equal to 1

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.960
minus 1 is 0.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.610
So in this case the constant
is just 1.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.530
So 1 minus 1 is 0.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.120
2 minus 2 is 0.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.430
4 minus 2 is 2.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.620
2 minus 1 is 1.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.040
Now let's replace the third row
with the third row minus 2

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.560
times the second row.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.390
So 2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.100
7 minus 2 times 2 is 3.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.590
5 minus 2 times 2 is 1.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.160
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.845
Let me get a good color here.

00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:39.540
I'll do pink.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.630
Let's replace the last row
with the last row,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.870
essentially, plus
the first row.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.410
You could say minus minus 1
times the first row is the

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.000
same thing as the last row
plus the first row.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.680
So minus 1 plus 1 is 0.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.700
4 plus 2 is 6.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.960
Minus 6 plus 2 is minus 4.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.490
And then 3 plus 1 is 4.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.220
So there we have it like that.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.810
And this guy has two 0's
here, so maybe I want

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.530
to swap some rows.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.920
So let me swap some rows.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.200
So if we swap rows,
what happens?

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.650
I'm going to swap the middle
two rows just for fun.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.090
Well, not just for fun.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.560
Because I want a pivot
entry right here.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.520
I shouldn't say a pivot entry.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.105
I want to do it in upper
triangular form.

00:05:29.105 --> 00:05:30.965
So I want a non-zero
entry here.

00:05:30.965 --> 00:05:33.370
This is a 0, so I'm going
to move this guy down.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.770
So I'm going to keep the
top row the same.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.680
1, 2, 2, 1.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.190
I'm going to keep the
bottom row the same.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.205
0, 0, 6, minus 4, 4.

00:05:43.205 --> 00:05:46.630
And I'm going to swap these
guys right here.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.150
So this is going to
be 0, 3, 1, 0.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.630
And then 0, 0, 2, 1.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.130
Now, can I just swap
entries like that?

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.520
Well, I can, but you have to
remember that when you swap

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.130
entries, your resulting
determinant is going to be the

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.810
negative of your original
determinant.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.990
So if we swap these two guys,
the determinant of this is

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.200
going to be the negative
of this determinant.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.110
When you swap two rows, you
just flip the sign of the

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.100
determinant.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.660
We saw that.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.370
That was one of the first videos
we did on these, kind

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.410
of messing with the
determinants.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.200
Now, what do we want
to do here?

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.530
To get this guy into upper
triangular form, it'd be nice

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.820
to get this to be a 0.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.520
So to get that to be
a 0, let me keep

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.960
everything else the same.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.840
So I have a 1, 2, 2, 1.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.240
I have a 0, 3, 1, 0.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.680
The third row is 0, 0, 2, 1.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.470
And now this last row, let me
replace it with the last row

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.270
minus 3 times this row.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.150
So let me write it like this.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.300
I have to carry that negative
sign as well.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.700
So I'm going to replace this
last row with the last row

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:02.750
minus 2 times the second row.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.610
want to zero it out.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.830
So 0 minus 2 times 0 is 0.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.680
6 minus 2 times 3 is 0.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.280
Minus 4 minus 2 times
1 is minus 6.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.590
And then 4 minus 2 times
0 is just 4.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.460
We're almost there.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.040
Now we want to zero this
guy out, so let's

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.140
replace this one.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.560
So I'm going to keep my top
three rows the same again.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.150
And let me see if I can write
it a little bit neater.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.800
So my first row is 1, 2, 2, 1.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.010
My second row is 0, 3, 1, 0.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.930
Fourth row is 0, 0, 2, 1.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.540
And I'm going to take
the matrix.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.960
I haven't written the
fourth row yet.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.250
And, of course, the negative
of this is going to be

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.540
determinant of our original
matrix, because we had swapped

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.650
those rows.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:00.790
But let's replace this last row
with the last row, plus 3

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.650
times the third row.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.240
So we get 0 plus
3 times 0 is 0.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.710
0 plus 3 times 0 is 0.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:12.220
Minus 6 plus 3 times 2 is 0.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.740
4 plus 3 times 1 is 7.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.620
And just like that, we have a
determinant of a matrix in

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.600
upper triangular form.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:28.080
So this is going to be equal to
the product of these guys.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.945
We can't forget our
negative sign.

00:08:29.945 --> 00:08:32.950
Let's throw our negative sign
out there and put a

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.500
parentheses just like that.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.039
This is going to be
the product of

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.030
that diagonal entry.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:43.760
1 times 3, times 3, times 2,
times 7, which is 6 times 7,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.130
which is 42.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.710
So the determinant of this
matrix is minus 42, which was

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.100
pretty fast. This was a
pretty fast shortcut.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.080
And it actually turns out it
tends to be computationally

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.580
more efficient to use these
takeaways to put things into

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.740
upper triangular form first. And
then, you know, if you do

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.300
swaps, you have to remember to
make the determinant negative.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.910
And then just multiply
down the diagonal.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.650
And we did that there, and
we got the determinant

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.250
as being minus 42.
