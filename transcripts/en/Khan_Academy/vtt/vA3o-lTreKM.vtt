00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.310
- [Instructor] In many videos,

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.473
we have talked about the
makeup of government,

00:00:04.473 --> 00:00:06.970
either the federal or the state level.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.318
We've talked about branches of government.

00:00:09.318 --> 00:00:11.860
We've talked about checks and balances.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.950
What we're gonna talk about in this video

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.370
is how people interface
with the government,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.540
and in particular,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.320
what are the channels that allow them

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.360
to communicate their preferences?

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.960
So this is the government here.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.220
And of course the government
is made up of people

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.720
in the various branches.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.580
But let's say this is
all of us as citizens

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.050
right over here.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.620
Now, we're always interfacing
with the government,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.750
or we're always interfacing with something

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.750
that the government does.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.720
When we pay our taxes,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.050
we are interfacing with the government.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.950
When we try to,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.360
when we renew our passport,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.174
we are interfacing with the government.

00:00:47.174 --> 00:00:49.140
But what are the ways

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.397
that we can communicate our preferences?

00:00:51.397 --> 00:00:55.123
Well, one very obvious
way is through elections.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.560
Obviously we can vote someone in,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.820
we can vote someone out.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.030
We can tell the government,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.411
are we happy with what they've been doing

00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:02.860
or are we not?

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.450
What issues are important to us

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.310
and which issues are not?

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.920
Another institution that's considered

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.230
a way to link the citizens

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.878
or the people of a country with
its government is the media.

00:01:14.878 --> 00:01:17.230
Is the media.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.340
And I'll actually draw
a two-way arrow here,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.100
because it's a way for the government

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.590
to communicate with everyone else,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.410
and it's also a way for views
to be heard and amplified,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.260
which the government might take note of.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.770
And these things would
influence each other.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.010
Obviously the media is capable
of influencing elections.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.790
Now, another way is interest groups.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.595
Another thing that we have
talked about in previous videos.

00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:42.300
So this is interest groups.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.140
And it could actually be
a two-way arrow where...

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.973
Let me write this down.

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:48.020
Interest groups.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.950
And we could be talking
about groups like AARP,

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.530
the NAACP, or the NRA.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.040
People could be members of that

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.600
or contribute to that interest group,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.860
and they are going to
lobby the government,

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.120
they're going to try
to influence elections,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.260
they'll oftentimes
participate in the media,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.910
and interest groups are
also going the other way,

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.125
where they're trying to get their members

00:02:08.125 --> 00:02:10.190
to go in one way or another,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.450
to adopt views of the interest group

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.980
or maybe influence elections

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.270
in ways that the interest
group might like.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.878
The fourth major channel for the citizenry

00:02:18.878 --> 00:02:22.980
to have this connection
with the government

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.963
is through political parties.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.370
Political parties.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.700
And these four different ways

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.680
of connecting the government with people,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.230
ways for the people to
communicate their preferences

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.340
to the government,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.440
these are often listed
in government classes,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.170
and collectively, they're
known as linkage institutions.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.940
Linkage institutions.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.130
And they're called that
because they link people

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.587
with their government.

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:53.446
But what I'm gonna focus on
in this video in particular

00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:55.770
are political parties

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.550
and the roles that they play.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.750
And we're all familiar
with political parties

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.880
in the United States.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.330
The two major political
parties are the Democrats

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.100
and the Republicans.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.980
But what do they fundamentally do?

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.067
How do they play this role
as linkage institutions?

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:14.880
Well, the parties will
have their platforms,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.420
so each of your political parties

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.050
will have a party platform.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.350
And I encourage you to do a web search

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.940
for the party platform,

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.250
the Democratic platform

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.130
or the Republican platform.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.030
It's really interesting to read,

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.040
especially when you see
how 180 degree opposite

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.240
the two different groups can have

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.520
on some very similar issues.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.580
But it's a way of saying,

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.170
what do they believe in?

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.850
And once they articulate this platform,

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.770
it can have multiple effects.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.430
It can influence the members of the party,

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.970
because common citizens
indeed do become affiliated

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.510
with various parties.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.410
But it could also
influence the politicians

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.580
that are members of that
party in government.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.910
So it can affect both of those.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:58.743
Related to this idea

00:03:58.743 --> 00:04:02.470
of a party platform influencing citizens

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.003
is this idea of voter
mobilization and education.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.940
With an upcoming election,

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.410
they'll go to people who are either

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.760
already members of the party,

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.900
who affiliate with a party

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.600
or might be sympathetic to a party,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.610
and say, look,

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.660
here are the big issues that
are going to be affected

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.340
by this upcoming election.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.600
Don't you care about it?

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.840
If you vote for the other person,

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.040
these things are going to go against you.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.010
Let's educate you on
our view of what is good

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.810
for the local government,

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:33.950
what is good for the state,

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.600
what is good for the country.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.483
Political parties also
do candidate recruitment.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.450
A purist view of parties is, look,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.820
they care about changing the agenda

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.220
or preserving an agenda,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.720
and so it's really important for them

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.930
to field candidates that are capable

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.920
of representing that agenda

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.360
and capable of winning.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.420
If they don't do that,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.850
the political parties will
eventually become irrelevant

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.970
because if they don't have
actual people who win elections

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.803
and get into government,

00:05:01.803 --> 00:05:04.130
well, they'll also probably
start losing followers,

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.280
because people don't like
to be part of a party

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.450
that really does not have much influence.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.050
And so political parties
are always going out there

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.000
and saying, okay,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.430
the opposition party has
a candidate like this.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.220
Here are the big issues on the table.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.170
Let's see if we can get a candidate

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.950
that can really take
advantage of the circumstances

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.960
in that region

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.610
and has a high chance of winning

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.810
while at the same time really representing

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.525
what the party believes in.

00:05:27.525 --> 00:05:30.460
A fourth thing that parties will do,

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.810
and this is related to
candidate recruitment,

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.213
is campaign management,

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.030
where you will have professional
political operatives

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.530
associated with political parties,

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.499
and they'll go from,

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:42.770
they might be involved even
in the candidate recruitment,

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.170
but once they get those candidates,

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.159
they'll say, hey, we're
gonna help you win.

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.190
Now, a fifth major function
of political parties,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.179
at least in the United States,

00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:52.930
just as these arrows
from the party platform

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.290
to the general electorate,

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.430
this is really,

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.726
this right over here really
is that voter mobilization

00:05:57.726 --> 00:05:59.660
and that voter education.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.744
This arrow right over here,

00:06:00.744 --> 00:06:05.130
where the party platform is
influencing the government

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.810
as it operates,

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.840
a lot of this happens
through the committee

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.533
and party leadership
system in legislatures.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.190
You have roles like majority party leader,

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.550
majority party whip,

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.880
minority party leader,

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.740
and a lot of what they are doing

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.120
is trying to take that party platform,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.442
what the party wants done,

00:06:23.442 --> 00:06:26.150
and make sure that all of
these folks in government,

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.070
who not, who,

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.340
just like the citizenry,

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.780
don't always believe the exact same thing.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.880
They might be representing
very different regions.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.670
They might have different personal views.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.080
But to try to bring them in
line with the party platform.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.490
And the idea is that if
they unify around things

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.740
and have a united front,

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.770
that they're going to have more influence.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:45.603
Now, of course,

00:06:45.603 --> 00:06:47.070
that can sometimes go the other way,

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.420
where both major parties are doing that,

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.620
where it's all or nothing,

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.350
you can get to a situation of gridlock,

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.520
which we've talked about in other videos.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.587
But the big takeaway here,

00:06:55.587 --> 00:06:59.320
the common classification
for the institutions

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.760
that link the people to the government,

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.160
linkage institutions,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.170
that allow individuals to
communicate their preferences

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.750
to policy-makers,

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.820
are elections, the media, interest groups,

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.090
and political parties.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.820
And political parties in particular.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.780
They have a platform.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.000
What do they represent?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.060
They mobilize and educate voters.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.870
They recruit candidates
and manage their campaigns.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.580
And then once those candidates win,

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.583
they have this leadership structure

00:07:24.583 --> 00:07:26.484
that tries to get them to be aligned,

00:07:26.484 --> 00:07:29.883
especially around that party platform.
