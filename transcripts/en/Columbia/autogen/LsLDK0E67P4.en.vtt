was a decision no it's like if a group

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:14.370
was a decision no it's like if a group
 

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:18.040
was a decision no it's like if a group
of people could decide

which inheritance we would like to have

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:21.550
which inheritance we would like to have
 

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:25.000
which inheritance we would like to have
and I think that actually we can choose

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.010
and I think that actually we can choose
 

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.160
and I think that actually we can choose
these as well and I think this is a

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:27.170
these as well and I think this is a
 

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:31.509
these as well and I think this is a
quite modern condition so to me it's

00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519
quite modern condition so to me it's
 

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:35.259
quite modern condition so to me it's
very remarkable that we have cell

00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:35.269
very remarkable that we have cell

an author I think that the architecture

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:48.620
an author I think that the architecture
 

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:52.269
an author I think that the architecture
now has this kind of very light way to

00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:52.279
now has this kind of very light way to
 

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:54.850
now has this kind of very light way to
be done so when this group they could

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:54.860
be done so when this group they could
 

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.079
be done so when this group they could
sometime be combined with other groups

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.910
almost like a public space for lectures
and we tried to to keep it active when

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:08.920
and we tried to to keep it active when
 

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:14.820
and we tried to to keep it active when
when we're not working so um today um so

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:14.830
when we're not working so um today um so
 

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.250

we've been working mostly recently on

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:17.260
we've been working mostly recently on
 

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.440
we've been working mostly recently on
large-scale projects but today we we

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:19.450
large-scale projects but today we we
 

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:20.940
large-scale projects but today we we
decided to show a little bit of

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:20.950
decided to show a little bit of
 

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.950
decided to show a little bit of
everything so wouldn't give the

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960
everything so wouldn't give the
 

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.840
everything so wouldn't give the
impression that we only do large-scale

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:24.850
impression that we only do large-scale
 

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.530
impression that we only do large-scale
schemes so start with those furniture

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:28.540
schemes so start with those furniture

I'm not saying so um they asked me to to

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:51.880
I'm not saying so um they asked me to to
 

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.790
I'm not saying so um they asked me to to
try to come up with a furniture piece

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:53.800
try to come up with a furniture piece
 

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.850
try to come up with a furniture piece
that could be you know easily stored and

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:56.860
that could be you know easily stored and
 

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.880
that could be you know easily stored and
put away for a conference center day so

00:23:59.880 --> 00:23:59.890
put away for a conference center day so
 

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.790
put away for a conference center day so
that the space good could still be

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:02.800
that the space good could still be
 

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.550
that the space good could still be
flexible so they use for other events as

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:05.560
flexible so they use for other events as
 

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.570
flexible so they use for other events as
well so I came up with this idea that

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:08.580
well so I came up with this idea that
 

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:12.270
well so I came up with this idea that
you know as like a single sheet of metal

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:12.280
you know as like a single sheet of metal
 

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.360
you know as like a single sheet of metal
could be cut and you would fold the

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:15.370
could be cut and you would fold the
 

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.240
could be cut and you would fold the
pieces with some sort of hinges and then

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:18.250
pieces with some sort of hinges and then
 

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.580
pieces with some sort of hinges and then
you could you know either hang it on the

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:20.590
you could you know either hang it on the
 

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:23.340
you could you know either hang it on the
wall or put it away or even leave it on

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:23.350
wall or put it away or even leave it on
 

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.670
wall or put it away or even leave it on
the floor so was struggling with the

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:25.680
the floor so was struggling with the
 

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.740
the floor so was struggling with the
details of that for a week and of course

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:28.750
details of that for a week and of course
 

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.230
details of that for a week and of course
I couldn't figure it out it was looking

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:31.240
I couldn't figure it out it was looking
 

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.870
I couldn't figure it out it was looking

to to make it look like it was very thin
on the tabletop but I really couldn't

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.010
on the tabletop but I really couldn't
 

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:46.280
on the tabletop but I really couldn't
make it so in the end Michael just said

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:46.290
make it so in the end Michael just said
 

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:49.520
make it so in the end Michael just said
and Marin you know Blum that's very nice

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:49.530
and Marin you know Blum that's very nice
 

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.700
and Marin you know Blum that's very nice
but why don't we try something else and

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:51.710
but why don't we try something else and
 

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:56.480
but why don't we try something else and
so they proposed and they did that's

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:56.490
so they proposed and they did that's
 

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.180
so they proposed and they did that's
their final design for the for the

00:24:59.180 --> 00:24:59.190
their final design for the for the
 

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.610
their final design for the for the
conference room which is of course much

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:01.620
conference room which is of course much
 

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:05.000
conference room which is of course much
more clever for for the use of the space

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.010
more clever for for the use of the space
 

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.400
more clever for for the use of the space
you open up the table and you can have

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:07.410
you open up the table and you can have
 

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:09.680
you open up the table and you can have
you know book launches there with drinks

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:09.690
you know book launches there with drinks
 

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:14.210
you know book launches there with drinks
on the other side so this was I came

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.220
on the other side so this was I came
 

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.280
on the other side so this was I came
here the Colombian I was doing survey of

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:16.290
here the Colombian I was doing survey of
 

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.950
here the Colombian I was doing survey of
the space of thought it was was fun to

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960
the space of thought it was was fun to
 

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.530
the space of thought it was was fun to
show that but when I came back to to

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:21.540
show that but when I came back to to
 

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:26.840
show that but when I came back to to
Brazil I decided to resurrect my idea of

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:26.850
Brazil I decided to resurrect my idea of
 

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:28.280
Brazil I decided to resurrect my idea of
the table that I couldn't develop their

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:28.290
the table that I couldn't develop their
 

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:34.190
the table that I couldn't develop their
so in this case now it's it's I had to

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200
so in this case now it's it's I had to
 

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.070
so in this case now it's it's I had to
extrude the the plank so it could be

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080
extrude the the plank so it could be
 

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.090
extrude the the plank so it could be
like a slab in terms of structure I

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:41.100
like a slab in terms of structure I
 

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.760
like a slab in terms of structure I
could solve the details more easily so

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:43.770
could solve the details more easily so
 

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:47.540
could solve the details more easily so
the idea is I nicknamed it the tatami

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:47.550
the idea is I nicknamed it the tatami
 

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.640
the idea is I nicknamed it the tatami
table so it has the proportions of at

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:49.650
table so it has the proportions of at
 

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:52.810
table so it has the proportions of at
the timing six feet by by three feet and

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:52.820
the timing six feet by by three feet and
 

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.960
the timing six feet by by three feet and
the basic modules three inches square

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:56.970
the basic modules three inches square
 

00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:00.830
the basic modules three inches square
and so I have the lights or 30 inches

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840
and so I have the lights or 30 inches
 

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.140
and so I have the lights or 30 inches
and the thickness of three inches so you

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:03.150
and the thickness of three inches so you
 

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:08.030
and the thickness of three inches so you
fold and fold it in a way that you can

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:08.040
fold and fold it in a way that you can
 

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.540
fold and fold it in a way that you can
basically carry it easily so that's the

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:11.550
basically carry it easily so that's the
 

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:17.240
basically carry it easily so that's the
final piece it looks like the massive

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:17.250
final piece it looks like the massive
 

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.460
final piece it looks like the massive
plank of wood but only the legs are

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:19.470
plank of wood but only the legs are
 

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:24.290
plank of wood but only the legs are
massive wood and and the tabletop is is

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:24.300
massive wood and and the tabletop is is
 

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.470
massive wood and and the tabletop is is
a light very light structure covered

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480
a light very light structure covered
 

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.840
a light very light structure covered
with wood laminate so it looks like a

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:29.850
with wood laminate so it looks like a
 

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:32.630
with wood laminate so it looks like a
massive blank and there is a actually

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640
massive blank and there is a actually
 

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.080
massive blank and there is a actually
the table the legs work as a giant screw

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:36.090
the table the legs work as a giant screw
 

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.750
the table the legs work as a giant screw
so as you screw to tighten it to an up

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760
so as you screw to tighten it to an up
 

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.030
so as you screw to tighten it to an up
to

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:39.040
to
 

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.390
to
a position where they way they stand

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.400
a position where they way they stand
 

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.950
a position where they way they stand
stable and it forms those irregular

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960
stable and it forms those irregular
 

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.040
stable and it forms those irregular
tabletop designs so this was a prototype

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:50.050
tabletop designs so this was a prototype
 

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:53.280
tabletop designs so this was a prototype
I made at the time for my my house and

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:53.290
I made at the time for my my house and
 

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:56.220
I made at the time for my my house and
also for my practice and then of course

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:56.230
also for my practice and then of course
 

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:59.910
also for my practice and then of course
we did variations on that this is the

00:26:59.910 --> 00:26:59.920
we did variations on that this is the
 

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.080
we did variations on that this is the
same table that when you get bored of

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:04.090
same table that when you get bored of
 

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:08.790
same table that when you get bored of
one finishing you can you know change it

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:08.800
one finishing you can you know change it
 

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.050
one finishing you can you know change it
it's basically the same same thing so

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:13.060
it's basically the same same thing so
 

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:17.670
it's basically the same same thing so
and this is going into production but

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:17.680
and this is going into production but
 

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.040
and this is going into production but
the the manufacturer asked to be in a

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:20.050
the the manufacturer asked to be in a
 

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:22.890
the the manufacturer asked to be in a
different proportion so sorry would sell

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:22.900
different proportion so sorry would sell
 

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.650
different proportion so sorry would sell
better so actually this would be will be

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:25.660
better so actually this would be will be
 

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:29.430
better so actually this would be will be
able to fold it and carry in the kind of

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440
able to fold it and carry in the kind of
 

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.230
able to fold it and carry in the kind of
the bag out of the store so it would be

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240
the bag out of the store so it would be
 

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.810
the bag out of the store so it would be
easily easily and kind of cheap also

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:36.820
easily easily and kind of cheap also
 

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.170
easily easily and kind of cheap also
like two hundred dollars at the most so

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:40.180
like two hundred dollars at the most so
 

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:42.330
like two hundred dollars at the most so
while of us do me this was also having

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:42.340
while of us do me this was also having
 

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.450
while of us do me this was also having
other ideas about furniture so and I was

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:45.460
other ideas about furniture so and I was
 

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.480
other ideas about furniture so and I was
invited by another industry to design a

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:48.490
invited by another industry to design a
 

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:50.670
invited by another industry to design a
table was a series of tables designed by

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:50.680
table was a series of tables designed by
 

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:55.050
table was a series of tables designed by
architects so I'm this is the unstable

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:55.060
architects so I'm this is the unstable
 

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:59.490
architects so I'm this is the unstable
the idea is that the tabletop looks like

00:27:59.490 --> 00:27:59.500
the idea is that the tabletop looks like
 

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:04.080
the idea is that the tabletop looks like
it's it's not it doesn't have really a

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:04.090
it's it's not it doesn't have really a
 

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:10.140
it's it's not it doesn't have really a
surface to be on top of so I try to make

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:10.150
surface to be on top of so I try to make
 

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:12.210
surface to be on top of so I try to make
it look very uncomfortable that as if

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:12.220
it look very uncomfortable that as if
 

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.730
it look very uncomfortable that as if
you would bump into it you know that the

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:14.740
you would bump into it you know that the
 

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.310
you would bump into it you know that the
table would just fall apart but actually

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:17.320
table would just fall apart but actually
 

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.860
table would just fall apart but actually
there is a quite complicated to tell you

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:19.870
there is a quite complicated to tell you
 

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:21.690
there is a quite complicated to tell you
to to make it look like that so it's

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:21.700
to to make it look like that so it's
 

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.499
to to make it look like that so it's
like a deception

00:28:24.499 --> 00:28:24.509
like a deception
 

00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:29.930
like a deception
really so although it looks like it's

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:29.940
really so although it looks like it's
 

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:33.319
really so although it looks like it's
it's going to you can also pull the

00:28:33.319 --> 00:28:33.329
it's going to you can also pull the
 

00:28:33.329 --> 00:28:36.680
it's going to you can also pull the
pieces and change the table top so this

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:36.690
pieces and change the table top so this
 

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:41.509
pieces and change the table top so this
was the only prototype they made and it

00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:41.519
was the only prototype they made and it
 

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:43.819
was the only prototype they made and it
never went into protection but hopefully

00:28:43.819 --> 00:28:43.829
never went into protection but hopefully
 

00:28:43.829 --> 00:28:47.539
never went into protection but hopefully
one day it will so this house was

00:28:47.539 --> 00:28:47.549
one day it will so this house was
 

00:28:47.549 --> 00:28:50.180
one day it will so this house was
developed by my my so it's a typical

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:50.190
developed by my my so it's a typical
 

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.669
developed by my my so it's a typical
typology that we work single-family

00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679
typology that we work single-family
 

00:28:52.679 --> 00:28:55.069
typology that we work single-family
houses I guess every every every

some it some some some kind of intimate
 

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.860
some it some some some kind of intimate
space underneath it so it defines the

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:42.870
space underneath it so it defines the
 

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:49.040
space underneath it so it defines the
place also even if it's an open space so

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:49.050

with lush lens forests and also in this
 

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:36.300
with lush lens forests and also in this
area so all this area is cut is cut

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:36.310
area so all this area is cut is cut
 

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.430

you know the borough's it separates the

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040
you know the borough's it separates the
 

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.910
you know the borough's it separates the
area so we did today we're talking about

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920
area so we did today we're talking about
 

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.380
area so we did today we're talking about
just the shooting center just to be

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:55.390
just the shooting center just to be
 

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:59.050
just the shooting center just to be
quick but we did the question center and

00:40:59.050 --> 00:40:59.060
quick but we did the question center and
 

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:02.650
quick but we did the question center and
the modern pentathlon the grass hockey

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:02.660
the modern pentathlon the grass hockey
 

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:06.610
the modern pentathlon the grass hockey
and the archer fields as well so this

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:06.620
and the archer fields as well so this
 

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.130
and the archer fields as well so this
the site plan the same the idea is to

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:09.140
the site plan the same the idea is to
 

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.890
the site plan the same the idea is to
have a cluster connected by pathway so

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:11.900
have a cluster connected by pathway so
 

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:13.630
have a cluster connected by pathway so
you can spend the entire day there

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:13.640
you can spend the entire day there
 

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:18.310
you can spend the entire day there
during the games and also this has

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:18.320
during the games and also this has
 

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.580
during the games and also this has
triggered a renovation of the entire

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:21.590
triggered a renovation of the entire
 

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:25.120
triggered a renovation of the entire
area with improvement of infrastructure

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:25.130
area with improvement of infrastructure
 

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:31.650
area with improvement of infrastructure
and an urban fixtures as well so this is

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:31.660
and an urban fixtures as well so this is
 

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:37.470
and an urban fixtures as well so this is
the shooting center this is basically a

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:37.480
the shooting center this is basically a
 

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.570
the shooting center this is basically a
series of pavilions shooting ranges

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:40.580
series of pavilions shooting ranges
 

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:44.980
series of pavilions shooting ranges
connected by a spine circulation for

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:44.990
connected by a spine circulation for
 

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:46.840
connected by a spine circulation for
some reasons they are all have to face

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:46.850
some reasons they are all have to face
 

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:49.330
some reasons they are all have to face
south so you approach you have the

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:49.340
south so you approach you have the
 

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.100
south so you approach you have the
entrance of the building you know

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:51.110
entrance of the building you know
 

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:53.050

which is quite dramatic when when

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280
which is quite dramatic when when
 

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.250
which is quite dramatic when when
they're practicing or when there is

through the line of fire and so we have

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480
through the line of fire and so we have
 

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.870
through the line of fire and so we have
this long building overall we have

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:07.880
this long building overall we have
 

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.080
this long building overall we have
almost like one kilometer from one point

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:11.090
almost like one kilometer from one point
 

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:13.930
almost like one kilometer from one point

quite quite amazing there a photo with
 

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:29.050
quite quite amazing there a photo with
the mountains and back and so this is

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:29.060
the mountains and back and so this is
 

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:33.520
the mountains and back and so this is
just like the overall organization after

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:33.530
just like the overall organization after
 

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:34.780

shooting center it's pretty like a

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:34.790
shooting center it's pretty like a
 

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:36.940
shooting center it's pretty like a
diagram actually we have the spine of

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:36.950
diagram actually we have the spine of
 

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:39.430

circulation connected to the to the

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440
circulation connected to the to the
 

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.460
circulation connected to the to the
shooting ranges and the public go up the

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:42.470
shooting ranges and the public go up the
 

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:45.040
shooting ranges and the public go up the
ramp and and they flow independently

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:45.050
ramp and and they flow independently
 

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:47.620
ramp and and they flow independently
from the accredited which are all go

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:47.630
from the accredited which are all go
 

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:50.290
from the accredited which are all go
from a separate entrance and so you

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:50.300
from a separate entrance and so you
 

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.630
from a separate entrance and so you
don't have a mixture of flows in terms

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640
don't have a mixture of flows in terms
 

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.890
don't have a mixture of flows in terms

about Brazilian architecture I think it

01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:39.550
about Brazilian architecture I think it
 

01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:43.020
about Brazilian architecture I think it
it gives many interesting examples of

is part of its charm for sure but

01:29:28.979 --> 01:29:28.989
is part of its charm for sure but
 

01:29:28.989 --> 01:29:32.040

quite you know a mess and you know the

01:29:37.229 --> 01:29:37.239
quite you know a mess and you know the
 

01:29:37.239 --> 01:29:39.660
quite you know a mess and you know the
only thing that we don't really I mean

01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:39.670
only thing that we don't really I mean
 

01:29:39.670 --> 01:29:43.050
only thing that we don't really I mean
I'm speaking for myself we don't really

01:29:43.050 --> 01:29:43.060
I'm speaking for myself we don't really
 

01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:47.189
I'm speaking for myself we don't really
have you know a strategy or method which

01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199
have you know a strategy or method which
 

01:29:47.199 --> 01:29:50.640
have you know a strategy or method which
is very rigorous with we just try to do

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:50.650
is very rigorous with we just try to do
 

01:29:50.650 --> 01:29:54.300
is very rigorous with we just try to do
it in a way that we don't celebrate it

01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:54.310
it in a way that we don't celebrate it
 

01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:57.360
it in a way that we don't celebrate it
or or we don't you know go against it so

01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:57.370
or or we don't you know go against it so
 

01:29:57.370 --> 01:30:00.149
or or we don't you know go against it so
so this is a thin line that we are

01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159
so this is a thin line that we are
 

01:30:00.159 --> 01:30:02.140
so this is a thin line that we are
always trying to do you know

01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:02.150
always trying to do you know
 

01:30:02.150 --> 01:30:05.560
always trying to do you know
not to fix a situation which is almost

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:05.570
not to fix a situation which is almost
 

01:30:05.570 --> 01:30:09.729
not to fix a situation which is almost
like unfixable and not you know to also

01:30:09.729 --> 01:30:09.739
like unfixable and not you know to also
 

01:30:09.739 --> 01:30:13.950
like unfixable and not you know to also
be celebrating a sort of very extreme

01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:13.960
be celebrating a sort of very extreme
 

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:16.300
be celebrating a sort of very extreme
contrast that can be very interesting

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:16.310
contrast that can be very interesting
 

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:19.390
contrast that can be very interesting
but also very problematic so we are

01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:19.400
but also very problematic so we are
 

01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.419
but also very problematic so we are
always dealing with those issues and

01:30:21.419 --> 01:30:21.429
always dealing with those issues and
 

01:30:21.429 --> 01:30:26.590
always dealing with those issues and
particularly what we try to do is

01:30:26.590 --> 01:30:26.600
particularly what we try to do is
 

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:31.510
particularly what we try to do is
basically we're very interested also in

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520
basically we're very interested also in
 

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:35.169
basically we're very interested also in
the and one of the very good things

01:30:35.169 --> 01:30:35.179
the and one of the very good things
 

01:30:35.179 --> 01:30:37.060
the and one of the very good things
about working in Brazil is that you can

01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:37.070
about working in Brazil is that you can
 

01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:39.850
about working in Brazil is that you can
work on the inside on the outside and

01:30:39.850 --> 01:30:39.860
work on the inside on the outside and
 

01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:42.070
work on the inside on the outside and
have this this transition between the

01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080
have this this transition between the
 

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:44.770
have this this transition between the
inside and the outside and much fluid

01:30:44.770 --> 01:30:44.780
inside and the outside and much fluid
 

01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:47.080
inside and the outside and much fluid
weight and then another climate so this

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:47.090
weight and then another climate so this
 

01:30:47.090 --> 01:30:50.320
weight and then another climate so this
is also something that we have to do but

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:50.330
is also something that we have to do but
 

01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:53.320
is also something that we have to do but
some pollo school as Angela mentioned is

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:53.330
some pollo school as Angela mentioned is
 

01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:58.149
some pollo school as Angela mentioned is
more is much more you have more method

01:30:58.149 --> 01:30:58.159
more is much more you have more method
 

01:30:58.159 --> 01:31:00.729
