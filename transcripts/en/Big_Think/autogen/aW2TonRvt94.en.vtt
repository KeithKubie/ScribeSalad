if you go and look around the world of
 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.590
if you go and look around the world of
new media right now they will tell you

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600
new media right now they will tell you
 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.129
new media right now they will tell you
that everybody has a $500 smartphone and

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.759
people as a form of a relationship and
so when you make assumptions like that

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769
so when you make assumptions like that
 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.930
so when you make assumptions like that
you stop a technology from being useful

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940
you stop a technology from being useful
 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.089
you stop a technology from being useful
in developing world even before they've

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099
in developing world even before they've
 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.280
in developing world even before they've
looked at what it's utility is right for

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290
looked at what it's utility is right for
 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.420
looked at what it's utility is right for
the beginning you've said this is not

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430
the beginning you've said this is not
 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.759
the beginning you've said this is not
for you this is not your total to use

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769
for you this is not your total to use
 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.469
for you this is not your total to use
and so those are the fundamental issues

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:07.479
and so those are the fundamental issues
 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.479
and so those are the fundamental issues
that have to be addressed is are we

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489
that have to be addressed is are we
 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.539
that have to be addressed is are we
assuming that these tools can be used

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549
assuming that these tools can be used
 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.509
assuming that these tools can be used
appropriately and and I think then

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519
appropriately and and I think then
 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.039
appropriately and and I think then
there's the logistical issues the fact

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049
there's the logistical issues the fact
 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.930
there's the logistical issues the fact
that the phone is a primary interface

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940
that the phone is a primary interface
 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.909
that the phone is a primary interface

about one laptop per child and things
 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.260
about one laptop per child and things
like that and I think it's much more
