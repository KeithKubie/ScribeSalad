00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.300
Everybody loves a good movie theory, and literally thousands of them have been conceived over the years.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.800
Could Thanos be an evolved version of Red Skull in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.300
Did Patrick Bateman imagine the murderous events of American Psycho?

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.000
And is Emily actually Andy's mother in the Toy Story movies?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.400
Those are just a few examples thought up by movie buffs; and Star Wars fans are no different...

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.800
In fact there are probably more theories about Star Wars than there are about any other movie franchise in existence.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.700
Such is the level of enthusiasm from the Star Wars fan base.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.900
&lt; "It's hard to create problems, and certainly then, confirm them."

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.500
In this video will run you through just a few of those theories to have been thought up in recent years.

and before we start can you guess the movie from these emojis?

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.200
stay tuned for the answer at the end of our video and be sure to keep watching

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.700
for fun trivia questions and fun facts along the way

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:03.700
&lt; "And these... blast points... too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial Stormtroopers are so precise."

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.400
One of the most well known traits of Star Wars' Stormtroopers is their terrible aim.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.330
Seriously they might as well be firing jelly from their blasters.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.600
They don't even hit a single main protagonist on the whole saga.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.600
Those guys couldn't hit a barn door from 5 yards away, could they?

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.100
This particular theory suggests that Stormtroopers might not actually be as useless as popular culture has made them out to be.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.500
Why? Well, because the Force is actually responsible for their poor aim.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.500
In 2016's Rogue One, the blind, Chirrut Imwe, walks through a barrage of Stormtrooper blasts without getting hit.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.000
"I'm one with The Force. The Force is with me."

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.700
While his buddy, Baze Malbus, gets hit almost instantly.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.000
The thing is, Imwe is chanting about The Force the whole time.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.500
The fact that he is Force-sensitive protects him against the blasts.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.000
It would explain why the likes of Luke, Leia, Obi-Wan, and those near to them

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.800
avoid getting hit in all of their appearances.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.100
By the way would you like to know a really fun fact about Stormtroopers?

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.869
Well stick around till the end and we'll give you one!

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.500
&gt; "Well, then, the Droid does belong to you."
&lt; "I don't seem to remember ever owning a Droid."

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.800
Having watched the prequel trilogy in which Obi-wan Kenobi becomes very

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.580
familiar with both C-3PO and R2-D2. It was later highlighted as something of a plot hole

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.000
in 1977's A New Hope when the veteran Jedi appeared to not recognize the two droids.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.500
&lt; "Hello there."
&gt; [beeps in response]

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.300
However this particular theory suggests that she actually did.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.000
&lt; "Very interesting."

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
When Luke suggests that R2 belongs with him, Obi-Wan responds by saying, "I don't seem to remember owning a Droid."

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.100
But that is technically true, and doesn't actually suggest that he doesn't know who R2 is.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.000
Moreover Obi-wan fairly nonchalantly mentioned that R2D2 should be able to interpret the entire Imperial Network

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.140
which is an incredibly bold thing to assume if he doesn't know what R2 is truly capable of.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.000
It actually makes far more sense to assume that he knows exactly what R2 is capable of, and did in fact recognize him.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.600
Which removes the annoying plot hole that so many people claimed was gaping.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.600
Are you convinced? Let us know.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.500
2016's Rogue One has some pretty sweet reveals in it.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.200
Arguably the coolest of all those reveals was the fact that Darth Vader was living In an awesome-looking castle on Mustafar.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.800
the planet where he lost his legs and became terribly scarred from a duel with obi-wan Kenobi.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.329
Seriously, the place wouldn't have looked out of place in Mordor.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.800
Obviously this showcased how terrifying and badass Vader is

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.290
but one theory suggests that it points towards something else happening going forward

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.400
Could it be where Kylo Ren headed after the events 2015's The Force Awakens?

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.500
It's no secret hat Ren is absolutely obsessed with his grandfather's legacy.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.000
So it certainly makes sense that he would like to inhabit the spectacular castle that he once lived in.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.600
The castle style also suits Ren's look and aura to a "T" which makes the theory make even more sense.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.400
Is Vader's awesome lava castle somewhere you'd like to see the evil Kylo Ren inhabiting going forward in the Star Wars franchise?

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.300
Make sure you tell us your thoughts about the prospect.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.200
&gt; "You will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open."

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.600
&lt; "I will remove these restraints and leave the cell with the door open."

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.000
Okay, Now we're coming to a trio of theories about the identity and heritage of Daisy Ridley's 'Rey' in the Star Wars franchise.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
The first of which involves a certain Jedi that's not the one you might think.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.400
The common conclusion to come to regarding Rey is that she's related to Luke Skywalker in some way,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.000
but this theory suggests she may actually be related to Obi-Wan Kenobi, more specifically she's his granddaughter.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.130
The reason for that theory? Well, like Rey, Obi-Wan was once a rebellious young Jedi.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.600
It was Obi-Wan's voice Rey heard calling out her name during her vision induced by a lightsaber.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.100
"Rey?"

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.450
Apart from C-3PO, only Obi-Wan and Rey have British accents in the franchise.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.200
Seriously, even other British actors in the franchise speak with American accents.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.000
She uses the Jedi Mind Trick which is Obi-Wan's trademark ability.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.000
&gt; "Move along."

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.000
&lt; "Move along! Move along!"

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.900
Her costume is similar to Obi-Wan's in the prequel trilogy,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.600
and, well, we could go on but you get the point here.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.700
The bigger question however is this: Who did Obi-Wan get it on with in order to extend his bloodline?

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.839
There seems to be only like... five or six women in the entire galaxy, so, could Rey be a  Kenobi?

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.400
Are you more convinced by one of the next two theories?

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.000
&gt; "You know how to use one of those?"
 
&lt; "Yeah... You pull the trigger."
 
&gt; "...a little bit more to it than that."

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.100
Alternatively could Rey actually be a Solo?

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.590
There's a lot less evidence pointing toward that being the case than there is for the previous theory,

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.000
but the evidence that does exist for this theory is fairly compelling.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.400
Those who have speculated that she could be the daughter of Han Solo and Leia Organa

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.000
believe so because that would make her Kylo Ren's sister

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.890
and Ren totally freaked out when he heard a mention of a girl

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.380
"What girl?!"

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.000
Did he know his sister was nearby?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.500
Also Rey bonds extremely quickly with Han Solo upon meeting him.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.000
It's almost as if the bond is so natural that it's a father-daughter bond.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.379
Moreover Rey shows a real aptitude for piloting the Millennium Falcon

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.000
which could be due to the fact that there's a genetic component involved in such a skill.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.500
This theory does make you wonder why Han and Leia would have abandoned Rey on a desert planet all those years ago.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.910
But maybe she was just an incredibly irritating little kid?

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.300
Do you think there's any chance at all that this theory could be true? Give us your thoughts.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.109
Still there's one more Rey theory to get through yet, so hold that thought for now

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.100
"You will find that it is you who are mistaken..."

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.899
"...about a great, many, things."

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.600
The final theory regarding Rey's heritage is a bit more out there

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.200
And it's one that in spite of how much they want to know fans might not like it

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.800
if it turns out to be true. Could Rey actually be a Palpatine?

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:35.000
That's right there's actually a theory that suggests Rey could be a Sith descendant and have a gene that will go on to make her incredibly wrinkly and gross.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.000
&gt; "The emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation."

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
An extremely well researched and compelling case for Rey's villainous ancestry has been made.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.049
Sith don't adhere to the same moral code as Jedi which means that there's every chance

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.000
Emperor Palpatine could have sowed his seed across all corners of the Galaxy.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.600
A number of Rey's lightsaber techniques are very reminiscent of the way Palpatine Wields his lightsaber

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.000
and the musical score associated with her character isn't too dissimilar to his.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Nobody wants to imagine the evil Emperor doing-the-deed, but sadly this theory forces us to do exactly that.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.500
Could this crazy theory actually be true or are those behind it just being silly?

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.000
By withholding her back-story, Disney has done a great job building up hype around Rey,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and her role in the unfolding Star Wars saga... To say nothing of the films themselves.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:24.140
Fact is, with little to go on but a few cryptic references, fans are left to speculate on how Rey fits into the larger story.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.779
Fan speculation is what drives the series.

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:31.200
Disney has hit upon a terrific marketing tool to keep us all on the hook for the next installment.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.500
We suspect they'll do the same for the ninth episode due out in 2019.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.000
So don't expect to get all the answers with the release of The Last Jedi later this year.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
We're eager to know more about Rey, Finn, and the rest of the characters. Aren't you?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Post your opinion in the comment section below.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.120
We're really interested to hear your thoughts on this.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.659
From the moment the first Star Wars movie was released back in 1977,

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:57.000
Darth Vader has been thought of as the out-and-out villain of the franchise.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
The prequel trilogy then showed How he became evil having previously been a promising Jedi,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
but he was considered completely bad, dark, and nefarious from A New Hope onwards. But is that actually the case?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.600
This theory suggests Vader wasn't fully evil until after the first installment of the Star Wars franchise.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.000
When you think about it it actually makes a lot of sense.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
In A New Hope, Vader is a lot more pleasant than when he cuts his son's hand off in Empire Strikes Back;

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Apart from one Force Choke incident he's generally quite polite to his Death Star co-workers and in Rogue One

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.289
it actually explains what made him become more evil thereafter: He let the Death Star plans slip through his fingers on two occasions and was unable to prevent

00:08:30.289 --> 00:08:35.989
the rebels from destroying it. Moreover he found out that the person responsible for its destruction was his son not to mention the fact that

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:41.089
he actually found out said son was alive and that the Emperor had been lying to him for decades prior to the  events of the movie.

00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:48.000
What do you think? Was Vader actually redeemable up until then? Was he only fully evil after the events of A New Hope? Tell us your thoughts.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.579
&lt; "Did you ever hear The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?"

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.000
Well earlier in the video we looked at three different theories about the heritage of Rey,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and now it's time to look at two about the identity of the mysterious Supreme Leader, Snoke.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.269
This first theory suggests that Snoke is actually a Sith Lord.

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:08.500
It'll probably be one we already know. That has led some people to believe that

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.160
Snoke is actually Palpatine's mentor Darth Plagueis.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.769
He certainly seems to be the best candidate although some people have theorized he could even be Darth Vader

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.010
or Palpatine himself as it would certainly make a lot of sense in the prequel trilogy.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.800
Plagueis supposedly discovered the secret to extending life and preventing death.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:28.740
&lt; "He could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create... Life."

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.990
It was a technique Palpatine apparently stole when he murdered his mentor,

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.300
but bearing in mind that he had discovered the key to NOT DYING

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.169
How could he possibly have been killed at all? Maybe Plagueis lives on?

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:44.600
Continuing to preach the ways of the Dark Side as Supreme Leader Snoke and their similar theme music would certainly back up this theory.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.109
Or could Snoke be a more well-known character from the Star Wars mythos?

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.620
Let's move on to the next theory

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.719
So it's on to our next theory about Supreme Leader Snoke; and this one suggests that he might actually be none other than Boba Fett.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.000
We really don't know that much about Snoke, other than the fact that he appears to be terribly disfigured.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.409
Could that disfigurement have occurred through being half-digested in the stomach of a Sarlacc? The people behind this theory say, "Yes."

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:11.119
Snoke could actually be the thought-dead Boba Fett, returned from the depths of Jabba the Hutt's Sarlacc Pit.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:16.300
Remember how it was Han Solo who accidentally ignited Fett's rocket pack, sending him into the Sarlacc's mouth?

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:23.200
It would certainly explain why Snoke made such a concerted effort to corrupt Solo's son, as Boba would definitely want revenge on Han if he was still alive.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.019
Can you imagine Snoke with a rocket pack though? [laughs] That would look pretty damn ridiculous.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.040
Do you think the theory is plausible? Who else do you think Snoke could be? Let us know!

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.600
As if Jar Jar Binks wasn't universally hated enough already...

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.900
&lt; "Me-sa called Jar Jar Binks! Me-sa your humble servant."

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.000
"That won't be necessary."

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.500
Seriously we all despise him, right? This recent theory will potentially make you hate him even more!

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:50.100
It suggests that the annoying Gungan is actually an accomplished Dark Force user and a secret Sith Lord.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.000
Jar jar appeared in all three installments of the Star Wars prequel Trilogy

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.130
Albeit only extremely briefly in 2005's Revenge of the Sith, and he just didn't win fans over at all.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:02.269
But was he actually a Dark Force user orchestrating events in secret? Let's look at the evidence.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.900
He does all kinds of clumsy stuff that always seems to work out like acrobatic dives, and leg sweeps.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.970
He seems to display skill in the martial Arts form known as Zui Quan [醉拳]

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.570
or 'Drunken Fist' which, while uneasy on the eyes is very effective.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:18.709
He seems to get lucky a lot, but Obi-Wan has suggested that luck doesn't exist in the Star Wars universe.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:23.149
He seems to make subtle gestures at pivotal moments such as when he's offered a seat on the Galactic Senate.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.200
And when he's promoted to Bomba General of the Gungan Grand Army.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:31.000
&lt; "General?!"
 
[Sighing exhale] *Thud*

00:11:31.059 --> 00:11:34.889
Suggesting he's performing mind tricks in order to make them happen the theory also suggests

00:11:34.889 --> 00:11:37.289
he's in cahoots with Palpatine as they grew up on a nearby planets.

00:11:37.479 --> 00:11:39.899
Which is like being next-door neighbors in the Star Wars universe.

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:42.959
And he can be seen hanging out with the Emperor in Revenge of the Sith.

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:48.000
Could jar Jar's idiocy be an elaborate act performed by an evil genius trying to deceive everyone?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.139
What do you think?

00:11:49.139 --> 00:11:51.100
&lt; "Go!"
 
&gt; "I need a weapon!"

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.100
&lt; "You have one!"

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.649
*Th-pew!* [into low hum]

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:59.800
Oh! And that fun fact about stormtroopers we promised you at the start?

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.299
Well here it is: Stormtroopers were originally intended to wield lightsabers!

00:12:03.299 --> 00:12:07.319
That's right the elegant energy blades were meant to be far more commonplace in the star Wars universe

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:12.269
Prior to George Lucas limiting them to Jedi and Sith. Hey, the Stormtroopers would probably been

00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:15.149
far more successful when it came to hitting things if they had lightsabers, right?

00:12:15.249 --> 00:12:18.868
