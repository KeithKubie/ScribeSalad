1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.830
No.
Let's take a closer look at the second major strategy,
which is tolerance.

2
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.940
Failure to tolerate inflammatory costs is well illustrated in the 1918 flu

3
00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:13.864
epidemic.

4
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.270
<v 0>It lasted from January,
1918 to December,</v>

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.490
1920 coming right at the end of the first world war.

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.930
It infected about 500 million people and it killed 50 to 130 million people or

8
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.020
about 3% of the population of the planet.

9
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.720
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.240
<v 0>Most of the victims,
and this is the interesting point,</v>

11
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.330
most of the victims were healthy young adults with strong

12
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.690
<v 1>immune responses.</v>

13
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.580
<v 0>The strain of flu was h one n one and that label refers to the variance of the</v>

14
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.670
Hemagglutinin.
That's the age and the Neuro Amena days.

15
00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:55.010
That's the end to the,

16
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.420
to the variance of those two genes whose products are displayed on the surface

17
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:03.110
of the virus,
and they are the ones that interact with the host immune system,

18
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.500
the virus,
he listens overexpression of cytokines and chemo and chemo kinds.

19
00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:16.501
It triggers what's called a cytokine storm that promotes inflammation.

20
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.400
People experiencing the cytokine storm most strongly were the ones with the

21
00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:25.280
healthiest immune systems that could react the most strongly.

22
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:30.020
Their lungs filled with fluid and many of the victims then died of secondary

23
00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:31.160
bacterial pneumonia.

24
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.980
<v 1>Okay,</v>

25
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.510
<v 0>so this is an example,</v>

26
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.050
both of incompatible defenses against viral and bacterial infections and a

27
00:01:40.331 --> 00:01:45.010
failure to tolerate inflammatory damage in a vital organ.
The Lung,

28
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.643
<v 1>okay,</v>

29
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.690
<v 0>here we have graphs in the top showing the influenza case rates by age groups.</v>

30
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:54.570
So this is the rate of clinical influenza here,

31
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:59.571
and what you see is that it was fairly high in infants and juveniles,

32
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:03.960
and then it declined with age.
However,
down here in the lower panel,

33
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:08.100
we see the rates of bacterial pneumonia and mortality.

34
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.030
So the percentage who had pneumonia here is in blue.

35
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:17.031
And you can see it spikes at about 20 to 2020 to 30 years of age and then drops

36
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.250
and it continues to drop all the way through to older people.

37
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.030
And then the influenza and pneumonia related mortality rate here is in red.

38
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.500
And that's highly interesting because very young people between the ages of five

39
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:39.270
and 10 had very little mortality rates and you would expect higher mortality

40
00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:41.640
rates in the very old,
and they do climb someone,

41
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.510
but look at the spike in mortality rates of people who are right about 30 years

42
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:48.620
old.
So that is,
uh,

43
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.340
a clear signal that the body is responding inappropriately,

44
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.820
not tolerating the infection and inducing a response that made possible

45
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:00.910
subsequent bacterial pneumonia.

46
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.690
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.690
<v 0>So the main idea on inflammatory tolerance is that hosts use inflammation to</v>

48
00:03:09.661 --> 00:03:14.661
reduce infection intensity until the cost of the immune response is larger than

49
00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:17.820
the cost of infection.
In the absence of inflammation.

50
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.320
If those people in the 1918 flu epidemic had been obeying that rule properly,

51
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.150
many,
many fewer would've died.
However,
this is not what happened in that case.

52
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.080
A classic case of tolerance is Simeon immuno virus in its natural hosts.

53
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.860
For example,
African green monkeys.

54
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.840
This is the primate analog of HIV in humans.

55
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.410
The monkeys have the pathogen,
it replicates in them.

56
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.690
It produces viral loads similar to those in humans who have HIV.

57
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.110
But the monkeys do not progress to a disease that re resembles aids.

58
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.080
The mechanisms include these,

59
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.100
they resolve the immune reaction soon after being infected.

60
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.360
There are fewer target cells which are infected and they are protected from

61
00:04:14.361 --> 00:04:15.530
mother infant transmission.

62
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.460
So they have co evolved with this virus for quite a while and this is how

63
00:04:19.461 --> 00:04:20.294
they've responded.

64
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.590
<v 0>These mechanisms include low immune activation and a lack of disease
progression.</v>

66
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.310
So they resolve the innate immune response quickly.

67
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.640
They down modulate uh,

68
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.070
CD three TCR that is signaling they maintain mucosal integrity and a t cell,

69
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.640
a certain population of t cells in the gut and they have limited the infection

70
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.680
of CD four plus t cells,
which are one of the targets,

71
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.760
uh,
in our immune system when HIV infects humans,

72
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.050
that leads to a low chronic level of chronic immune activation.

73
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.560
There is minimal bystander immunopathology.

74
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.690
There are low levels of t cell activation and a pop ptosis.

75
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.260
There was a lack of microbial translocation and there is preserved homeostasis

76
00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:20.260
of t cell populations and lymph tissue architecture.

77
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.810
So all of that leads to no progression to AIDS in African green monkeys.

78
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

79
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.160
<v 0>There are other elements.</v>

80
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.500
The virus also has evolved the specific properties of Simeon.

81
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.041
Simeon,

82
00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:39.990
Immuno virus accessory proteins result in less pathogenesis in their natural

83
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:43.620
hosts with the virus has intrinsically lowered.
It's very,

84
00:05:43.621 --> 00:05:48.621
once the host has also evolved and natural hosts avoid progression to AIDS by

85
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:53.070
limiting chronic immune activation and bystander immunopathology as we just

86
00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:53.904
summarized,

87
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.090
the natural host also maintain the integrity of the gut mucosal barrier by

88
00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:01.490
preserving the mucosal immune environment.

89
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.290
Something that does not happen with age.
However,

90
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:11.291
this kind of tolerance which is so illuminating about the things that might be

91
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:15.920
done for a human disease also has its own costs.

92
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.590
Mechanisms that promote tolerance do so at the expense of other functions.

93
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.920
Tolerance has indirect costs.

94
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.510
If it does not completely remove the negative impact of an infection,

95
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.540
then of course the host has the remaining impacted deal with and that's the cost

96
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:37.370
of relying on tolerance rather than resistance.

97
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.380
Many animals tolerate parasitic infections,
for example,

98
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.990
but their health still does suffer somewhat.

99
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.470
So to summarize,
avoidance and tolerance are the best choices.

100
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:54.380
When resistance is either few tile or too costly,

101
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.200
resistance is the best choice.

102
00:06:57.201 --> 00:07:02.201
When avoidance is impossible and tolerance is going to be insufficient in most

103
00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:03.531
cases,

104
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:08.531
the strategies are combined in the defense response and failed.

105
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:11.600
Avoidance,
failed or excessive resistance,

106
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:16.310
and insufficient tolerance are all causes of infectious disease.
