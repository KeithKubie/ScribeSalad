00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.860
(singing) I wanna be a billionaire...

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.620
(singing, technically) So freaking baaad

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.300
And maybe you do too.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.520
The idea of becoming richer is so ingrained in US culture

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.600
that it's actually the central theme of the American dream.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.500
The idea of the American Dream is of course that anyone

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.660
from any background can get to the top of American society.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.600
But you don't have to take his word for it. Listen to these politicians try to sell you on it.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.820
The condition of your birth does not determine the outcome of your life in this country.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.580
We have never been a nation of haves and have-nots.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.640
We are a nation of haves and soon-to-haves.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.280
Or look at music and movies from literally any decade.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.880
(singing) And if I had a million dollars

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.300
(singing) If I had a million dollars

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.400
Show me the money!

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.800
Show me the moneeeey!

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.240
Bling bling. Every time I buy a new ride -- Bling bling.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.020
Hey, fam. I'm Imaeyen, and this Sunday we're explaining how to become a billionaire,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.160
Your odds of becoming the next Jeff Bezos,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.800
And how you can acquire so much wealth, you'll never ever have to worry about saving money

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.160
by filling your gas tank only half way so you can drive to work to film a video all about becoming a billionaire.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.000
Yaaaaaay, let's do this!

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.800
If you're watching this video, then you're probably in the top 100% of all income earners.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.320
And you want to get into an even more exclusive tier.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.740
There was a time when a million dollars was big money.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.180
Like that time there was a show dedicated to that premise.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.260
Okay, you ready?

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.760
Yes.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.100
Ok, here we go, let's play "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.420
(dramatic music)

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.780
Now a million bucks is just something a billionaire feels like when he's sick.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.340
The sad truth is that from the perspective of very rich people today, a million dollars is not a lot of money.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.760
That's venture capitalist and early Amazon investor Nick Hanauer.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.480
And he's one of the more than 1,500 billionaires globally.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.480
It's a very exclusive and elusive club that includes these names:

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.040
Cue money music!

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.560
(baller music plays)

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.140
The billionaire crew is a group where right now there are 8 people who have as much money

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.760
as 3.6 billion of the world's poorest people.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.340
Hanauer says that type of income disparity is bad for the wealthy and the poor

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.540
The challenge for business owners of wealth inequality

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.480
is that if most people have no money, then who will buy the stuff?

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.760
Sometimes it can be difficult to visualize just how big the financial discrepancy is.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.180
Trigger Warning!

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.480
I'm about to break down just how much money you'd have to have to be a billionaire.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.860
The average income for the top 1% is more than 1.1 million dollars.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.800
It's about 554 dollars per hour for a typical work week.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.020
And that's just the 1 percent's earnings.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.080
Billionaires are the top .00001%

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.480
They're making way more than that petty 554 dollars an hour.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.240
Let me give you some examples.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.500
Legendary investor Warren Buffett made what averaged out to be about $25,694 per minute in 2013.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.720
If that was your hourly rate, you could retire a millionaire in just...

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.640
40 minutes.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.340
Hashtag retirement goals.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.800
Here's president Donald Trump's favorite billionaire campaign callout in 2016.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.360
I have Carl Icahn's already endorsed me.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.740
Well, he made a lot less than Buffett -- just 14,492 dollars per minute, which makes him -- wait for it...

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.540
Still a billionaire.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.560
Meanwhile, the federal minimum wage is 7 dollars and 25 cents per hour.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.640
It'll probably take less than 25 years for the world to get its first trillionaire,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.680
And it'll likely be either this guy or that guy

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.920
Economist Mark Blyth says that's a problem.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.260
If I'm a trillionaire and I can buy politics, and we live in a democracy?

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.300
That's a problem.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.140
Before you get to trillions, you have to make a pitstop at billions

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.780
How easy is it for you to meet Bezos in the billionaire baller bracket?

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.260
Well, wikiHow says it's as simple as a 3-part plan,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
which includes creating opportunities,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.700
investing in a business,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.420
and maintaining wealth.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.940
What the article seems to imply is that everyone working on being in the 3-comma club

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.460
is already in the 2-comma club

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.080
But most people aren't.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.720
And the real very first step to being a billionaire

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.860
is taking a look at where you're starting

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.420
according to Richard Wilkinson, who's spent his entire career studying wealth.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.500
In countries of bigger income difference,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.440
a father's income is a much more important determinant of how well children do.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.460
So the tendency for rich fathers to have rich sons and poor fathers to have poor sons

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.380
is much stronger in more unequal societies.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.380
Got it.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.940
Classic life hack:

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.560
Have wealthy parents.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:57.100
And certainly if you take a look at the life paths of the wealthiest people in our country,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.460
not a one of them started at the bottom.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.200
From Bill Gates to Jeff Bezos to Sergey Brin to Larry Page

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:18.100
You know, these are people who came from families with resources, stability, and privilege.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.960
There are so many ways it's easy for wealthier people to make money versus their less rich counterparts

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.560
They have the benefits of financial safety nets if investments fail.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.880
And they sometimes decide their own salary.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.040
Think powerful CEOs

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.300
The average CEO makes 271 times what the average worker earns.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:42.740
The gap between CEOs at the top and the average worker in the same company

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.520
has increased enormously over time.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.500
And it looks as if CEOs' incomes are not related to company performance.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.940
A discussion about acquiring vast, golden, diamond-encrusted mountains of wealth

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.840
is also a conversation about income inequality.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.140
And good display of how this wealth gap has developed starts in the post-World War 2 era.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.480
(1940s radio voice) And the return of happier days.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.800
(back to Imaeyen's voice) Earnings grew fast.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.960
And at the same rate on all rungs of the income ladder.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.280
If you adjust for inflation, the money doubled.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.460
The gap between people higher and lower on the income ladder

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.760
was still substantial, but the disparity didn't actually change much during those decades.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.200
Then the economic slowdown of the 1970s happened.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.960
(1970s news anchor voice) A long line because the recession here has caused a 10 percent jump

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.740
each month in the number of those needing help.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.540
Those at the top continued to see their dollars grow,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.020
but the middle and lower income households saw their gains drop sharply.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.320
The disparity between the groups got bigger,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.780
which means you'll need to have stronger thighs to jump across that wage gap.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:52.820
There's basically been a slowdown to complete halt in terms of mobility between classes in the United States.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.160
It's as if the social ladder was much steeper or the rungs on the ladder further apart.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.540
Check out this chart.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.020
It shows just how much and how quickly

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.500
in the last 40 years the divide between the haves

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.620
and Marco Rubio's so-called "soon-to-haves"

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.880
has ballooned.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.220
The data basically says the easiest and most recommended way to become a billionaire...

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.360
Is to be a multimillionaire.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.900
The American Dream is based upon the idea that everyone and anyone in the US

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.360
has an equal opportunity to gain success and prosperity.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.120
It's code for "You too can be rich!"

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.280
But for regular people, how much do the stats support the implication of the American Dream?

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:38.040
How realistic is the American Dream? Wow, well, most dreams are not very realistic, are they?

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.960
The US is behind countries like Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Spain when it comes to social mobility.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.580
Our Northern neighbor, Canada, is better at seeing people rise in wealth and class.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.280
Even the developing nation of Pakistan is beating us in this department.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.240
The US has many obstacles that disproportionately keep the poor from gaining wealth.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.520
There are payday lenders targeting the less financially flexible,

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.600
And charging them interest rates as high as 1,900 percent;

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.220
credit card companies wooing applicants who aren't fiscally stable enough to pay on time,

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.260
and charging them higher interest rates;

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.620
and banks charging late fees and overdraft fees that can bleed already anemic accounts.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.940
It is extraordinarily expensive to be poor.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:24.260
It is expensive and difficult, for instance, not to own your own car.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:33.540
It is expensive to need to live far from your job because housing prices near your job are prohibitively expensive.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:40.620
The poor often regard themselves as poor because they didn't have what it took.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:47.960
People don't understand the wider social, environmental impact of inequality and social status.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.300
Now impoverished people are 20 times less likely than they were in 2001

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.540
to believe that hard work will get them ahead,

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.740
and only 38 percent of Americans believe that their children will have a better life than they've had.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.920
There are so many other statistics we could include,

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.220
like how race and gender affect people's average income earnings and chances of moving up.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.000
That literally could be an entirely separate video,

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.600
and luckily we've already made those videos and have linked to them below.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:19.380
And by the way, we tried to get commentary from literally all the minority women billionaires in America,

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.940
but we couldn't get ahold of Oprah.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.440
But one thing you should know is that your quest to become a billionaire

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.900
may be affected by your political leanings.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.940
66 percent of Republicans and those who lean right say hard work,

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.960
instead of a person's advantages,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.720
have more to do with why they're rich.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.620
Democrats and those that lean left feel the exact opposite.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.580
60 percent say a person is rich because they've had more advantages than others

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.280
as opposed to just working hard.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:51.100
There are a bunch of extraordinarily hardworking people in our society that are desperately poor

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:57.480
and kept that way for structural reasons, and there are a ton of people in our society who are enormously rich

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:04.500
who are lazy, good-for-nothing clowns and got rich because they were in the way of some

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.140
tidal wave of money, or they inherited, or got lucky.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.720
The truth is that making the move to billionaire status isn't easy

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.600
unless you or your family are already multimillionaires.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.960
And if you're not in the upper class, what you'll need to make it to the next stage of wealth

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.980
is much more than those above you.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.020
We've spent so much time in this video talking about how to become a billionaire,

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.020
but the real question may be if you should become one.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.860
Bigger income differences damages the health of the whole population.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.960
You also see much higher rates of violence.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:45.360
I think that it's very unethical to have these enormously inflated salaries at the top.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.100
In the context of our economy today,

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:56.120
having people who are worth that much money is almost certainly a failure of policy and morality.
