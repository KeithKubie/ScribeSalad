00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:24.740
 and good is inaccessible because here in the 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:28.699
 health issue there is no plan 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:34.090
 that you can access in cost to 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.090
 Having a prosthesis is very expensive 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.070
 a boy wants to have a hand and is 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.230
 500 kilometers in the capital has to 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.140
 resort to a traditional orthopedics 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.050
 you have to travel and take action and 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.960
 hands that can come to the boy who 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.680
 today it is almost between one thousand and five 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.510
 One thousand dollars 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.640
 we are going to do a lot to 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.790
 a lower cost we are talking about five 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.790
 Dollars 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.500
 you can open and close your hand to 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.080
 grab things or you can also 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.180
 pull out your fingers and do something much more 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.700
 copado so to speak that is to put a 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.230
 Support for cups or a holder for 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.730
 open bottles or to play with 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.440
 then here what we are 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.270
 allowing people is not 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.850
 only have a hand that allows 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.710
 do things but have a hand that is 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.370
 multitask 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.370
 plus 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.369
 two 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.759
 and at the end of the tour we join 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:00.929
 take an experience you are not going to 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.929
