00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.170
- What do we have here?

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.330
JOEY: A nice little
Schwinn bike for you.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.380
What do you think?

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.210
I think it's seen
its better days.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.040
Obviously, you didn't buy
it new because this thing

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.790
is older than you are.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.120
Actually, this thing might
even be older than I am.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.330
[laughter]

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.880
Doubt it.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.170
[bell rings]

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.080
JOEY: I don't really know
much about the Schwinn bikes.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.540
I know that, back in the
day, they were popular.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.580
I got the bike from my
grandfather's garage.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.250
I picked up the bike
because I wanted

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.330
to give it to my girlfriend,
but she looked at it in disgust.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.580
So I figured I'd sell it and
get a couple of dollars for it.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.330
This thing is definitely cool.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.250
Schwinn came out in,
like, the late 1890s,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.250
and they just made
really good bikes.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.920
This came out in,
like, the early '60s.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.580
The Fiesta was, like, their
highest-end girls' bike.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.250
What they were going for
was durability, reliability.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.380
They weren't going for
lightweight, high-speed bike.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.170
Look at modern bikes, like
mountain bikes and stuff

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.380
like that.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.330
I mean, they're just
built for speed.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.960
There's no style involved.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.580
This had style.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.620
Schwinn was the iconic
American bicycle brand.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.080
When you thought of bicycles,
first thing you thought out of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.380
was a Schwinn.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.210
Some could go for over $10,000.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.420
It all depends on the model
when it comes to Schwinns.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.460
So what were you
looking to do with it?

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.460
I was thinking--

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.580
thinking I'd sell
it for a few bucks.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.710
$300, I was looking
for, at least.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.790
Nope.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.290
JOEY: No?

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.790
This is the whole thing.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.620
As far as the collector
market goes for bicycles,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.460
it's usually guys, and they
buy the bikes they were

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.250
riding when they were kids.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.920
So boys' bikes are
worth a lot more,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.750
and this is a girl's bike.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.170
I can maybe get
this thing restored.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.670
I'm going to show
this to my guy.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.920
And if he can redo this
thing for a decent price,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.670
I'll probably sell
it for $700 or $800,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.330
but I'm hoping he can
do it for $200 or $300.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.420
So I will give you $80.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.250
JOEY: Man.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.920
$250, at least?

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.170
No.
I'll tell you what.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.170
I'll give you $100.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.790
I'm not going to go no more.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.790
All right.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.170
I'll give it up for $100.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.170
All right, sweet, man.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.790
JOEY: Appreciate it.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.250
I'm going to take the $100,
give my girlfriend a gift,

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.960
and say sorry for
that trashy bike

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.710
that I tried to give her before.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.880
I'm hoping I can get it
restored and make a few bucks,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.790
so I've called Bob down
to take a look at it.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.540
This is it.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.000
What do you think?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.040
BOB: It's not in bad shape.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.540
Let's bring it over
here and see if we

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.330
can put it up on the table.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.880
Here we go.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.540
It's a Schwinn, so it takes
two people to lift it.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.540
BOB: OK.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.040
First of all, it's a girl's.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.380
And the girls' bicycle
market is really down.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.880
But this was part of
their top of the line.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.330
They had the Debutante, the
Deluxe, and they had this.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.120
It's a cool bike.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.330
So can you fix this thing up?

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.420
BOB: Of course I can fix it up.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.380
I can this look great.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.380
With a lot of chrome work.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.250
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9--

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.580
10 pieces of chrome.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.580
They'll look fabulous
when it's done.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.080
They'll look
absolutely outrageous.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.670
We'll strip down the
whole bike, repaint it,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.920
re-stripe it, replace the seat.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.500
And all that will
cost you only $1,400,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.250
and then you'll be able
to sell it for $700.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.670
[laughter]

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.670
So I bought it in mind that
it might be a parts bike,

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.880
so apparently it's going
to be a parts bike.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.920
BOB: Oh, yeah.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.620
You'll do a hell
of a lot better.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.210
You know, you've got stuff
like this original rack here,

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.120
the original light, the tank.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.710
You should do real well.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.790
You'd do much better
than if you fixed it up.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.960
Well, thanks, Bob.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.790
BOB: Hey, good
luck with it, Rick.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.920
Have fun with it.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.580
That bike would look
bitchin' if we restored it.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.460
It would bring back a
lot of memories for girls

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.250
who used to ride that bike.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.620
But at the end result,
it's only worth $700.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.080
If Rick stripped that
down and sold it in parts,

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.460
he'd do pretty well.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.290
He could probably make
about $300, $400 on it.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.920
I tried.
