00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
Now remember your goal here is to start
with a series of hypotheses, that's all

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.530
you have on day one. If you're a domain
expert, maybe you know a little more, but

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.269
it's okay because you're just kind of
guessing here. You start with, "Well, here's

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.080
who I think my customers are," but then
you get out of the building and you

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.449
start running experiments and you find
out, "Oh, I was right" or more often on your

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.980
first guesses, "I was wrong." And because
we're going to do these experiments

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.680
cheaply inexpensively and upfront, we're
going to save all the enormous waste we

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.610
would do if we waited until we launched
the product and did an expensive

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.360
marketing campaign and then only then
realizing that oops

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.570
these weren't our customers or these
were our customers, but we built the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.610
wrong features. So let's dive down a
level deeper and first focus on what's

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.690
the jobs needed to be done. That is,
what's the customer segments trying to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.300
get done and is it a problem or need. Now
this phrase jobs to be done was first

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.769
popularized by Clayton Christensen who
wrote a series of books, "The innovators

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.250
Dilemma" and "The Innovators Solution"
should probably be on any entrepreneurs

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.020
reading list and what Christensen said
is look what functional or social jobs

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.890
are getting done. That is, does the
customer want to perform or complete a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.390
specific task? Or solve a problem? Or
trying to look good? Gain power status?

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:29.369
Or there's some emotional jobs - do they want to look better? feel good? feel more

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.530
secure? And what basic needs are you
helping your customer satisfy? Is it

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.610
entertainment? Is it dating? Is it something hardwired into the human psyche?
