00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:08.459
One of the things that's a challenge in understanding
how something as simple and small as a gene

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:14.170
can affect something as complicated as human
behavior is that it takes a long time for

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.689
those effects to be manifest.

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:23.570
And we had been doing a study of marriages
that started 20 years ago, it started in 1989.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.679
So one of the things that we noticed as we
started studying couples -- especially over

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:34.720
time is that some couples are in these relationships
that are very emotionally difficult.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.989
A lot of anger and sadness and contempt.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.420
And the marriages just get really miserable.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.450
Others have similarly toxic environments,
but they seem to do OK.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.750
So this is not what we were expecting.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.789
We were expecting the emotions to pretty much
determine how happy people were with their

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:56.789
marriage, regardless.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.740
But it wasn't the case.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.730
And we started thinking that maybe the answer
lies in their genes.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.159
Slight differences in the genetic make up
of individuals could incline them to be more

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.640
or less sensitive to the emotional quality
of their marriage.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.439
So we're interested in a gene that regulates
serotonin in the brain.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:27.020
A lot of the drugs that are used to treat
depression act on the serotonin system in

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.030
the brain.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.619
This is clearly a very important chemical
for determining the nature of our emotional

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:34.619
lives.

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.310
So the serotonin transporter gene has two
commonly occurring variations: one is the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.229
long allele and one is the short allele.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.340
So when we got into this area, the prevailing
view was that if you had the short alleles,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.619
it was just bad.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.360
There were a number of studies that suggested
that people who had the short alleles had

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.030
a higher risk for developing depression and
a number of terrible outcomes.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.080
But the pendulum was starting to shift to
think about this not as a risk gene, but as

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.920
a sensitivity gene.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.430
So our thought was maybe it's not that you're
just going to have bad reactions but you're

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.040
going to have more of the reactions that you'd
expect given the environment you were in.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.480
People with the short alleles look at cartoons
or funny films â€”&nbsp;they laugh more.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.810
In a situation that's embarrassing, and we
had a kind of a karaoke task, people with

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.519
the short alleles they get more embarrassed.

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.490
So it didn't seem that the short allele produced
a particular kind of emotional response, it

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.760
just produced a bigger emotional response
across the board.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.490
And so that was the clue to us that when we
looked at marriage, that we would find that

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.379
the short allele people would be doing really
well in marriages that were emotionally positive

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.050
and really poorly in marriages that were emotionally
negative.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.090
So people with the long alleles, what's determining
whether they're satisfied or dissatisfied

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.140
with their marriages?It could be any of a
millions things, you know, it might be how

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.140
much money they're making.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.290
It might be whether their kids are doing well.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.099
But it wouldn't be this sort of emotional
substrate of their relationship.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.319
So it's important to step back and ask:well,
how big of difference is this?

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.150
Could I see it with the naked eye?

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.989
And I think you can't.

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.489
I think these genetic variants produce slight
biases.

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.360
Having the short allele may make our emotional
responses just a little bit bigger.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.150
And just one incident isn't going to make
much of a difference, but if you start thinking

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.220
of like 20 years in the life of a marriage
and about hundreds of emotions every day -- In

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.520
the aggregate this becomes something that
really does make a difference.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.330
So how about if we could kind of reconstruct
a personal genome and we knew enough about

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.950
the function of each gene so we could really
start to get a picture of how all these genes

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.250
affected us and how they made us the person
that we are.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.790
But we are so far away from that now.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.370
We are just at the very beginning of being
able to understand a few of these genes.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.550
So stay tuned, we're just getting started.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.190
As complicated, as mysterious, and extraordinary
as relationships are -- there is science that

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.420
can be done here.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.660
There are these understandable forces that
are driving even these most complicated kind

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.080
of parts of our lives and the value of good
science and careful science is when it really

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.160
starts to help us understand some of these
mysteries.
