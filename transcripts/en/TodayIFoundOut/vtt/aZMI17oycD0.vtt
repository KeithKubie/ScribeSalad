00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.749
The Origin of the Hokey Pokey

00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:05.830
Like many innocuous songs and dances that
you’d assume have fairly benign origins,

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.240
the Hokey Pokey is believed by some to have
fairly sinister beginnings.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.269
There are those who insist the song originated
with Scottish Puritans in the UK as an anti-Catholic

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.269
taunt.

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.750
The words “hokey cokey,” which is how
the song is sung in the UK, is supposedly

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.340
derived from the magician’s incantation
“hocus pocus.”

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.980
Hocus Pocus popped up in the 17th century
as a part of the conjuration phrase: “Hocus

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.520
pocus, tontus talontus, vade celeriter jubeo.”

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.480
It’s thought by some that this derived from
the phrase spoken at Catholic Mass: hoc est

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.770
enim corpus meum,” or “for this is my
body.”

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.080
Thus, this “hokey cokey” origin theory
is that it was supposed to be a jab at the

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.800
Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, the
belief that the bread and wine turn into the

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.230
body and blood of Christ during the Mass.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.100
As recently as 2008, a few Catholic Church
officials have considered the “Hokey Pokey”

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.800
as an example of “faith hate,” but it
doesn’t seem most took these allegations

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.410
all that seriously and there isn’t much
in the way of documented evidence to back

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.300
up the “Catholic hate” origin theory.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.400
So what do we actually know about the song?

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.050
In 1857, two sisters from Canterbury, England
who were visiting Bridgewater, NH, brought

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.060
a little English/Scottish ditty with accompanying
gestures across the pond.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.520
The song is thought to be based on the Scottish
“Hinkum-Booby.”

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.060
(“Booby” here referring to the “stupid”
definition, rather than the more modern alternative

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.200
definition you might think of when shaking
things about.)

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.830
The song went a little something like this:
I put my right hand in,

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.090
I put my right hand out,
In out, in out.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.540
shake it all about.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.870
It then continued with other body parts being
put in and out and shaken all about.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.210
Fast-forward to 1940 during the Blitz in London,
a Canadian officer suggested writing an action

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.370
party song to English bandleader Al Tabor.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.500
The song’s title, “The Hokey Pokey,”
was supposedly in homage to an ice cream vendor

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.540
from Tabor’s childhood, who would call out
“Hokey pokey penny a lump.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.220
Have a lick make you jump.”

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.270
In this case, “hokey pokey” was supposedly
a slang at the time for ice cream and the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.580
ice cream seller was called the “hokey pokey
man”.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.759
Presumably borrowing from the aforementioned
English ditty, Tabor put it together with

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.310
“hokey pokey” and the song was almost,
but not quite, complete; after all, it’s

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.549
called “Hokey Cokey” in the UK.

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.310
Tabor claimed he changed the name to “The
Hokey Cokey” at the urging of the same Canadian

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.560
officer, who informed him “cokey” was
Canadian slang for “crazy.”

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.129
In 1942, the sheet music for “The Hokey
Cokey” was finally published.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.280
Tabor, after a bit of a legal battle, eventually
signed over all rights to the song to famed

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.629
Irish songwriter and publisher Jimmy Kennedy
as part of the settlement the two reached

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.470
over a lawsuit concerning the song.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.439
It should also be noted here that Kennedy’s
son claimed that Jimmy Kennedy, not Al Tabor,

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.599
was the primary author of the lyrics and it
was Jimmy that made the decision to go with

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:51.599
“cokey”.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.451
Across the pond, supposedly independent of
Tabor’s or Kennedy’s work, in 1944, two

00:02:56.451 --> 00:03:02.329
musicians from Scranton PA named Robert Degan
and Joe Brier made a record of a song called

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:03.739
“The Hokey Pokey Dance.”

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.260
This song was recorded for the entertainment
of the summer crowds at Poconos resorts.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.939
The tune proved to be a regional favorite
throughout the 1940s, but it’s still not

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.730
the version that we shake it all about to
today.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.879
In 1949, Charles Mack, Taft Baker and Larry
Laprise, “The Ram Trio,” made their own

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.769
version of the song , which is closer to the
version we all know and love today.

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.290
The Ram Trio also supposedly independently
developed the song, but in reality probably

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.120
learned it from vacationers who’d heard
it at the Poconos resorts.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.860
The song was penned for the amusement of skiers
at the Sun Valley Resort in Idaho.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.370
It proved to be a big hit, so Laprise decided
to record it.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.339
The problem with making such a record and
playing it on the airwaves is that Degan and

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:47.689
Brier got wind of it and sued Laprise for
ripping off their “Hokey Pokey Dance.”

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:52.010
Laprise’s lawyers must have been top-notch,
because even though his version of the song

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.059
was released after Degan and Brier’s, Laprise
walked away with the rights to the “Hokey

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:57.180
Pokey Dance.”

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.409
Interestingly enough, despite the legal battles
over the song, between Tabor and Kennedy in

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.909
the UK and Laprise and Degan/Brier in the
US, going on around the same time, the two

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.439
pairs never sought to sue their counterparts
across the pond.

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:14.260
In the end, the ultimate origin of what it’s
all about seems to have been lost to history.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.190
If you choose to believe Al Tabor’s anecdote,
though, at least the recent derivation of

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:31.940
it is about 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.260
ice cream.
