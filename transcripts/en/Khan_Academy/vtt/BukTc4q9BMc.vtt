00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.726
Just realized that I
typed in the wrong numbers

00:00:02.726 --> 00:00:04.100
at the end of the
last video when

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.970
I was trying to put
them in the calculator.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.625
We were trying to determine the
coefficient of static friction,

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:12.080
and it's 50 newtons divided by
49 square roots of 3 newtons.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.330
And in the last video, by
accident, in the calculator,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.870
instead of doing 49
square roots of 3,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.100
I wrote 40 square roots of 3.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.030
So let's actually
calculate it again.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.700
50 divided by 49 times--
let me write it this way,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.930
make sure we get-- 49
times the square root of 3

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.260
gives us a coefficient of static
friction of, if we round it,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.380
0.59.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.380
So this is equal to 0.59.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.050
And so that's it.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.820
I just forgot to-- I
did the calculation

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.590
wrong on the calculator
in the last video.
