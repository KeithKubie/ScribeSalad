00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:10.689
Deep inside Yale University's Beinecke
Rare Book and Manuscript Library

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:14.899
lies the only copy of a 240-page tome.

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:17.523
Recently carbon dated to around 1420,

00:00:17.523 --> 00:00:19.984
its vellum pages features 
looping handwriting

00:00:19.984 --> 00:00:23.979
and hand-drawn images seemingly
stolen from a dream.

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:25.733
Real and imaginary plants,

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.350
floating castles,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.762
bathing women,

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.263
astrology diagrams,

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:31.499
zodiac rings,

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:37.010
and suns and moons with faces
accompany the text.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.540
This 24x16 centimeter book
is called the Voynich manuscript,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.649
and its one of history's biggest
unsolved mysteries.

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:45.890
The reason why?

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.261
No one can figure out what it says.

00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:51.190
The name comes from Wilfrid Voynich,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.660
a Polish bookseller who came across
the document at a Jesuit college

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.769
in Italy in 1912.

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:57.941
He was puzzled.

00:00:57.941 --> 00:00:59.011
Who wrote it?

00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:00.431
Where was it made?

00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:04.120
What do these bizarre words
and vibrant drawings represent?

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.691
What secrets do its pages contain?

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:09.671
He purchased the manuscript from
the cash-strapped priest at the college,

00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:11.572
and eventually brought it to the U.S.,

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:16.191
where experts have continued to puzzle
over it for more than a century.

00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:20.081
Cryptologists say the writing has all
the characteristics of a real language,

00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:22.651
just one that no one's ever seen before.

00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:25.391
What makes it seem real is that
in actual languages,

00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:29.391
letters and groups of letters appear
with consistent frequencies,

00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:31.511
and the language in the Voynich manuscript

00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:35.342
has patterns you wouldn't find
from a random letter generator.

00:01:35.342 --> 00:01:38.712
Other than that, we know little more
than what we can see.

00:01:38.712 --> 00:01:41.244
The letters are varied 
in style and height.

00:01:41.244 --> 00:01:44.943
Some are borrowed from other scripts,
but many are unique.

00:01:44.943 --> 00:01:48.262
The taller letters have been named
gallows characters.

00:01:48.262 --> 00:01:50.482
The manuscript is 
highly decorated throughout

00:01:50.482 --> 00:01:52.592
with scroll-like embellishments.

00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:55.213
It appears to be written by two
or more hands,

00:01:55.213 --> 00:01:58.273
with the painting done 
by yet another party.

00:01:58.273 --> 00:02:03.693
Over the years, three main theories
about the manuscript's text have emerged.

00:02:03.693 --> 00:02:06.042
The first is that it's written in cypher,

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:10.263
a secret code deliberately designed
to hide secret meaning.

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:12.575
The second is that the document is a hoax

00:02:12.575 --> 00:02:16.213
written in gibberish to make money
off a gullible buyer.

00:02:16.213 --> 00:02:19.133
Some speculate the author
was a medieval con man.

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:22.793
Others, that it was Voynich himself.

00:02:22.793 --> 00:02:26.523
The third theory is that the manuscript
is written in an actual language,

00:02:26.523 --> 00:02:28.695
but in an unknown script.

00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:31.674
Perhaps medieval scholars were attempting
to create an alphabet

00:02:31.674 --> 00:02:35.123
for a language that was spoken
but not yet written.

00:02:35.123 --> 00:02:38.844
In that case, the Voynich manuscript
might be like the rongorongo script

00:02:38.844 --> 00:02:40.684
invented on Easter Island,

00:02:40.684 --> 00:02:45.005
now unreadable after the culture
that made it collapsed.

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:47.364
Though no one can read 
the Voynich manuscript,

00:02:47.364 --> 00:02:50.145
that hasn't stopped people from guessing
what it might say.

00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:52.873
Those who believe the manuscript
was an attempt to create

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:54.736
a new form of written language

00:02:54.736 --> 00:02:56.995
speculate that it might be an encyclopedia

00:02:56.995 --> 00:03:00.285
containing the knowledge 
of the culture that produced it.

00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:04.406
Others believe it was written by 
the 13th century philosopher Roger Bacon,

00:03:04.406 --> 00:03:08.127
who attempted to understand 
the universal laws of grammar,

00:03:08.127 --> 00:03:12.496
or in the 16th century by the
Elizabethan mystic John Dee,

00:03:12.496 --> 00:03:15.257
who practiced alchemy and divination.

00:03:15.257 --> 00:03:19.073
More fringe theories that the book was
written by a coven of Italian witches,

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:22.296
or even by Martians.

00:03:22.296 --> 00:03:24.116
After 100 years of frustration,

00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:27.576
scientists have recently shed a little
light on the mystery.

00:03:27.576 --> 00:03:30.193
The first breakthrough 
was the carbon dating.

00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:33.666
Also, contemporary historians have
traced the provenance of the manuscript

00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:37.546
back through Rome and Prague
to as early as 1612,

00:03:37.546 --> 00:03:41.287
when it was perhaps passed
from Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:44.477
to his physician, Jacobus Sinapius.

00:03:44.477 --> 00:03:46.801
In addition to these 
historical breakthroughs,

00:03:46.801 --> 00:03:50.527
linguistic researchers recently proposed
the provisional identification

00:03:50.527 --> 00:03:53.698
of a few of the manuscript's words.

00:03:53.698 --> 00:03:56.938
Could the letters beside these seven
stars spell Tauran,

00:03:56.938 --> 00:03:58.523
a name for Taurus,

00:03:58.523 --> 00:04:02.437
a constellation that includes the seven
stars called the Pleiades?

00:04:02.437 --> 00:04:06.807
Could this word be Centaurun
for the Centaurea plant in the picture?

00:04:06.807 --> 00:04:09.698
Perhaps, but progress is slow.

00:04:09.698 --> 00:04:12.527
If we can crack its code,
what might we find?

00:04:12.527 --> 00:04:14.959
The dream journal of 
a 15th-century illustrator?

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.692
A bunch of nonsense?

00:04:16.692 --> 00:04:19.488
Or the lost knowledge 
of a forgotten culture?

00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:21.477
What do you think it is?
