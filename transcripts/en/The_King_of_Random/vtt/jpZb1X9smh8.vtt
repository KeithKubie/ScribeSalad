00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.960
I just got back from the hardware store where I picked up some replacement blades for my utility knife.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.560
Because overtime, these things get dull and pretty rusty.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.300
But, as I took the old blade out and took a good look at it,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.340
I had a revelation on what kind of project we could do today.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.500
Can you see what I see?

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.180
[BATMAN TRANSITION MUSIC]

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.080
That's right guys! In this video, we are making bat blades out of utility razors.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.780
So, I went ahead and took the liberty of making up a nice little bat blade template.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.900
Were going to use these to transfer an image to the blades that will make it a bit easier for cutting out the steel.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.460
Now, razor blades like these are designed for hardness.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.080
Which, means that the steel has a very high carbon content.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.680
That makes them extremely hard, but, extremely brittle.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.100
When you take your razor blades out of the package, you're going to notice that they're very oily.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.520
And permanent marker isn't going to stick to that.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.180
So, we want to start off by cleaning these off with paper towel and maybe even some rubbing alcohol, to prepare the surface for ink.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.740
One grease free blade, ready to go.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.020
Now, these templates are kind of reverse templates.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.040
So, you'll want to take something like an Exacto knife and we're going to cut out the shape and we want to leave a negative

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.820
because, we're actually going to paint the picture onto the razor blade itself.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:07.400
So,when your piece is cut out, it should just pop right out of the paper and that will leave you a negative that you can position over top of one of your razor blades.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.740
Once you got a template that you're happy with, go ahead and put the paper facing down on the table.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.320
Then, take your blade and put it down over top of the back

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.800
and when it's lined up exactly how you want it, go ahead and take a piece of tape,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.840
could be Scotch tape, masking tape, whatever you want,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.040
and just carefully put it over top of the razor blade and press in down to the paper.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.440
That will secure it in place

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.940
and that will make it very easy to spray paint or use something like a permanent marker to transfer the image onto the blade itself.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.600
Go ahead and throw your template onto the table and grab something like a permanent marker and go ahead and color it in.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.140
Now you'll want to give that about 10 to 15 seconds to dry and you should be able to remove the tape and extract your blade.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.580
So, we got a cool little bat image transferred to our razor blade,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.260
but, it's important to know that you're not going to be able to cut these things out with a hack saw blade.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.460
You're not going to be able to cut them with metal files.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.940
To cut out shapes in high carbon steel, we're going to need to use grinding wheels and rotatory tools.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.520
Alright boys! Glasses on for safety. Let's get down to business.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.700
Alright guys! There you have it!

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.100
It's not pretty. But, it's going to get the job done.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.140
So, now we can use our diamond tip dremel tool to to clean up all of those edges to make it look sharp and really crisp.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.260
So, update guys! The diamond tip bits do not work.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.040
Do not get these.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.700
I've gone through 3 of these, including one that I just got from Home Depot for $8.00 and it burned out in about 30 seconds.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.960
Not to mention, that I ended up breaking like three of my blades, so I'm on my fourth one now and I did find I did find something that's a lot better

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.100
and it's these mini cut off wheels for the dremel tool.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.540
These things by themselves will cut out your entire shape if you go slowly and carefully enough.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.700
So, you see, guys, just using the mini cut off wheel, you can actually cut out the entire blade.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.800
This, by far, works better that any of the other tools that I was using.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.620
They're very durable, they're very cheap, and they do a much better job than these other bits.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.080
The only thing that you have to be careful of, is that when you're grinding your bat blade, you grind with the edge of the wheel.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.640
You don't want to grind with the flat surface or you might end up tearing your disc apart like that.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.620
So, this is awesome, guys! Our bat blades are looking really cool.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.940
They look awesome in sliver, but, if you want to make them look a little more authentic, grab yourself some black spray paint like this.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.340
This is the kind that dries in about 10 to 15 minutes.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.080
Just poke one of the tips of your bat blade into a cardboard base, give it a shot of spray paint from both angles and let it set.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.200
This paint should take just a couple of minutes to dry. So, while we're waiting, let me tell you about the Wounded Warrior Project.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.900
With the holiday season approaching, I wanted to share some information about a charity I recently learned about that helps veterans.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.600
The Wounded Warrior Project and its supporters believe that warriors already paid their dues on the battlefield.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.500
Their vision is to foster the most successful, well adjusted generation of wounded service members in our nations history.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:01.880
The Wounded Warrior Project also empowers warriors to live life on their own terms as well as mentor fellow warriors to embody The Wounded Warrior Project logo of one warrior carrying another.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.020
The mission of The Wounded Warrior Project is to honor and empower wounded warriors.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.080
So, big thanks to The Wounded Warrior Project for sponsoring this video and you can click the link in the description to learn more.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.160
Alright, so, update. Our paint is dry.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.280
These bat blades are looking awesome and at this point, all we have to do is to take a little bit of sand paper, a sanding sponge, or even a belt sander

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.700
and use it to remove the paint from the tips these blades just to make it look a bit nicer and at this point, we're ready to go.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.700
Just for fun, I printed out out a little target so we could do a little throwing practice with our bat blades.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.020
I got to make sure I don't miss because I don't want it to stick into the sheet rock.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.980
Fail.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.880
I think it's all in the wrist. You got to get that little snap. Maybe.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.720
Oh! Bangerang!

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.140
Check that out!

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.660
Well, we just got his collar.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.400
It's a pretty solid shot.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.780
I would like to see that the other direction though.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.020
Hee-Yah!

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.200
Ohh! Right in the knee cap.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.140
Oh! Right in the knee cap again!

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.220
Oh! Dang! See that's what I was afraid of.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.020
The one time I miss, it goes into the wall.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.120
Boom! There it is.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.760
That's what I'm talking about right there.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.340
So, there you have it guys.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.880
That's how you take blades from your utility knife and turn them into batterangs.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.280
How cool is that?

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.020
But, remember that these things are not toys.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.280
They are very dangerous, they are very sharp, they are razor blades.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.680
So, use safety and use caution if you try making them yourself.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.860
Thanks for joining me for this project today. I'll be looking for you in the next one. Talk to you then.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.960
[GRANT LAUGHS]

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.240
That is epic.
