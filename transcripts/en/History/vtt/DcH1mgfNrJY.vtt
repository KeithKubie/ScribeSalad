00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.900
The one thing about you
is you always seem positive.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.870
I try to.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.970
And that comes
through in the show.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.430
And matter of fact, why
don't we take a look

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.070
at some of these
big moments for you

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.170
and how you came across as
always positive and happy.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.830
[laughter]

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:13.630
Well, look at this.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.230
This was the first big snow.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.670
And this is when I
walked out of my shelter

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.230
in the first big snow.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.870
And I started making
snow balls and juggling

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.600
because I was just so happy.
I felt good.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.000
I was freezing my butt off.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.730
And I was like, I got to go out
there and make some snowballs.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.030
[humming]

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.370
What I'm going to
do, I'm going to make

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.600
a really cool Christmas--

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.200
I'm going to make Christmas
ornaments for our tree.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.300
Damn.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.530
That is going to
occupy a lot of time.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.970
That's for Campbell.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.730
I miss my family.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.800
But I know they're
there waiting for me.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.000
It's going to be all good.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.730
So I'm all good.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.000
That stone right
there that I just

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.870
kept writing family
in a piece of ash

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.770
over and over on the
stone is my motivation.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.770
And that ended up being
the tattoo that I got.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.470
Before I left, I found a
Mongolian tattoo artist,

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.000
and I got old Mongolian
script pronounced

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.900
[non-english speech].

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.170
And it says family.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.770
HOST: Pretty good way
to remember the trip.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.770
Thank you.
