the we continue the discussions about

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
the we continue the discussions about
 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.109
the we continue the discussions about
scientific truth we had this morning and

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
scientific truth we had this morning and
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.120

absolute thing it's something that is
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.100
absolute thing it's something that is
subject to change and we must understand

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110
subject to change and we must understand
 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.340
subject to change and we must understand
that and as scientists you three are all

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350
that and as scientists you three are all

very used to that concept so let's start

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
very used to that concept so let's start
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.280
very used to that concept so let's start
there and talk about how you deal in

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
there and talk about how you deal in
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.270
there and talk about how you deal in

way that like it or not we get to

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590
way that like it or not we get to
 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.100

was a similar story with the Higgs boson

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610
was a similar story with the Higgs boson
 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.590
was a similar story with the Higgs boson
that took only 50 years and it's a

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.210

similar story good for except some of

similar story good for except some of
 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.850
similar story good for except some of
the things I've been pushing so that

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860
the things I've been pushing so that
 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.150
the things I've been pushing so that
that's certainly one way so you're used

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160
that's certainly one way so you're used
 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160
that's certainly one way so you're used
to decades of uncertainty before this

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170
to decades of uncertainty before this
 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.190
to decades of uncertainty before this
decades of Unser and but of course this

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200
decades of Unser and but of course this
 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.750
decades of Unser and but of course this
is not something that's a passive

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760
is not something that's a passive

process we try to help the exhibit by

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660
process we try to help the exhibit by
 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.810
process we try to help the exhibit by
suggesting new techniques for the

suggesting new techniques for the
 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.650
suggesting new techniques for the
experimenters and encouraging further

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660
experimenters and encouraging further
 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.370

refinements and thought to accelerate

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380
refinements and thought to accelerate
 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.800
refinements and thought to accelerate
the process and in a way so it can be

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810
the process and in a way so it can be
 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.750
the process and in a way so it can be
very difficult yeah but in a way it's a

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760
very difficult yeah but in a way it's a
 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.370
very difficult yeah but in a way it's a
necessary part because if you if you

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380
necessary part because if you if you
 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.570
necessary part because if you if you
don't have the uncertainty you're not

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580
don't have the uncertainty you're not
 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.430
don't have the uncertainty you're not
pushing hard enough that's right I like

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440
pushing hard enough that's right I like
 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.280
pushing hard enough that's right I like
to tell students when they begin with me

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290
to tell students when they begin with me
 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.590
to tell students when they begin with me
that if you don't make mistakes you're

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600
that if you don't make mistakes you're
 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.180
that if you don't make mistakes you're
not working on hard enough problems

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190
not working on hard enough problems

mistakes are not only to be expected but
they're really to be welcomed because

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330
they're really to be welcomed because
 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.420
they're really to be welcomed because
that they're very good learning

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430
that they're very good learning

theoretical physicist Michael you're a
 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.810
theoretical physicist Michael you're a
biophysicist so I think uncertainty is

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820
biophysicist so I think uncertainty is
 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.750
biophysicist so I think uncertainty is
intrinsic and everything any measurement

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760
intrinsic and everything any measurement
 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.880
intrinsic and everything any measurement
has certain uncertainty I think life

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890
has certain uncertainty I think life
 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.250
has certain uncertainty I think life
itself has uncertainty I think

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260
itself has uncertainty I think
 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.310
itself has uncertainty I think
in any one minute you know maybe nothing

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320
in any one minute you know maybe nothing
 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.020
in any one minute you know maybe nothing
happened to you but that many many bad

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030
happened to you but that many many bad
 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.280
happened to you but that many many bad
things could have happened to useful in

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290
things could have happened to useful in
 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.800
things could have happened to useful in
some ways you know you're generally

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810
some ways you know you're generally
 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.150
some ways you know you're generally
ahead if you're alive

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160
ahead if you're alive
 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.990
ahead if you're alive
I think uncertainty can also be a very

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000
I think uncertainty can also be a very
 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.380
I think uncertainty can also be a very
good thing I think some of the error

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390
good thing I think some of the error
 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.460
good thing I think some of the error
that I think is particularly interesting

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470
that I think is particularly interesting
 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.740
that I think is particularly interesting
that scientists understand is the value

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750
that scientists understand is the value
 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.130
that scientists understand is the value
of randomness and some of the what why

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140
of randomness and some of the what why
 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.740
of randomness and some of the what why
randomness is so valuable is that it's

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750
randomness is so valuable is that it's
 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.190
randomness is so valuable is that it's
unbiased and often it's very cheap

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200
unbiased and often it's very cheap
 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.930
unbiased and often it's very cheap
because do anything it's that it's throw

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940
because do anything it's that it's throw
 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.550
because do anything it's that it's throw
a dice and some of those powerful

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560
a dice and some of those powerful
 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.410
a dice and some of those powerful
methods and optimizations for example

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420
methods and optimizations for example
 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.960
methods and optimizations for example
said the Monte Carlo method it's just

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970
said the Monte Carlo method it's just
 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.330
said the Monte Carlo method it's just
based on doing things with a certain

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340
based on doing things with a certain
 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.400
based on doing things with a certain
level of randomness and I think the lack

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410
level of randomness and I think the lack
 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.190
level of randomness and I think the lack
of bias is is a really powerful thing

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200
of bias is is a really powerful thing
 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.600
of bias is is a really powerful thing
about the certainty I tell people who

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610
about the certainty I tell people who
 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.040
about the certainty I tell people who
often come to me and say you know I have

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050
often come to me and say you know I have
 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.930
often come to me and say you know I have
these two choices and I can't decide and

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940
these two choices and I can't decide and
 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.700
these two choices and I can't decide and
they said but you can't decide it

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710
they said but you can't decide it
 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.200
they said but you can't decide it
doesn't really make any difference you

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210
doesn't really make any difference you
 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.030
doesn't really make any difference you
know decide that if the dice is over

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040
know decide that if the dice is over
 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.010
know decide that if the dice is over
three we'll choose option one and if the

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020
three we'll choose option one and if the
 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.960
three we'll choose option one and if the
dice is under three drop them two and do

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970
dice is under three drop them two and do
 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.430
dice is under three drop them two and do
it that way now very often when they do

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440
it that way now very often when they do
 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.710
it that way now very often when they do
it that way they suddenly the sky that

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720
it that way they suddenly the sky that
 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.570
it that way they suddenly the sky that
they actually prefer the other option

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580
they actually prefer the other option
 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.330
they actually prefer the other option
so sometimes redness is very very

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340
so sometimes redness is very very
 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.100
so sometimes redness is very very
powerful uncertainty is actually a

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110
powerful uncertainty is actually a
 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.410
powerful uncertainty is actually a
positive thing I think people who are

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420
positive thing I think people who are
 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.780
positive thing I think people who are
very certain about their lives miss out

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790
very certain about their lives miss out
 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.010

on all the good stuff which is the
answer yeah I can only echo what has

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940
answer yeah I can only echo what has
 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.850
answer yeah I can only echo what has
been said so far but I want to do it in

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860
been said so far but I want to do it in
 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.410
been said so far but I want to do it in
my own words and I would start out by

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420
my own words and I would start out by
 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.260
my own words and I would start out by
saying we have to realize that research

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270
saying we have to realize that research
 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.710
saying we have to realize that research
is inherently uncertain don't kid

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720

sky research however you call it it's
 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.890
sky research however you call it it's
inherently uncertain because you don't

inherently uncertain because you don't
 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.110
inherently uncertain because you don't
know what you're going to find you don't

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120

and therefore uncertainty for scientists

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150
and therefore uncertainty for scientists
 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.770
and therefore uncertainty for scientists
is an enormous very important driving

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.780
we also live with uncertainty all the
time it's not such a strange concept

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:22.790
time it's not such a strange concept
 

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.540
time it's not such a strange concept
none very few of us I mean you said if

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:25.550
none very few of us I mean you said if
 

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.040
none very few of us I mean you said if
you live a certain life it's perhaps

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:27.050
you live a certain life it's perhaps
 

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.590
you live a certain life it's perhaps
more boring life but very few of us do

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:29.600
more boring life but very few of us do
 

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.750
more boring life but very few of us do
most of us are constantly aware that we

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:31.760
most of us are constantly aware that we
 

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.220
most of us are constantly aware that we
don't really know what decisions we

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:33.230
don't really know what decisions we
 

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.670
don't really know what decisions we
ought to make a basis

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:35.680
ought to make a basis
 

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.620
ought to make a basis
and yet the dichotomy is that although

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:38.630
and yet the dichotomy is that although
 

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.020
and yet the dichotomy is that although
we know that and we and maybe people

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:41.030
we know that and we and maybe people
 

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.210
we know that and we and maybe people
what we will to discuss whether people

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:43.220
what we will to discuss whether people
 

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.650
what we will to discuss whether people
do or do not understand this arts

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:44.660
do or do not understand this arts
 

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.730
do or do not understand this arts
proceeds like this people want certainty

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:48.740
proceeds like this people want certainty
 

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.300
proceeds like this people want certainty
in decision-making they want certainty

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:52.310
in decision-making they want certainty
 

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.430
in decision-making they want certainty
from politicians they see uncertainty as

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:54.440
from politicians they see uncertainty as
 

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.860
from politicians they see uncertainty as
a weakness and it's very strange why

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:56.870
a weakness and it's very strange why
 

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.690
a weakness and it's very strange why
should there be this separation between

00:08:58.690 --> 00:08:58.700
should there be this separation between
 

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.060
should there be this separation between
the lives we perhaps need individually

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:01.070
the lives we perhaps need individually
 

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.730
the lives we perhaps need individually
in the law and the public life yeah it

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:03.740
in the law and the public life yeah it
 

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.530
in the law and the public life yeah it
was very important to realize that some

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:05.540
was very important to realize that some
 

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.350
was very important to realize that some
things are more certain than others we

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.360
things are more certain than others we
 

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.450
things are more certain than others we
had a lecture from David gross this

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:10.460
had a lecture from David gross this
 

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.000
had a lecture from David gross this
morning about the scientific method and

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.010
morning about the scientific method and
 

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.790
morning about the scientific method and
that produces kind of the gold standard

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:15.800
that produces kind of the gold standard
 

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.640
that produces kind of the gold standard
of truth when you can do repeated

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:18.650
of truth when you can do repeated
 

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.460
of truth when you can do repeated
experiments check things establish

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:21.470

things with great precision over

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:23.420
things with great precision over
 

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.540
things with great precision over
hundreds of years of data collection and

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:25.550
hundreds of years of data collection and
 

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:29.560
hundreds of years of data collection and
so even those basics can be questioned

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:29.570
so even those basics can be questioned
 

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.210
so even those basics can be questioned
like Newton's theory of gravity was

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:31.220
like Newton's theory of gravity was
 

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.940
like Newton's theory of gravity was
eventually surpassed by Einstein's

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:33.950
eventually surpassed by Einstein's
 

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.910
eventually surpassed by Einstein's
theory but there are some things that

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920
theory but there are some things that
 

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.330
theory but there are some things that
are really really solid and well tested

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:39.340
are really really solid and well tested
 

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.550
are really really solid and well tested
but most things aren't like that

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560
but most things aren't like that
 

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.520
but most things aren't like that
once you step out of the hard core of

that are just facts they're not truth

there are a lot of contingent facts that

there are a lot of contingent facts that
 

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.250
there are a lot of contingent facts that
have to be added and biology is all

about contingent facts I think one of

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:27.410
about contingent facts I think one of
 

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.800
about contingent facts I think one of

the course of the future and it was only

that it became possible to imagine that

think ultimately you know every second
we were alive is worth so much wonder

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:17.810
we were alive is worth so much wonder
 

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.420
we were alive is worth so much wonder
but instead of worrying about what's

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:19.430
but instead of worrying about what's
 

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.220
but instead of worrying about what's
gonna happen tomorrow is very uncertain

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:21.230
gonna happen tomorrow is very uncertain
 

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.160
gonna happen tomorrow is very uncertain
we may not be here who knows and you

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:24.170
we may not be here who knows and you
 

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:25.480
we may not be here who knows and you
know you can worry about it if you're

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:25.490
know you can worry about it if you're
 

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.310
know you can worry about it if you're
making the policy but you probably

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:27.320
making the policy but you probably
 

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.510
making the policy but you probably
shouldn't worry about it because you

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:28.520
shouldn't worry about it because you

sometimes of somebody who was very

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:32.900
sometimes of somebody who was very
 

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.590
sometimes of somebody who was very
pessimistic all his life and you know

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600
pessimistic all his life and you know
 

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.570
pessimistic all his life and you know
he's on his deathbed and sudden he looks

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:37.580
he's on his deathbed and sudden he looks
 

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.400
he's on his deathbed and sudden he looks
back if there's gee nothing bad ever

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:39.410
back if there's gee nothing bad ever

interesting things and I was very
 

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.630
interesting things and I was very
pessimistic I avoided them I think

ultimately we don't know but basically

ultimately we don't know but basically

I think we have to always realize that

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:56.450
I think we have to always realize that
 

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.600
I think we have to always realize that
everything is super amplified by media

know things are basically like this but
 

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.660

basically things sort of continue

think this is a good example of the

think this is a good example of the

from the audience please be thinking yes
in the front please Kelly so you have

in the front please Kelly so you have
 

00:22:36.389 --> 00:22:38.000
in the front please Kelly so you have
all explained very well

all explained very well

all explained very well
why we have to accept uncertainty we

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880
why we have to accept uncertainty we
 

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.370
why we have to accept uncertainty we
have to live with it and we may even

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:43.380
have to live with it and we may even
 

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:44.600
have to live with it and we may even
have to embrace it

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:44.610
have to embrace it
 

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:47.629
have to embrace it
but when we select our leaders in

00:22:47.629 --> 00:22:47.639
but when we select our leaders in
 

00:22:47.639 --> 00:22:50.299
but when we select our leaders in
business in politics and so forth we

00:22:50.299 --> 00:22:50.309
business in politics and so forth we
 

00:22:50.309 --> 00:22:52.190
business in politics and so forth we
want them to be forceful them we want

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200
want them to be forceful them we want
 

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.710
want them to be forceful them we want
them to have a clear view and we

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720
them to have a clear view and we
 

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.080
them to have a clear view and we
certainly do not want uncertainty in

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:57.090
certainly do not want uncertainty in
 

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:02.419
certainly do not want uncertainty in
leadership I think in a way we would be

00:23:02.419 --> 00:23:02.429
leadership I think in a way we would be
 

00:23:02.429 --> 00:23:04.460
leadership I think in a way we would be
much better off if we could have leaders

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:04.470
much better off if we could have leaders
 

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:07.399
much better off if we could have leaders
to have wisdom rather than fanatism but

00:23:07.399 --> 00:23:07.409
to have wisdom rather than fanatism but
 

00:23:07.409 --> 00:23:11.779
to have wisdom rather than fanatism but
how do we get there so just a deal but I

00:23:11.779 --> 00:23:11.789
how do we get there so just a deal but I
 

00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:15.580
how do we get there so just a deal but I
think that if we were to apply the

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:15.590
think that if we were to apply the
 

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.860
think that if we were to apply the
methods for selecting leaders to other

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:18.870
methods for selecting leaders to other
 

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.470
methods for selecting leaders to other
walks of life so we would choose our

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480
walks of life so we would choose our
 

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.230
walks of life so we would choose our
best scientists by how many people voted

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240
best scientists by how many people voted

for them if the head of a big company

00:23:28.009 --> 00:23:28.019
for them if the head of a big company
 

00:23:28.019 --> 00:23:30.680
for them if the head of a big company
was somebody randomly chosen or who had

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:30.690
was somebody randomly chosen or who had
 

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:33.019
was somebody randomly chosen or who had
a big network I think we wouldn't really

00:23:33.019 --> 00:23:33.029
a big network I think we wouldn't really
 

00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:34.549
a big network I think we wouldn't really
succeed very well and I think in some

00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559
succeed very well and I think in some
 

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:36.740
succeed very well and I think in some
ways it's interesting how

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:36.750
ways it's interesting how
 

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.830
ways it's interesting how
politics and leadership and I think you

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:40.840
politics and leadership and I think you
 

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.330
politics and leadership and I think you
know there's discussions of democracy

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:42.340
know there's discussions of democracy
 

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.670
know there's discussions of democracy
versus non democracy but I think that

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:44.680
versus non democracy but I think that
 

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.070
versus non democracy but I think that
you know do we actually have a to

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:47.080
you know do we actually have a to
 

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.810
you know do we actually have a to
democracy anywhere in the world I don't

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:48.820
democracy anywhere in the world I don't
 

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.970
democracy anywhere in the world I don't
know when the power of lobbyists is as

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:50.980
know when the power of lobbyists is as
 

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.500
know when the power of lobbyists is as
powerful it is in the USA and you can

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:52.510
powerful it is in the USA and you can
 

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:54.990
powerful it is in the USA and you can
buy politicians maybe they should just

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:55.000
buy politicians maybe they should just
 

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.610
buy politicians maybe they should just
be bought outright maybe Google should

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:56.620
be bought outright maybe Google should
 

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.410
be bought outright maybe Google should
come to the you know the Prime Minister

00:23:58.410 --> 00:23:58.420
come to the you know the Prime Minister
 

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.240
come to the you know the Prime Minister
of Britain and say look you're going to

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:00.250
of Britain and say look you're going to
 

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:01.500
of Britain and say look you're going to
get 10 million dollars when you leave

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:01.510
get 10 million dollars when you leave
 

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.030
get 10 million dollars when you leave
you're going to do what I say and that's

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:03.040
you're going to do what I say and that's
 

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.760
you're going to do what I say and that's
it make it out right but I think there

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:05.770
it make it out right but I think there
 

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:08.010
it make it out right but I think there
is hope and this actually comes the very

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:08.020
is hope and this actually comes the very
 

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.440
is hope and this actually comes the very
first session this morning we heard some

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:10.450
first session this morning we heard some
 

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.450
first session this morning we heard some
clips of people being asked and the last

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:12.460
clips of people being asked and the last
 

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.630
clips of people being asked and the last
person was saying that he hoped that

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640
person was saying that he hoped that
 

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.820
person was saying that he hoped that

errors say of artificial intelligence
 

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.320
errors say of artificial intelligence
could actually help inform government

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:19.330
could actually help inform government
 

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:22.740
could actually help inform government
and one thing I remember I was here two

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:22.750
and one thing I remember I was here two
 

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.840
and one thing I remember I was here two
years ago when the actual dialogue was

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:24.850
years ago when the actual dialogue was
 

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.090
years ago when the actual dialogue was
about artificial intelligence and

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.100
about artificial intelligence and
 

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:30.540
about artificial intelligence and
somebody from IBM spoke about the Watson

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:30.550
somebody from IBM spoke about the Watson
 

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:31.920

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:31.930
that could actually play chess for any
 

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.000
that could actually play chess for any
really well and now there are many

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:33.010
really well and now there are many
 

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:34.770
really well and now there are many
better computers on that well I had a

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:34.780
better computers on that well I had a
 

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.390
better computers on that well I had a
sort of feeling wouldn't it be wonderful

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400
sort of feeling wouldn't it be wonderful
 

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.360
sort of feeling wouldn't it be wonderful
if every president of the USA or every

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:16.350
and if you aren't prepared to worry
 

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:19.639
and if you aren't prepared to worry
about you know good renewable energy at

00:33:19.639 --> 00:33:19.649
about you know good renewable energy at
 

00:33:19.649 --> 00:33:21.200
about you know good renewable energy at
some point your companies will be buying

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:21.210
some point your companies will be buying
 

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:22.999
some point your companies will be buying
only Chinese things and you're going to

00:33:22.999 --> 00:33:23.009
only Chinese things and you're going to
 

00:33:23.009 --> 00:33:25.070
only Chinese things and you're going to
run out of money so it seems to me that

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080
run out of money so it seems to me that
 

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.289
run out of money so it seems to me that
this is a good buffer the fact that the

00:33:27.289 --> 00:33:27.299
this is a good buffer the fact that the
 

00:33:27.299 --> 00:33:29.659
this is a good buffer the fact that the
world is not only much better off in

00:33:29.659 --> 00:33:29.669
world is not only much better off in
 

00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:31.879
world is not only much better off in
terms of these indicators but also much

00:33:31.879 --> 00:33:31.889
terms of these indicators but also much
 

00:33:31.889 --> 00:33:34.009
terms of these indicators but also much
more globally United I think it's an

00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:34.019
more globally United I think it's an
 

00:33:34.019 --> 00:33:38.080
more globally United I think it's an
enormously positive force for the future

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:38.090
enormously positive force for the future
 

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:41.989
enormously positive force for the future
I would agree with you that the world is

00:33:41.989 --> 00:33:41.999
I would agree with you that the world is
 

00:33:41.999 --> 00:33:45.889
I would agree with you that the world is
better off in many ways but at the same

00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:45.899
better off in many ways but at the same
 

00:33:45.899 --> 00:33:49.369
better off in many ways but at the same

underdeveloped in terms of our values
but nevertheless there is an evolution

00:34:20.539 --> 00:34:20.549
but nevertheless there is an evolution
 

00:34:20.549 --> 00:34:23.240

sensitivity you know variety is a really
 

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:38.860
sensitivity you know variety is a really
good idea and if you if you're very

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:38.870
good idea and if you if you're very
 

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:41.680
good idea and if you if you're very
lactose intolerant maybe you should you

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:41.690
lactose intolerant maybe you should you
 

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.330
lactose intolerant maybe you should you
know be very very careful but it seems

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:43.340
know be very very careful but it seems
 

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.000
know be very very careful but it seems
to we can't worry about that always if

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:46.010
to we can't worry about that always if
 

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:49.690
to we can't worry about that always if
you listen to people mmm these educated

really the interest of the individual

00:37:59.680 --> 00:37:59.690
really the interest of the individual
 

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:02.950
really the interest of the individual

care about the rest of society so it's

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:21.170
care about the rest of society so it's
 

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:23.350
care about the rest of society so it's
not so much disputing what science says

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:23.360
not so much disputing what science says
 

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:27.340
not so much disputing what science says
but saying you know I have my interest

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:27.350
but saying you know I have my interest
 

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:30.640
but saying you know I have my interest
to protect my child against you know all

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:30.650
to protect my child against you know all

with GM's always I was in Switzerland at

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:38.870
with GM's always I was in Switzerland at
 

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:42.090

the time when there was the referendum
 

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.820
the time when there was the referendum
for or against GM or now it turned out

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:45.830
for or against GM or now it turned out
 

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:48.520
for or against GM or now it turned out
that in the the same country in the

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:48.530
that in the the same country in the
 

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:51.250
that in the the same country in the
german-speaking part people were much

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:51.260
german-speaking part people were much
 

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.110
german-speaking part people were much
more risk-averse than in the

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:53.120
more risk-averse than in the
 

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.960
more risk-averse than in the
french-speaking part so you say well

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:55.970
french-speaking part so you say well
 

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:57.490

the friend
more risk-loving than the

00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680
more risk-loving than the
 

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.890
more risk-loving than the
german-speaking but then it turned out

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:01.900
german-speaking but then it turned out
 

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:05.880
german-speaking but then it turned out
that the reasons behind it below it

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:05.890
that the reasons behind it below it
 

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:08.490

you have very little agriculture so
 

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.730
you have very little agriculture so
people did not care yeah so I'm just

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:26.740
people did not care yeah so I'm just
 

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.160
people did not care yeah so I'm just
saying very often there are other

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:29.170
saying very often there are other
 

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:31.110

I'm not saying you know this is better

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:32.920
I'm not saying you know this is better
 

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:36.000
I'm not saying you know this is better
it's worse but it's not so much the

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:36.010
it's worse but it's not so much the
 

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:38.130
it's worse but it's not so much the
science is an easy target it becomes

science is an easy target it becomes
 

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:41.190
science is an easy target it becomes
easy to attack and we would make a

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200
easy to attack and we would make a
 

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.860
easy to attack and we would make a
mistake in interpreting everything is

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:43.870
mistake in interpreting everything is
 

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:46.650
mistake in interpreting everything is
anti science without looking deeper into

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:46.660
anti science without looking deeper into
 

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:51.050
anti science without looking deeper into
it thank you thank you please question

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060
it thank you thank you please question
 

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.680
it thank you thank you please question
my question would be to the panel about

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:54.690
my question would be to the panel about
 

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:57.780
my question would be to the panel about
your thoughts on the importance of

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:57.790
your thoughts on the importance of
 

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:00.390
your thoughts on the importance of
education as we heard earlier today

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400
education as we heard earlier today
 

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.390
education as we heard earlier today
there is some threat to our universities

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:03.400
there is some threat to our universities
 

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.710
there is some threat to our universities
and our educators and as an educator I'm

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:07.720
and our educators and as an educator I'm
 

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.880
and our educators and as an educator I'm
really concerned what I hear and

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:10.890
really concerned what I hear and
 

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:13.530
really concerned what I hear and
particularly will you be mentioning

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:13.540
particularly will you be mentioning
 

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:16.980
particularly will you be mentioning
things like uncertainty and as an

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:16.990
things like uncertainty and as an
 

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:21.900
things like uncertainty and as an
educator how do we as educator then take

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:21.910
educator how do we as educator then take
 

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:25.260
educator how do we as educator then take
that forward to our students please

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:25.270

I think directly dealing with education

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240
I think directly dealing with education
 

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.550
I think directly dealing with education
it seems to me that one area of Science

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560
it seems to me that one area of Science
 

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.930
it seems to me that one area of Science
and Mathematics and has been really

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:33.940
and Mathematics and has been really
 

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.580
and Mathematics and has been really
neglected at school education is

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:35.590
neglected at school education is
 

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:37.980
neglected at school education is
statistics and uncertainty is a very

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:37.990
statistics and uncertainty is a very
 

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:40.440
statistics and uncertainty is a very
infancy part of statistics and it seems

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:40.450
infancy part of statistics and it seems
 

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:43.380
infancy part of statistics and it seems
to me that you know even six or old

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:43.390
to me that you know even six or old
 

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:46.290
to me that you know even six or old
children should be given dice and you

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:46.300
children should be given dice and you
 

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.090
children should be given dice and you
know mate make distributions and

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:48.100
know mate make distributions and
 

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.830
know mate make distributions and
understand what a mean is and a standard

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:49.840
understand what a mean is and a standard
 

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.590
understand what a mean is and a standard
deviation get some feeling or what

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:52.600
deviation get some feeling or what
 

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.630
deviation get some feeling or what
statistic there's and I think that this

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640
statistic there's and I think that this
 

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.950
statistic there's and I think that this
is something I don't even know the

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:55.960
is something I don't even know the
 

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.020
is something I don't even know the
history of why for example we teach

00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:58.030
history of why for example we teach
 

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:59.910
history of why for example we teach
people how to add fractions which is

00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920
people how to add fractions which is
 

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.830
people how to add fractions which is
number theory but we totally ignore

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:01.840
number theory but we totally ignore
 

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.800
number theory but we totally ignore
sadistic in school and it's a lot of

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:04.810
sadistic in school and it's a lot of
 

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:06.060
sadistic in school and it's a lot of
people think statistics is very

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:06.070
people think statistics is very
 

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:08.790
people think statistics is very
difficult but basically it's very easy

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800
difficult but basically it's very easy
 

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.770
difficult but basically it's very easy
to do experimental statistics just have

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:10.780
to do experimental statistics just have
 

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.900
to do experimental statistics just have
children throw a coin and record the

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:12.910
children throw a coin and record the
 

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:14.580
children throw a coin and record the
throws and you can analyze that change

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:14.590
throws and you can analyze that change
 

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:18.390
throws and you can analyze that change
so I think that would be my number one

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400
so I think that would be my number one
 

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.180
so I think that would be my number one
recommendation for schools well I think

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:21.190
recommendation for schools well I think
 

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:26.900
recommendation for schools well I think
education is all important and I'm very

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:26.910
education is all important and I'm very
 

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:30.270
education is all important and I'm very
pleased that people have started to

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.280
pleased that people have started to
 

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:36.260
pleased that people have started to
quantify that in a way that that can be

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:36.270
quantify that in a way that that can be
 

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:40.760
quantify that in a way that that can be
transmitted as objective data

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:40.770

moment he wrote a book called the
 

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.160
moment he wrote a book called the
scientific attitude and it's only about

scientific attitude and it's only about
 

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:26.250
scientific attitude and it's only about
applying the scientific attitude to the

applying the scientific attitude to the
 

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:29.430
applying the scientific attitude to the
problems of his time and it's a it's a

you're looking for not actually doing
 

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:01.819
you're looking for not actually doing
any research so I mean as far as I'm a

00:48:01.819 --> 00:48:01.829
any research so I mean as far as I'm a
 

00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:03.200
any research so I mean as far as I'm a
physics student so as far as physics is

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:03.210
physics student so as far as physics is
 

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:03.890
physics student so as far as physics is
concerned

00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900
concerned
 

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:05.809
concerned
isn't that statement more related to

00:48:05.809 --> 00:48:05.819
isn't that statement more related to
 

00:48:05.819 --> 00:48:07.609
isn't that statement more related to
experimental physics than theoretical

00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:07.619
experimental physics than theoretical
 

00:48:07.619 --> 00:48:09.230

physics because I asked pastor Frank
pointed out Einstein knew what he would

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:12.030
pointed out Einstein knew what he would
 

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:14.030
pointed out Einstein knew what he would
expect because of his theory of gravity

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040
expect because of his theory of gravity
 

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:16.010
expect because of his theory of gravity
and he said okay light would Bend this

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:16.020
and he said okay light would Bend this
 

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:17.870
and he said okay light would Bend this
certain amount and I think that actually

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880
certain amount and I think that actually
 

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.790
certain amount and I think that actually
found that it actually been there almost

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800
found that it actually been there almost
 

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.579
found that it actually been there almost
the same exact amount so theoretical

00:48:22.579 --> 00:48:22.589
the same exact amount so theoretical
 

00:48:22.589 --> 00:48:24.920
the same exact amount so theoretical
physics is a form of research so what

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:24.930
physics is a form of research so what
 

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:27.170
physics is a form of research so what
would you have to say about that I'm

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:27.180
would you have to say about that I'm
 

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.210

are discovering a new substance that

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:49.260
are discovering a new substance that
 

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:52.339
are discovering a new substance that
nobody has discovered before and you do

00:48:52.339 --> 00:48:52.349
nobody has discovered before and you do
 

00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:54.589

it by chance it happens by chance it's
 

00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:57.410
it by chance it happens by chance it's
one side but then you have to realize

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:57.420
one side but then you have to realize
 

00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:00.349
one side but then you have to realize
its significance because very often

00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359
its significance because very often
 

00:49:00.359 --> 00:49:02.089
its significance because very often
these things pop up and you think well

00:49:02.089 --> 00:49:02.099
these things pop up and you think well
 

00:49:02.099 --> 00:49:05.329
these things pop up and you think well
it's noise it's not important etc and

00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:05.339
it's noise it's not important etc and
 

00:49:05.339 --> 00:49:07.520
it's noise it's not important etc and
there are famous examples for instance

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:07.530
there are famous examples for instance

in high-temperature superconductivity
 

00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:12.650
in high-temperature superconductivity
there was a team that found exactly what

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:12.660
there was a team that found exactly what
 

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:14.180
there was a team that found exactly what
the people who got the Nobel Prize for

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:14.190
the people who got the Nobel Prize for
 

00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:18.620
the people who got the Nobel Prize for
later because they knew the significance

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:18.630
later because they knew the significance
 

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:21.950
later because they knew the significance
of what they found so let's thank you

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960
