00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.420
In the last episode, I talked about stars
that are orbiting one another. When it’s

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.190
two stars it’s called a binary. Three stars
would be a trinary system, and so on. But

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.180
what happens if you have ten stars? A thousand?
A MILLION?

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.720
What do you call it when stars CLUSTER together?

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.700
It’s likely that some stars are born individually,
but astronomers think that most stars are born in

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.300
groups called clusters, sometimes hundreds and
sometimes HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS at a time.

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.640
There are two kinds of clusters. Open, or
galactic clusters, and globular clusters.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.440
Open clusters are loosely bound collections
of dozens or thousands of stars, usually in

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.250
an irregular shape. Some are big enough and
close enough to us that they can be seen by

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.530
the naked eye; faint fuzzy patches in the
sky. Galileo was the first to discover, or

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.269
at least record, the fact that they were actually
composed of many stars so close together our

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.989
unaided eyes couldn’t resolve them.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.020
As we’ll see in next week’s episode, clusters
are formed from gigantic clouds of gas and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.209
dust. Depending on local conditions (like
how massive they are) these clouds can form

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:19.830
dozens, hundreds, or thousands of dense clumps,
which then contract to form individual stars.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.110
These stars can be bound together by their
mutual gravity, forming an open cluster. Unlike

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.940
the solar system, where the Sun dominates
and provides a singular, central source of

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.560
gravity holding the planets under its sway,
in a cluster ALL the stars contribute to the

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.200
overall gravity, so there’s a more general
gravitational schmear. The stars all orbit

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.060
the cluster’s center of mass, even though
there may not be anything at the very center.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.340
Not only that, but the stars don’t all orbit in a
flat plane, like our planets do. Instead, their orbits

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.480
are tilted in all different directions, more like the
way long period comets are scattered around the Sun.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.240
Typically, an open cluster is a couple of
dozen light years across, with stars much

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.310
closer together than they are in interstellar
space; the nearest known star to the Sun is

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.510
over 4 light years away, while stars in an open cluster
are typically a fraction of a light year apart.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.980
Some clusters are very young — well, in
an astronomical sense. They’re a few million

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.590
years old. Others are far, far older, billions
of years in age.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.340
How do we know? By looking at the stars themselves.
Remember, hot, blue, massive stars don’t

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.200
live long before exploding. If a cluster has
those kinds of stars it must be pretty youthful.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.100
If all it has are much lower mass red
dwarfs, it must be be much older,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.500
all the more massive stars having died off.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.680
In fact, clusters are pretty useful this way.
If you assume all the stars in them were born

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.040
at the same time — a reasonable starting
guess — then the age can be found by looking

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.040
at the most massive stars still on the main
sequence, still fusing hydrogen into helium

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.100
like the Sun is. The most massive stars can
be identified by their spectra, which gives

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.500
us their mass, and then that can be used to
get the cluster’s age.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.180
You might expect the distribution of cluster
ages to be all over the place, with some young,

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.200
some old, and some middle-aged. But in fact,
most clusters are young, and very few are

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.540
older than roughly 50 million years. That’s
because they evaporate.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.780
All the stars in the cluster interact with
each other via gravity. That means they constantly

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.740
tug on one another, changing each others’
orbits. You may remember from our episode

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.260
about gravity, that the kind of orbit an object
has depends on the amount of energy it has.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.370
Give it more energy and the orbit gets bigger.
Give it enough energy and it will achieve

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.360
escape velocity and fly away.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.880
In clusters the stars are always passing by
each other and exchanging energy via their

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.340
gravity. If a low mass star swings past a
higher mass star, it can get a relatively

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.650
big kick to its energy, and get flung into
a much higher orbit in the cluster, while

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.400
the high mass star loses energy, dropping
it down toward the center.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.360
Over time, these interactions tend to flick
the lower mass stars out of the cluster completely,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.420
and the cluster loses stars. It starts with
the lowest mass stars, but as they leave even

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.470
higher mass stars can be lost this way. Eventually
only the most massive stars are left, and

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.060
those tend to blow up. Even then, the remaining
neutron stars and black holes interact and

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.440
fling each other way. This process is aided
by collisions with gas clouds and the tidal

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.540
forces of the collected stars in the galaxy
itself. Given enough time, the cluster just…

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.440
disappears. The individual stars are left
to orbit the galaxy on their own.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.870
About a thousand open clusters are known.
But their days are numbered. Eventually, over

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.580
millions of years, they’ll go away, their
stars scattered across tens of thousands of

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.060
light years, merging with the population of other
stars in space. So, better observe them while you can.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.340
One of the most famous and beautiful open
clusters in the sky is the Pleiades, about

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.169
500 light years from Earth. They appear as
a small, tightly-packed collection of six

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.830
or seven stars to the eye, and a lot of people
call them the Seven Sisters.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.280
Through binoculars several dozen stars can
be seen. Most of them look blue, but that’s

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.139
what we in the science business call a selection
effect or selection bias: The blue stars are

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.490
the brightest, so we see them more easily.
Through a telescope redder stars are apparent.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.570
Long exposures of the Pleiades reveal a surprise:
The stars are embedded in a dust cloud, which

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.860
glows blue from reflected and scattered starlight.
When I was younger it was thought that this

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.540
was the leftover stuff from which the stars
formed. But now we know it’s a coincidence;

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.080
by sheer happenstance the cluster is colliding
with an unrelated cloud of dust -- it’s

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.970
like driving a car through a dust cloud thrown
up by a truck that went past you earlier.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.889
By another coincidence, the Pleiades are located
in the sky next to the Hyades, the only other

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.350
cluster with stars resolvable by the naked
eye. The Hyades are much closer, and appear

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.710
bigger; in fact they form the distinctive
V-shape of the horns of Taurus, the Bull!

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.230
As someone who enjoys taking out a telescope
and observing the sky, I’m a fan of open

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.820
clusters, and a few are favorite targets whenever
I’m outside; I love looking at the Pleiades

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.919
with binoculars, and M35 at the foot of Gemini
is another must-see for me in the winter through

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:44.740
my telescope.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.990
But as much fun as they are to find, and as
beautiful as they are to see, they can’t

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.360
hold a candle to globular clusters.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.340
These are clusters of not thousands, but HUNDREDS
of thousands of stars! They form a roughly

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.840
spherical shape, hence the term globular,
and generally have a well-defined core with

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.210
stars scattered around them in a halo that
fades away with distance. Most globulars are

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.460
bigger than open clusters, with diameters
perhaps a hundred light years across, though

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.320
size is a bit hard to measure, since they
don’t really have an edge.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.430
Like open clusters, the stars in them orbit
every which way, like bees around a beehive.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:24.699
Unlike open clusters, though, globulars are
old. VERY old; most are over ten billion years

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.830
old! We think they were among the first objects
to form after the Universe itself did.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.710
We know this because in most globulars, the
MOST massive stars are LESS massive than the

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.350
Sun. They’ve been around so long that even
stars like the Sun have had enough time to

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.960
become red giants and die, and that takes
a long, LONG time.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.760
The stars in globular clusters tend to have
less heavy elements in them too, which you

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.889
expect if they’re old. Massive stars explode
and scatter their heavy elements into the

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:57.419
Universe, and that takes time. It took billions
of years for stars like the Sun to form, the

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:02.079
ones with more heavy elements in them. Old
stars formed before the Universe was seeded with

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.760
those elements, so they have more lighter elements
in them than later-generation stars like the Sun.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.000
Despite being larger than open clusters, globulars
have more stars and are denser, which is one

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:16.110
reason they live longer than open clusters.
Another is that they tend to spend most of

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.949
their lives outside the galaxy on long, looping
orbits, and there’s nothing out there to

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:23.109
interfere with their solitary existence.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:27.720
Globulars are great laboratories for stellar
astrophysicists. All the stars in them are

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:32.100
born at the same time, and so they’re the
same age. They’re also the same distance

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:37.020
from Earth so if you see one star in a globular
that’s twice as bright as another, it really

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:42.270
IS twice as luminous. That’s handy if you’re
comparing stars for other characteristics.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.770
Because globulars are so old, they contain
a lot of dead stars. We see quite a few white

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.460
dwarfs, as well as neutron stars and black
holes in them — if they have stellar companions,

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.360
they strip off their material, which falls
in and emits X-rays. What normal stars are

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.889
left are low mass red stars, so globulars
tend to look red.

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:03.789
Weirdly, there ARE some blue stars in globulars,
called blue stragglers, and they were mystery

00:08:03.789 --> 00:08:07.860
at first, since they shouldn’t be there
in such old objects. But astronomers figured

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.460
out they’re actually stars that have physically
collided and merged to form a single, higher

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:17.680
mass star. Such collisions are extremely rare
in space, but the stars are so tightly packed

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.889
in globulars that collisions are more common.

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:24.990
We know of about 150 globular clusters orbiting
the Milky Way galaxy — our own local collection

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.330
of stars that we’ll dive into in more detail
in an episode very soon — but other galaxies

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.099
have more, many hundreds or even thousands.

00:08:33.099 --> 00:08:37.559
Globulars are among my very favorite objects
to observe with a small telescope; they are

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:42.009
bright, compact, and their fuzziness due to
so many stars packed so closely together gives

00:08:42.009 --> 00:08:47.779
them an illusion of activity, again like bees
swarming a hive. They are incredibly beautiful.

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:51.499
And that’s the view from tens of thousands
of light years away. Imagine what the sky

00:08:51.499 --> 00:08:56.300
would look like from a planet orbiting a star
inside the cluster! The sky would be filled

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.929
with stars, some so close and luminous there
could be dozens brighter than Venus appears

00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:05.139
in our sky. At night you might be able to
read by starlight!

00:09:05.139 --> 00:09:10.779
Sadly, though, this fantastic sight is probably
more science fiction than science. Because

00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:14.899
globular stars lack heavy metals, it’s unlikely
they would’ve formed planets like Earth.

00:09:14.899 --> 00:09:20.359
And the stars are so closely packed that nearby
encounters might eject any planets that did form.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:26.060
Such a scene would be amazing, but unfortunately
it’s probably one that exists only in our imagination.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.199
Today you learned that open clusters contain
hundreds or thousands of stars held together

00:09:30.199 --> 00:09:35.119
by gravity. They’re young, and evaporate
over time, their stars let loose to roam space

00:09:35.119 --> 00:09:39.980
freely. Globular clusters are larger, have
hundreds of thousands of stars, and are more

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.769
spherical. They’re very old, a significant
fraction of the age of the Universe itself,

00:09:44.769 --> 00:09:49.399
and that means their stars have less heavy
elements in them, are redder, and probably

00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:51.569
don’t have planets (though we’re not really
sure).
