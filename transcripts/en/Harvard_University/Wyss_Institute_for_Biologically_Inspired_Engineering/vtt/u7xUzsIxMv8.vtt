00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.080
I'm a mother of one-year-old daughter,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.230
who has had at least six ear infections in the last six months,

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.090
which makes her actually one of potential candidates for ear tubes.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.330
I took this clinical otolaryngology class at Mass Eye and Ear

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.505
last year where we actually looked inside each other's ears.

00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:23.010
When people would look in my ear,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.880
they could see scar tissue from actually when I had ear tubes when I was two years old.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.310
Tympanostomy tubes, also known as ear tubes,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.460
are devices that are placed frequently in children,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.065
but also in adults,

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:37.590
under conditions of recurrent ear infections,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.745
and that is to evacuate fluid that's stuck behind the eardrum,

00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:42.890
or to ventilate the ear,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.830
in order to prevent recurrent infections from taking place.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.200
Current ear tubes, as we know them,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.150
are very much unchanged from when they were first introduced about 40 years ago,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.850
and have had persistent problems.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.570
Sometimes these ear tubes get clogged and administration of

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.530
topical antibiotics do not make it into the middle ear,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.495
they can be prematurely extruded,

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:07.220
they can be very invasive,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.400
and cause perforation, scarring tissues,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.260
and potentially hearing loss.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.735
Sometimes they have to be reinserted,

00:01:14.735 --> 00:01:18.770
which leads to more surgeries under general anesthesia

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.125
which are truly undesirable by patients and parents.

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:26.270
I think that some advances within material science,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.265
that have occurred over the last few years,

00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:30.440
maybe able to address these issues.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.015
We're full of pipes in our bodies.

00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:39.390
They are supposed to be friction free.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.035
So, nature has evolved already,

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:48.120
how to make piping nonadhesive to bacteria,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.490
nonadhesive to whole range of other biological foulants.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.355
Our team leverages unique biocompatible materials and designs,

00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:05.240
and we utilize an easy to manufacture route through silicon injection molding.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.915
Not only that it makes the tubes nonadhesive to microbes,

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:15.910
but it actually creates unique transport properties.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.375
In one direction, the tube is capable of releasing

00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:25.850
tension and otitis media coming off the inflamed area,

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.860
and in the other direction,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.010
to have antibiotics drugs that can be delivered to middle ear,

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.930
to treat the infections.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.435
That is highly unique,

00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:42.445
customizable feature that has never been seen before.

00:02:42.445 --> 00:02:44.820
So this can reduce otorrhea,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.030
and this can also prevent premature extrusion of the tubes from the patients.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.810
So there's more predictable time frame.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.210
In vitro results are incredibly promising.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.790
We look forward to animal studies,

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.010
through an animal model that's already established,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.485
and we hope to be able to consider

00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:04.190
a human clinical trial in the not too distant future thereafter.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.400
For me, it was very important to work on this project and

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.955
try to find a better solution available for parents,

00:03:10.955 --> 00:03:18.450
who definitely desire more reliable medical device implanted into their children's ears.
