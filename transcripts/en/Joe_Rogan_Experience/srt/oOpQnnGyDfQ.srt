1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:02,763
Let me find my

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,690
waiver signed away over new
[inaudible]. Right. We're live. Great.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,390
While you said that sounds great.
I'm glad that people are seeing me.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,650
Neil Brennan, size witness, everyone
will be a notary, notary republic.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,880
I wonder if they can live,

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,620
there's a software that can listen to
the sound your pan is making and figure

7
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:22,710
out the lines you're drawing.
You know, they have um,

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,270
technology now where when people are
speaking in a room with a, with a window,

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,300
they can get rid of the window noise.
They can know,

10
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:35,301
they can tune into the vibrations of the
window from the sound of your voice and

11
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:37,710
pick up everything that's
being said in the room.

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,890
I heard that there's a
Netflix you because before,

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,870
I mean Netflix doesn't
give people ratings,

14
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:48,710
but there's a way that there you can get,

15
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,370
they can gauge reflections off of with
some weird fucking technology where,

16
00:00:56,421 --> 00:01:00,350
and it's fairly accurate.
Reflections off a window. Yes.

17
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:04,220
I don't sell secondhand. Yeah. Like
second hand. Not at, it's like,

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,960
I believe it's sound waves.
Um,

19
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,880
oh wow. What are they monitoring?
Jamie's got something. I have no idea.

20
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,200
[inaudible] by this right now,

21
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:15,620
if you want Jamie long range
laser listening device,

22
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,230
the long range laser listening device,

23
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:22,190
laser microscope is a highly sophisticated
surveillance apparatus that utilizes

24
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:26,210
an invisible infrared laser
beam to eavesdrop on a target,

25
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,710
does the most effective long range
laser listening device in the world.

26
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:34,970
That allows the operator to conduct an
undetectable surveillance operation on

27
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:39,560
any target from Tony Stark industry with
at least one window at an impressive

28
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:42,200
distance of over 500 meters.

29
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,410
That is actually very impressive are
that's far as shit with the laser beam

30
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,740
Gottschalk and you can just buy that,
as I say, that's commercially available.

31
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:55,580
And I wonder what is not commercially
available. Oh, for sure. Right out there.

32
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,210
Like you remember when there was that
story about a some weird sound weapon they

33
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:03,470
think that the Cubans are using on,
yeah, Americans that were in Cuba,

34
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,910
this probably a bunch of shit.

35
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,120
I was reading an article they can
list like submarines, have technology,

36
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:12,170
they can listen to basically like
fish farting in the ocean. If they,

37
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,870
if they wanted to, they can hear sounds
that quiet, they can hear anything. So if,

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,950
uh, like literally a fish farts, they're
like, oh, what was that? What was that?

39
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:21,170
Was that a sub? Nope, it was a fish next.

40
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,390
Like what was the next sound good for
us or something good for somebody?

41
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,570
Good for us I guess. Uh, yeah,

42
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:34,550
the sound thing was funny cause it was
like people would get sick and they quit

43
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:37,920
and then there was also, they didn't
shine it too. They were like, they at uh,

44
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,130
American civil like Ngo,

45
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,780
like government or like kind of worked
for the government tangentially.

46
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,110
Or they worked at the embassy there.
Apartments were above each other.

47
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,360
Two separate people. And both of them,
it was on 60 minutes, like not long ago.

48
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,090
So they targeted the rooms. Yeah.
It's like a dog whistle for people.

49
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,980
It yes. In essence. And it's
like, well, do you want me to

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,520
do, I guess you just leave. I
guess it is like a dog whistle.

51
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,680
Just shares. Yeah, the
Fuck Outta here. Oh yeah.

52
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:11,170
There's probably a ton of technology
like that that we're not aware of.

53
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,360
My friend Mike Swick,

54
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,460
he used to fight in the UFC and
before that he did a brief brief,

55
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,460
spent a stint rather um,
in the military

56
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,340
he was doing something,
some sort of a,

57
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,500
he is either secret service work or
something along those lines. But anyway,

58
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:30,400
he was at the embassy in Russia and
he said that they had found listening

59
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:35,401
devices that were so sophisticated that
they were being powered by the natural

60
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:40,330
sway of the building. Wow.
With the wind. So the wind,

61
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,980
they didn't need a power source.

62
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:47,190
The natural swaying of the building in
the wind was powering up this little

63
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:51,020
microphone that was listening in
on things and he said they were,

64
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,520
they were looking at this stuff. They're
like, we don't know anything like this.

65
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:59,440
Like this is completely new stuff.
And that we found it in the building.

66
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,700
I like, I mean, I don't love it, but
it's like kind of cool. It's cool. Yeah.

67
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,990
Like I just don't kill me or us.
You know what I mean?

68
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:11,580
Like the hope is we just boat would
they have their thing and we hadn't,

69
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,720
it's just like mutually
assured destruction.

70
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:16,480
Like an arms race of technology
cause that's what's gonna happen.

71
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,870
The amount do you use the cloud?
Yes.

72
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,350
I know like I don't use it for important
stuff but I use it for like my apps.

73
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,930
Yeah.
All my apps are backed up in the cloud.

74
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,840
Recordings are backed up
in the cloud sets sets,

75
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,670
but there's no photos or video. Let's
just have been like, I don't know man.

76
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,520
It's fucking crazy. I mean we're, we're,

77
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,150
we're getting down to some very
strange place with the cloud.

78
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,420
Let's stuff be in the air
and the amount of trust,

79
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,790
it takes a,

80
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,560
the presumption that we'll just never
run out of energy and we'll never run out

81
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:57,670
of the ability to tap into the cloud. It's
like I don't, that seems presumption. I,

82
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,800
I'm not even like a doomsday person,

83
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:04,030
but I just feel like it's like the
difference between how men dress in public

84
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:05,830
and how women dress.
Like on a night out,

85
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,400
women are wearing heels and guys are
dressed in case they have to fight.

86
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,170
I'm still like, we will do the thing. And
the mayor were like, ah, I'll fucking,

87
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,460
I'll fuck you up. And like, that's how
I feel with technology where I'm like,

88
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,030
what do I have a backup plan for this?
Even people with like,

89
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,760
why Phi door locks? I'm like, I
don't know man. I don't know man.

90
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,640
I don't know if the Wifi goes out,
what are you going to yeah.

91
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,650
Like please be care. I
don't, I don't know what the,

92
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,720
what the negative scenario is,

93
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,140
but even my garage in my place and I
live in like a townhouse thing and there

94
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,020
was a power outage,
the gate won't open.

95
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,410
And like there's no release was a fail.

96
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,410
There was a release, uh, that somebody,

97
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,950
a better person than I figured out. You
know what I mean? I would have just like,

98
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,110
we're like the mud kid come Uber,
I didn't have a fucking plan,

99
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:04,100
but someone figured out,
like,

100
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,730
you open a hatch and then there's a
chain and you got to pull the chain.

101
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:12,170
And then was like, okay, but
it wasn't, uh, it wasn't easy.

102
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,970
Like, I, you know, it's the doomsday
thing. It's like, yeah, well

103
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,240
this Guy Graham Hancock. Yeah, this
guy's been on my show several times.

104
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,410
He's just done recently and he's one of
the main proponents of this theory that

105
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,690
something somewhere around 12,800
years ago hit the earth and fucked up

106
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:34,860
everything and probably reset civilization
killed off the vast majority of us.

107
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,100
12,200 that's not that long ago,
not that long ago.

108
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:39,960
At on corresponds with
the end of the ice age.

109
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:44,100
There's a lot of physical evidence for
it and increasingly we're seeing more and

110
00:06:44,101 --> 00:06:49,101
more evidence in terms of ancient
cultures that existed far before a 12,800

111
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:52,310
years ago.
They really didn't understand that.

112
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,600
They thought people were just
hunter gatherers back then.

113
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:57,690
Now they're finding evidence of things
like there's a place called go Beckley

114
00:06:57,691 --> 00:06:58,950
tappy,
which is a giant,

115
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,910
these huge monolithic structures
that are made out of stone carving,

116
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,140
like huge columns that don't seem like
they were made by hunter gatherers.

117
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:10,500
It seems like there was probably some
sort of a lost civilization and they know

118
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:12,960
that this all happened
somewhere around that time,

119
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:15,750
somewhere around 12,000 years ago. So, um,

120
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,970
it can happen again and if it does happen
again, all our stuff is on digital now,

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,690
which is even weirder. It's weirder
than books, right? We have books,

122
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,880
but the vast majority of most of
the data that we all keep and share,

123
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,180
we share on phones and on
computers and we can't read it.

124
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,670
We can't read it without compromise.

125
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,190
I don't know the first thing about,
do you know what I mean?

126
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:42,720
Like I don't know anything about,
I was, I was talking last night,

127
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:46,320
like I don't know much about
my, the different, the,

128
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:51,180
the level of education women have about
their reproductive organs versus men.

129
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,710
Oh yeah. Like my, my balls,
I know about my balls.

130
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,510
I know that the medical term, his
testicles. Hmm. That's about it.

131
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,490
Don't go hot if you get them hot again,
that's like, that's like a child.

132
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,270
You know what I mean? Like Saturday.
And you only know that from like,

133
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,980
oh cause I got 'em hot one time.

134
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,030
But I don't know how semen gets to the,

135
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,210
I don't know the name of the two. I
don't know anything cause that's my body.

136
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,130
Right. Women know tons of, they know
fallopian tubes with a vulva, cervix,

137
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,260
like everything. Um, yeah.

138
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:32,180
Guys know prostate cancer
room blows my asshole. Ooh.

139
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,650
Oh yeah. And not curious. I mean, like,
not like curious in a way of like,

140
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,820
I,
let's just hope,

141
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,590
just hope for the [inaudible] none of
my business plus to get checked out,

142
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:47,160
you have to have a finger in your ass and
everybody puts that off. Yeah. Now me,

143
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:49,680
why women do that once he constantly,

144
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,240
they're always getting jabbed at and swab
to swab. Yes. They get the Pap smear.

145
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,220
US smear the, the title. Yeah.

146
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,810
We'll fuck Jesus.

147
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:03,210
Just every imagine if you needed
people to come inside you,

148
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,820
he needed them to not just, not just
exchange bodily fluids by kissing.

149
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,590
Now they have to squirt something
in you to make people. Yeah.

150
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,280
I have this odd,
they're poisonous little dirty DNA.

151
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,570
Their dirty little fucking infected.

152
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,190
It's awfully gross.
Okay.

153
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,120
Maybe you get like 10 feet away from it.
You're like, Jesus, what they're doing,

154
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:33,330
but why you're in the moment. It seems
like the most logical you gotta do it.

155
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,520
CanNot do it. Yeah. Did you,
uh, speaking of that too,

156
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,240
do you see the thing about Gerad? No,
that I don't if you want to bring it up,

157
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:47,160
but he basically came out a little on HBO,

158
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,810
came out,
came out a little too.

159
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:53,010
His mom said I've had a sexual
experiences with men. Oh.

160
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,750
Um, and uh, it's a, it's just
like, was she cool with it?

161
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,220
Yeah, she was cool with it. Yeah.
That's, I think when I, people are like,

162
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:03,180
what are you think? I'm like, I don't,

163
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,650
that sexual preference at this point to
me is about as interesting as like your

164
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:10,550
workout routine. Like I just don't care.
Like what are you doing? Hey, go cold.

165
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:13,560
You know what I care about? Are you funny?
Are you funny? And Are you cool? Yeah.

166
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,850
And, and like do we have shit to talk
about? Right. Great. Yeah, I don't,

167
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,440
I couldn't care less who's,
what type of hand you like jerk and yet,

168
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,011
you know what I mean?

169
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:26,640
Like I think it's kind of a mouth
with some guys who like Tim Dillon,

170
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:30,330
I think it's an advantage with his act
that he's gay because he's so ridiculous.

171
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:33,090
And over the top and he's
just like big fat gay guy,

172
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,070
but he doesn't really talk to them.
He'd talk about it very much.

173
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,180
Talk about it sometimes. Yeah, but
I mean, it's not a big deal to him.

174
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,760
He treats it the way God
treats the sexuality. Look,

175
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:44,490
you don't have to go blaring through the
streets of your straight all the time.

176
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,990
Right. You are. I usually
assume you're really not.
Right, right. There's no, yeah,

177
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,770
there's straight. You're straight.
If you're not, no one fucking cares.

178
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:55,320
And the comedy community,
literally, no one cares. Yeah.

179
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,610
Doesn't it makes any difference?

180
00:10:56,611 --> 00:11:00,180
The only thing that bums me out is
when guys hide it. It's like, come on,

181
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,080
does it bum you out for them or
for them? Yeah, I'd really bumped,

182
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:08,760
but having said that, I get it. I
get it. Like it's a real bummer.

183
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:12,600
It's sad. We know a few guys
that are in the closet and it's,

184
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,990
you just feel bad for them.
Like Zach, like, yeah, man,

185
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,440
I hope it's not unbearable.
Right. You know what I mean? Like,

186
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,230
like I get while you're,
while you're in the closet.

187
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,880
I get why actors in the closet,

188
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:28,500
like especially male actors like cause
it doesn't serve them to come out.

189
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,180
It's not gonna it's not gonna help them.

190
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,260
I think it's the worst thing for them
in terms of like getting roles as a

191
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:37,110
heterosexual.
If you're a known homosexual,

192
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,010
you almost can't get roles
as a heterosexual. Yeah.

193
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,340
Like I remember there were some who is a,

194
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,030
what is that guy's named
Neil Patrick Harris.

195
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,350
He was in something where he played
like this arrogant guy who likes girls.

196
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,190
He was in a it now.
Well No,

197
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,400
and now he was on to uh, how I met
your mother. Yeah. And that worked.

198
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,210
He also played a straight guy
in a gone girl pretty well.

199
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,370
Yeah. Was that before or it was at Cape.
Both Ben after. Really. And I was all,

200
00:12:07,371 --> 00:12:11,650
cause I said, I was surprised that that's
what he played. But like certain people,

201
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:12,550
they just,
I don't know.

202
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:17,610
He might put the only guy that I agree
that like he came out and it's not,

203
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,260
then he's he you buy it
somehow as a romantic lead.

204
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,910
You think that it's like
it cancels that out.

205
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,830
Like if Tom Cruise decided to come out,

206
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:28,660
if Tom Cruise is gay and
he decided to come out,

207
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,360
like that would be a real problem.
You know what?

208
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:32,840
I was talking to somebody
about this the other day,

209
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:37,850
you know it be a hilarious movie into a
gay couple because Tom Cruise and John

210
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,800
Travolta, John Travolta, John
Travolta gets kidnapped and gay.

211
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:47,710
Tom Cruise has to save his
gay husband John Travolta.

212
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,660
But other than that it's a real
action movie. Wow. It's just gay.

213
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,310
I like it when that'd be fucking cool.
Like just a straight get,

214
00:12:57,311 --> 00:13:00,040
if anyone out there,
a screen writer that have at it,

215
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,400
because I'm never going to write it.
Would that fly when people enjoy that?

216
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,150
Like if it was really good like
John Wick style, I think it would.

217
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,080
I really think it would if it was,
if the guy just kicked,

218
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,360
it's not like gay guys are
like a feet and offend you.

219
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,510
I know plenty of like rough gay
guys that will whoop your ass.

220
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:21,340
Like bro Bears, Bro. Her they
got, they got their own crowd.

221
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,930
That's how fucking bad
these guys are. Uh, yeah.

222
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,970
I too really it would be fucking so
cool. Like, and he was going to, yeah.

223
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,240
Cause that's how I feel with someone
like drunk coming out. I'm like,

224
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,780
I don't care.
Okay.

225
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,790
I know it's never come up are we've
been good friends for a decade.

226
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,870
Just never came up. Yeah. Like he
didn't seem that interested in women,

227
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:41,251
but I don't,

228
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:45,250
I also don't think he's not interested
in just maybe there's definitely a

229
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:49,600
spectrum. Right. And so people are
just, yeah. And that's fine too. Yeah.

230
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,600
I'm also not met.
Like if I were on the spectrum,

231
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:55,840
I think I would absolutely do it. Yeah.
I'm just not on the spectrum like I,

232
00:13:55,841 --> 00:14:00,460
but in terms of opportunity,
there's a lot of nights a year,

233
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,180
Joe. Oh yeah. There's 365
nights a year. Yeah. You could,

234
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,770
you're not going to do the Pussy Dick Go.
You go back the same night, split it up.

235
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,180
Dahmer. I had the best joke about
that. He goes, he goes, I, he goes,

236
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,310
this is how little I give a fuck.
He goes,

237
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:19,570
I wish I was gay just so I could
come out. Yeah. It was, I wish,

238
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,440
I wish I had a secret like that.
Yeah.

239
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,740
That's how little I give a fuck.
It's true.

240
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,680
It's like his joke about I'm
gaining weight for a movie.

241
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,880
I don't know what the movie is yet,
but it's fucking great joke.

242
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,660
Um, yeah, but uh, gay action movie
was fantastic. I like it. I do too. I,

243
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,760
within a year or two, people would
be definitely ready for it. I it,

244
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,220
if it were a legit good action
movie. Yeah. I think they'd be,

245
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,180
if it were Tom Hardy,

246
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,250
even if maybe if they were both one of
was straight and one of them was Tom

247
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:56,660
already and he just plays gay and,
and like he, it's, it's taken,

248
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,410
but it doesn't have to be two
gay guys can be even crazier.

249
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,590
Two straight guys who have to make out.
Yeah.

250
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:05,810
They could be played by white
straight guys. Absolutely.

251
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:07,040
Then we're right now we're talking,

252
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:10,580
now we're really talking now
you caulking and commitment.

253
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,540
Because I was thinking about do
whim if Tom Cruise was gay, right?

254
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,650
Uh, and he just came out and there's
a movie where he has to save his wife.

255
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,750
Would women not believe it?
Do you know what I mean? Like,
like, so if you come out,

256
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:27,200
so it's like, all right, so now
in the next mission impossible,

257
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,690
they just kidnap his husband.
Yeah.

258
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,340
Well for sure you could do
that with lesbians if you
had two hot lesbians. Yeah,

259
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:38,990
of course. 100%. Yeah, no, there's
zero issue. That would be no problem.

260
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,980
Uh, there'd be no resistance. And
that's a difference too. You know,

261
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,970
a lesbian actress, they can go a woman
who a lesbian. You know why the trays?

262
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:51,971
I believe gay straight because there's
a big portion of men who never truly

263
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:55,280
believe a lesbian. I have
a bit about it. Yeah.

264
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:57,110
I had a bit about from
one of my old specials.

265
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,430
So like we believe that you believe
you're a lesbian. Yeah. But uh,

266
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,380
just ain't got a pizza this week. Stick
yet. He never spent a Saturday with me.

267
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:11,300
Fucking Applebee's. I hit you with
an Applebee's and the bar corner bar.

268
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:15,500
Forget it. The panty dropper.
Tequila shots. What do you
got? Oh, Brokeback mountain.

269
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,220
Yeah. There wasn't really an
action though. I know. If we,

270
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,670
we know for sure that both of
those guys are not gay. We do not.

271
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,840
We us,

272
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:28,820
I mean Jake Dillon Hall
Straight and you say,

273
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,750
so heath ledger, but you saw that
movie house. True Man. Come on, man.

274
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:36,110
You saw he buy, you believed it,
Jack. No one's that good at acting.

275
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:40,310
Definitely crazy. There's no way he could
play crazy. That guy's definitely gay.

276
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,680
Trust me.
I know things.

277
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,280
I've seen many movies and understand them.

278
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,870
I know when someone's acting and
someone's just gay fucking kid,

279
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,640
that was easy for him. Yeah. No, it
would be that, but running around. Yeah,

280
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,950
that could happen. That could,
I think that could happen.

281
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,350
I think we're on the verge of that.
I would enjoy it.

282
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,220
I'm happy for it because then people
stop getting free passes where you're

283
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:10,690
goofy, but you're gay. So we let you slide
with silly behavior like, no, no, no, no,

284
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:13,040
no, no, no. I want equality.

285
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,520
I want you me to be able to call you a
dunce and not have to worry about being

286
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:19,610
homophobic and no one hears gay dunce.
Right.

287
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:23,870
When you say you just got
to get this guy's a fucking
dummy. Hey, hey. Yeah. God,

288
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:28,450
you're homophobic. Yeah. Oh my
God. Oh my God. Yeah, it's the it,

289
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,260
that's how we would go
at the comedy cellar.

290
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,460
Like it just like this fucking dunce here.
It would count.

291
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,980
Did I hear that the,
the comedy cellar is like,

292
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:40,640
seriously has a social
justice warrior infestation,

293
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:43,520
like they need to like spray
the place. Oh, I don't, I mean,

294
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,670
when I've been there and it hasn't been
like that, that's me. They've been,

295
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,600
there had been people writing about it.
There've been,

296
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,620
I mean it's like the comedy cellar,
like the main hub of culture now.

297
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,910
It's like the hub of wokeness. Yeah,
I mean, but it's also like the,

298
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,200
the main battlefield of
wokeness where it's like,

299
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,970
literally we came and they were protesters
and then I couldn't sit at the table

300
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,620
and I, because it's like,
all right. I mean, yeah.

301
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,680
I don't think it's pull your dick out.
Yeah, exactly. Louie. To pull it dick out.

302
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:13,940
And she was a hero. I was, I was
quoting all these tweets, uh,

303
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,810
that we're talking about it in articles
that were written hero. She was heroic.

304
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,720
I think that, I think someone
sent me a Louis article today.

305
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:24,030
I think there's just
fatigue at this point. Yes.

306
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,640
I think people are just like taught
like, what's he, I don't. Okay.

307
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:31,680
Try to find a new stormy Daniels article.
Yeah. Everybody's like, enough. Yeah. Try.

308
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:36,450
We thought it was going to work. It didn't
work. Fuck. He doesn't give a fuck. Fuck.

309
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,390
He doesn't care. Shit. Justin
Martindale was, and I'll never forget,

310
00:18:40,391 --> 00:18:44,190
he's in the fucking hallway of the comedy
store as flamboyant as he could ever

311
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:48,540
be. And he goes, that's our Monica
Lewinsky. She's going to take them down.

312
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:52,020
I'm like, good luck. Stormy Daniels.
Yeah. I'm like, good luck man.

313
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,860
I ain't gonna do shit. So what's the
worst thing that comes out of this?

314
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,550
That he fucked her or they paid her to
keep quiet and she didn't keep quiet.

315
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,980
What's the worst thing do we
think he doesn't fuck. Yeah,

316
00:19:02,981 --> 00:19:07,410
it's all different strains on like
we knew he was gross. No one cared.

317
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,800
The only way that we'll, it
goes, he raises taxes. Yeah.

318
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,200
Or then he'll lose his base or you a
raise the taxes on lower middle class

319
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:20,010
people. And if he, if he like
doesn't stand by as abortion stuff,

320
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:23,700
but otherwise all the donors are sticking
with them. Everyone sticking with them.

321
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,800
What happened yesterday, there was a
new abortion ruling. Was it an Alabama?

322
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,500
Yes.
Basically outlawed.

323
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,610
I personally believe it's going
to backfire. You think so? Yeah.

324
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:36,750
Cause I think people,

325
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,780
the thing that that's always been true
was republicans were against abortion and

326
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:45,660
they would go like we and they
never got to repeal it. Right.

327
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,450
But I think they're going to repeal it
and then people are going to go like,

328
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:52,470
Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa.
This is crazy. If you don't
want to get abortions, fine,

329
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:57,810
but you can't, uh, change a
law based on a lot of times,

330
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,670
not even a plurality of, of, uh,
you know, like in general elections,

331
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:04,320
like in the general presidential election,

332
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:07,380
like it's not even the majority of
the country that elects the president.

333
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,280
Now what do, who vote? Was this something
that the people of Alabama voting? No,

334
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:13,400
it's the, it's the, the government,

335
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:17,520
like the state a slippery slope.
Yeah.

336
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,470
And it's like you're going, you're
doing 99 years in jail if you get an a,

337
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,980
if you give an abortion or get one.
Yeah. That's what it is now. Yeah.

338
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,510
That's what it's going to,
that's the law that they passed.

339
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,740
I just personally believe that.
I mean, I'm obviously hopeful,

340
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,200
but it's a bit like, no, that's too far.

341
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:39,090
It's a bit like when they made Clinton
testify and people were like, ah,

342
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,010
that was too, that was like tha
tha tha tha too, too far. Uh,

343
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,860
the aline was crossed where they may
Clinton testify about sex life and it was

344
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:48,130
like,

345
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,870
hmm,
we don't like that.

346
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,720
We understand that you wanted to rebuke
the guy but don't make the press.

347
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,230
And I feel like I'm hoping
and I believe it's true, uh,

348
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,480
that it will be too far
field for moderate people.

349
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,500
Well I hope you're right and it's just,

350
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,040
it's very dangerous when you just decide
that no one can do it anymore based on

351
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:15,240
a few people's decision that is going to
affect the millions of people that live

352
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:15,910
in Alabama.

353
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:20,910
We'll also keep abortion laws are odd
cause it it the assumption is the reason

354
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Christians want to outlaw it is because
they think God is going to say what's

355
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:32,750
with your vote on that? I saw
that you voted for abortion. What?

356
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,070
Like do you want to kill babies? Yeah.
So you want to kill baby was like,

357
00:21:35,071 --> 00:21:37,660
well no I didn't. I didn't kill
anybody just yet. But you voted for it.

358
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,590
It's like they don't want to live
in a country where that's legal.

359
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,180
Having said that,

360
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,270
if you Google the worldwide rights of
abortion, it's not legal everywhere.

361
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:53,420
Which surprised me because I was like,
where is it? What is America's a,

362
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,380
where do we stand within
the rest of the world?

363
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:59,720
And there are not a ton of
countries, but there's an, there's,

364
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,920
I think it's illegal in a
quarter of the world. Wow. Um,

365
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,920
if not more,

366
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,740
well, abortion is one of those
things where it's like, okay,

367
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,910
when does it bother you? It doesn't bother
me at all. If you're two days pregnant,

368
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,780
doesn't bother me at all. Bothers me a
little. If you're four months pregnant,

369
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,050
bothers me a lot. If you're
five or six, bothers me a lot.

370
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,590
If you look really pregnant, you get
an abortion. It's like, what? What,

371
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,190
what is that? Is that a baby that
would be viable outside the womb?

372
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,050
Cause it's one of those,
it's,

373
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,920
it's something that people just have a
deep discomfort about when discussing,

374
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,780
even if you're a supporter of it,

375
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:38,560
if you just discuss the
actual reality of what it is,

376
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:43,450
what the act is with this
surgical procedure is,

377
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,470
and it makes, you know,
it's not, it's not nothing.

378
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,560
That's the saying, it's not
enough. Right. Like, and,

379
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,000
and I think that one of the
indicators that it's not nothing,

380
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,380
and I'm pro pro choice. Yeah. Like, um,

381
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,250
you're right wing Joe. Everybody
knows that. Um, for some so far right.

382
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:04,910
To go the other way and
left. Um, the backside, the,

383
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:08,960
I actually do want to talk about that,
uh, the, the presumption about you, um,

384
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,850
that,
you know,

385
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,600
the one of the indicators is when people
talk about even getting an abortion,

386
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,970
they are,
they always whisper about it.

387
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,010
And I don't know if it's because of
the stigma or thinks because they,

388
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,850
it's kind of not nothing. Yeah.
It's a personal thing too.

389
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:27,560
I don't think they want to
discuss it with other folks,

390
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,200
but I wouldn't care if he got it,
if I've got a cyst removed. I mean,

391
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:34,730
if that's the indication, yeah. It's
just a medical procedure. And again,

392
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,710
pro choice have added. Yeah.
I'm sure. I've never, I don't,

393
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:44,120
I haven't had any abortions
that I know of. Um, but I don't,

394
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,160
I don't know at what I'd be like,
ah,

395
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,990
when these attitudes about it,

396
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,280
about the taboo of discussing it though
and impedes rational discourse and

397
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:56,570
impedes your ability to talk about things
and communicate about them because you

398
00:23:56,571 --> 00:24:01,571
have to have this very rigid opinion that
you're always pro abortion pro women's

399
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:03,800
rights, woman's right to
choose, which I am. It is,

400
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:08,780
but we're still talking about a real
thing and that real thing is killing a

401
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:12,140
thing that would grow up to be a person
and that's why people freak out about it

402
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:14,990
and to pretend otherwise
is just disingenuous.

403
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,110
Louis was the first one I heard talk
about that on stage and in a way that was

404
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:20,690
funny where like if they think they're
burner babies down there, yeah,

405
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:22,940
I'd protest too if I thought they were,

406
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:25,410
if there was a place that I thought
these people are murdering babies, right.

407
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,280
I'm out there every day. Yeah.
I, he's like, I don't care.

408
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,460
I personally think they are
murdering babies. I don't care. It's,

409
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,230
this was before that

410
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,630
trouble and this is one of the things
like when like that Parkland joke that he

411
00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:41,420
did, I was like, look, that's
not his best joke, but it's also,

412
00:24:41,421 --> 00:24:45,770
he's working it out yet then stand up in
10 fucking months. He's working it out.

413
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:49,670
But if you say that he's different now
we're getting to see the real Louis like

414
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:52,520
bitch, you better go through
his library. That's what he did.

415
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,850
Yeah. The apartment and was like
his ninth most offensive joke. Yeah.

416
00:24:55,851 --> 00:25:00,440
Not even close. And he's, he's, that's
what he does. It's called comedy.

417
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,950
Yeah. They, the idea was like we'll put,
we didn't know he was, he didn't know him.

418
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,800
Yeah. Cause you know, you assume what
you believed, what he fed or you,

419
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,270
you wanted to believe.
I actually,

420
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,680
I have a theory that one of the reasons
people like the New York Times and, and,

421
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,603
and,
uh,

422
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:21,290
other media outlets got brought the hammer
down so hard on him is because they'd

423
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:23,840
heard the rumors and ignored them.

424
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,980
So now they have to signal
that like this is wrong.

425
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,700
Because there were rumors before and
they were like, we don't like they,

426
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,060
they ignore them. So now they have
to overcompensate and be like,

427
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:39,980
he is absolutely, he's the face of
hypocrisy and evil. I'm just like,

428
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,060
okay, well he just caught it at the
worst time. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

429
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,040
He just a bad,

430
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:50,330
he had beach front property
during a turn it, yeah.

431
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:55,550
Yeah. He just is like some arcades you
can just tell you got the deep stilts,

432
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,710
not this one mother fucker.
Like he had flush on sure. Flat.

433
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,700
He's walking around and I was
going, oh my God, this is my cup.

434
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,710
Oh my cup. Uh, here's what I
want to talk about with you.

435
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,460
The idea, cause whenever I tell people
were friends or that I go on your show,

436
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:15,590
they're like, how can,
I'm like, first of all,

437
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:20,650
because you're a fucking good dude and
have been a good dude for 27 years that I

438
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:24,830
know of. To me, um, it doesn't
mean you're always get whatever.

439
00:26:24,831 --> 00:26:26,560
You're always good to do that.
Every time I said, whatever,

440
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,670
I don't fucking know your life.
I don't know what you do.

441
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:32,420
Outside of fucking Encino, uh, the, uh,

442
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:38,020
and now the next question becomes
why do you have cranks on,

443
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,460
or what people would
consider cranks on the show.

444
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:44,040
And you and I have talked about this a
little bit off the show. Explain because

445
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,290
you are basically liberal.
Yes.

446
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,220
But you believe in having hardcore right
wing people on because you like them

447
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,340
personally or you like you believe it's
worth some of them I like personally,

448
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:58,470
so it's worth having a conversation.

449
00:26:58,471 --> 00:27:02,970
Like Ben Shapiro was one that
I had a long conversation with.

450
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:06,270
He's one of the more controversial guys
that I have on how people get upset at

451
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:10,290
me and call me an outrider. You mean
while he's been attacked by the alt right.

452
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:15,180
You know, I mean he wears a Yarmulke
for Christ sake and he's not alt right.

453
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:17,430
It's not a white supremacist by
any stretch of the imagination.

454
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:21,960
He was the number one target for
antisemitic remarks in the entire world.

455
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,890
2016. Well he's that. There's
that. It's definitely dead.

456
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,670
But we had an in depth conversation,

457
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:32,410
a very long one about gay people.
Yeah.

458
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,670
Cause he's a little bit of it where
he was like, he kind of didn't,

459
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,670
he kinda got a little lost.
Well, yeah, because it doesn't,

460
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,790
well he had two different
t here's David Parkman,

461
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,170
uh, had, uh, an interesting take on it.

462
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,500
Pacman said that if you
look at his explanation,

463
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,940
because I asked him a couple things,
I'm like,

464
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:54,720
do you really believe that Moses
part of the Red Sea? And he said,

465
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,080
I would look for more
naturalistic explanation for that.

466
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,850
But then when I talked to him
about gay people and gay things,

467
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,240
he wasn't interested in a
naturalistic explanation.

468
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,900
And he also wasn't interested in giving
people the ability to do whatever they

469
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:13,080
want. He felt like you're not,
you're supposed to resist that.

470
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,140
And his take is that like, you,
you have an urge to murder people,

471
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:19,140
but you don't do it because you're a
good person and you should do the same

472
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:23,550
thing with being gay. And I was like,
wow, that's crazy. That's crazy.

473
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:24,570
Mental gymnastics.

474
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,920
So that is a natch he believes the natural
occurring thing that God is testing

475
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:31,530
you with. I mean, I'm putting
words in his mouth. I think,

476
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:33,360
but essentially that's his position.

477
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,420
His position is that God doesn't want
you to do that. It's in the Bible.

478
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:38,550
He doesn't do it. I mean he, he goes hard.

479
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,610
He doesn't use electricity in the Sabba
till the sun goes down the whole deal.

480
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,880
Yeah. And um, you know, a
lot of people like, you know,

481
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:46,170
you've given this guy
a platform. Like, look,

482
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:49,680
I'm communicating with someone and I like
him as a person. He's a very nice guy.

483
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:52,760
I don't agree with them at all about that,
about the gays.

484
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:55,920
Don't you believe it's worth giving
people a platform? What does that mean?

485
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,090
I'm not platform,

486
00:28:57,091 --> 00:29:00,240
but like I think that's a real problem
that discussing things like that,

487
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:03,720
like giving people a platform because
we're living in this world of DDI platform

488
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:05,700
with people.
I think that's inherently dangerous.

489
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,510
And I think that just stopping people
from their ability to communicate just

490
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:12,000
makes more pressure on their side.

491
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,780
It makes more people that are on the
fence support them because they see you as

492
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:20,010
being a sensor. And that's what I think
we found out with Jack. I'm from Twitter,

493
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:23,420
Jack Dorsey, when he came on and talk
to me about it and when he brought vid,

494
00:29:23,421 --> 00:29:28,200
John Who's the lawyer and you know
like censoring, censoring, all sort of,

495
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,480
it's not smart,
it's not good.

496
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,360
It does the opposite of
what you intended to do.

497
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:35,130
It makes the other side magnified.

498
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,100
It makes whoever you're
censoring more popular.

499
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,220
It makes them an underdog and it also
goes against core American values,

500
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:43,300
like the freedom of speech.

501
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,770
And I know that these are private
institutions and I know that they are not

502
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:52,771
necessarily forced to uphold what we
determine as free speech in terms of like

503
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:57,160
how it's written in the constitution, the
bill of rights. I get, I understand that,

504
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:02,550
but I think that the principles of human
interaction on this planet are largely

505
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,290
dictated by our ability to discuss
things even if you disagree.

506
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,310
I actually do agree
with you that that the,

507
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,320
I think like d platforming and silencing
and he's at the danger. I don't,

508
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,920
there are very few people that,
well,

509
00:30:19,921 --> 00:30:24,030
there's no one that I agree with 100% of
the time. Right. Including yourself. Yes.

510
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,210
Including your joke about like you
don't agree with yourself. Like I don't,

511
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,870
I don't, it's real. Yeah. Well that's
also, there's something Buddhist about it,

512
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:34,530
which is like your thoughts
are not correct. Right.

513
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,640
They're not even your thoughts.
They're just like pended upon your lotion.

514
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,290
Yes. It depends on your stress levels.
Yeah. You know, sometimes you just like,

515
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:45,020
you're, you just don't have it
in you and you're like stop.

516
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,210
And other times the same situation,

517
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:50,330
you'd be super calm and reasonable
and maybe you could turn it around.

518
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:53,170
Yeah. If you've eaten. Yeah. Like
there, I saw a thing yesterday.

519
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:55,720
Doctors are worse in the afternoon.
Oh,

520
00:30:55,721 --> 00:31:00,550
I'm sure judges are worst hurt search
before surgeries in the morning. Uh, yeah.

521
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,540
So to your point,

522
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,920
yeah.
The right wing thing.

523
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:05,830
It's just an easy way to dismiss
me because I'm not right wing.

524
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:09,070
If you asked me my positions on
things, it's very left wing. Yeah.

525
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,780
The only thing that I very,

526
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:15,160
with the Orthodoxy is with the
Second Amendment with gun rights.

527
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,870
I don't think it's just that simple.

528
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,000
I know a lot of really good people
that have guns and I'll know,

529
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:21,580
I know a lot of really good people that
would never shoot anybody that have guns

530
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:24,070
to protect themselves and
to label everyone the same.

531
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:27,580
It's just like labeling everyone who
drives a car the same as those in cells

532
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:30,320
that drove into people in Montreal
or wherever that was. Who's that?

533
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:34,150
Toronto or wherever that was. Yeah, it's,

534
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,240
we have a real problem labeling people
and labeling people with it's lazy and

535
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,930
it's an attempt to marginalize
or dismiss their positions

536
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,750
and it also feels good.
Yeah.

537
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,790
Should do it should it feels good to
like guest what? Writing them off.

538
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,570
I'm superior.
I have a very clear moral view.

539
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:58,580
I'm taking out one of my moral
paint brushes, Chuang Tzu.

540
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,533
You are that.

541
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:02,490
Even if it's not a moral position,
even if like that Neal Brennan,

542
00:32:02,491 --> 00:32:06,690
he's such a left wing cook. He's a this
and of that. And Boom, there you go.

543
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,900
I've got them in a box. I'm going to
put a ribbon on it. Yep. Ship them off.

544
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,200
So you've read the comments when I'm on
the chancel you're canceled. I heard.

545
00:32:13,201 --> 00:32:17,480
Yeah. So, uh, I brought up
that makeup boy and, um,

546
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,170
the makeup of my daughter's in love with,

547
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,930
she watches this makeup on Youtube
and now he's been canceled.

548
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,330
I understand he lost 3 million and she's,

549
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:28,830
she was telling me to have an 11 year
old sit down and tell you about a gay

550
00:32:28,831 --> 00:32:31,260
makeup artists and this is the funny part.
She goes,

551
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,000
well there was a couple of things.
Okay. So there was the thing with,

552
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,320
he has, um, a friend who,

553
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:43,370
and he tells me this woman's name who
got him into the business and then she

554
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:45,950
asked him to promote her hair stuff,

555
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,280
but he said no and he went with
another hairstyle. So he totally,

556
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,210
totally betrayed her.
All right.

557
00:32:51,211 --> 00:32:53,960
It's like my 11 year olds telling me
this and then this was the best part.

558
00:32:53,961 --> 00:32:54,620
She goes,

559
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,620
there was also some talk that he know
he's gay and there was boys that were not

560
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:05,530
gay and he tried to get them to be
in a room with him. It's just like,

561
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,950
well, listening to an 11 year
old. Tell me, by the way,

562
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:13,930
that also could have been how, that's how,
that's the tone of the Internet anyway.

563
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:14,830
It's an 11 year old girl,

564
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,910
so I'm actually heard at least it came
from an 11 year old girl instead of like

565
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,990
so and so's canceled.
You can like the yet. No,

566
00:33:22,991 --> 00:33:25,150
you're a fucking 40 dope.
Don't,

567
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:29,500
why are you talking like a little girl?
You're on a fuck.

568
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:31,330
You're on buzzfeed or on Fox.

569
00:33:31,331 --> 00:33:33,790
Like is he in the point where the New
York Times is going to be doing that?

570
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,270
Like it took close to it now? I
mean I think that Alabama, oh,

571
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,720
owns abortion people.
Yeah.

572
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,780
What it is is the media right now,
especially journalism,

573
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:48,950
they're fucking starving for hits. It's
so hard to make money. It's so hard.

574
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:49,980
And so they're drowning.
Yeah.

575
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,590
And so they're trying to grab
whatever branches they can. Yeah,

576
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,470
they got to make a good story with
it. Click baity title. Fuck it.

577
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,780
Deceptive title. Who gives
a shit? We got a good store.

578
00:33:59,781 --> 00:34:02,480
That store is vetted and even
if it's not totally vetted,

579
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:06,140
if it's a little slippery, but that you
can make an amendment later, you know,

580
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:09,450
I'm sorry, we have a little bit an apology
and we have to make a retraction. Yeah.

581
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,310
Nobody reads those goddamn retractions.
No, you should have to have a retract.

582
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:13,641
If you,

583
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:18,080
if you fuck up so hardcore that you
attribute a crime to someone or you do

584
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:20,360
something like that and you'd
have to make it a retraction.

585
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,290
It should be on the front page of your
paper and nothing else for a month. Yeah,

586
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,230
that's it. This is your
newspaper now. Well, I'm sorry,

587
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:31,490
we don't get to tell you the news anymore
because we fucked this up so hard that

588
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:34,850
we printed out to millions of people
to just put in a little column in the

589
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:35,960
corner. Yeah, we'd like to,

590
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,850
Paul, we fucked up last
month also. Nine 11 happened

591
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,230
close though.
Planes wrote into the World Trade Center.

592
00:34:44,231 --> 00:34:47,590
It's fucking too hard to be a
journalist, man. Well, that's what I,

593
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:50,080
this is another thing I want
to talk to you about, which is,

594
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:51,723
uh,

595
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,900
absolute meaning if you believe like,

596
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:01,790
I still believe in like institutional
journalists. I believe in New York Times,

597
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:05,210
I believe in Washington,
Washington Post, like so,

598
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:09,290
and you use the fact that
they wrote about a UFC fight.

599
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,450
They just said he was bloody and early
into Mcgregor fight where bloody and he

600
00:35:12,451 --> 00:35:12,860
wasn't

601
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,400
just a bad, very bad description.
It was very inaccurate. I'm like,

602
00:35:16,401 --> 00:35:17,630
why would you do that?
Like,

603
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:20,930
do you guys are crazy that the New
York Times is allowing this? Yeah.

604
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,760
Completely inaccurate description of
something that millions of people saw.

605
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:28,250
It's so silly and it makes everybody
question everything else you say.

606
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:31,160
And you might think it's trivial
because it's just a boxing match,

607
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:36,460
but it's completely inaccurate and
completely exaggerating what went down.

608
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,800
Well, if you've, you've had
articles written about you,
they fuck up everyone. Yeah.

609
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,980
Everyone.
Now having said that,

610
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,830
we can't dismiss all in like
there needs to be an absolute,

611
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,950
uh,
kind of an absolute truth.

612
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:58,310
And that's what I feel like is a sort
of melting in this era of anyone who was

613
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:01,920
like, well, they said
this and that's not true.

614
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,750
So everything else they say is fucking
bullshit of course. Which I think the,

615
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:12,060
the Trump does a lot and I think people
are all too happy to believe it because

616
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:15,360
they resent institutions. They resent
the smarty pants motherfuckers,

617
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:20,430
which I also get, I get the impulse, I
just don't think New York Times, right?

618
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,750
Yes. A smartness the old gray
lady. Yeah. Um, and it's like,

619
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,210
it just plays on every stereotype.

620
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:31,050
Like there are so many stereotypes of
work that can make you write it off.

621
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,470
I think we're in a transitionary
period. That's what I think. I think.

622
00:36:34,471 --> 00:36:37,050
What do you think he gets replaced
by them. That's the real problem.

623
00:36:37,051 --> 00:36:41,730
The real problem is they have all their
pieces, all the best journalists, right.

624
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:46,910
All the best people are all
locked into two ancient systems.

625
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,060
One ancient system is print medium. The
other ancient system is broadcast medium,

626
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,100
the broadcast medium.
The ancient product.

627
00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:55,920
Part of it is it has to
go on at a certain time.

628
00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:00,120
Tuesdays at 8:00 PM and then you have to
sit there and wait for the commercials

629
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:03,240
unless you DVR it. Right? Right.
So that's inherently flawed.

630
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,530
And then the print medium,

631
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,620
while they figured out a way to get it
on your laptop and your phone now, so,

632
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:10,020
okay, they've got a little
bit of a work around there,

633
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:12,330
but they have a really hard time
getting people to sign up for digital

634
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:16,230
subscriptions is that the distribution's
not nearly as good as it used to be and

635
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:18,480
it's hard. It's hard to get people to
buy newspapers, but at least they've,

636
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,490
they've got their foot
in the door with click.

637
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,960
Then I titles like the times and the post
are, are, are pretty successful online.

638
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:29,070
They're actually doing much better because
of president Trump because he talks

639
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:31,380
so much shit about them
that people x slate said,

640
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,420
I need to supply the New York
Times. What is, well they,

641
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,230
yeah, I'll check it out because they're
like, fuck man, this guy's child.

642
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,940
At times it's still irresponsible.

643
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,610
He's trying to match what I think might
have with abortion where it's like,

644
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:48,390
oh wait, whoa. I don't even
want to get it. But if you,

645
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:52,950
if this is where you motherfuckers were
headed, cause they were being held back,

646
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:54,840
it was like motherfucker,
I'll fuck you up.

647
00:37:54,841 --> 00:37:58,680
And then they got free and now they're
beating the shit out of abortion.

648
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,270
People are like, Whoa,
accidental pregnancies or the
real problem. It's not even,

649
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:06,480
I mean obviously abortion is a
solution, right? If you have to,

650
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:09,110
if you want to do it.
But if the accidental pregnancies,

651
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,250
the real fucking problem
like it should be,

652
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:16,320
it's one of the things that I talked about
with Jesse Insel who was on the other

653
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,820
day,
we were talking about genetic engineering.

654
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:22,320
So like they're going to eventually one
day move away from sex for procreation

655
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,390
and sex is just going to be for fun,

656
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:28,290
which going to be people bonding
and enjoying each other's bodies.

657
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,260
That's not going to be how we procreate.
We're gonna,

658
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:34,350
we're gonna procreate through some
sort of, you like a girl naked calls.

659
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,620
It'll certainly drastically reduce the
amount of people that have kids, you know?

660
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:43,570
But what he said is everyone do you
freeze your eggs and like give sperm.

661
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,820
I don't know how they're going to do it.
I don't know how they're going to do it.

662
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:46,060
I mean,

663
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:50,740
I think there's also the problem that
the baby's supposedly bonds inside the

664
00:38:50,741 --> 00:38:51,574
mother's body.

665
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,870
Like to have a baby grow up in some
sort of a fucking weird electronic womb,

666
00:38:55,871 --> 00:38:58,000
and then you make that
kid a fucking sociopath,

667
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:02,560
has no connection to people when he's
born. Doesn't give a fuck just to survive.

668
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:05,830
I mean, there was that test tube baby
thing, which I think started before me,

669
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:09,600
but I remember that being an insult. They
put the bid, the baby in the body, the,

670
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,990
they put the embryos in the person's
body and there is the thing of, uh,

671
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,740
surrogates. Yeah. So they, who do they
bond with? That's a weird one man.

672
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:20,320
Like that's,
that's the Kim Kardashian way now.

673
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,830
And she's having a bunch of babies
with surrogates. Like, you know,

674
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:27,160
you show up for the wedding or that you
show up for the birth in a fucking tight

675
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:31,450
skirt and like, Yay, my babies being
born today. Like, what? What you're,

676
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,030
you have your clothes on? What is
happening here now? She's, yeah,

677
00:39:35,031 --> 00:39:37,650
I got a hired somebody,
my friend, I got a girl,

678
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,430
my friend actually did that and he's
gay and he and his husband, um, they,

679
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,690
they mix their sperm.

680
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,620
They shot it in the Turkey based
or something into some Gal.

681
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,490
I don't know how I am. I don't make an
excel file the science too tight. Anyway,

682
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,500
she got pregnant,
their surrogate got pregnant,

683
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:58,030
had the baby and decided to keep it
decided she couldn't part with it and it's

684
00:39:58,031 --> 00:40:02,200
their baby.
So it's their DNA and mixed with hers.

685
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,510
And she decided to keep it and
uh, she got away with it, um,

686
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:09,070
sewer or they just were like, oh, I
don't know. I didn't want to push.

687
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:13,150
They were very upset and then they wound
up getting another surrogate and then

688
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:16,370
having a child and everything worked
out is quite a while ago. But uh,

689
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,330
they were really bummed out, man. I mean,
they were ready to be parents, but then,

690
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,610
you know, some people say, we will
do renewal, we're going to be purged.

691
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:24,840
The first blues crews were good,
noon, even have sex with him,

692
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,970
but it is their baby.
Right.

693
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:31,030
It's their DNA that made that based
on if they didn't adopt a child,

694
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:35,380
they chose to have
surrogates. So heh. Yeah. No,

695
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:38,650
it's complicated and getting
well that's the thing of like,

696
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,250
it feels like the level of danger and
difficulty in the world is just getting

697
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,680
steeper by the day.
We're like, wait a wow.

698
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,130
And then there's always global
warming and you're like, oh fuck.

699
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,620
Did you see a fucking the science guy,

700
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:55,621
Bill Nye going crazy screaming and he
was on the elevator or the planets on

701
00:40:55,631 --> 00:40:59,730
fucking fire and yeah, let's get a little
silly. Yeah, I know. Never like Bro.

702
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,720
All right. Go to Antarctica.
Plants on fire, Bro. Uh,

703
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,320
no. I saw a thing that an artist that was
like 84 degrees. Oh my God. It's on fire.

704
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,150
I mean, yeah, it's really, do you really
see something that's in the Antarctic?

705
00:41:11,151 --> 00:41:12,400
It was 84 nights.
Yeah.

706
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:16,300
Something in the Arctic circle is 84
degrees plus three days ago. Fuck that.

707
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,210
What it's going to be a,
it's gotta be,

708
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,610
do you ever think about
like global warming,

709
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:26,410
but really what it will look like,
like in 70 years,

710
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,840
what it will do to the art.
Like,

711
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,130
and I'm not talking about
just Miami's gone or any,

712
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:38,690
that's like incredibly like crazy
to think about. It's unfathomable.

713
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:42,380
Those Miami people, they're gonna
move other places and ruined.

714
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:45,980
That's probably the biggest, that's
my biggest worry. Definitely. He goes,

715
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:50,330
can we be Lamborghinis dudes yelling
at girls and Spanish eating outside.

716
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,630
Everyone's fucking eating outside, but
like, would you fucking get indoors?

717
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:55,790
You maniac though.
A lot of salsa.

718
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:00,380
I love going salsa and like North Carolina
like fuck Outta here. Salsa dancing.

719
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:03,790
Fuck out of here with the
fucking dead. Ain't bet. Then um,

720
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:08,930
that's a good bit there. Like another
country that's attached to Florida.

721
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,270
Yeah, it's like Europe. It's,

722
00:42:11,271 --> 00:42:16,271
I always say it's like people do you
see like Italian people like in Beverly

723
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,210
Hills or Miami and the,
I would say to my friends,

724
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,900
those are people that were two
douchey for Ada Lee. They're like,

725
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:25,520
oh wait,

726
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,390
we got to take it to the next to
do she level Miami and then that go

727
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:36,830
deep. Uh, yeah, that, but,
but you think about like k,

728
00:42:36,831 --> 00:42:41,810
I like, not like 28 days later,
but like, you know, like huge,

729
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:44,270
like scary.
Fucking scary.

730
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:49,330
Especially because we're going to
be near dead and no disrespect,

731
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:52,460
you're not going to be in the same shape
you're in now and you're not. You do,

732
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,030
I mean, people may give
you respect, but like,

733
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,480
it's going to be so fucking scary. We're
going to have to move to the mountains.

734
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:04,520
Where would you move to? Shit. Hit
the fan. Somebody. Sam, uh, who's,

735
00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:09,260
what's Calvin's friend? Sam ciders.
Mind Sam seater? No, Sam. Uh,

736
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:14,270
the fighter's mind, he wrote him and how
can I not remember his name? Yeah. Um,

737
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,290
hold on one second. I'll tell you real
quick. This is going to be worth it guys.

738
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,310
Listeners, this is Tim.
Listen, Sam Sheridan. That's
right. Yeah, I'm sure. Um,

739
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:25,310
thank you.
Told me 10 years ago that stuck with me.

740
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,880
Go to the marina cause I live in Venice.
He,

741
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:33,881
he's like go to the marina and basically
just get basically you gotta pay to get

742
00:43:34,581 --> 00:43:35,750
on a boat or just be like,

743
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:40,910
I will be the hard part
is how do I qualify too.

744
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:45,800
Like I can help you cause I get seasick.
Here's what I have going for me.

745
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:50,450
Seasick queasy because you just get away.
You get away from,

746
00:43:50,451 --> 00:43:54,860
from La. Anyone you get
away from, uh, in Las case,

747
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,580
millions and millions
of people and you can,

748
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:01,250
if there's a attacker,
you can see them.

749
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,070
You assume that they're not
going to be like, you know,

750
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:08,810
seal teams coming onto your
boat. Attackers. Well, I
know, but that's what I mean.

751
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:13,040
Like how crazy could get,
yeah, you got to go to Alaska.

752
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,770
The how do you get there? It's good
call. I'll do, can you dry reports?

753
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,500
Closed airport. I mean I or lights
connected, right? You could drive.

754
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,090
You could technically drive. Yeah.
It cut off that road all the time.

755
00:44:26,091 --> 00:44:29,540
And like the Napa Valley,
cause the landslide will Sharon.

756
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:33,360
We're gonna fuck you going
to go. Yeah. Good luck.

757
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,860
It's like Burger's got the helicopter
but he, it's, he's got to go to get it.

758
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,200
Yeah. That's his escape. A great bit about
that as black and white special. Yeah.

759
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:44,600
Yeah.

760
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,410
I would move north. I'd probably
move somewhere. That was a,

761
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:52,730
if I could get just go to a place,
if I knew I just had to get to a place,

762
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,930
I would go to a place that is sustainable.
Like uh,

763
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:01,370
whether it's Alaska or
Minnesota or Michigan somewhere.

764
00:45:01,371 --> 00:45:06,140
There's a lot of animals and there's
wildlife and you have, you have cold,

765
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,120
you have water,
you have a lot.

766
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:11,300
Like cold is better than heat
because cold you can make a fire.

767
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,450
Like if you have shelter and you can
make a fire in the cold, you can live.

768
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,880
I have a cat

769
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,100
argument,
which is I don't,

770
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:21,440
I the cold kills more people
than he does hypothermia. Yes,

771
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,390
but that's just because you know,
people are unprepared for it.

772
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,820
You can prepare for cold with clothing.

773
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:31,090
You can't really prepare for
heat with clothing, with heat,

774
00:45:31,091 --> 00:45:33,430
you need air conditioning
and you need water.

775
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:36,490
Those are two things that are
shade. Yeah. You need something.

776
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:40,390
If you live in like there's people
that have lived in very cold climates,

777
00:45:40,391 --> 00:45:42,850
as long as they have a good house
and they have a good supply of wood,

778
00:45:42,851 --> 00:45:46,120
they're fine. If you live in the
desert, man, you're kind of fucked.

779
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,100
You're kind of fucked.
If the power goes out,

780
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,680
you don't really have
anything to keep you cool.

781
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,660
You have to stay in the
shade and stay in doors,

782
00:45:52,661 --> 00:45:57,340
but it's not good enough and it's 110
degrees inside. It's 125 hydrated though.

783
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:01,180
I don't think you will just die from
x from heat exposure. No you won't,

784
00:46:01,181 --> 00:46:02,650
but you're not going
to find a lot of water.

785
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,240
One of the problems with global warming's
going to be that things like lakes,

786
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,180
lakes and streams are going to,
there's going to be less.

787
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,600
This gonna be less water is going to
be less dribbling down to the creeks.

788
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,050
Creeks, we're going to dry
up. Streams will dry up.

789
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,960
You're gonna have a hard time getting
water if you're in a desert environment.

790
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:24,860
If you have by by the same token,
if you have enough water,

791
00:46:24,861 --> 00:46:27,230
you have as much water as you have wood.
Obviously the,

792
00:46:27,231 --> 00:46:31,130
it's not a one to one analogy because
you can go get more would easily,

793
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:33,650
but if you had a shit load of water right.

794
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:38,710
If you just had like I hear your thought
about getting cold but I don't know if

795
00:46:40,911 --> 00:46:42,290
I had shade.
I guess you don't.

796
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,560
I guess with cold you don't
have to have electricity,

797
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,450
you don't have to have electricity
with cold and also you have more of an

798
00:46:49,451 --> 00:46:50,950
opportunity to find animals.

799
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,820
You'll find more animals in cold climates
and you're going to for delicious

800
00:46:54,821 --> 00:46:57,820
animals for sure. Yeah, more
things to eat, but you might,

801
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,220
you could still easily starve to death.

802
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:04,450
Like the idea that it's easy to go out
there and shoot a bunch of animals and

803
00:47:04,451 --> 00:47:07,210
eat them all the time,
like not most places.

804
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,450
Most places you don't have an
abundant enough supply of wildlife.

805
00:47:10,451 --> 00:47:13,570
You're also a guy who does archery.
Yeah,

806
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:17,050
I know how to do you have skills for
this and I would still be panicked.

807
00:47:17,051 --> 00:47:18,550
I'd be like, fuck, this is not good.

808
00:47:18,551 --> 00:47:21,880
If I had to feed my family with a bow
and Arrow, first of all, I'd say, okay,

809
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:25,750
how many hours do I have? I would have
to make sure that I have enough arrows.

810
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,580
I mean, you have to practice
to is not like a rifle.

811
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:35,200
If I have a hundred rounds,
I can kill a hundred things.

812
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,810
I don't really need to practice
that much of my rifles on off.

813
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:41,940
I can have good triggered discipline.
I'll pull through the shot, I'll,

814
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,940
I'll try not to flinch and I'm not
going to take any unreasonable.

815
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,590
I have no fucking idea what
you're telling me. Shooting.

816
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,200
You don't want to anticipate.

817
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:53,800
I anticipate you don't want to
flinch when the trigger goes up.

818
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,500
So a lot of guys like Tim Kennedy,

819
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,520
who's a friend of mine who's a one of
the baddest motherfuckers in the world,

820
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:03,070
he'll practice with dummy rounds.

821
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,760
So he has regular bullets and then
four bullets are just not real bullets.

822
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:11,650
So it's like bang, Bang, Bang, click,
and then the has to get rid of that,

823
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:13,360
that bullet.
But he leaves.

824
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,480
He knows if he was flinching
because if you're flinching,

825
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:20,140
you'll see this movement where there's no,
no gun goes off.

826
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,100
The boat doesn't go off,

827
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:24,520
but you make that weird mood because
you're anticipating in the shot.

828
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,680
That's the way to train
yourself out of it. Yeah.

829
00:48:26,681 --> 00:48:28,300
You have to do something like that.

830
00:48:28,301 --> 00:48:30,630
You have to have what's called trigger
discipline. Well, first of all,

831
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,620
trigger discipline means don't
put your finger on the trigger,

832
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:35,620
but also the way you squeeze. You got
to just squeeze, squeeze, squeeze,

833
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:39,010
squeeze and let the shot go off
by surprise and not react to it.

834
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:42,280
It's the same thing with a bow and arrow.
You have to have a surprise shot.

835
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,940
You want, you wanted to just do
want to concentrate on the target,

836
00:48:44,941 --> 00:48:49,660
zone it in and which feels like
you kind of can't even be there.

837
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:52,310
Meaning like you just have to be
like, I'm doing a thing. You know,

838
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,540
like you can't think about the release.

839
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,720
You have to just think about the
target that's very astute of you.

840
00:48:58,721 --> 00:49:03,550
There's actually courses is a guy named
Joel Turner who has this whole course

841
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:07,810
called a shot Iq. He's
a, he teaches um, um,

842
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:12,340
first responders like swat teams and
shit without trigger discipline and about

843
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:16,280
how to, how to shoot properly
under pressure. And uh,

844
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:19,390
he works with people with archery for
this sit with the same thing cause it's a

845
00:49:19,391 --> 00:49:24,340
psychological thing to,
but my point is with a bow and Arrow,

846
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:25,520
you're kind of fucked you,

847
00:49:25,521 --> 00:49:28,210
you need a lot of Goddamn arrows and you
need to make sure that bone is going to

848
00:49:28,211 --> 00:49:32,530
stay okay with all the animal
to like, like a deer, deer,

849
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,910
deer or bear would be like
the most edible thing. Yeah.

850
00:49:34,911 --> 00:49:36,400
You want to bear if you have a bear,

851
00:49:36,401 --> 00:49:39,340
you could eat that motherfucker for a
long time and you can take that fat and

852
00:49:39,341 --> 00:49:43,030
you could render the fat down, use it
for cooking and use it for, you know,

853
00:49:43,031 --> 00:49:46,180
you could do, do a lot of things with
it. And that meat is a lot of meat.

854
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,900
Anything big, you want a big animal
because you want to be able to dry it out,

855
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:50,734
make jerky.

856
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:54,250
You want to have something that's going
to sustain you for a few days or weeks

857
00:49:54,251 --> 00:49:55,510
until you find another animal.

858
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:58,810
You're gonna want to dig a hole in the
ground to make some sort of cold storage.

859
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,790
You want to get below like
the frost line. Yeah, you got,

860
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:04,030
you got to protect it from
other bears. Yeah, you got it.

861
00:50:04,031 --> 00:50:07,060
You're going to have to do a lot of
things and you're probably not gonna make

862
00:50:07,061 --> 00:50:10,200
enough food. It sounds hard.
It's the hardest the eye.

863
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,930
Every time I go on a hunting trip,
I always think like,

864
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:16,210
imagine if this is the
only way I could get food.

865
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:21,370
It's so God damn hard to get close
to an animal. It's so hard. Yeah.

866
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:25,150
People see videos of it like on youtube
and there's the deer and you draw your

867
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:28,040
bow back and you hit it in the
heart and the deer's down. Everybody

868
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:28,851
said,
well,

869
00:50:28,851 --> 00:50:33,740
you don't see as days and days
of writing all day long. Just go.

870
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:38,180
If you could watch from a live
stream of the moment of hunt,

871
00:50:38,181 --> 00:50:41,690
start to the moment you're successful
and you just sat through the whole thing.

872
00:50:41,691 --> 00:50:45,230
Look as a fucking games of Thrones
marathon, then you would understand it,

873
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:48,860
but even then you wouldn't really, cause
you wouldn't be out there in the cold,

874
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,180
exhausted,

875
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:54,740
hiking uphill going thousands of feet
up and down and elevation and then the

876
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:58,130
wind shifts and the deer smells you
and it starts off, you're like, fuck,

877
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:03,170
it's hard man. It's like tedious.
And to survive off of that,

878
00:51:03,171 --> 00:51:07,970
see I'm doing it for my own food, but if
I don't get a deer, I'm going to live.

879
00:51:07,971 --> 00:51:08,870
I'll go to a restaurant.

880
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,440
If you're only option is deer that you
catch and kill and find your shot or

881
00:51:14,641 --> 00:51:18,380
sick. Oh my God. And he got
to fucking catch a deer.

882
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,260
That's um, that's when you wonder,
you know, you wonder how am I gonna,

883
00:51:22,261 --> 00:51:23,960
what am I going to watch
them starve to death?

884
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,010
That must've been really exciting for
native Americans or just any ancient

885
00:51:28,011 --> 00:51:32,060
people of just like getting
like kit. Like, you know,

886
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:36,470
I think we could kill above.
Hello? Yeah, we all like,

887
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:37,820
we all have to be fat.

888
00:51:37,821 --> 00:51:41,030
Like we all have to team up and
that's why humans have survived.

889
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:45,110
But like it must've been so
fucking like at celebration,

890
00:51:45,111 --> 00:51:46,670
like in he walks celebration,

891
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:51,620
you know it's crazy to this day there
are these areas where they find a lot of

892
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,820
arrowheads because they would
drive these buffalo off cliffs.

893
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,370
How fucking nuts is that?

894
00:51:58,371 --> 00:52:02,330
Like they know the spots where they
would drive them off cliffs and fall down

895
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:05,870
and sometimes the bodies with
decay cause I didn't eat all of it.

896
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:10,760
They a hundred buffalo fly off a cliff
is only a thousand native Americans in

897
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:13,600
this spot with the fuck are they gonna do.
They're gonna eat as much as we can.

898
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:19,270
But the rotten ones literally exploded
and caused a forest fire in one area.

899
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:25,060
They think a forest fire was caused by a
rotting pile of buffalo that eventually

900
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:29,600
exploded like a whale explosion.
I like that kind of deal.

901
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,110
Google that makes sure that's not horse
shit cause it sounds like a lie coming

902
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:33,944
out of my mouth.

903
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:39,220
They believe that a rotting pile of
bison was responsible for starting a fire

904
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,530
here because that's how the,

905
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,560
cause they found like all this
chard like stuff and they're like,

906
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,860
they were trying to piece it together.
If I remember the story of properly.

907
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:49,843
And I think they were like,

908
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:53,840
this might have happened because
the body's rotted so much.

909
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:56,510
They exploded and it started fuck.

910
00:52:56,511 --> 00:53:00,530
Cause it's like you have the gasses
Muldez rotting tissue. Like, you know,

911
00:53:00,531 --> 00:53:04,250
whales explode on the beach. I
splatter on people. Yeah. Fantastic.

912
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:05,960
So they're trying to take
this to a next level,

913
00:53:05,961 --> 00:53:09,110
like how much heat would be
generated by all this bacteria?

914
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:12,440
Like what kind of explosion
could this make? Yeah.

915
00:53:12,441 --> 00:53:17,030
And also why would the explosion,
is it a spark caused,

916
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:22,280
I would assume it's gooey methane
gases and rotten gases. Yeah.

917
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:26,070
Like they would have to be some, something
to ignite, you know, those little

918
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:30,300
um, uh, arrowheads. They find you're
supposed to leave them in a lot of places.

919
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:32,670
If you find you're supposed to
leave him there just for like,

920
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:35,490
luck or something for you,
go fuck yourself.

921
00:53:35,491 --> 00:53:39,610
I ain't leaving shit arrowhead.
Like, Oh, you have to lead it. Words.

922
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:42,840
Guns fucking going up there. Yeah. Where
is it going? Like where's if I leave it,

923
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:46,500
someone else can pick it up on you think
the good man have a good person to pick

924
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:50,280
it up. You have to leave it here.
No, no, no, you can't have it.

925
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,400
Is that like the parks commissioners are
native and I know when I was hunting in

926
00:53:53,401 --> 00:53:56,430
Nevada they said that if you found
an arrowhead yet to leave it there.

927
00:53:56,431 --> 00:53:59,790
I was like, Huh, okay. Oh, you know what?

928
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:04,170
I haven't talked to you about
what the doing these big venues.

929
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:07,980
Oh Arenas. Yeah. That's weird.
How do you like it? It's fun, man.

930
00:54:07,981 --> 00:54:11,430
San Diego was a lot of fun.
It's um, it's strange though.

931
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:12,660
It's a lot of God damn people.

932
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:17,790
Does it feel like disconnected now?

933
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:20,700
Not didn't surprisingly.
San Diego is interesting.

934
00:54:20,701 --> 00:54:22,980
Like the people that were in the
front, they were right there, man.

935
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:28,010
It was [inaudible] 7,000 now
San Diego was 12 something,

936
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,840
almost thirteen thousand thirteen
thousand unbelief. It's a lot of people.

937
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:38,010
And they was in the round.
Yeah, that was weird too.

938
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:43,260
And did you have a plan? Nope. But yeah.

939
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,490
No cause like she can't
really think about,

940
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,390
you can't worry about the people that
are behind you. You can't, you got,

941
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:55,220
well they have giant screens everywhere
so everybody got to see you. Um, I,

942
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:59,550
I definitely was aware of the magnitude
of the show and I did a lot of sets that

943
00:54:59,551 --> 00:55:02,250
we, I do like eight, nine sets
that week before I did it.

944
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,590
Like the funny thing was I
didn't understand, I was like,

945
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:09,000
how is he not selling this out? And
then I saw victor, then I was like, oh,

946
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:13,200
it's a fucking arena. I was like, I
thought Joe was as popular as ever been.

947
00:55:13,201 --> 00:55:16,180
And then I'm like, why is this guy posted
so much? And then I'm like, oh, cause it's

948
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:22,680
hard to get that last last
thousand. I know. And you're still,

949
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,480
you can't,
the,

950
00:55:24,481 --> 00:55:27,750
I dunno if it's the human mind are
like the competitive comedy mind,

951
00:55:27,751 --> 00:55:30,710
but like can't leave it alone.
You want that fucking thousand.

952
00:55:30,711 --> 00:55:34,200
Like you want to hear sold out.
Yeah. Like doesn't like, yeah,

953
00:55:34,201 --> 00:55:37,920
but you don't want to go sell Joe
Rogan 12,000 people. You have a woods.

954
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:41,580
It holds like 12, nine.
Yeah. Aw, what a pussy.

955
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,540
Can't even get 900 more people like
you bro. And you would kind not,

956
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:47,940
you would think it's a failure,
but you would always be like, yeah,

957
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:51,330
Josh Wolfe showed me a picture once of
him on stage open enough for Larry the

958
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:55,960
cable guide in front of 50,000.
Jesus, he did a football stadium.

959
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,230
Jesus get her done. Well that's
what Kevin Hart does. Those big,

960
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,040
I mean he did his uh,
one of his Netflix buses,

961
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:08,550
like 49,000 people. Some
fucking insane. If, I mean that,

962
00:56:08,551 --> 00:56:09,820
I wouldn't want to see that shit.

963
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:14,670
I wouldn't want to go to that weird
third balcony. Like what do you even,

964
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:18,540
I mean, I don't know. People like
communal experiences like that. Yes.

965
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,620
I think that's a good way to put it.

966
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:24,250
But like when venues 50,000,

967
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,080
you're just far away.
Yeah.

968
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:31,480
But I guess if you like the jeans and
everyone's in there together, it's,

969
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,810
you've created a culture.
So people go to be a part of the culture.

970
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:39,160
Kevin's created the culture.
Larry, the cable guy, created
a culture. So people go,

971
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:43,210
it's like to be around their brothers
and sisters. Kind of kind of,

972
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,900
I mean straight up though,
like not like it's even intentional.

973
00:56:46,901 --> 00:56:51,901
That's the thing I like about podcasting
as a successful medium and your

974
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:56,290
podcasts in particular
is like the shit you're,

975
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:59,920
you're into comedy,
you're into fucking weed,

976
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:04,180
you're into you,
fos and the unexplained,

977
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,760
you're into government conspiracies,
you're into a gender issues. You're,

978
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:13,800
you're legitimately into all this stuff
and you created a tent where everybody

979
00:57:15,701 --> 00:57:19,540
feels like welcome, like, hey, it's going
to talk about the thing that I'm like,

980
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:22,210
you're interested in a lot of
shit. Generally. You're not going,

981
00:57:22,211 --> 00:57:26,790
I'm only interested in comedy or, or
more niche about it. You just like this,

982
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,460
you're into, you're intently inventions
and fire and guns and hunting.

983
00:57:30,461 --> 00:57:35,461
You're just into a bunch of
shit legitimately and you
express it and people love

984
00:57:36,431 --> 00:57:37,264
it.
Well that's it.

985
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:41,700
Was gene actually being into shit and
talking about things you're into versus

986
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:43,800
talking about the things
you think will be popular,

987
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:48,310
right? Yeah. You kind of, you
can't, you can't do that for,

988
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:52,450
I guess you see, I can't think of anyone
could, but you'd get off the top of your,

989
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,180
off the top of my head who that would be.
But it'd be obvious that you

990
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:58,910
weren't really tuned in. He wouldn't be
really interested in it. You're not, you,

991
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,450
you wouldn't be as enthusiastic.

992
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,620
Yeah.
And you are genuinely,

993
00:58:02,621 --> 00:58:07,621
you only have on people that you genuinely
like or genuinely interested in and

994
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:10,120
doesn't matter if they're famous,
not famous,

995
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:14,200
like whatever controversial,
not controversial.

996
00:58:14,201 --> 00:58:18,310
Like it's just shit that
you're into your expressing.

997
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,210
It's the,
the another reason why I like pockets,

998
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,840
it's like watching someone exist.
Yeah.

999
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,420
It's like an expression of your
subconscious or your, your brain.

1000
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:35,320
Like it's like the typical day in your
brain. I'm just like, I like this.

1001
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:36,810
And then I go over here and then I go,
Duh.

1002
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:39,820
And you and you've been
able to like do it in a way,

1003
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:45,100
which is why it's so popular is like it
is popular but it's not even the right

1004
00:58:45,101 --> 00:58:46,750
word.
It's like resonant with people.

1005
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:47,691
Yeah.

1006
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:52,691
I think for a long time people have been
doing shows where the show was produced

1007
00:58:55,521 --> 00:59:00,470
and there's a bunch of people behind
the scenes and whatever that person is,

1008
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:00,940
it's,

1009
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:05,000
it's almost more difficult for them to
get their personality to shine through

1010
00:59:05,001 --> 00:59:08,150
all that shit. But if it's just stuff
that you're really interested in, yeah.

1011
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,170
Then people get up

1012
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:13,850
and it's also be like, and then it's a
girl takes off and Burt takes off. And uh,

1013
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,100
who,
who am I forgetting the Joey takes off.

1014
00:59:16,101 --> 00:59:19,170
I didn't know how long you've been
friends with Joey, Joey guys, friends

1015
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,980
for 23.
Yeah.

1016
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:25,940
Theo like guys that you just genuinely
like, like that they're just kind of like,

1017
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:27,050
even the,
the,

1018
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:31,940
the like the sober October
thing or like it's, you know,

1019
00:59:31,941 --> 00:59:36,500
the numbers are massive. Yeah. It's cause
it's just, it's like a show. It's like a,

1020
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:41,470
I know it's everybody's a character
and it's like an old radio play.

1021
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,970
Like here comes fucking Bert Kreischer.

1022
00:59:43,971 --> 00:59:45,940
He think he acts out something
called the Mickey Mantle. Jay,

1023
00:59:45,941 --> 00:59:49,370
what the hell is it Mickey mantle
thinking about like, everybody's got like,

1024
00:59:49,371 --> 00:59:54,200
it's set up and it's,
it's not like it's sloppy in a fun way.

1025
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:59,360
Yeah. And uh, and it's cool and
you get to reap all the reward,

1026
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,640
all the guys that are
responsible for the cause.

1027
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:05,000
The other thing is so many times,
this is the first time, like in,

1028
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:10,090
in certainly in media history where guys
are in charge of their own everything.

1029
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:15,750
Yeah. Like you own the labor. I
mean, there's not even a layer.

1030
01:00:15,751 --> 01:00:20,030
That's just my thing there.
Artists tried,

1031
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:24,260
like the Beatles had a record label and
they would bring people on and then they

1032
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:28,220
would, they, it always got
fucked up every single time.

1033
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:32,450
And this I feel like is the first time
where it's like, Sigur has got like,

1034
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,540
you know,
his umbrella now he's got like his,

1035
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,360
he's got his spinoffs and uh,

1036
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:43,220
it's fucking excellent.
It's just excellent.

1037
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,600
It's so great.

1038
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:50,060
I was talking to a guy who used to be in
charge of at Viacom and we were talking

1039
01:00:50,061 --> 01:00:54,950
about, you know, when they, when
people do shows now, like, you know,

1040
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:59,540
they'll pay, uh, Kenny Barron, so they'll
pay, Sean arrived and the pay Dave Allen,

1041
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:02,990
Chris, all these guys, like 20 million,
the writers get a hundred buddy of mine,

1042
01:01:02,991 --> 01:01:06,050
Mike Schur created good place and,
um,

1043
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:10,310
parks and rec and he's getting 25 mil
a year for the next five years. Yeah.

1044
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,120
And it shows aren't hits his heart.

1045
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:19,040
His shows are picked up and successful,
but they're not like cheers. Right.

1046
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,930
Wow. Um, and I said to Doug
Herzog, the guy from flag, I go,

1047
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:27,890
how much were you fucking guys
making before? What were these,

1048
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:31,100
what were these companies
making 20 years ago?

1049
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:35,030
Like what was ABC making
20 years ago that they,

1050
01:01:35,031 --> 01:01:39,230
and they even Seinfeld said that he,
he's like,

1051
01:01:39,231 --> 01:01:42,920
I was the first one to get a hundred,
uh, million an episode. And I go,

1052
01:01:42,921 --> 01:01:46,190
which is a pittance compared to what
they could have paid you. And he's like,

1053
01:01:46,191 --> 01:01:50,520
I know that now,
but back then $1 million in and Ah,

1054
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:54,470
what are you even going to deal with it?

1055
01:01:54,471 --> 01:01:59,150
And now it's like what are they gonna do
with it? What the fuck they were making?

1056
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:01,490
They were making 100 million in episode,

1057
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:05,470
but because it's a logo and a corporation
go, well that's what a corporate,

1058
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:08,090
it's supposed to make $100 million
and a half is up. Meanwhile,

1059
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:10,730
if a guy makes a million, you're
like, what are you going to,

1060
01:02:10,731 --> 01:02:12,650
it's like this unfathomable thing.

1061
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:15,530
It's like where they get mad at basketball
players and not the owners of the

1062
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:16,430
teams.
Yeah.

1063
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:21,360
And it's also that distribution model of
like putting something on a network is,

1064
01:02:21,361 --> 01:02:24,660
there's so much fat,
there's so many people,

1065
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:29,160
the silly things that you have to pay
so much, so many different places.

1066
01:02:29,161 --> 01:02:29,940
The money goes,

1067
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:34,080
it's almost like you have to make $100
million an episode for everybody to make

1068
01:02:34,081 --> 01:02:39,020
out. Yeah. But also, no, they don't live,
but also they're still taken 90 yeah.

1069
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:43,410
You know what I mean? Yeah. Even with all
the revenues with all like the, the, the,

1070
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:48,240
uh, all the miles, I got a fade. It's
still like a huge profit. But as a writer,

1071
01:02:48,241 --> 01:02:51,660
do you think that like investing your
time and effort into a Sitcom today?

1072
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:55,470
It's like, well, good luck with
that. I don't, dude. I like,

1073
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,440
I just started, I, we used to
do the podcast may emotionally,

1074
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,290
this podcast called the
champion was great. And uh,

1075
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:04,830
and now I just started one like a
month ago called how Neil failed.

1076
01:03:04,831 --> 01:03:06,760
Look for it and you look up things,
um,

1077
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:10,410
how Neil you'll feel and that's the
name of the pocket, got a theme song.

1078
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:14,430
Everything's very sick. Um, but it
was, I was like, why am I trying,

1079
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:19,460
I did it a pilot like a year ago for a
network and they gave me notes and I was

1080
01:03:19,711 --> 01:03:22,580
like, oh, I forgot about notes. Oh,

1081
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:26,280
I forgot that they were going
to give me notes. Like, Ugh,

1082
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,770
like I don't just let me,

1083
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:31,320
that was the always the thing that me
and Dave got to with comedy central and

1084
01:03:31,321 --> 01:03:34,470
they finally left the salon after
like six episodes where I was like,

1085
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:39,630
let us show it to the audience and
let them decide. We don't want a bomb.

1086
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:45,150
We want to bomb less than you
guys do. Trust me. Trust me.

1087
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:49,050
You've never met two people who
want to bomb less than me and him.

1088
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,960
And so they'd be like, well, we don't
end up like, let's show to the crowd.

1089
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:54,990
If they like it, then
great. And if they don't,

1090
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:59,850
then we sh they that we did this
real world sketch and they didn't.

1091
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:02,820
They were like, we just think it's a
bunch of unfunny scenes back to back.

1092
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,040
And we're like,
let's just show it to the crown.

1093
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,230
And then we showed it killed
and they were like, all right,

1094
01:04:07,231 --> 01:04:08,640
we don't know what we were talking about.
They literally said,

1095
01:04:08,641 --> 01:04:10,560
we don't know what we're talking about.
So do whatever you want.

1096
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:15,480
Unfunny what a fucking God.
Oh,

1097
01:04:15,481 --> 01:04:18,300
those people. But that's the, I get that.

1098
01:04:18,301 --> 01:04:20,930
They feel like they have to do something.
Yeah.

1099
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:26,240
But we're with comedians are willing
to like all our skin's in the game.

1100
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:30,270
It's all, it's all of our,
it's our hide every time.

1101
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:35,360
So why do you feel the need to
like correct us or I don't mind if,

1102
01:04:35,491 --> 01:04:39,270
uh, if like an executive is like the
first audience, do you know what I mean?

1103
01:04:39,271 --> 01:04:42,930
Or like, Hey, your shirts fucked it,
whatever. Like, like in minor stuff.

1104
01:04:42,931 --> 01:04:44,310
But it's like material wise,

1105
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:49,580
most of you are not good at defining
what's special about somebody or what's an

1106
01:04:51,751 --> 01:04:53,490
innovative segment or
you know what I mean?

1107
01:04:53,491 --> 01:04:54,690
Like they don't even think about that.
They just,

1108
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,350
they're ambitious people who are just
like working their way up a thing and

1109
01:04:58,351 --> 01:05:01,320
they're like, is it my
turn yet? I get to fucking,

1110
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,630
I get to put my stamp
on it now. Yeah. Yeah.

1111
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:08,040
I want to add something even
if it's irrelevant, like be,

1112
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:10,920
I had a joke when we were doing half
baked and then going two for two day,

1113
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:14,390
but uh, we're doing half baked
and I said to David, God,

1114
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:17,710
we should do a thing at the end where,
um,

1115
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:20,470
we should just say, hey,
let us do whatever we want.

1116
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:25,180
And in the end we'll pass a hat around
and you guys can take credit for something

1117
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:28,930
because ultimately that's what you want.

1118
01:05:28,931 --> 01:05:30,790
You want to be able to take
credit for something, right?

1119
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:34,960
Well don't fucking make us do it.
I know you just want credit.

1120
01:05:34,961 --> 01:05:36,700
That's all you want.
You just want to feel good about yourself.

1121
01:05:36,701 --> 01:05:39,610
You want to feel like I
contributed to this thing,

1122
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:43,180
but let us just let us do the thing.
You know what I mean?

1123
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:47,020
And if you're like you who've just been,
how long you been doing the podcast?

1124
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:50,530
Almost 10 years.
It'll be 10 years in December,

1125
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:54,220
you're going to do a big network show
about him kind of networked anniversary,

1126
01:05:54,221 --> 01:05:57,940
Special Ham radio.
That's hilarious.

1127
01:05:57,941 --> 01:06:00,670
I've been thinking about taking over
an am radio station for the day.

1128
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:05,470
That's so fun. That'd be
really fun. So let me, um, the,
uh, wonder if they'd let me,

1129
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:10,840
but even like in when we used to do it in
your house, you know what I mean? Like,

1130
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:12,700
and it's like,
that was a long time ago.

1131
01:06:12,701 --> 01:06:17,500
You were on you on an episode
at least seven years ago. Yeah.

1132
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:22,330
Oh yeah. I did too. In your
house. That was back in the kids,

1133
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:25,320
be in the background yelling at each
other and shit here in the hall.

1134
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:29,050
And they were a little
crazy. Um, one 14. Wow.

1135
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:33,820
Episode one 14. How many?
That's two years. Year and
a half. And yeah, probably.

1136
01:06:33,821 --> 01:06:37,540
What does episode now?
What is 1297 [inaudible] 98.

1137
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:41,050
That was 98. Now this is number
one, two, nine, eight. No,

1138
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:46,230
[inaudible] 98 when the
podcast and started hundred
episodes 1100 episodes ago.

1139
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:51,210
Yeah. And it's from, look at me. I'd a
Fohawk lucky you. Beautiful bastards.

1140
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:52,900
Fog 80% nos.

1141
01:06:52,901 --> 01:06:57,400
That was before I realized they should
put a beard on where a little bit more,

1142
01:06:57,401 --> 01:07:02,060
a little scruff. Um, podcasts are a
very, very strange thing, man. It's,

1143
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:03,400
it's just this,

1144
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:07,390
no one saw this coming and
everyone can start one,

1145
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:10,930
but I don't even think you saw it
coming. Do you know what I mean? Like,

1146
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,120
I don't call him, I didn't see this. Yeah.

1147
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:17,730
Like presidential candidates
from my fucking show. Telsey
Gabbert on yesterdays.

1148
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,900
Yeah. Running for president.
I didn't watch it, but yeah,

1149
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,280
I wanted to talk about real issues that
affect the world. I'm like, Oh yeah. Uh,

1150
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:29,290
yeah. And I'm sure do you feel, I mean,
you Kinda can't change your ethos.

1151
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:34,180
You can't be like, I'm a role model
and I need to know, no, it's not.

1152
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:38,440
No, no, no. I'm just going to be me. You
know, and the world's going to be weirder,

1153
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,410
but it's just me.
But it's also the thing of like,

1154
01:07:41,411 --> 01:07:46,150
when you're in these like development
TV movie worlds and you're like,

1155
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:49,310
just let me talk.
Just fucking lie.

1156
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:54,010
Like I promise it'll be interesting.
Like it won't all be interesting,

1157
01:07:54,011 --> 01:07:58,650
but it'll be interesting enough. It'll be
interesting enough. Often enough. Yeah,

1158
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:00,400
that just let me talk.

1159
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:05,340
Why couldn't imagine given up that
reigns to someone now, like if a,

1160
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:08,860
all of a sudden we brought in some sort
of a producer or a network, just like,

1161
01:08:08,861 --> 01:08:11,320
look, we're going to take this
podcast to the next level,

1162
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:16,321
but you got to listen to me Joe Show
where I'm not sure that you did with Ilan

1163
01:08:16,570 --> 01:08:16,580
Moscow.

1164
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:19,450
One of the great reasons that that show
was very successful as the way you were

1165
01:08:19,451 --> 01:08:20,240
dressed.
Yeah,

1166
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:24,020
I know you don't like to hear this and
we tested it had nothing to do with him

1167
01:08:24,021 --> 01:08:28,970
being weird and smoking weed and having
a fucking, having a claim for our shirt.

1168
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,400
You wore a nice shirt is,

1169
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,100
I mean is there even like there's,

1170
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:36,590
you could never decide.

1171
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:40,160
You can never test like whether
podcasts going to be successful,

1172
01:08:40,161 --> 01:08:42,710
you can now just,
it's all,

1173
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:47,180
it's all a word of mouth.
It's just weird fucking,

1174
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:51,440
they like it. They like it. Like
a conversation like this. Yes.

1175
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:56,540
We're actual real friends. So when we
talk it's very evident. We have chemistry,

1176
01:08:56,620 --> 01:09:00,940
what's known as a chemistry.
Yes. I can try that. That's
right. Normal. Yeah. Yeah.

1177
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:06,410
Like right here and joining
your time here on this earth.

1178
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:11,420
Well that's the thing.
Doing so doing this and I told,

1179
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:12,950
I remember telling somebody like,

1180
01:09:12,951 --> 01:09:17,450
it's like doing the tonight
show in [inaudible] 78
interviewed in terms of like,

1181
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:21,100
I was in Singapore and a guy came
to the show who saw me on that.

1182
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:25,580
Like every it's, you can't, it's not
even worth knowing if you're, you.

1183
01:09:25,581 --> 01:09:29,270
It's like fucking don't worry about
it. Just show up and talk. But uh,

1184
01:09:29,271 --> 01:09:33,150
I can't pay attention to that. Yeah.
By paralyzing. Yeah. But the, uh,

1185
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:36,470
so I'm like,
the funny thing is when you do TV,

1186
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,900
when you do something that's going to
be seen or heard by this many people,

1187
01:09:38,901 --> 01:09:43,700
like a TV show. If I do Seth or
the daily show, like I prep this,

1188
01:09:43,701 --> 01:09:46,450
I'm like, fucking, yeah. I don't know.

1189
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:48,890
We talk about like so many times,

1190
01:09:48,891 --> 01:09:52,610
I'll run into you at the store and we
basically have like a 10 minute podcast in

1191
01:09:52,611 --> 01:09:56,340
the hallway. Yeah. You know, we just start
talking. You'll say you seen this? Yeah.

1192
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:59,990
You pulled me aside. Like if you ever
heard about ketamine, I'm like, what?

1193
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,810
And then all of a sudden you're telling
me you're taking ketamine session.

1194
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,520
And that's the thing. If
there's no, you can't prep.

1195
01:10:07,521 --> 01:10:10,850
And it would be odd you couldn't
explain it to people 10 years ago.

1196
01:10:10,851 --> 01:10:15,590
Like it'll just be people sitting
and talking. Now the, the,

1197
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,640
the comedians are by
nature pretty entertaining.

1198
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:24,890
At least talkative. Yeah. At least
pretty talkative. And at, at, at,

1199
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:29,990
uh, and on the high end, entertaining
and funny, he had the worst advice.

1200
01:10:29,991 --> 01:10:32,840
He's like, you go to [inaudible]
doing it for an hour,

1201
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:36,680
just do it one hour and edit it.
Yeah. I'm like, all right. Now,

1202
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:41,240
you know, uh, when people
turn it off or anything, nope.

1203
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:46,460
Um, I know that the average time
that someone watches on Youtube,

1204
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,690
we know that, which is like
what, 35 minutes or so.

1205
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:53,120
35 minutes on Youtube,
which is a lot. Yeah,

1206
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:57,620
that's it because the average is
like 15 seconds. But yeah, the APP.

1207
01:10:57,621 --> 01:10:59,950
What's a normal average on you?
Two, three or four minutes. Yeah.

1208
01:10:59,951 --> 01:11:01,760
Flick for everyone that
watches for 10 seconds.

1209
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:03,770
There's someone that watched it for
an hour and a half or three hours.

1210
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:08,080
So the average would be like three or
four minutes for a normal channel. Yeah.

1211
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:08,721
Yeah.

1212
01:11:08,721 --> 01:11:13,721
Well you know the difference between
something on Youtube and something

1213
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,550
that's a podcast that you're
listening to though I think the,

1214
01:11:17,551 --> 01:11:21,450
the people that are listening are,
I don't want to say this, I'm not,

1215
01:11:21,451 --> 01:11:22,201
I don't know if it's really true,

1216
01:11:22,201 --> 01:11:26,820
but they might be more invested in like,

1217
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:29,880
cause they're subscribing
to it and they're listening
to it in their car on the

1218
01:11:29,881 --> 01:11:32,610
way to work. They're listening to. A
lot of times when they're at the gym,

1219
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:36,900
people on Youtube can flip the and decided
to go to the next and what's this and

1220
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:40,180
that, and then they get, you don't get
taken down a rabbit hole with podcasts,

1221
01:11:40,181 --> 01:11:44,210
with audio podcasts. You just listen,
you listen to one of your other.

1222
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,970
Whereas Youtube, like you could stumble
upon this accidentally. Right now.

1223
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:51,930
Someone might be stumbling upon this
very video right now on youtube.

1224
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:57,000
Welcome. Welcome, welcome friend.
The same for you, bitch. Ah,

1225
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:01,610
the other thing you forget is how
much people fucking drive. Yeah.

1226
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:06,080
We're the like, I'm in my car for
hours a day. You're like, what? Why?

1227
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:10,340
And they're like, and, and you are
their friend. Yeah. That's weird.

1228
01:12:10,341 --> 01:12:12,560
Do you know what I mean? Like
you're there, whether you,

1229
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:14,330
it's like you don't know them,
but you,

1230
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:16,730
they really like you and they feel
like they have a connection with you.

1231
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:21,480
Yeah. And all the other people that like
you and Theo and Dileo, whoever's here,

1232
01:12:21,481 --> 01:12:23,700
you know, people that come in. Yeah.

1233
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:27,720
Then those people become characters
in their little world play as well.

1234
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,870
Yeah. Like, you'll see it
in the comments, but like,

1235
01:12:29,871 --> 01:12:33,710
this fucking skinny fuck is like
literally like this. Talk me back.

1236
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:35,750
They read the [inaudible]
was the last time I did it.

1237
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:40,910
The comments were so bad and I
didn't even you or you texted me.

1238
01:12:40,911 --> 01:12:44,230
I was like, boy, they must be very
bad because you were like, we ma,

1239
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:47,720
we did something right or something. I was
like, well, they must be awful. And then,

1240
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:52,070
uh, uh, I didn't cause I know what
they're going to say. It's like,

1241
01:12:52,071 --> 01:12:53,990
what do you think? I'm
dumb. I'm not a dumb.

1242
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:57,380
You got to say whatever you
think of me. I'm not dumb. Right.

1243
01:12:57,650 --> 01:13:02,360
So I disagree with you politically. All
right. I don't, you know, like I don't,

1244
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:03,253
I don't eat right.

1245
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:06,500
That's one of the reasons why I bring
people on that I don't agree with.

1246
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,750
I think it's important to have
conversations with people,

1247
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:10,610
whether on the left or the right,
that you don't agree with.

1248
01:13:10,611 --> 01:13:13,150
Just to find out who they are
and what they think. Yeah.

1249
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:14,660
And just to have discussions,

1250
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:19,240
testing your own feelings about a hundred
percent just like, okay, no, that's,

1251
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:20,081
that's all right.

1252
01:13:20,081 --> 01:13:24,880
I still feel having heard arguably
their best argument or a very cogent

1253
01:13:24,881 --> 01:13:28,300
arguments for their side and
you go, Yep, I think that,

1254
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:31,960
I think the thing that is lost in our,

1255
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:35,600
in one of the things that's
lost in the world now is, um,

1256
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:41,590
because of I partially because of
the internet or blogs or whatever,

1257
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:46,650
where you have to be 100% in every
belief and it's like I'm not 100% in any

1258
01:13:49,001 --> 01:13:52,030
belief. No. Like I'm like, I,

1259
01:13:52,031 --> 01:13:54,490
there are some beliefs where I say I'm 50,

1260
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:58,330
I'm 51% and but that still wins.

1261
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:03,360
51% is still the thing I tell you where
if people can't believe you either gotta

1262
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:08,380
be 100% or zero,
you're a cock whore,

1263
01:14:08,381 --> 01:14:13,330
you're a fucking stud. Like,
uh, and there's no like,

1264
01:14:13,331 --> 01:14:17,860
yeah, well abortions of perfect example
where we're both like, I'm for it, but,

1265
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:22,630
but it's pretty brutal or it's pretty,
it's a severe thing or whatever.

1266
01:14:22,631 --> 01:14:25,720
The Butt and you're not allowed to
have a button anymore. You can't,

1267
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:29,740
you just can't go.
I haven't measured point of view and it's,

1268
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:33,970
I took the vote in my head and it's 70,
30 and you're not,

1269
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:37,800
and it can change your mind somehow or
another. That's bad. That's my whole,

1270
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,060
someone said, well, not just one person.

1271
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:43,270
Many people said you flip
flop on things like, no,

1272
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:45,610
I consider things and it changed my life.

1273
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:50,020
So not when politicians do it,
it's because they,

1274
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:53,780
it's politically in that going
to work in their favor. Yeah.

1275
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:58,180
You do it because you've thought more
about it or you heard the right argument

1276
01:14:58,181 --> 01:14:59,560
at the right time and just got okay.

1277
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,490
Yeah, I changed my opinions
all the time. I don't, I don't,

1278
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,450
I'm not married to those fucking
things. I don't need them. You know,

1279
01:15:06,451 --> 01:15:11,451
my opinions are just the ideas in my
mind or something that should be explored

1280
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,850
and there's certain ideas that I
just hold steadfast. Don't rape,

1281
01:15:14,851 --> 01:15:17,650
don't murder people. Don't steal
all the obvious ones. Right?

1282
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:22,140
Everybody holds those. Yeah. But then
when it gets to a unusual, weird,

1283
01:15:22,141 --> 01:15:24,930
slippery things, I'm like,
okay, well what is why?

1284
01:15:24,931 --> 01:15:27,690
Why is there an inclination to
lean towards a certain direction?

1285
01:15:27,691 --> 01:15:30,510
Like what do we virtue signaling are we,
you know,

1286
01:15:30,511 --> 01:15:35,460
we are sending out the flag of tribal
obedience and what are we doing when we're

1287
01:15:35,461 --> 01:15:40,020
discussing these things?
And a lot of that is what ruins discourse.

1288
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,190
And this is what I think. I have a
real big problem with deep platforming.

1289
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:47,010
We started d platforming
people in censoring people.

1290
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:51,690
You don't just want to not hear them,
you want no one to hear them.

1291
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:56,250
And this is where I have a problem.
It's because who the fuck are you?

1292
01:15:56,610 --> 01:15:59,610
Like why are you the one who gets
to say even if they're wrong,

1293
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:02,110
even if they're won't let everybody
figure it out. It's missing

1294
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:04,830
formation. That's the thing. It's
like pizza gate or one of the,

1295
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:09,060
like Alex shall be saying like,
dude, what the fuck are you doing

1296
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:13,640
to gain is a good example, right? Because
people get ramped up in it. They're like,

1297
01:16:13,641 --> 01:16:18,560
what? And there was a guy, Ben Swan, who
is a, uh, a journalist who had all these,

1298
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:19,221
he was,

1299
01:16:19,221 --> 01:16:24,221
he had this video that he put out that
showed like all the different connections

1300
01:16:24,441 --> 01:16:28,200
with conspiracy theory or
with pizza gate and, uh,

1301
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:32,510
various conspiracies and pedophilia.
And it was, it was a real weird one.

1302
01:16:32,511 --> 01:16:37,080
And everybody was like, what? Well, it's
just because these things are similar.

1303
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:40,310
It doesn't mean there's a pedophile
ring going on. They're like,

1304
01:16:40,311 --> 01:16:43,130
what is that exactly is happening there?

1305
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:46,940
But then you hear about someone like
Jimmy Saville and you go, wait a minute,

1306
01:16:46,941 --> 01:16:50,660
wait a minute with this guy was fucking
kids for how long? Yeah. And no one, like,

1307
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:54,140
how are there any other ones right
now that they have it exposed?

1308
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:59,350
You know what I mean? Like that kind of,
that kind of shit does, I don't having,

1309
01:16:59,450 --> 01:16:59,890
yeah,

1310
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:04,860
I think there's a big, there's
a ton of distance between, uh,

1311
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:10,010
there are pedophiles and there
are pedophiles in the pizza in the

1312
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:13,520
basement. Yeah. Like there, I
believe there's pedophiles. Right.

1313
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:17,840
And that they should be stopped and
they're mostly, yeah. And I, my bed is,

1314
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:19,720
I don't think none of
them are powerful in that,

1315
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:22,520
but I don't think that there is a,
uh,

1316
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:25,340
I just don't really buy into conspiracies.

1317
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:30,230
Just generally buy in some, cause
there's some of them that approvable,

1318
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:34,730
there's some of them that really did
happen where you go, Jesus Christ,

1319
01:17:34,731 --> 01:17:38,780
they really did that. There's no,
yeah, I mean like, like, like in,

1320
01:17:38,781 --> 01:17:41,930
in like third world countries where
will fuck with elections, like salmon,

1321
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:46,100
the shit like that. Like that is, yeah.
Like that's not even a conspiracy.

1322
01:17:46,101 --> 01:17:49,370
That's just like a poorly
told part of history.

1323
01:17:49,371 --> 01:17:53,270
That's our goal Shit Tonkin and said,
oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But that's,

1324
01:17:53,271 --> 01:17:57,770
I think that's, well, I
think that's, uh, out,

1325
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:01,490
you know what I mean? Oh yeah. Um, do
you know about the operation Northwoods?

1326
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:03,080
Do you know about that one?
I don't know.

1327
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:07,760
That one's probably the most disturbing
one because that one was signed by the

1328
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:08,090
Joint Chiefs of Staff.

1329
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:13,090
They were going to organize a bunch of
attacks on America and blame the Cuban so

1330
01:18:13,581 --> 01:18:14,900
that we could go to war with Cuba.

1331
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:19,490
They were going to arm KeyVault families
and have them attack one Tanam obey.

1332
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:22,640
They were going to blow up a
jetliner and blame it on Cuba.

1333
01:18:22,641 --> 01:18:25,640
They had all these plans and it was signed
by the Joint Chiefs of staff and then

1334
01:18:25,641 --> 01:18:29,710
vetoed by Kennedy. He was like, what the
fuck are you? What are you guys doing?

1335
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:30,780
You guys?

1336
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:35,780
I went to fucking Hyannis port and I come
back and try to blow up airplanes and

1337
01:18:35,871 --> 01:18:40,460
the thing is it's, this is something that
didn't fly, but we found out about it.

1338
01:18:40,461 --> 01:18:44,120
How many of these things we didn't find
out about that actually did happen and

1339
01:18:44,121 --> 01:18:48,170
that we think are legitimate instances
in the news or real attacks and I just

1340
01:18:48,171 --> 01:18:51,860
turned out to be false drop in the bucket.
It's a drop in the bucket.

1341
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:56,660
I think it's less than 1% in comparison
to actual events, actual reality per se.

1342
01:18:57,170 --> 01:19:01,540
And so when, when people are the reason
I don't like conspiracy theories,

1343
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,820
I think it people use it to explain
their own failure a lot of the time.

1344
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:08,930
Like we say it a lot in comedy, like,
well, you can't make it unless you're a,

1345
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:12,390
oh goodness, be warm. And you're
like, all right man, that's not just,

1346
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:17,060
I hate that fucking, that perspective
is so crazy. It's like, listen,

1347
01:19:17,061 --> 01:19:19,970
if you're killing people are going
to see you. If you kill a lot,

1348
01:19:19,971 --> 01:19:24,560
people go to see you a lot.
It's that simple. You can't
fake it is a meritocracy.

1349
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:26,990
It really is.
And it's v like there are,

1350
01:19:26,991 --> 01:19:30,980
there are certainly like some
quota of stuff in the margins,

1351
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:36,240
but not, no one's making it. Uh, no
one's doing arenas because of, uh,

1352
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:37,700
the quote you can't pull.

1353
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:41,270
There's nothing you can do to get into
arenas yet people have to actually like

1354
01:19:41,271 --> 01:19:42,830
you. Um, and this,

1355
01:19:42,831 --> 01:19:46,310
this excuse making that people
do do as a straight white man.

1356
01:19:46,311 --> 01:19:48,710
I can't get a break in his town alert.
Oh my God.

1357
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:54,220
When you're a straight white man and
you're complaining like you got one of the

1358
01:19:54,591 --> 01:19:58,400
most fucking captivating hands
of cards in world history,

1359
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:03,350
world history in 2019 straight
has still a great hand.

1360
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:07,370
You might get beat with a crazy,
uh,

1361
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:10,050
you know Nan that.
Yeah.

1362
01:20:10,051 --> 01:20:14,700
And then that hand out at the hamstrings,
man, that'll get you on the river.

1363
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:20,640
I know she got number one. It wasn't
even funny. Yeah, the fuck. Ah,

1364
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,030
man. What's anti-car alright. Uh,

1365
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:27,240
my take on it and then that thing and
I haven't even seen it. It's like,

1366
01:20:27,241 --> 01:20:31,920
do people like it? Yeah. Good. I saw live.
Did you like it? Yeah, I liked it a lot.

1367
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:35,850
Nice. It's like I saw in New York,
I saw before it was on Netflix.

1368
01:20:35,851 --> 01:20:39,960
Like I saw it and met her and was like,
thought I was really nice.

1369
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:44,880
It was an awkward conversation. I'll say
that. Well, she is a little spectrum me,

1370
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:49,320
right? Isn't that, I think that's a
fair, pretty open about estimation. Yeah.

1371
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:52,020
Like it was, it was, it wasn't like easy.

1372
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:56,790
Do you find that you, when you
speak to certain women, particular,

1373
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:59,680
you feel like almost like you're
guilty of something like you,

1374
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:03,630
like you're a male, like you're
an oppressor. Do you ever,

1375
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:08,480
you ever not too many women
and it could just be a project.

1376
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,940
It could be my own. It could be. I'm
like auto projecting where I'm like,

1377
01:21:11,941 --> 01:21:14,760
I definitely do that.
There aren't too many,

1378
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:19,620
but I think you have to work
against stereotypes. You're
working against tattoos,

1379
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:22,900
built bald,
right wing podcasts.

1380
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:27,810
Well cage fighting commentator.
I forgot about that. Cheeses,

1381
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:32,460
Joe. Yeah. So like you have
a lot. I'm pretty, you know,

1382
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:37,060
a feet. The way I look is a
problem. It's like I and I, if you,

1383
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:41,550
what are the odds? You're not sexist
or a dickhead. Yeah. Not that good.

1384
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:46,530
Like what are the odds like,
so, uh, you try, I mean I don't,

1385
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,280
I don't feel it too much,
but I can imagine how much,

1386
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:54,150
what percentage of women do you
feel like you have to do that?

1387
01:21:54,151 --> 01:21:58,710
With the ones who don't know me,
once they know me, like I'm pretty,

1388
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:04,260
pretty nice. Like go to a venue, you go
to the venue that you've never been to.

1389
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,780
There's a woman,
the backstage,

1390
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:10,920
one of the works for live nation or she
works the venue like does she assume

1391
01:22:10,921 --> 01:22:13,800
that you're not if they worked for our
nation, I'm nice to all those folks.

1392
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:16,450
But I think that if someone has,
uh,

1393
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:20,580
like a very staunch feminist perspective
and they meet someone like me,

1394
01:22:20,581 --> 01:22:24,060
they might, depending upon
their perspective, they might
think that I'm the enemy.

1395
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:26,340
That that's a,
that's a possibility.

1396
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:28,890
That like right away they looked
at me like the enemy. Yeah.

1397
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:33,480
Well that's the thing of like,
what are you absolute like even,

1398
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:36,270
and you, you can tell sometimes
when you're arguing with,

1399
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:40,890
with people that are super dogmatic
about whatever they believe in,

1400
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:42,030
let they can,

1401
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:47,420
you can watch them go into a line of
logic that they know that they then

1402
01:22:48,931 --> 01:22:53,460
realize,
I can't cause that will like a seed,

1403
01:22:53,461 --> 01:22:55,630
some ground to this person. They go, Duh.

1404
01:22:55,930 --> 01:23:00,840
And it's like I saw you start to
go down that like a, just a reason.

1405
01:23:00,841 --> 01:23:05,160
And I'm not saying d, uh, stop
believing what you believe.
And it's just like, it's,

1406
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:08,830
you doesn't have to be 100% exactly.
Just, it's fine. You can still,

1407
01:23:08,990 --> 01:23:12,250
you're still win the popular vote.
It's majority rules.

1408
01:23:12,251 --> 01:23:15,520
It doesn't have to be
overwhelming. Just, just don't,

1409
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:19,570
it's dishonest in a way because
they don't want to believe.

1410
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,210
They don't want to have,
uh,

1411
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:24,880
they don't wanna have a chink in
their armor in terms of logic.

1412
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:29,630
Yeah. To want to lump people
into categories because
it's easy to define them to,

1413
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:31,880
you know, uh, we were goofing yesterday,

1414
01:23:31,881 --> 01:23:35,760
me and Joe List were goofing around
about a Alyssa Milano sex strike and she

1415
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:37,430
choose for those enough.
And I was like,

1416
01:23:37,670 --> 01:23:41,690
one of the things that's offensive
about that is first of all, that, um,

1417
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:46,780
that women would agree with you that
they would just withhold sex from the

1418
01:23:47,361 --> 01:23:49,160
person that they'd allow
us. Some Alana said, guys,

1419
01:23:49,161 --> 01:23:53,030
I'm Alyssa Milano said you should
withhold sex because in fucking Georgia

1420
01:23:53,031 --> 01:23:55,430
they're limiting abortion laws.
But the second thing is,

1421
01:23:55,431 --> 01:23:59,690
I like that you would assume that
all men are responsible for this,

1422
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,390
not even just the voters in Georgia,
but all men.

1423
01:24:02,391 --> 01:24:06,860
Somehow I got a man in Minneapolis
should be denied sex from his progressive

1424
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:10,860
for that. He's going to call like
his friend in Alabama. Like, man,

1425
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:14,610
this is some, cause I'm not
getting no pussy up here bro.

1426
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:18,710
This fucking sex strike is for real,
Bro. This is hitting us. So it's so good,

1427
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:23,720
delusional and such a dumb flag of
virtue that they're throwing up and it's

1428
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:27,820
such, it's such stupid 2019
woke politics. That was okay

1429
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:30,820
by the way. It's like based
on lots of Strada like uh, uh,

1430
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:35,300
old Greek play wasn't really. Yeah,
no shit. Those are sec striking it.

1431
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:40,840
Yeah. And that's what that
movie Shairaq was about. It
was, it was a sex strike. No,

1432
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:45,400
in Chicago. Yeah. Did that work?
It's an I don't think it's ever,

1433
01:24:45,401 --> 01:24:49,150
I don't know. Will you Google and
see if it's ever been done? Um,

1434
01:24:49,151 --> 01:24:52,250
imagine the girls are just use it as
excuse to not fuck a guy. They won't,

1435
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:55,660
don't want to fuck. It's also like, come
on. So most of them aren't fucking anyway.

1436
01:24:55,661 --> 01:24:59,230
It's like, yeah, like what are you going
to take? Rock had that joke about like,

1437
01:24:59,231 --> 01:25:02,860
what are you going to, you can't stop.
You're already not fucking me to die.

1438
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:06,700
When you hear, we hear women talk about
not wanting to fuck their husbands.

1439
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:11,110
It's like, it's such a depressing, like I
was listening to this Gal, she was like,

1440
01:25:11,111 --> 01:25:13,870
well, you know, most wives don't
want to have sex with their husbands.

1441
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:17,390
Like what you listen to that you're like,
Ugh,

1442
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,850
as a husband at bumps you out.
Or as a, as a human being,

1443
01:25:21,851 --> 01:25:26,830
humans and the learn a situation without
the thing that people liked the most

1444
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:31,930
about relationships. But besides the
fact that he loves someone to care,

1445
01:25:31,931 --> 01:25:35,050
someone is having sex with somebody
who wants to have sex with you.

1446
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:38,800
It's great fun. It's a fun
time. It's very rewarding.

1447
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:42,430
It's feels real nice.
Phil's Chris specially take a little hit.

1448
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:47,020
See if we really feel
it. Yeah, it feels great.

1449
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:50,320
So when you hear that someone
doesn't want that and then you know,

1450
01:25:50,321 --> 01:25:52,510
and their attitudes that
most women don't want that.

1451
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,060
Most women don't have sex
with their husband. They just
do it cause they have to.

1452
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,201
Well that's also,

1453
01:25:56,201 --> 01:26:00,370
it's very hard to get a clear story about
women and sexuality in that. Like it's,

1454
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:04,040
I don't,
I think it's varies from wildly.

1455
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,040
Oh, for sure. Like he hasn't
been girls you've dated. Yeah.

1456
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:10,880
Even the other day I put a thing
on, on, uh, Instagram where I said,

1457
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,160
how if you start following a guy,

1458
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:18,290
how long do you think he should
wait to Dmu? Because as a guy,

1459
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:22,460
I'll have girls follow me and because
I just do jokes on there. I'm like,

1460
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:27,560
this is Carolina. I don't want to be
like, so you came for the comedy also?

1461
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:31,450
I don't know. Yeah. That's hilarious.

1462
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:34,480
I don't want to fall. I don't want
to bomb her out if she just came to,

1463
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:36,920
she thinks I'm funny, but like,
yes, but what about fucking me?

1464
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:41,390
Can I interest you in
that peanuts? Yes. Um, so,

1465
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:46,280
and of course the answers
were all over the place. Yeah.
Like four days. Five days,

1466
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:50,030
10 minutes. And then I said, but if he's
cute, it doesn't matter. And they wrote,

1467
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:50,893
nope.

1468
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:56,100
Ah, yeah. But if it's aqua
man, just let them slide.

1469
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:59,170
I like that you're referencing aqua man
is like the paradigm of hotness though.

1470
01:26:59,171 --> 01:27:01,920
Cause he really is. He's
as good as it gets. He's,

1471
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:05,190
well this is when my wife said she
goes, he's everybody's type. Yeah.

1472
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:09,480
He's a including fish. Yeah.
He's a big giant, handsome,

1473
01:27:09,481 --> 01:27:13,050
beautiful man who seems to be
extraordinarily kind. Yeah.

1474
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:17,070
Like he's got like Benny dates and older.
Well, a woman that's older than him,

1475
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:21,540
like he's got he exercises. What does
it say? Furthermore, sex strikes,

1476
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:25,530
I started sleeping less and didn't
read it as pointed by Chicago.

1477
01:27:25,531 --> 01:27:29,400
Whist in Kenya, the
Philippines. Liberia. Thanks.

1478
01:27:29,401 --> 01:27:33,310
Nobel Prize winner Lima.
Wha How split?

1479
01:27:33,370 --> 01:27:37,970
Say That g B o w Wilby keep,
Whoa,

1480
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:40,470
whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. We,

1481
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:45,680
and in Colombia where women held a
10 day sex strike in 2006 to end gang

1482
01:27:46,231 --> 01:27:46,780
fighting.

1483
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:51,520
Wow.
And it is a great idea.

1484
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:55,900
It truly is. Like, if you want
to affect change, just get every,

1485
01:27:55,901 --> 01:27:59,420
I was saying to somebody last
night like we all know, like every,

1486
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:03,130
somebody was asking me about uh,

1487
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:07,840
cheating on and I was like, I'm
not a cheater. But I was like,

1488
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:11,440
every guy does what they do.

1489
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:16,060
Most human achievement is because
they men wanted to get like,

1490
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:18,100
yeah,
like buildings,

1491
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:21,660
electricity.
If you think that scab problem in unions,

1492
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:26,070
just trust me.
If you got a fucking sex drive them hoes,

1493
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:29,280
them hoes going to come down. I
was also, what am I going to you?

1494
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:30,960
I have no leverage.

1495
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:35,350
This is my main leverage.
Like, um, but, but yeah,

1496
01:28:35,351 --> 01:28:38,980
like it's a, it's a great bargaining
tool. Oh yeah. I mean it's the,

1497
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:40,810
it is the bargaining.
I mean that's,

1498
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:45,010
in some ways that's most
of them negotiation of a
relationship is like where

1499
01:28:45,011 --> 01:28:46,710
girls get like women don't control.

1500
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:50,020
It's like they may not
control it explicitly,

1501
01:28:50,021 --> 01:28:53,500
but I know if I do something that's
going to get you in a bad mood,

1502
01:28:53,501 --> 01:28:54,370
you're not going to fuck me.

1503
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:57,480
And legalized prostitution is one of the,

1504
01:28:57,660 --> 01:29:00,990
one of the best ways to
combat any kind of sex strike.

1505
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:06,180
And that is one reason why women fucking
hate the idea of legalized prostitution.

1506
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:09,510
They don't ever want that
to not be negotiable.

1507
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:12,390
They don't ever want you to be able
to go, oh, I'm an asshole. Yeah,

1508
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:13,950
I'm going for a drive.

1509
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:19,020
And you go right down to the store when
you go to the sex store and you pay for

1510
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:23,190
a 10 and she's built like Jessica Rabbit
and you bang and you have a time of

1511
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:26,200
your life and then you go home and your
girlfriend's got a little bit of a gut,

1512
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:29,550
their ass a little saggy and you're like,
I just know.

1513
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:33,150
I mean you can't tell me what to do
anymore. I spent 80 bucks. I just,

1514
01:29:33,151 --> 01:29:37,650
I said it wasn't that much. Yeah.
If sex was legal v financially,

1515
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:39,330
if it was transactions,

1516
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,600
it is legal in a lot of countries
are not a lot of countries,

1517
01:29:42,601 --> 01:29:45,840
but a few cuts of view. Yeah, enough.
But if it was legal in this country,

1518
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:49,980
how much do you think it would shift
perceptions? And the way what people,

1519
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:51,060
I think it would,
I don't know,

1520
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:54,720
cause I was just in Singapore and
apparently it's legal there by the way.

1521
01:29:54,721 --> 01:29:59,040
I went to like there's a, I was
in Singapore, did some shows.

1522
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:01,230
Excellent.
And uh,

1523
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:05,990
and there was a place called,
uh,

1524
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:11,030
it's orchard road and it's a mall during
the day and at night it becomes a mall

1525
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:17,080
for prostitutes. They have
a prostitute mall. Yes.

1526
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:21,960
It's dirt road. And the awful saying
four it is four floors of horrors,

1527
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:22,823
which I did.

1528
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:27,480
I hate you. I hate the word war.
Um, I don't know. It just bugs me.

1529
01:30:27,481 --> 01:30:31,020
I had something about, it's like you wore,
it just feels like dice or the cooker.

1530
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:35,310
Pr. I Dunno. I like hooker
is a term of endearment.

1531
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:41,480
Call. No, not like mouth shut
your mouth hooker. Like oh yeah,

1532
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:44,550
like a girlfriend who's just joking around
about something. They shut your mouth.

1533
01:30:44,551 --> 01:30:46,970
Hooker and that everybody
will laugh. Yeah. Uh,

1534
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:51,350
so, but it, I, so the, the,

1535
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:55,260
the local guys, we're going
there and I was like, well yeah,

1536
01:30:55,261 --> 01:30:57,030
I'm going to go also because
I want to see this place.

1537
01:30:57,031 --> 01:31:00,180
Cause I've read about it and there was
a restaurant there that they ate in,

1538
01:31:00,181 --> 01:31:05,130
which is a whole other issue, but it's
literally like a mall, like a Shitty Mall.

1539
01:31:05,131 --> 01:31:09,660
Like not like a, you know, Glendale
Gallery that where it's like, like a law.

1540
01:31:09,690 --> 01:31:13,020
It's just one of those like square
ones where it's like four floors.

1541
01:31:13,021 --> 01:31:15,330
There's escalator in the middle and
then there's just basically like,

1542
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:19,770
and there's just wimp, prostitutes,
hookers as you call them,

1543
01:31:20,370 --> 01:31:23,100
uh,
out in the

1544
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:26,600
walkway. Jamie's got a visual for us
trying to find something, but I found a,

1545
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:31,630
a TripAdvisor review of
Ortho. Nice. Yeah. Wow.

1546
01:31:31,631 --> 01:31:34,450
Don't go here at nighttime unless
you want to be shocked a little.

1547
01:31:34,451 --> 01:31:38,800
The wholest place turns into a countless,
into countless brothel bars.

1548
01:31:39,190 --> 01:31:43,310
I feel like I needed to scrub myself after
our visit. I, I don't diss. Like I, I was

1549
01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:46,340
there about three minutes and I was like,
all right.

1550
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:51,760
Cause the thing is there's a difference
between legally legalize prostitution

1551
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:55,550
and anyone wanting to be a prostitute.
They don't want to be,

1552
01:31:55,551 --> 01:31:58,730
I mean they are right. I don't think
they're being forced or coerced,

1553
01:31:58,731 --> 01:32:00,070
but is coercing

1554
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:01,360
them.
What did you doing it?

1555
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:04,450
What did you think about the
Robert Kraft situation here?

1556
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:08,530
Here's what bothered me about that. Two
things bothered me about that one, they,

1557
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:12,370
they accused him of being a
part of sex trafficking. Right.

1558
01:32:12,371 --> 01:32:14,470
But it turns out that wasn't true.
They weren't,

1559
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:17,860
they were just regular girls who wanted
a jerk guys off for money. Right.

1560
01:32:17,861 --> 01:32:20,350
It wasn't, there was no one there
on it, I think is a big word.

1561
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:25,630
Would willingly did it
voluntarily, whatever. Um,

1562
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:29,450
and they were threatening to release
the film footage of him. Like,

1563
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:30,491
so what do you do?

1564
01:32:30,491 --> 01:32:34,420
And just trying to shame him into
submission and the fact that this guy,

1565
01:32:34,421 --> 01:32:37,930
even though he's a billionaire, he can't
stop that from happening. I kept crazy.

1566
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:41,560
Well the funny thing is the fact that
he's a billionaire and still has to go to

1567
01:32:41,570 --> 01:32:45,580
them to the fucking drive through.
It's like,

1568
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:50,530
boy, I wished there was a better system.
It shouldn't be a better system. Yeah.

1569
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,030
I mean I think it's going to be robots.

1570
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:56,260
I think sex robots are going to be like
blur the morality line. I was at, uh,

1571
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:56,880
this is,
uh,

1572
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:00,790
similar thing about like, there's no, uh,

1573
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:03,540
a release and relief anywhere.

1574
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:07,230
I was at a party recently and
DiCaprio was there and there were,

1575
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:10,350
and there were a bunch. It was
just like a huge, crazy party,

1576
01:33:10,830 --> 01:33:13,620
like crazy holiday party, like
the kind. I never go to them.

1577
01:33:13,621 --> 01:33:15,900
And it's just like Eddie just
everyone's there and, uh,

1578
01:33:16,410 --> 01:33:20,860
Dicaprio's girl wanted to
leave and he goes, well, uh,

1579
01:33:21,150 --> 01:33:24,660
the girls are tired.
So I got to leave the greatest party ever.

1580
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:30,600
Like he had to leave, like even did
Leonardo Dicaprio, the king of kings.

1581
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:36,660
The girls are tired. God got to go.
They'd been at the Party for, ah,

1582
01:33:37,710 --> 01:33:39,930
I don't know, hour and a
half or something, but there
was like a dinner before,

1583
01:33:40,230 --> 01:33:43,050
but it was, it was just a funny
thing, like, oh, okay. So there's no,

1584
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:47,880
it doesn't matter who I am. You still,
when they're done, yeah, when they're,

1585
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:52,080
when they're done, you're going to
go so times. But having said that,

1586
01:33:52,110 --> 01:33:57,110
we still all do it for some invisible,

1587
01:33:58,650 --> 01:34:00,150
uh,
Shangrila.

1588
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:04,120
I bet she would have stayed at the party
for aqua man. You know what I mean? Yeah.

1589
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:07,800
Aqua man was the man document.
Like, it's fine, let's stay. Yeah.

1590
01:34:07,801 --> 01:34:09,990
My feet take off my shoes.

1591
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:15,210
Uh, yeah, the, uh, but yeah,
there's still, he's still kind of,

1592
01:34:15,211 --> 01:34:18,750
I mean,
we're still doing it for some primal,

1593
01:34:19,530 --> 01:34:22,110
like all the achievements and
all that shit. It's still some,

1594
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:25,350
yeah. Well, you want to be
respected, loved, and liked,

1595
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:29,590
and you want people to desire you.
Yeah. That's part of it. Right.

1596
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:33,360
Even if you're not gonna
take them up on it. Right.

1597
01:34:33,690 --> 01:34:38,520
Like I told an anecdote on, on,
uh, how neofill this week, um,

1598
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:41,400
about the best compliment I ever got.

1599
01:34:41,401 --> 01:34:45,000
I was doing a show in Vegas with two
buddies of mine who shall remain nameless.

1600
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:48,600
We get on the elevator at the end,
woman gets on and goes,

1601
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:53,550
can I just say I'm married, but
I would fuck all you guys, whoa.

1602
01:34:54,030 --> 01:34:57,980
And we, and it was
great, but like, Oh, you

1603
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:02,600
get, we feel accomplished. We
did a great job. At the show,

1604
01:35:02,601 --> 01:35:06,460
you're attracted us having to be married
and that's so nothing's ever gonna

1605
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:10,940
happen. But thank you for expressing
your attraction. US A one.

1606
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:15,050
If she was saying, even though I'm
married now, she was saying it like,

1607
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:19,970
just so you know, if I weren't married
by, wasn't married yet, fuck and not,

1608
01:35:19,971 --> 01:35:22,950
and she didn't mean at the same time
either. She was a little drunk, she was,

1609
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:26,600
but even tipsy, she had some ridiculous,
that's a very nice thing to say.

1610
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:31,640
Like that's kind of what you want to from
everyone. For a guy. Yeah. Like, Hey,

1611
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:35,300
I would fuck you girls don't want to hear
that. They're like, yeah, thanks. Yeah,

1612
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:40,140
no kidding. Yeah. Everyone
wants to come on to, yeah. Hey,

1613
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:45,020
how do you like doing a
podcast with Bianca? I love,
don't be on, she's hilarious.

1614
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:47,140
She's funny.
She's smart,

1615
01:35:47,270 --> 01:35:51,340
smart and she's a pain in
the ass in terms of like, ah,

1616
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,080
she is very like,
no,

1617
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:56,570
like she has her own logic.

1618
01:35:56,990 --> 01:36:01,910
She has her own belief system
and we just argue it out. Uh,

1619
01:36:02,270 --> 01:36:06,140
she's more in like,
and she's also like 10 different races.

1620
01:36:07,090 --> 01:36:10,420
She's like, so she's pulling from
a, like her father's Middle Eastern.

1621
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:12,770
She grew up in Oakland.
Like she's got a lot of different,

1622
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:15,830
like it's got Panamanian
and she's got a Panamanian,

1623
01:36:15,831 --> 01:36:18,230
she speaks German I think like for real.

1624
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:22,340
Like she's so she's just
like from all over. And uh,

1625
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:26,570
she's a fun,
she's fun and funny and she's funny too.

1626
01:36:26,630 --> 01:36:29,940
She's fun to be funny around.
Is she on how Neil feel? Yeah,

1627
01:36:29,941 --> 01:36:33,350
she's on hunting field. That's the name
of the, so how, how often you guys do it?

1628
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:36,560
Once a week. Oh, that's cool. Yeah.
What do you do it? Do it in my,

1629
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:40,190
literally in my bedroom. Oh, nice.
Yeah. Beautiful. Cause it's, it's not,

1630
01:36:40,191 --> 01:36:43,460
that's the only space we have. That's
cool. But it's like, you know, it works.

1631
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:48,320
How many have you done so far for? Okay,
cool. Nice. The beginning of a podcast.

1632
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:52,490
It's nice. You can see what it becomes.
Low expectations. You'd be like, yeah,

1633
01:36:52,491 --> 01:36:56,000
we're still starting out.
Yeah. Uh, I like it either.

1634
01:36:56,110 --> 01:36:58,640
Have you done any at the store?
No,

1635
01:36:58,641 --> 01:37:01,490
I literally haven't done any,

1636
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:05,210
I don't think maybe I did one in the
basement once. It's a nice little spot,

1637
01:37:05,211 --> 01:37:09,790
man that it is. Yeah, it's cool. It is
kind of a cocoon. Yeah, it is. It's,

1638
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:12,410
it's the way they have it set up
down there. It's pretty bad ass.

1639
01:37:12,411 --> 01:37:15,800
And the fact that like, wow, we're doing
a podcast at the comedy store. It feels,

1640
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:19,700
it feels kind of historical because that
is the thing that brought that place

1641
01:37:19,701 --> 01:37:20,600
back.
Yeah.

1642
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:25,520
Podcast brought that place back from the
brink and made it the thriving center

1643
01:37:25,521 --> 01:37:26,354
of comedy.

1644
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:30,740
I think you can all agree that is the
center of comedy in the known you hundred

1645
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:34,970
percent. 100% yeah. And that podcast,
even like Robbie from Netflix is like,

1646
01:37:34,971 --> 01:37:39,971
podcasts are like the
indicator of streams.

1647
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:44,360
Like you know, it's, it's pretty
direct. Yeah. The correlation,

1648
01:37:44,361 --> 01:37:48,170
and I don't know what Tom would be more
popular from Netflix or the podcast.

1649
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:52,910
They're both pretty fucking like one on
one aide in terms of he's murder in it

1650
01:37:52,911 --> 01:37:54,020
right now.
It is.

1651
01:37:54,021 --> 01:37:58,380
Podcast has fans like whenever
they do these Garth Brooke things.

1652
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:02,970
Oh my God, Garth Brooks is haunted.
He doesn't know what to do.

1653
01:38:02,971 --> 01:38:05,780
He's so trapped by your mom's house fans.
Yeah.

1654
01:38:06,150 --> 01:38:10,110
They just won't stop with the means
and the deep fakes with Tom's face of a

1655
01:38:10,111 --> 01:38:15,000
Garth Brooks body fight.
DM The guy. Yeah. And uh,

1656
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:20,010
cause I was like, is it hard because
it's terrifying. Someone said,

1657
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:20,963
I did it.

1658
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:25,680
Jamie used the software to make one
with me with Trump's head was easy.

1659
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:28,260
Yes. Fuck very easy. Someone,

1660
01:38:28,290 --> 01:38:32,940
I was talking to somebody about it and
they said it bums me out in the way.

1661
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:35,220
Death used to bum me out
when I was a little kid.

1662
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:43,200
Wow. Wow. Oh, I know what he means.

1663
01:38:43,201 --> 01:38:47,750
It's like unfathomable. Like,
oh, this is not good shot man.

1664
01:38:48,070 --> 01:38:52,580
Chow. Check this out.
God competition for us,

1665
01:38:52,581 --> 01:38:55,830
for the US. Look at this. Are you
checking in about which vice president?

1666
01:38:56,660 --> 01:39:00,250
Former vice president Biden. The
current vice president is my shorthand.

1667
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:03,570
He actually looks like Joey. Do
you guys do that? Looks like me.

1668
01:39:03,571 --> 01:39:06,690
If I was fat and I had a crazy
haircut that looks, that's me.

1669
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:11,400
Everyone's competition. I view
everybody's clarity. That's so good.

1670
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:12,660
How long did it take for real?

1671
01:39:13,150 --> 01:39:16,970
Um, it's about the, I was teaching
myself how to do it really. Right.

1672
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:19,330
So like this version took,

1673
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,880
I let it run overnight because there's a
little bit of what the machine learning

1674
01:39:21,881 --> 01:39:25,170
kind of thing I was doing. The longer you
let that run, the better it is as well.

1675
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:28,720
I've been learning. So this was just my
test of like eight hours, maybe six hours,

1676
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:32,410
have multiples going at one once I made
this year, months or in the hopper.

1677
01:39:32,530 --> 01:39:35,980
The crazy thing is porn. They're
doing that with gals that taken like,

1678
01:39:35,981 --> 01:39:39,430
you know that you've, you used the
word Gallop's 12, that word. I love it.

1679
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:42,490
This is a good time to bring this up cause
I just saw something today literally.

1680
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:45,880
And it has to do with this, and I don't
know if this is real, but this sounds,

1681
01:39:45,881 --> 01:39:49,090
it sounds scary and this is where someone
is taking this technology into a weird

1682
01:39:49,091 --> 01:39:52,180
place. Uh, a lady like as a Facebook
post, it's why I don't believe it,

1683
01:39:52,181 --> 01:39:56,440
but she said she was with her son
and while she was out of her house,

1684
01:39:56,441 --> 01:40:00,820
her husband was called saying that her
son was kidnapped and that he heard his

1685
01:40:00,821 --> 01:40:04,570
son's voice saying like, Mommy, help me,
help me, help me. And to give them money.

1686
01:40:04,571 --> 01:40:07,900
And the dad was freaking out,
didn't know what to do, did,

1687
01:40:07,901 --> 01:40:11,800
couldn't get ahold of them and for
finally did after six minutes and she said

1688
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:15,730
they couldn't even convince the dad that
that wasn't real. Like after hearing, no,

1689
01:40:15,731 --> 01:40:18,840
I'm fine. We're fine. I'm with them.
But I don't know if this is even real,

1690
01:40:19,150 --> 01:40:22,450
how they could do that at this with
the capability now I'm not sure,

1691
01:40:22,451 --> 01:40:23,470
but they might be able to.

1692
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:25,810
Oh, for sure they can do it.
Yeah, they can do with your mind.

1693
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:28,330
I mean if they can do it with faces,
they can do with audio.

1694
01:40:28,331 --> 01:40:31,090
They did it with two pocket,
that Coachella like five years ago.

1695
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:35,590
That was the way he said Coachella
is exactly how he would've said it.

1696
01:40:36,670 --> 01:40:40,210
And they have that,
that Hologram that looks just like him,

1697
01:40:40,211 --> 01:40:44,340
but like a little more jacked. Just a
little like it had more of a six pack.

1698
01:40:44,341 --> 01:40:49,270
He like you went to crossfit?
Yep. Yeah. And having uh,

1699
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:52,940
yeah, that's, I can, I totally
believe they can do the voice seven

1700
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:56,080
ago for that one. Wow.
Yeah, they're so close now.

1701
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:57,970
Even if you go back and
watch game of Thrones,

1702
01:40:57,971 --> 01:41:01,180
like season one and with the wolf's
look like they look like shit. Really?

1703
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:04,270
Yeah they were. There's Shitty
CGI wolves. A little clunky,

1704
01:41:04,450 --> 01:41:07,840
but now they look amazing. Now it looks
like a real fucking wolf. What is this?

1705
01:41:07,841 --> 01:41:09,700
That's Tupac. Look, look out. Jackie is,

1706
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:12,490
do you have any idea how many sit ups you
have to do to have a stomach like that?

1707
01:41:12,491 --> 01:41:16,870
You gotta be on that Wiz Khalifa
tense also as routine. It's also,

1708
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:20,800
you got to not eat any starts,
right? I mean any sugar,

1709
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:23,830
you can't be fucking around with carbs,
carbs,

1710
01:41:23,831 --> 01:41:27,940
that would keep you from being really
shredded. I mean, not all carbs,

1711
01:41:27,941 --> 01:41:32,870
but I mean either doing some, a lot
of fasting. You got to do something.

1712
01:41:32,871 --> 01:41:36,880
And get your body fat down that low
because it doesn't matter how many sit ups

1713
01:41:36,881 --> 01:41:37,340
you do.
Right.

1714
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:41,950
It's not gonna well up to make your ab
muscles bigger and make them more defined.

1715
01:41:41,951 --> 01:41:44,800
I can see one of mine, yeah,
you got to lose weight.

1716
01:41:45,130 --> 01:41:49,430
The only way he goes on to say that,
no, it's so easy to get fat too.

1717
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:52,240
I'm so amazed at how easy I
can get fat on a vacation.

1718
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:54,580
Like one week I gained 10 pounds.

1719
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:59,080
If I go on a vacation and I just go
drink and eat pasta, 10 pounds in a week.

1720
01:41:59,290 --> 01:42:02,870
Well that's like you're running
such a small margin. Yeah,

1721
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:06,490
and just in everyday life
where it's like, yeah, if you,

1722
01:42:06,610 --> 01:42:11,410
if you just eat, it's not a man. I mean
it's fairly massive, but it's not like,

1723
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:16,630
what do you think it is? 800 calories
a day. No, that's dry. Made the extra.

1724
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:21,910
I don't know. With me, man, I go
hard when I, when I eat on vacation,

1725
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:26,380
drink, drinking and eating, like just
the drinking. When I'm on vacation,

1726
01:42:26,381 --> 01:42:30,370
I might drink four or five drinks a day,
maybe more every day.

1727
01:42:30,430 --> 01:42:34,150
Do you drink during the day if you're on
vacation without your [inaudible]? No,

1728
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:38,140
no, no. Not without my kids, but when
my kids are there, I'm hammered. Yeah.

1729
01:42:38,141 --> 01:42:40,690
You got to say, yeah, I get no,

1730
01:42:40,691 --> 01:42:43,330
but if I'm away on vacation and I'm out,

1731
01:42:43,331 --> 01:42:47,560
I might have a drink at the pool
or at the beach, wherever I am.

1732
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:50,260
And then at night if I go to dinner,
I might have two or three,

1733
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:53,470
so I might have four or five
drinks every fucking day.

1734
01:42:53,471 --> 01:42:56,380
That's not a normal day for me.
Such as just piling up,

1735
01:42:56,530 --> 01:43:00,670
piling up and what are you
drinking? Whatever, whatever.
What do you got got? Yeah.

1736
01:43:00,671 --> 01:43:03,910
If I'm on vacation, you know,
I'm trying to get fucked up.

1737
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:07,630
I'm trying to have a good time doing
it. Like it's my job. And Are you,

1738
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:12,580
does your wife get drunk? She'll get
hammered. Not as much as me though.

1739
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:17,360
I get more drunk than her.
That's fun. Yeah. Yeah.

1740
01:43:17,380 --> 01:43:19,870
Was you don't know where to go and
you could just walk to wherever you're

1741
01:43:19,871 --> 01:43:24,760
supposed to be. Yeah. Yeah. But a
10 pounds later, I'm like, you fat.

1742
01:43:24,761 --> 01:43:29,260
Fuck. And I'm grabbing my sides when I
can go grab a fistful of meat. Right.

1743
01:43:29,261 --> 01:43:31,630
Where my love handles on.
I'm like Jesus Christ.

1744
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:36,990
Well cause it's so like you fucked up
and you just like have a thing that you

1745
01:43:37,961 --> 01:43:41,680
have a handful of regret. Yeah. Take
a week to get everything back in line.

1746
01:43:41,770 --> 01:43:43,270
By the way,
that not that long.

1747
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:47,770
I mean that's not a very long time
compared to compared to most people.

1748
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:51,230
Like at your age, fucking people,
People's metabolism. Take them.

1749
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:54,950
People get fat a little bit
and then they're done. Yeah.

1750
01:43:54,951 --> 01:43:59,951
But I still do the same shit that I did
when I was 21 like in terms of like the

1751
01:44:00,171 --> 01:44:02,330
amount of working out I do. Yeah. I still,

1752
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:07,700
I'm still running the hills and doing
serious kettlebell workouts and martial

1753
01:44:07,701 --> 01:44:11,680
arts and all this stuff. At least
five days a week I'm doing something,

1754
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:15,710
muscles shit every day. Are you doing
Tom's? I'll do something every day.

1755
01:44:15,711 --> 01:44:18,800
I'll do multiple workouts in a
day because I have a gym at home.

1756
01:44:18,801 --> 01:44:22,220
So I'll get up in the morning and lift
and then I'll do yoga and then I'll do

1757
01:44:22,221 --> 01:44:26,420
something later. I just, you have to
keep going when you're 50 years old,

1758
01:44:26,610 --> 01:44:28,730
like your body requires,

1759
01:44:28,731 --> 01:44:32,570
like you can't have too much slack
in that cause when you slack,

1760
01:44:32,571 --> 01:44:36,560
if you get out of shape, fuck man, it's
hard to get back in shape. It's hard.

1761
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:39,270
Like your body is trying to die.
Yes.

1762
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:44,340
And not trying to put muscle
on and up your vo two Max.

1763
01:44:44,841 --> 01:44:46,010
It's not interested in that.

1764
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:51,220
Interested in dying and the trick that
continuously working out as the kind of

1765
01:44:51,711 --> 01:44:52,760
like,
Yup.

1766
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:58,910
I've been cranking the sauna up to 200
degrees because Gabrielle Reece told me

1767
01:44:58,911 --> 01:45:03,590
that Laird Hamilton puts his shit on to
2100 twice. That's what she said, right?

1768
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:08,240
To 20, which is you cook meat
at 220 degrees. That's like,

1769
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:12,530
that's fucking hot. And uh,
I was like, there must be
some sort of benefit in that.

1770
01:45:12,531 --> 01:45:12,861
So I'm like,

1771
01:45:12,861 --> 01:45:17,000
I'm going to ramp my shit up from one
80 to 200 and it made a big difference.

1772
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:19,760
What and what's the difference?
First of all,

1773
01:45:19,761 --> 01:45:24,620
it's way harder to do the difference.
Gene one 60 in one, like I was at a um,

1774
01:45:24,621 --> 01:45:29,450
a sauna this past weekend at a gym,
like a hotel gym. It was a nice song,

1775
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:33,440
but it was not hot enough. It was like
one 60 ish. And at that point that hot,

1776
01:45:33,441 --> 01:45:36,980
you're sweating and it's, it's helping,
you're getting heat shock proteins.

1777
01:45:36,981 --> 01:45:37,731
It's good for your body,

1778
01:45:37,731 --> 01:45:41,300
reduces inflammation but not nearly
as radically is when you hit 200,

1779
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:45,500
200 is fucking hard to do.
Like you are the, first of all,

1780
01:45:45,501 --> 01:45:49,490
the wood in the sauna that
you're sitting on is hot as fuck.

1781
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:53,750
You need your sweat to cool off the
wood because the wood is like a plank.

1782
01:45:53,751 --> 01:45:57,830
Like a cedar point through you're cooking
a filet of salmon on the wood gets

1783
01:45:57,831 --> 01:46:02,690
like it's how long can you stay in at 20
minutes and those last five minutes are

1784
01:46:02,691 --> 01:46:03,524
rough.

1785
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:08,180
And how do you deal with the pain?

1786
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:11,420
Whatever the like you can't, you
don't want to move, right? Yeah.

1787
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:16,370
The last five minutes I'd get
up and I start walking around.

1788
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:20,420
Actually I feel like I have more of a
hard time sitting still in the last five

1789
01:46:20,421 --> 01:46:23,300
minutes. So like, uh, yeah, I
would think attractive. Yeah.

1790
01:46:23,301 --> 01:46:27,320
I distract myself by stretching and
moving away flip flops or that they would

1791
01:46:27,321 --> 01:46:30,410
mouth know you. They'd probably get,
well you know what works though?

1792
01:46:30,411 --> 01:46:35,411
Surprisingly airpods those fuckers don't
die out in 200 your phone would be dead

1793
01:46:36,381 --> 01:46:41,210
as fuck, but airpods keep going. So if I
put my phone just outside the door, yeah,

1794
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:42,111
but airpods on,

1795
01:46:42,111 --> 01:46:45,620
I could listen to music or at least
think they're hot to the touch. Yeah,

1796
01:46:45,621 --> 01:46:48,470
they're hot. I feel them. But
they're not breaking down.

1797
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:52,870
They don't do the hang in there at 200
degrees. Good for you or probably, yeah,

1798
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:57,750
they're good. And you feel
it markedly different. Yeah.

1799
01:46:57,751 --> 01:46:59,490
You feel good when you
get out of there man.

1800
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:03,960
Like all your little aches and
pains feel like to get a big bump,

1801
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:08,760
like a big reduction in the
aches and pains and that's,

1802
01:47:08,761 --> 01:47:12,570
and most your aches and pains, their
age and working out. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1803
01:47:12,571 --> 01:47:14,240
Just inflammation in Jay.

1804
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:19,110
What age would you be pissed at?
Be pissed.

1805
01:47:19,111 --> 01:47:23,910
If you died at 60 would you be
pissed? Do you know what? Nah.

1806
01:47:23,990 --> 01:47:26,130
You know what I mean by pests?
Like fucking fuck you.

1807
01:47:26,131 --> 01:47:28,860
I fucking did all the right
shit. Yeah. I don't know man.

1808
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:30,840
You know I just heard John Singleton.

1809
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:35,930
He died at 51 Luke Perry
died at 51 or 52 stroke.

1810
01:47:36,361 --> 01:47:39,540
Both those guys. That's like
fucking, that's me. That's this age.

1811
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:42,930
Destroy of Stevenson. Even my,
I mean he was not in good shape,

1812
01:47:42,931 --> 01:47:47,230
but like he wasn't old. No,
no. He strokes and yeah,

1813
01:47:47,290 --> 01:47:50,220
that one's like, oh, was
Keith when he had his stroke?

1814
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:55,320
50 Ah, fuck. Fuck. Yeah.

1815
01:47:55,321 --> 01:47:59,550
Like at what point would you be like,
feel ripped off? Probably right now.

1816
01:48:00,630 --> 01:48:04,680
So 60 you would be like the shit out
of this body though. It's amazing.

1817
01:48:04,681 --> 01:48:06,810
This thing works as good as it does.
You know,

1818
01:48:06,811 --> 01:48:09,320
if I think about my body's
like a car that I've been to,

1819
01:48:09,321 --> 01:48:10,980
you still feel like you're
beating the shit out of it,

1820
01:48:10,981 --> 01:48:13,740
or did you feel like the Jujitsu stuff
was beating the shit out of it? Well,

1821
01:48:13,741 --> 01:48:17,730
I still do that though, but I, I
went running in the hills yesterday.

1822
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:21,750
Hard fucking work out
yesterday. How far? Two miles.

1823
01:48:21,751 --> 01:48:24,780
But it's straight up or
steep. Yeah, it's like one,

1824
01:48:24,781 --> 01:48:29,781
one stretches more than a 200 yards
straight up and it's fucking hard.

1825
01:48:30,991 --> 01:48:34,780
It's a hard sprint. I, the dog runs ahead
and I'm trying to keep up with them.

1826
01:48:34,970 --> 01:48:35,640
Yeah,

1827
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:39,660
but you get to the top of these really
steep hills when your legs are on fire,

1828
01:48:39,661 --> 01:48:43,350
your lungs are killing you. But man,
it makes a difference. But it's also,

1829
01:48:43,410 --> 01:48:47,250
are you beating the shit out of your body
or are you just doing it? I'm strength,

1830
01:48:47,251 --> 01:48:51,690
right? I'm doing it right, but I am, I am
putting a lot of pressure on the joints.

1831
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:54,860
I'm putting a lot of pressure on
the muscles and it's not simple.

1832
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:58,500
It's not like doing yoga every day.
I'm doing some pretty heavy duty stuff,

1833
01:48:58,890 --> 01:49:01,110
but I feel like,
um,

1834
01:49:01,230 --> 01:49:05,010
if you do it smart and you warm up a
lot and you stretch and I've been pretty

1835
01:49:05,011 --> 01:49:08,970
diligent about recovery
sauna in the big way,

1836
01:49:08,971 --> 01:49:10,310
but also a beginning,

1837
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:15,380
a trigger point muscles release therapy
like which is like really hardcore

1838
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:18,930
brutal massage that you
literally want to cry. Like,

1839
01:49:19,110 --> 01:49:23,460
like this kind of elbows estimate each
fucking puts her elbow on the back of my

1840
01:49:23,461 --> 01:49:26,150
neck and you're like, yeah, but it's,

1841
01:49:26,940 --> 01:49:31,470
but it makes a big difference
man. All that stuff, cry
out therapy, all that stuff.

1842
01:49:31,471 --> 01:49:34,670
Everything's got a little place.
Yeah. Helps. But the moment,

1843
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:39,750
the main thing is consistency. Like
you can't, you can't take months off,

1844
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:43,030
you can't, you can't take weeks off.
You can't just eat less. You'll, you'll,

1845
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:47,740
it'll slip away. Your body
wants to do what it's been
doing. Yup. Like your spirit,

1846
01:49:47,741 --> 01:49:48,080
whatever.

1847
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:49,060
Like whether it's like,

1848
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:53,560
you know whenever the law is that body
in motion stays in motion but it just

1849
01:49:53,561 --> 01:49:57,520
does. It's Gunna like sugar, same
thing, eat sugar and you're like,

1850
01:49:57,540 --> 01:50:01,180
we've got to get more sugar. Don't eat
it. Four days later you're like, man,

1851
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:02,053
God could feel like

1852
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:03,940
variety is really critical to look.

1853
01:50:03,941 --> 01:50:07,990
I'll make sure that I get at least one
or two days a yoga and at least one or

1854
01:50:07,991 --> 01:50:11,080
two days of running at least one or two
days of lifting least one or two days a

1855
01:50:11,081 --> 01:50:13,810
martial arts,
like do a bunch of different shit,

1856
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:16,930
mix it all up together because if
I don't mix it all up together,

1857
01:50:16,931 --> 01:50:20,830
then it's like to just too much
repetitive stress possibility.

1858
01:50:20,831 --> 01:50:22,860
Like if I'm just running every day,

1859
01:50:23,010 --> 01:50:25,920
I don't, I'm not, I don't
think that's wise. And you you,

1860
01:50:26,610 --> 01:50:30,840
why don't you do interval training with
running? I do sometimes, yeah, I do.

1861
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:32,280
I do a bunch of different shit.

1862
01:50:32,550 --> 01:50:36,690
I mean sometimes I just do hill sprints
and then I slowly go down the hill.

1863
01:50:36,870 --> 01:50:39,840
I'll wait till my heart rate gets below
one 40 and then sprint back up the hill

1864
01:50:39,841 --> 01:50:41,910
again. You know, I mix it up,

1865
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:45,990
but the key is consistency.
No matter what you're doing,

1866
01:50:45,991 --> 01:50:49,860
whether it's yoga or running, you got
to do something almost every day. Yeah.

1867
01:50:50,430 --> 01:50:51,340
I don't do some everyday,

1868
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:55,530
but I'd try to do like I got a treadmill
and I now have a bowflex and practicing

1869
01:50:55,540 --> 01:50:57,900
the proud owner of above.
You're the last guy to buy one.

1870
01:50:57,990 --> 01:50:59,610
I know bout to go out of business,
but they go,

1871
01:50:59,611 --> 01:51:03,360
we just got to fucking a
wonderful from 1988 bro. Yeah. My,

1872
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:07,170
my ex girlfriend's roommate had a bowflex.
I remember using this going,

1873
01:51:07,171 --> 01:51:11,500
why in the fuck did you get out of this
big actually and it gets like, it's uh,

1874
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:15,540
takes up a lot of space. Got
a boat. I didn't even put,
yeah, you're right though,

1875
01:51:16,210 --> 01:51:20,190
bro. Come on. They don't that
only that's when it, yeah,

1876
01:51:20,191 --> 01:51:24,570
it does have like a wing. It
is a wing bird. Does it work?

1877
01:51:24,630 --> 01:51:28,050
Yeah, I, yes. You got a good workout.
I got, I'm getting my gains, Bro.

1878
01:51:28,290 --> 01:51:32,280
I still have like dumbbells and you
know, other shin bands. I tell people,

1879
01:51:32,290 --> 01:51:35,170
well, if you really want to work out
at home, all you need is a chin up bar.

1880
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:38,770
Everything else you could do on the
ground, you can do body weight exercises,

1881
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:39,660
you can do

1882
01:51:39,660 --> 01:51:42,240
plenty of. I've got to say, I don't
even think you need a chin up bar.

1883
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:45,060
I mean again,
you know 10 times more than I know,

1884
01:51:45,061 --> 01:51:48,750
but I'm saying like what are you getting
from a chin up bar that you can't get

1885
01:51:48,751 --> 01:51:52,590
from a push up or a dip or
pull ups you're getting,

1886
01:51:52,591 --> 01:51:54,150
but I'm saying it's all done right.

1887
01:51:54,170 --> 01:51:56,180
You're getting your back,
you're getting your back.

1888
01:51:56,181 --> 01:51:58,460
You're not getting your back much.
You're getting a little bit.

1889
01:51:58,461 --> 01:52:02,330
If you do Hindu pushups, we swooped
down and elevate and then come back up.

1890
01:52:02,331 --> 01:52:04,460
You're getting a little bit of your back,
but you're really getting your back.

1891
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:08,240
If you're hanging onto a chin up bar
and you using your whole body weight,

1892
01:52:08,490 --> 01:52:13,310
that's what you want. That that is, that
is an amazing works. My backout very much.

1893
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:15,530
No. Am I fucking myself? Yeah, for sure.

1894
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:19,910
You have the strength in that bitch to
keep the stability in your spinal column.

1895
01:52:19,911 --> 01:52:23,960
You want meat, you want that to be
armored, you know, that's very big.

1896
01:52:23,961 --> 01:52:28,190
I have several machines out there that
are just designed to keep my back strong

1897
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:31,230
and you just think it's good.
It's best practice.

1898
01:52:31,310 --> 01:52:35,150
Yeah, I do that almost as much
as any other kind of exercise.

1899
01:52:35,151 --> 01:52:39,520
I do a reverse hyper. I do a whole series,
the reverse hyper machine. Then the,

1900
01:52:39,521 --> 01:52:42,420
the glutes, the glute machine
where you you, you know, no,

1901
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:47,330
I cannot believe how hard glutes.
Like it's the hardest.

1902
01:52:47,390 --> 01:52:51,890
That's the one after it. I'm like
wow, I'm gonna fucking throw up.

1903
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:57,460
It's the fucking wars hard and you have
to even like I was talking to a trainer

1904
01:52:58,671 --> 01:53:01,880
and she was like, well you need
to like activate your glutes.

1905
01:53:01,881 --> 01:53:03,980
And in part of me is like, I don't
even know what you're talking about.

1906
01:53:04,250 --> 01:53:05,330
And then the more I research,

1907
01:53:05,331 --> 01:53:09,320
it's like our glutes are
dead as like normal people.

1908
01:53:09,321 --> 01:53:12,200
We don't use our glutes and
they are literally atrophied.

1909
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:14,920
That's why women's get
get so disgusted by guys.

1910
01:53:14,930 --> 01:53:18,910
Flat ass don't like this mother
fucker doesn't even activate as no,

1911
01:53:19,330 --> 01:53:22,170
but do you want if he's
gonna run ton of Shit. Yeah.

1912
01:53:22,171 --> 01:53:24,740
You have to do a ton of shit just
to, and she's like, you would take,

1913
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:27,500
it would take you a couple of months to
even just get them activated and I was

1914
01:53:27,501 --> 01:53:29,120
like,
I don't know what you're talking.

1915
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:33,470
I just thought it was some trainer shit
and it's you have to like turn them on.

1916
01:53:33,510 --> 01:53:36,920
Yeah. Like you have to like
do like I do a ton of shit.

1917
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:39,870
I don't even know if I'm doing it
right. They I think iron up. Yeah,

1918
01:53:39,871 --> 01:53:42,290
they got together. You got to get a train.
I should get a train and come home, man.

1919
01:53:42,350 --> 01:53:45,760
Yeah. You got cash. Yeah. Get yourself
a training and Brennan. Yeah, I shit.

1920
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:50,530
Plus it's good because you have to make,
is this your bowflex? No, I went the news.

1921
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:52,430
That's the mirror.
Look,

1922
01:53:52,431 --> 01:53:55,580
if you think I didn't almost by this
you're out of your mind. Magnets.

1923
01:53:55,620 --> 01:53:58,490
It's a snapmirror one waiting.
Wait something or other.

1924
01:53:58,491 --> 01:53:59,690
I've been seeing this online recently.

1925
01:53:59,691 --> 01:54:01,820
I just curious if you've
ever heard of it or no.

1926
01:54:01,821 --> 01:54:05,870
If it works well it's got two chords.
How much a resistance,

1927
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:09,700
the resistance is all internally had done
just by magnet pressure that you saw.

1928
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:11,670
What's the maximum amount of stoke?

1929
01:54:11,790 --> 01:54:14,630
Cause I don't know if you know this
but I'm jacked. No. Yeah, I heard

1930
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:21,320
how much? 148 pounds in the middle. I
think you'd probably 200 plus pounds.

1931
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:24,800
I think it's, I think one 40 it'll
take care of most people. Yeah.

1932
01:54:24,801 --> 01:54:29,600
And if you just doing cables, so 148
on each side, is that what it is?

1933
01:54:29,601 --> 01:54:30,770
I don't know.
Literally I just,

1934
01:54:30,771 --> 01:54:35,090
it's new and I was just curious if you
had seen anything that looks bad ass.

1935
01:54:35,091 --> 01:54:37,700
So the mirror is showing you your forms,

1936
01:54:37,870 --> 01:54:42,200
forms versus video versus like
are you doing it correctly

1937
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:48,350
and they tell you what to do and it
goes up and down. It fits on the wall.

1938
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:53,050
Is that a gimmick? That's what I wonder.
Is there any reviews that it's way it's,

1939
01:54:53,250 --> 01:54:56,150
it's like brand new. I don't even know
if the reviews are all pretty strong.

1940
01:54:56,210 --> 01:54:58,910
This is the, like, as you're saying,

1941
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:02,750
it all comes down to are you going to
do it? Yeah. If you do it every day,

1942
01:55:02,751 --> 01:55:06,670
it's fucking great. Right. You just,
most people won't do it every day. Yep.

1943
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:10,670
They just,
because it's got to write it down.

1944
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:14,840
Just like every day I brush my
teeth. Yeah. So do that too,

1945
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:19,850
but takes longer. I meditate twice a day.
It's fucking twice a day. Really. 20, 28.

1946
01:55:20,090 --> 01:55:23,420
Wow. Interesting. Yeah.
So how does that work?

1947
01:55:23,421 --> 01:55:26,720
Like what do you do a sit down,

1948
01:55:26,750 --> 01:55:31,520
set the timer for 20 and a closed
my eyes and repeat the mantra.

1949
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:35,950
And what is your mantra? Sucker
car. Sorry. Oh, sorry. I got

1950
01:55:37,490 --> 01:55:42,230
um, uh, and it,

1951
01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:43,980
I think it works.

1952
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:48,030
I think I need less sleep as a
result really since I've started,

1953
01:55:48,031 --> 01:55:51,990
I started like a year and a half ago and
I needed significantly less sleep from

1954
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,190
before and I don't know, again, because
it's impossible to know why, you know,

1955
01:55:56,670 --> 01:55:59,730
what's doing what, but what other benefits
in terms of like clarity and stuff.

1956
01:56:00,690 --> 01:56:05,190
I don't, again, I don't know. I think
they're good, but I, I can't say like,

1957
01:56:05,191 --> 01:56:09,900
well I was writing 4.3 jokes a month
before and now I read 4.8 like I don't,

1958
01:56:09,930 --> 01:56:14,430
there's no direct correlation.
I am happy with my output but like,

1959
01:56:14,570 --> 01:56:16,050
hmm. Isn't that funny? Yeah.

1960
01:56:16,050 --> 01:56:18,810
That like to an average person they'd
be like, wait, wait, wait four point.

1961
01:56:19,050 --> 01:56:23,010
You're joking, right? No, no. If
I get four great jokes a month,

1962
01:56:23,011 --> 01:56:24,180
that's an amazing month.

1963
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:25,380
Yeah.
Well it's like that.

1964
01:56:25,381 --> 01:56:28,120
I was going to bring it up when you were
talking about deer hunting. Yeah. Right.

1965
01:56:28,150 --> 01:56:30,510
It's like, yeah. If you it,

1966
01:56:30,570 --> 01:56:34,330
you see the special thought
of it all at once. Yeah.

1967
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:37,740
I'm the special,
you had a great line about

1968
01:56:37,890 --> 01:56:39,330
writing and that like,

1969
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:43,650
like writing in a notebook or on your
phone that it's like a net to catch ideas.

1970
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:44,450
Yeah.

1971
01:56:44,450 --> 01:56:47,230
That really is like thought about that
was like that is a great way to put it.

1972
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:50,470
Yeah. Like here put throw this in
the, put it on the thing and like,

1973
01:56:50,471 --> 01:56:52,600
and then you can look back.
You ever have an idea,

1974
01:56:52,601 --> 01:56:56,510
write it down and then three days later
looking at like that's fucking fun.

1975
01:56:56,550 --> 01:56:58,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's funny.

1976
01:56:58,590 --> 01:57:00,870
Well that's why you got to throw
a lot of shit against the wall.

1977
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:05,730
I have pages and pages of stuff that I
review like late night rambles that I

1978
01:57:05,731 --> 01:57:09,360
labeled them late night rambles
cause I write a lot of times at,

1979
01:57:09,450 --> 01:57:13,440
at night after the store. So I by
yourself? Yeah. Yeah. Everyone's asleep.

1980
01:57:13,830 --> 01:57:15,900
I'm high and just sit in
front of the computer.

1981
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:18,450
And is it like you have
a germ from the day?

1982
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:22,690
I have sometimes some,
but I have one hour they have to write.

1983
01:57:22,870 --> 01:57:26,560
So I'm one hour in front of that computer
and like give myself that one hour and

1984
01:57:26,561 --> 01:57:29,830
then after that I can watch youtube
videos or whatever you flicks, whatever.

1985
01:57:29,860 --> 01:57:32,500
But I have to get that
one hour in and man,

1986
01:57:32,501 --> 01:57:35,140
there's been many times where I'm sitting
there staring at that fucking computer

1987
01:57:35,141 --> 01:57:39,160
for 20 minutes and then, and then sh
I got an idea, I'm like oh my God,

1988
01:57:39,161 --> 01:57:41,710
there's something. And then the
next day I'd do that onstage. Boom.

1989
01:57:41,711 --> 01:57:43,450
It gets a laugh like fuck yeah.

1990
01:57:43,630 --> 01:57:48,040
That reward for the tediousness
to is just getting through the,

1991
01:57:48,250 --> 01:57:50,950
the sitting in front,
staring at the blank screen,

1992
01:57:50,951 --> 01:57:55,480
staring at some fucking
weird notes. You're not even
sure if they mean anything.

1993
01:57:55,481 --> 01:57:58,800
Trying to find some old shit where
there's just a spark of light,

1994
01:57:59,020 --> 01:58:02,230
an amber blow on it,
turn into a fire.

1995
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:06,600
Or like I had a joke that I try
that I was trying and I was like,

1996
01:58:07,050 --> 01:58:11,340
I know it's good. I just have
to come up with the right thing.

1997
01:58:11,700 --> 01:58:13,980
Yeah.
And then I try to couple,

1998
01:58:13,981 --> 01:58:17,640
the first couple times you fuck it up,
you don't say it right.

1999
01:58:18,270 --> 01:58:22,710
It's just so it is the TD and the mild
embarrassment of just like trying and

2000
01:58:22,711 --> 01:58:26,370
failing. But uh, but having an idea,

2001
01:58:27,150 --> 01:58:31,600
writing it down,
doing it on stage is the,

2002
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:33,660
to me the most rewarding
thing I can think of.

2003
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:37,230
It's one of the most rewarding things
in all of life. Yeah. I mean honestly,

2004
01:58:37,231 --> 01:58:42,040
and I don't say that light. I just mean
like living a life. That is the thing. And

2005
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:45,180
it's not, that's the one that's not
really about, women are not about that.

2006
01:58:45,181 --> 01:58:49,860
It's more like spiritual.
It's like about like, uh,

2007
01:58:50,700 --> 01:58:53,970
yeah. And, and like you,

2008
01:58:54,980 --> 01:58:58,480
it goes through the,
your your filter and you're like,

2009
01:58:58,481 --> 01:59:02,590
no one ever thought of that. Right. Know
what fucking ever thought of that. Right,

2010
01:59:02,591 --> 01:59:05,620
right, right. That's fucking
crazy. Those are the best ones.

2011
01:59:05,621 --> 01:59:10,120
So like how did I catch you? Like
how, what that cue. Thank you.

2012
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:15,460
Earth. How often do you write on stage?
How often do you ad Lib on stage?

2013
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:20,080
Very rarely. I you see I come up with
my sheets. Yup. Yup. And like put,

2014
01:59:20,081 --> 01:59:23,050
I have a new joke show every
Tuesday in Santa Monica and then,

2015
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:28,590
so I'll go up and do as much new shit
as I have [inaudible] and mix it in with

2016
01:59:29,291 --> 01:59:32,860
my ma. I mean, you know that when
you have a punk then you'll put like,

2017
01:59:33,220 --> 01:59:36,730
I can do it,
I can put that part in there.

2018
01:59:36,730 --> 01:59:41,710
So he kind of have to do some old jokes
that like fit in the new part. Um, and,

2019
01:59:41,740 --> 01:59:46,090
but my, I'm like, I usually
am like if I write for jokes,

2020
01:59:46,091 --> 01:59:50,540
one of them will work. Yeah. Like,
and I just like nip. Yeah. Alright.

2021
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:51,371
For jokes.

2022
01:59:51,371 --> 01:59:53,950
One of them will have signs and then
sometimes the other ones you're like, man,

2023
01:59:53,951 --> 01:59:56,710
I don't know if you're alive or not.
I got to stare at you for a little bit.

2024
01:59:56,950 --> 01:59:59,520
I had to try to figure out a
way to bring you to life. Yeah.

2025
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:04,530
Is might be something there.
I'm maybe missing it on the
first pass. Set it aside.

2026
02:00:04,540 --> 02:00:06,910
You ever have a premise and
years later you'll figure it out.

2027
02:00:06,911 --> 02:00:10,660
Years later I'd decade. Yeah.
Yeah. And be like, Oh fuck.

2028
02:00:10,661 --> 02:00:12,160
And you just know how to do it now.
Yeah.

2029
02:00:12,190 --> 02:00:15,520
Maybe you have a bit that you did that
taught you about something else or some

2030
02:00:15,521 --> 02:00:20,020
other aspect of writing a pit and
you couldn't explain it to any,

2031
02:00:20,021 --> 02:00:24,070
you couldn't explain it to someone
who doesn't do it. No. Like you can't,

2032
02:00:24,071 --> 02:00:25,180
it's kind of not,

2033
02:00:25,420 --> 02:00:29,890
I mean maybe athletes a little bit where
it's like they figured the game out in

2034
02:00:29,891 --> 02:00:30,724
a different way,

2035
02:00:30,910 --> 02:00:35,110
but it's so private and it's so like a,

2036
02:00:35,111 --> 02:00:37,510
and that's the thing I was talking
to somebody about this, like

2037
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:43,900
how many funny people are there in the
world. There's a lot of funny people,

2038
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:47,430
but how many of them are
funny? Standup funny. Yeah.

2039
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:50,980
They could just go on stage and make a
roomful of people laugh. That's a hard,

2040
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:53,660
that's a hard couple hundred.
If you're being generous,

2041
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:54,730
you're going to be really general.

2042
02:00:54,731 --> 02:00:58,420
Like how many real legit professional
comedians that you and I respect.

2043
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:02,800
Maybe 200 yeah, man, there's
7 billion people in the world

2044
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:09,600
and like that's the rare and I as much
as comedy is like deified in ways that

2045
02:01:10,121 --> 02:01:14,470
are sort of goofy now. It's still
like, no, this is all we do every day.

2046
02:01:14,470 --> 02:01:16,060
It's fucking interesting.
It's like Ed,

2047
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:20,620
especially now the way the culture is
like we're the only people speaking freely

2048
02:01:20,621 --> 02:01:24,910
in public or at least in an organized
way in this, this format as well.

2049
02:01:24,911 --> 02:01:28,990
Podcast and stand up those
the only two things. Yeah.

2050
02:01:29,350 --> 02:01:33,610
I mean everything else right now
is compromised it seems like. Yeah.

2051
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:35,830
And then everybody else feels at work.

2052
02:01:36,070 --> 02:01:40,460
You can't really talk freely at,
in relationships.

2053
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:44,930
There's like, and it's not like
we're just talking extemporaneously,

2054
02:01:44,931 --> 02:01:46,430
like I don't even know where I'm going,

2055
02:01:46,431 --> 02:01:50,930
but I'm fucking know what's
going to happen at the end
of this sentence. But, uh,

2056
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:54,380
but that, and that's the thing
that's so riveting about it.

2057
02:01:54,381 --> 02:01:59,381
It's like is there no one else is doing
and there's only a few hundred people

2058
02:01:59,481 --> 02:02:03,590
that can do it. Well, yeah. It's crazy.
And it's also reverting to like the,

2059
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:08,360
the creation of like these,
these little things that you come up with.

2060
02:02:08,630 --> 02:02:12,290
If you keep going,
eventually there'll be a special,

2061
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:15,470
eventually it'll be something
that we actually can record. Yeah.

2062
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:18,950
And there's just like these, this thought,
like, I'm onto something. I've got this,

2063
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:23,030
I'm piecing this little puzzle together.
And not even knowing someone said like,

2064
02:02:23,031 --> 02:02:24,980
so what do you, how do you
come up with? And it's like,

2065
02:02:25,010 --> 02:02:28,310
I don't even know what
I mean when I start.

2066
02:02:28,311 --> 02:02:32,450
And then I write the jokes and I'm
like, oh, I see what I was doing.

2067
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:35,990
Or going through.
Do you sometimes rewrite a bit,

2068
02:02:36,050 --> 02:02:38,360
like write a bit and then rewrite
it from a different angle?

2069
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:40,500
Okay.

2070
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:45,050
Uh, I mean there's obviously like threads
of like, like you just do the inverse.

2071
02:02:45,290 --> 02:02:48,260
Sometimes I'd take a bit when
it's already done and I say, okay,

2072
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:51,620
let me put that aside. I know
it's done. I know it works.

2073
02:02:51,950 --> 02:02:56,210
Let me approach the subject from a
completely different angle now. Yeah.

2074
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:58,850
Let me approach the subject as a hater.
Well,

2075
02:02:58,851 --> 02:03:01,040
couldn't you do you end up
probably doing both of them, right?

2076
02:03:01,041 --> 02:03:02,770
Like a lot of your feminism shit.
Yeah.

2077
02:03:02,830 --> 02:03:06,290
The thing you were closing with felt
like you'd written a half and then we're

2078
02:03:06,291 --> 02:03:10,550
like, well, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And now my own robot. Well,

2079
02:03:10,551 --> 02:03:12,900
I'm wanting to rebut myself. Yeah. I know.

2080
02:03:12,970 --> 02:03:17,510
Also wanted to shit on myself so hard
that by the time I got to shit on the

2081
02:03:17,511 --> 02:03:19,610
feminists, like it worked. Yeah. Well,

2082
02:03:19,611 --> 02:03:22,070
that's another thing where
it's like if you couch,

2083
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:26,840
you can say anything as long as
she's it with like I'm not a monster,

2084
02:03:26,841 --> 02:03:30,320
just know that I'm not a monster of
course, but some of these bitches are,

2085
02:03:31,660 --> 02:03:35,420
or some of these, whoever's are
like, I'm not a total piece of shit,

2086
02:03:35,450 --> 02:03:38,270
but let's talk about that.
Yeah, that's the, the,

2087
02:03:38,900 --> 02:03:40,910
I'm thankful that I just thought of a,

2088
02:03:41,130 --> 02:03:45,140
another like frame for, uh, for uh,

2089
02:03:45,530 --> 02:03:48,320
like I did the three Mike's
thing. Yeah, no I did for Netflix.

2090
02:03:48,321 --> 02:03:52,580
So I thought of that frame as like three
microphones on stage and I just thought

2091
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:56,690
of a nother certain that it's
not like a structural thing,

2092
02:03:56,691 --> 02:03:58,900
but it's a way to do a show and,
Huh.

2093
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:00,420
Yeah.

2094
02:04:00,420 --> 02:04:03,180
My first thought was fucking thank God.

2095
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:08,230
Meaning you don't want to be
like, you don't want to do it. Uh,

2096
02:04:08,410 --> 02:04:10,470
premise he show every time.
Cause I did three mics,

2097
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:12,600
then I did a half hour on Netflix,
New Year's Day,

2098
02:04:12,601 --> 02:04:15,840
the communities of the world thing
that deleon Swartz into two. And, uh,

2099
02:04:16,620 --> 02:04:20,940
and now I'm like, I would like to
do it kind of not one man show.

2100
02:04:20,941 --> 02:04:25,770
We think just not a modeling version,
but like a way to do jokes that are more,

2101
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:30,060
it's like jokes, but also if you can
thread something else in it. It's like,

2102
02:04:30,061 --> 02:04:31,530
do you see that there
was a ground site live?

2103
02:04:31,531 --> 02:04:36,531
I think it was Halsy who sang a song
and fucking painted at the same,

2104
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:43,100
she painted a painting turning
this off and I was like,

2105
02:04:43,111 --> 02:04:47,520
wow, wow. See if you can bring
it up. Cause it's like the song,

2106
02:04:47,910 --> 02:04:51,360
I can't play it. We'll get, we'll get to
it was the second song. It's our live.

2107
02:04:52,140 --> 02:04:54,270
Yeah. If we play it well
we'll definitely get the boot.

2108
02:04:54,660 --> 02:04:59,010
Youtube is brutal with their
copyright shit. Brutal.

2109
02:04:59,460 --> 02:05:02,460
I mean, so what's, it's just
very, it's good and bad. Yeah.

2110
02:05:02,461 --> 02:05:05,260
But it's very easy for someone
to claim copyright off of just,

2111
02:05:05,261 --> 02:05:08,010
you play a clip and next thing you
know your video gets taken down.

2112
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:13,480
He can't stream. So part of me is
like, you know, is it right here?

2113
02:05:13,860 --> 02:05:18,750
So she's singing, she's singing and
chanting. And by the way. Great. Logan.

2114
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:23,110
Yeah. Okay. Just got a lot going
on. And she's tearful barefoot.

2115
02:05:23,630 --> 02:05:28,140
Oh, I mean, is it amazing? No, but it's
fucking amazing for singing to me. Yeah.

2116
02:05:28,141 --> 02:05:30,630
It's better than I can do not singing.

2117
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:35,280
I bet she's quite a character.
I don't, that felt loaded.

2118
02:05:35,281 --> 02:05:39,150
That's set up front
load of jail. Um, yeah,

2119
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:42,210
so like I thought of another premise, so
I'm excited about that. That's awesome.

2120
02:05:42,330 --> 02:05:44,400
When you think you're gonna
film, if you will, you will.

2121
02:05:45,410 --> 02:05:49,230
Not long ago I got a, I have,
I've kind of written out,

2122
02:05:49,231 --> 02:05:51,660
but like I'm going to probably
do it like in New York,

2123
02:05:51,661 --> 02:05:54,900
like I did three mikes where I did it
like sort of op Broadway and, okay.

2124
02:05:54,901 --> 02:05:58,140
So when you do something like that where
you do like a long run and then film at

2125
02:05:58,141 --> 02:06:01,650
the end of the run. Yeah, I basically did
three mikes. I did for like two months,

2126
02:06:01,651 --> 02:06:06,180
four nights a week. So, uh,
ended it all in New York. Yeah.

2127
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:08,470
Oh cool. And then where did you do? Uh,

2128
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:12,990
some theater like on the lower east
side were perfectly does his, and then,

2129
02:06:13,210 --> 02:06:17,550
and uh, it was cool. It's cool to just
like have to do an hour every night.

2130
02:06:17,551 --> 02:06:21,240
It's a cool like, oh, I'm going
to do an hour and I'm in a town,

2131
02:06:21,260 --> 02:06:22,410
I'm in the same town.

2132
02:06:22,470 --> 02:06:26,070
That is cool and I'm doing an hour every
night and you're doing essentially like

2133
02:06:26,071 --> 02:06:30,710
a play on that. I liked it
was an emotional, there was a,

2134
02:06:30,810 --> 02:06:34,530
it was a like an emotional fucking,
I talk about emotional shit.

2135
02:06:34,770 --> 02:06:38,460
This'll be less emotional.
It'll be a less wrenching,

2136
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:41,760
emotionally people saw three Mike's like,
it's fucking pretty gut wrenching.

2137
02:06:41,790 --> 02:06:44,460
But uh,
but this'll be less gut wrenching.

2138
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:48,810
But you have a premise that's exciting
to you. Yeah. Which is fucking, you know,

2139
02:06:48,811 --> 02:06:52,380
that's like fucking excellent.
And it's also the only thing that like,

2140
02:06:53,490 --> 02:06:57,000
it's like, well, you're gonna make
money. I don't know. I don't care.

2141
02:06:57,060 --> 02:07:00,360
It doesn't matter.
It's like not even a consideration.

2142
02:07:00,361 --> 02:07:03,840
It seems like you're wasting your time
thinking about that because all that

2143
02:07:03,841 --> 02:07:06,990
really matters is do you enjoy doing
it? This is the audience. Enjoy it.

2144
02:07:06,991 --> 02:07:09,900
All that other stuff comes out of
that, right? Yes. If you enjoy it,

2145
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:12,570
they're probably gonna
enjoy it too. Yeah. And,

2146
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:16,260
and even the thing where people go like,
so what are you doing? And you're like,

2147
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:19,860
you can say you're doing the podcast
or you have UFC stuff like go like,

2148
02:07:19,890 --> 02:07:22,300
oh you have to have something that
you're working on. And I'm like,

2149
02:07:22,370 --> 02:07:27,370
I feel like I'm doing an
hour comedy special for a
huge stream streaming service

2150
02:07:29,551 --> 02:07:33,210
that's going to broadcast
fucking everyone's like, what
are you doing? That's it.

2151
02:07:33,460 --> 02:07:36,780
You know, that's how they,
and you're like, this is a,
what I'm doing is fucking,

2152
02:07:36,790 --> 02:07:41,320
it doesn't, it's not time
consuming visibly day to day,

2153
02:07:41,350 --> 02:07:45,310
but like it's consuming emotional,
like thinking about it.

2154
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:49,850
What's your take on what's going on with
Louie? Like what he's trying to do with,

2155
02:07:49,870 --> 02:07:50,650
uh,

2156
02:07:50,650 --> 02:07:55,650
stopping people from quoting
his bits and the quoting.

2157
02:07:56,310 --> 02:07:59,890
I mean, I think he's just trying to
stop people from leaving a shit. Yeah.

2158
02:08:00,230 --> 02:08:02,560
It was his own fault cause
he just didn't have the bag.

2159
02:08:02,561 --> 02:08:06,510
He didn't have the Undergrad like he could
have him was like, yeah, it'll be fine.

2160
02:08:06,860 --> 02:08:10,910
Yeah. What's the worst
that can happen? Why Louie?

2161
02:08:11,420 --> 02:08:13,870
So now he's doing everything.
He's got the yonder bags,

2162
02:08:13,910 --> 02:08:18,280
he's doing small clubs and he also has a
sign that he puts up saying that if you

2163
02:08:18,281 --> 02:08:23,050
leak any of the material that
they have legal repercussions. Uh,

2164
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:28,090
good. Yeah. I mean why should, why
should, it's a spoiler. It's like,

2165
02:08:28,270 --> 02:08:30,760
it's like a fucking, but it's
worse than a spoiler. Yeah.

2166
02:08:30,761 --> 02:08:35,560
It is worse than a spoiler because every,
every joke is its own movie,

2167
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:39,430
right? It's got its own prize to
exaggerate about it, but it's like, yeah,

2168
02:08:39,431 --> 02:08:43,720
it's a huge, it's a, it's
a, that's a huge problem.

2169
02:08:43,721 --> 02:08:44,740
And it's also,

2170
02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:49,000
it goes to that 11 year old girl thing
where it's like literally said deaths and

2171
02:08:49,690 --> 02:08:52,170
what he did that.
Yeah.

2172
02:08:53,530 --> 02:08:58,360
Uh Huh. Yeah. When you have 11 year old
daughters, man, it's like you get it. Oh,

2173
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:02,770
now I see how people are thinking.
I'm like little kids. And what's the,

2174
02:09:02,771 --> 02:09:06,370
how would you describe it? Like
sort of like simplistic. Yeah.

2175
02:09:06,371 --> 02:09:10,720
Looking for something to
be naughty. Someone to do
something back. What did he do?

2176
02:09:10,870 --> 02:09:13,330
What did she do? What
are they doing? Well,

2177
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:17,830
we'll tell you right after the break
and you're like, oh, I can't wait. Yeah.

2178
02:09:18,010 --> 02:09:19,840
Uh, but I don't, I mean,

2179
02:09:20,440 --> 02:09:23,630
Louise a hilarious dude and,

2180
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:26,920
and I hope I,
I'm interested to see what happens.

2181
02:09:27,010 --> 02:09:30,700
I think he's going to come out
with a motherfucker over an hour.

2182
02:09:30,790 --> 02:09:34,000
That's what I think. I think he's
going to pee. He's constantly touring.

2183
02:09:34,030 --> 02:09:35,920
He's on the road all the time doing this.

2184
02:09:35,950 --> 02:09:38,890
I know he's not doing it just for money
cause he's only doing these little tiny

2185
02:09:38,891 --> 02:09:41,930
places. It's doing Zane. He's
in Chicago right now or Zane.

2186
02:09:41,931 --> 02:09:42,940
He's in Nashville right now.

2187
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:48,160
He's going to come out with a
motherfucker of a special and resubmit his

2188
02:09:48,161 --> 02:09:48,791
position.

2189
02:09:48,791 --> 02:09:51,670
And I think there's going to be people
that are still mad at him no matter what.

2190
02:09:51,730 --> 02:09:52,540
I don't matter.

2191
02:09:52,540 --> 02:09:55,350
I don't think that you can please most
of the people that are mad at him,

2192
02:09:55,360 --> 02:10:00,100
no meaning and I don't, I just think
it's like they're not reasonable. They,

2193
02:10:00,160 --> 02:10:04,820
it's more fun to not forgive
him. Yeah. It's ideal.

2194
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:08,890
It feels better to not forgive him. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. Fuck him. Yeah. I get it.

2195
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:11,710
I get their perspective,
but for everybody else,

2196
02:10:11,740 --> 02:10:14,710
we're going to get treated to a
monster hour. That's what I think.

2197
02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:17,930
I hope when he's all done, I think it's
probably going to be as best hour, hour.

2198
02:10:17,950 --> 02:10:21,980
I listened to the, the leaked one. Yeah,
it was good. Yeah, it was good. I mean,

2199
02:10:22,090 --> 02:10:24,070
10 months out, man. No, no.

2200
02:10:24,071 --> 02:10:27,010
Comedy it off for 10 months and then
he starts doing it again and there's,

2201
02:10:27,011 --> 02:10:27,550
you know,

2202
02:10:27,550 --> 02:10:30,400
some bits in there that would have
been great if they didn't get leaked.

2203
02:10:30,430 --> 02:10:33,440
The thing about what are you going to do?
Cancel my birthday is so fucking funny.

2204
02:10:33,830 --> 02:10:38,810
It's in, it's like, yeah, he's
so fucking funny. It's bananas.

2205
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:39,051
Yeah.

2206
02:10:39,051 --> 02:10:43,910
Cause my life is over like
you to cancel my birthday.

2207
02:10:44,570 --> 02:10:49,190
Ah. So God damn funny. Um,
yeah. Yeah. Like I, you know,

2208
02:10:49,191 --> 02:10:53,600
he's an, he's a fucking
hilarious dude. Yeah. That's
the front of the line. I mean,

2209
02:10:53,601 --> 02:10:57,120
when it comes to comedy and political
correctness and the pushback,

2210
02:10:57,260 --> 02:11:00,620
that's the front of the line
for the pushback is stand up.

2211
02:11:00,650 --> 02:11:04,550
Let nightclubs stand up.
The stuff that you and I both do,

2212
02:11:04,551 --> 02:11:09,200
we say a bunch of fucked up things that
happen to also be funny and you're doing

2213
02:11:09,201 --> 02:11:11,600
it in front of live cry or I'd
set on safety of the night,

2214
02:11:11,630 --> 02:11:15,080
they're going to a strip club
and complaining about cellulite.

2215
02:11:16,280 --> 02:11:19,230
That's what it feels like. It's
like, what do you, this is,

2216
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:23,930
we say a ton of shit.
Some of it doesn't work.

2217
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:28,160
Somebody doesn't work because it
doesn't cross the, the comedy barrier.

2218
02:11:28,250 --> 02:11:30,590
Some it doesn't work cause
it's ideologically fucked up.

2219
02:11:30,591 --> 02:11:32,780
But you don't know it until
you say it's like, yeah.

2220
02:11:32,930 --> 02:11:37,930
Even the funny many great bits that
you love are fucked up to someone sure.

2221
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:39,840
To someone like,

2222
02:11:39,890 --> 02:11:43,640
or you have to figure out a way to make
them more like Chris Rock's bit about

2223
02:11:43,641 --> 02:11:48,350
this difference between black people in
the end. Yeah. That bit he said bombed.

2224
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:51,100
Oh yeah. A long time before
we figured out how to go.

2225
02:11:51,150 --> 02:11:56,090
Shortly before he did it
on his, on his uh, crazy.

2226
02:11:56,220 --> 02:12:00,410
Um, it's great, but he knew,
he's like, God dammit, there's
something in this. Yeah.

2227
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:02,030
Uh,
and,

2228
02:12:02,090 --> 02:12:06,020
and also it is fucked up.

2229
02:12:06,140 --> 02:12:11,090
It is a fucked up. Like it's fucked
up. You can weaponize that joke. Sure.

2230
02:12:11,091 --> 02:12:15,710
A lot of white people did like a lot
of racist white. But like I told you,

2231
02:12:15,740 --> 02:12:20,450
I've been saying to that in my car
for years. Um, and that exactly,

2232
02:12:20,630 --> 02:12:25,180
but at the same time you can't worry about
that. Like I was talking to uh, some,

2233
02:12:25,190 --> 02:12:26,810
I did a thing on the pockets
where I was saying like,

2234
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:30,650
I don't understand the problem with
Jordan Peterson and you and I have talked

2235
02:12:30,651 --> 02:12:33,680
about this at the, at the
club like, and, and then,

2236
02:12:33,740 --> 02:12:36,110
and people email me and they said,
well,

2237
02:12:36,111 --> 02:12:39,170
people use Jordan people,

2238
02:12:39,171 --> 02:12:41,990
right wing people use him as an example
of Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. I'm like,

2239
02:12:42,140 --> 02:12:46,010
that's not his problem. Right.
That's, and he promotes,

2240
02:12:46,100 --> 02:12:50,450
someone said he promotes an all meat diet.
No he doesn't.

2241
02:12:50,480 --> 02:12:53,240
He said he does it,
but he didn't promote it.

2242
02:12:53,241 --> 02:12:54,740
He didn't make a
commercial about the shit.

2243
02:12:55,280 --> 02:13:00,080
You can't worry about how someone takes,
again,

2244
02:13:00,081 --> 02:13:05,081
this goes to a point is how
someone interprets your art.

2245
02:13:05,750 --> 02:13:08,570
Use Channy interpretation exact.
And also by the way,

2246
02:13:08,571 --> 02:13:12,890
then throw away taxi
driver and uh, and uh, uh,

2247
02:13:12,950 --> 02:13:14,630
the [inaudible] book,

2248
02:13:14,631 --> 02:13:18,770
the Catcher in the rye cause that's
responsible for killing Lennon.

2249
02:13:19,010 --> 02:13:21,770
Shooting Reagan like [inaudible]
just like, okay, well,

2250
02:13:21,800 --> 02:13:26,600
so these fucking dummies use
it as their thing. Right.

2251
02:13:26,601 --> 02:13:30,730
So now I can enjoy it. Like to
fuck go fuck yourself. Yeah.

2252
02:13:30,930 --> 02:13:33,690
There's too many interpretations.
There's too many perspectives.

2253
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:36,930
There's too many people. You just have
to be a reasonable person. Be Nice,

2254
02:13:36,931 --> 02:13:41,610
do your shit, do your best.
And you know, look, we worked
together all the time, man.

2255
02:13:41,611 --> 02:13:45,740
People are laughing. Yes. People
are having a good time. Like, and,

2256
02:13:46,050 --> 02:13:49,440
and it's not, it's also like,
what's your intention? Yeah.

2257
02:13:49,580 --> 02:13:51,900
It's not our intention is to create,
right.

2258
02:13:51,901 --> 02:13:56,190
Our intention is to come up with funny
thing and like me as a person who enjoys

2259
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:57,120
standup,

2260
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:01,230
I like sitting in the back of the
[inaudible] and watching someone kill I

2261
02:14:01,231 --> 02:14:05,040
fucking July. It's the best. I told
somebody that like I'm a gym rat,

2262
02:14:05,041 --> 02:14:09,630
but for comedy club, yeah. Yeah.
I've been seeing you for 27 years.

2263
02:14:09,660 --> 02:14:13,440
Yeah. Just hanging out, like
me and Chappelle were in
Vegas and some kid was like,

2264
02:14:13,441 --> 02:14:17,760
what do you, he was a chef at,
uh, this place yellowtail and,

2265
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:23,070
and he was just saying like, being a chef,
you just fucking have to cook for 12,

2266
02:14:23,130 --> 02:14:26,880
10 years, 10, 12 years, just like
itch hard and shitty. I was like,

2267
02:14:27,150 --> 02:14:29,790
I've known him for 28 years.

2268
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:33,480
He's been going to clubs for 33 years.
Like,

2269
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:37,320
that's the only thing that Matt,
it just makes sense.

2270
02:14:37,710 --> 02:14:42,450
It's fair. It's like it's an
economy that you understand.

2271
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:46,050
If the idea is good enough, the we'll
get this response and there's not,

2272
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:49,140
there's not really politics.
There's not, there's preferences,

2273
02:14:49,141 --> 02:14:52,980
but there's not like, you
know, like, oh, uh, have him,

2274
02:14:53,010 --> 02:14:55,410
although you've got the fact that you
got banned from the store is hilarious.

2275
02:14:56,820 --> 02:15:01,500
That is like from a movie, like we'll
band, we have to ban one of them. Uh,

2276
02:15:01,710 --> 02:15:06,450
but, uh, but, and you won in
the end as it were. But, um,

2277
02:15:07,170 --> 02:15:10,950
but it is a fair thing and
it is like the only people

2278
02:15:12,990 --> 02:15:15,270
as rock says, we're like x
man. Where it's like they,

2279
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:16,800
they're always mad at the x men.

2280
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:22,920
They're always mad at the x man. But
like fucking, he's still like the ECZEMA.

2281
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:26,130
Yeah. You're mad. You're,
you're mad at Louie.

2282
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:30,420
But fuck if he went on stage and you
know, the mother fuckers hilarious. Crazy.

2283
02:15:30,421 --> 02:15:34,110
Yes. If he walked on stage, they would
stand up and give him a standing ovation.

2284
02:15:34,130 --> 02:15:36,390
Yes. And there's also, it's also the,

2285
02:15:36,420 --> 02:15:41,250
it's almost the corporate thing where
it's like, if, if, um, you know,

2286
02:15:41,251 --> 02:15:43,050
Chinese slaves are making phones,

2287
02:15:44,580 --> 02:15:48,780
did they make this one like this part?
Like,

2288
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:50,280
whereas with Louie,

2289
02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:55,310
it's like this one guy is responsible
for all institutional sexism.

2290
02:15:55,970 --> 02:16:00,090
It's like, no, he's not. He's
a fucking, he just was a dumb,

2291
02:16:00,091 --> 02:16:01,890
he just was dumb.
And he handled,

2292
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:06,750
he was dumb from beginning to end
and he talked about it. He will. Yes.

2293
02:16:06,751 --> 02:16:10,180
He was fucked. He just fucked
up and it was stupid. Um,

2294
02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:15,030
but he doesn't have to take the
fall, uh, you know, whatever.

2295
02:16:15,031 --> 02:16:19,350
Like he is valuable. Yeah. He's a
valuable, these valuable to our culture.

2296
02:16:19,351 --> 02:16:20,340
It creates a lot of,

2297
02:16:21,480 --> 02:16:24,810
I don't think of standup this way where
it's like you create joint for people.

2298
02:16:24,811 --> 02:16:26,070
I'm like,
I never think of it that way.

2299
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:30,130
But he did create a lot of
thought and joy and like, yeah,

2300
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:33,310
he's responsible for a
lot of positive shit.

2301
02:16:34,330 --> 02:16:36,350
I mean, that is what
the art form is. Yeah.

2302
02:16:36,360 --> 02:16:39,460
You're literally changing a
person's state and that w I mean,

2303
02:16:39,470 --> 02:16:43,630
as an audience member, I still
love it. And that was, uh,

2304
02:16:43,990 --> 02:16:47,050
that was a struggle for me
early on because I was jealous.

2305
02:16:47,051 --> 02:16:49,690
I could see people doing well and I
wasn't doing well. I was like, God,

2306
02:16:49,691 --> 02:16:53,290
I wish I was doing that. I wish I wrote
that joke. I wish I was doing that show.

2307
02:16:53,291 --> 02:16:58,030
I wish I was. And then I realized like,
oh, this is like totally unproductive.

2308
02:16:58,060 --> 02:17:00,520
Like the opposite of productive.
It's negative.

2309
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:04,210
And so it can be activating in terms
of like, if you turn it into bleed,

2310
02:17:04,211 --> 02:17:08,770
then work harder. Right? Well, but the
problem is like, I wish I did that.

2311
02:17:08,771 --> 02:17:12,670
Like that part of is no good or God, why
is he have to get this? That part of is,

2312
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:16,600
there's no positive to that. But what
is positive? You Watch someone kill go,

2313
02:17:16,601 --> 02:17:20,980
God damn, he's funny. I got to go
to work. Yeah, that's good. But the,

2314
02:17:20,990 --> 02:17:25,420
the hate part is,
is like spat instinct.

2315
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:28,030
It's not, it's counterproductive.
It's really common.

2316
02:17:28,840 --> 02:17:32,440
I think it's then 11 year
old, it's, that's your first.

2317
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:37,190
That's the easy reaction.
I'm like, no, yes, yes. Ah,

2318
02:17:37,220 --> 02:17:40,720
the 11 year old man. And then
it's like, okay, but what am I,

2319
02:17:40,860 --> 02:17:44,730
what's underneath that? What's
underneath that is like respect. I don't,

2320
02:17:44,880 --> 02:17:48,090
and then there's certain people that
it's like, I've never hated Brian Righ.

2321
02:17:48,470 --> 02:17:52,220
Right. Do you know what I mean? Like, and
also like, there's so loves him. Yeah.

2322
02:17:52,230 --> 02:17:55,740
And he's fucking hilarious
in a way that's just like,

2323
02:17:55,800 --> 02:17:59,070
I don't know this fucking dude.
This dude's funny.

2324
02:17:59,170 --> 02:18:01,060
He's so funny and so clean.

2325
02:18:01,090 --> 02:18:05,590
You could take your grandma to see him
and never worry for a second. A gall,

2326
02:18:05,591 --> 02:18:09,610
where's he going with this? Yeah. Grandma
gets said so fuck, I gotta get a drink.

2327
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:10,900
Yeah. He, he's just,

2328
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:15,520
he's one of those rare cats like Gaffigan
that figured out a way to make clean

2329
02:18:15,521 --> 02:18:18,720
just as Sebastian too though.
Yeah. Like Sebastian to the,

2330
02:18:18,721 --> 02:18:21,230
I always forget he's clean
and eight bar gutsy. He's

2331
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:26,190
now like getting into that area where
he's like clean southern accent.

2332
02:18:26,250 --> 02:18:30,600
Like it's a big,
it's like it's a good place to be,

2333
02:18:30,601 --> 02:18:35,070
but he's fucking so funny if you're
naturally inclined to do that. Yeah. Yeah.

2334
02:18:35,430 --> 02:18:40,410
Like if, yeah. If you're forcing
yourself to it. Um, but uh, yeah,

2335
02:18:40,411 --> 02:18:43,950
I think that there's a ton of value in,

2336
02:18:44,610 --> 02:18:48,390
in standup. I mean it's, it
seems so obvious, but it's like,

2337
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:50,040
and I think Netflix must,

2338
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:55,290
there must be some metric
of Netflix where they,

2339
02:18:55,380 --> 02:18:57,780
at a certain point they're
losing a ton of programming,

2340
02:18:57,870 --> 02:18:59,850
meaning all of their shits licensed.

2341
02:19:00,570 --> 02:19:05,250
Disney's taken all their shit back in
like a year or two. A lot of like parents,

2342
02:19:05,251 --> 02:19:08,430
like all of these places are starting
their own apps, so they're going to lose.

2343
02:19:08,460 --> 02:19:12,630
And I think they realize like, oh, a lot
of Netflix is stand up and documentaries.

2344
02:19:13,290 --> 02:19:15,830
And I think that must
be in terms of like pry,

2345
02:19:15,870 --> 02:19:20,870
they can never monetize it in terms of
like if the Ali Wong special begat this

2346
02:19:20,881 --> 02:19:21,540
much money,

2347
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:26,540
but if it costs them 500 grand
to get alley walks for special,

2348
02:19:27,770 --> 02:19:28,310
including

2349
02:19:28,310 --> 02:19:33,080
production, everything, they made a lot
of money. You know what I mean? Like,

2350
02:19:33,270 --> 02:19:37,010
and it's millions of people watched it
and like as well he should because he's

2351
02:19:37,011 --> 02:19:40,010
fucking great.
So like they,

2352
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:45,200
it's just a cool, it's just the
coolest thing I can imagine. I agree.

2353
02:19:45,470 --> 02:19:49,550
Like being a convenience.
The coolest thing though man.
I mean that's, that's the,

2354
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:52,880
the have the appreciation and respect
for something that you enjoy doing.

2355
02:19:52,881 --> 02:19:56,540
That is actually your, your, your,
your, your answer. Occupation. I mean,

2356
02:19:56,541 --> 02:19:57,800
it's a beautiful thing.
We're really,

2357
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:02,570
really fortunate and the
gifts that we get like a low,

2358
02:20:02,610 --> 02:20:07,400
you know what I mean? Like it's all for,
it's all from comedy. Yeah. Glasses,

2359
02:20:07,401 --> 02:20:09,880
shoes, car. Yeah, everything
you're doing. Yeah.

2360
02:20:09,900 --> 02:20:14,280
Basically like every single thing
is from just a personality quirk.

2361
02:20:14,590 --> 02:20:19,460
Yeah. And like creativity, work,
grinding too. I like grinding.

2362
02:20:19,730 --> 02:20:21,650
I really do it when I'm doing three,
four shows a night,

2363
02:20:21,730 --> 02:20:24,890
I get a kick out of it and I'm like,
here we go. This is how things get good.

2364
02:20:24,891 --> 02:20:29,280
Work a joke out. Oh, the best.
That's how they come alive. Yeah.

2365
02:20:29,320 --> 02:20:32,540
I gotta wrap this up then.
Brendan, tell people your podcast.

2366
02:20:32,541 --> 02:20:36,110
How do you feel you go to find a friend,
Bianca,

2367
02:20:36,111 --> 02:20:40,580
and fucking doing it with her? She,
yeah. Very cool. Yeah, it's great.

2368
02:20:40,581 --> 02:20:44,780
We get good chemistry and um, and it's
iTunes everywhere, so go check it out.

2369
02:20:44,810 --> 02:20:48,270
It's just me. It's like this. Except it's
like this. Yeah. It's like this. Yes.

2370
02:20:48,380 --> 02:20:52,580
Except as a higher pitch voice.
Disagree with not much higher.

2371
02:20:52,581 --> 02:20:56,660
And Joe might have pretty, yeah, it's kind
of high. Right. All right. Bye everybody.
