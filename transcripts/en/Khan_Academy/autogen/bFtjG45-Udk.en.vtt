00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600
 . 

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.770
 Now I want to solve a bunch of examples that deal with 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.160
 More two types of multiplying multipliers are typical 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.550
 Which you will see, in algebra 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.640
 The first is quadrilateral bipolar 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.600
 If I have (x + 9) ^ 2, I know your intuition 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.630
 Will this tell you, oh, this is not x ^ 2 + 9 ^ 2? 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.260
 I will say, no, not so 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
 You have to deal with every desire 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.660
 When doing this 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.280
 It is not x ^ 2 + 9 ^ 2 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:40.610
 Remember, x (9) ^ 2 equals (x + 9) 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.630
 × (x + 9) 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.940
 This is a multiplication of the bipolar phrase itself 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.350
 You always need to remember that 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.900
 It is very tempting to think that it is an x ​​^ 2 + 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.760
 9 ^ 2, but no, you have to expand it 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.160
 Now that we have expanded it, we can use some of the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.250
 The skills we learned in the last show to hit 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.370
 To make it clear that we can do this in a way 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.910
 We hit the three-way border once again, let's hit (x +9) 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.760
 × (x + 9) written in purple 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.850
 I use this method until I make it clear to you when 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.880
 Multiply by 9 against this x 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.740
 But let us use it 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.970
 If 9 × 9 = 81 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.800
 Put it in the position of constants 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.630
 9 x x = 9x 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.830
 Then we have - move on to the words x these - our 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.240
 x yellow, if x x 9 = 9 x 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.022
 Put it in the status of the first degree statement 

00:01:38.022 --> 00:01:40.960
 x x x = x ^ 2 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.670
 x ^ 2 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.700
 And then we collect everything 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.520
 You get x ^ 2 + 18x + 81 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.650
 This is equal to x ^ 2 + 18x + 81 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.560
 Now maybe you are seeing a pattern here, and will 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.965
 Explain this pattern quickly 

00:02:02.965 --> 00:02:06.010
 But what happens when you double-edged words? 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.750
 We have x ^ 2 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.190
 We have x these x x, and x x 2 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.920
 We have 9 × 9, which equals 81 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.950
 And then we have this phrase which is 18x 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.910
 How did we get 18x? 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.210
 Well, we've hit x these by 9 so we get 9x, and then 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.510
 We hit 9 b x in order to get another 9x 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.960
 And then we collected the two and we got 18x 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.250
 If in general, when we have a double-edged box - call me 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.890
 Use this method 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.250
 I will use generic terms - suppose we have (a 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.630
 + b) ^ 2 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.340
 (a + b) ^ 2 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.740
 Let me hit it this way again, even 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.630
 Attached in your mind 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:53.250
 This is equal to (a + b) (a + - I will put 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.770
 b green here - 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.440
 If we have b × b = b ^ 2 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.410
 Let's assume that this is hard 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.510
 I'll put b ^ 2 here 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.860
 I suppose this is hard 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.060
 If this will be hard, be 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.660
 Its value is 81 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.640
 a variable abaya - in fact, let me change that 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.040
 To become better 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:21.270
 Let me make it (x + b) ^ 2, and we assume that b 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.750
 Is hard 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:30.890
 X (b) (x + b) 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.700
 Assuming that b is constant, b × b = b ^ 2 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.060
 b × x = bx 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.090
 Then we move to purple x 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.140
 x x b = bx 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.900
 Then x x x = x ^ 2 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.330
 So when we collect everything, we have x ^ 2 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.840
 + 2bx + b ^ 2 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.010
 What you see is, the final winner, what you will get when 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.340
 You have (x + b) ^ 2, is x ^ 2 + 2 × 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.490
 Multiply x and b, + b ^ 2 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.750
 Using this pattern, let's solve more examples 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.910
 More examples 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.709
 I will use the fast way 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.850
 If (3x - 7) ^ 2 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.980
 Let's remember what I told you 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.340
 Not just for remembering, but for you to 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.780
 You know why it makes sense 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.350
 If you want to multiply this, using the distribution property 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.740
 Twice, as you know you will get the same answer 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:44.730
 If this equals 3x ^ 2 + 2 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.990
 × 3x × 7 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.280
 is not it? 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.630
 We know that 2 × is the result of each of these statements 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.700
 + 7 ^ 2 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.200
 If we use the multiplication rules here, 3x ^ 2 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.950
 Equivalent to 9x ^ 2 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.440
 Here, you will get 2 x 3, whatever 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.980
 Equals 6, × 7, equals -42x 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.670
 Then -7 ^ 2 = positive 49 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.930
 That's the quick way 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.600
 And to make sure I did not make a mistake 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.950
 Let me do it in a slow way 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:32.320
 (3x - 7) (3x - 7) 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.940
 -7 × -7 = positive 49 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.310
 -7 × 3x = -21x 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.220
 3x × 7 = -21x 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.280
 3x × 3x = 9x ^ 2 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.060
 We move to the left slightly 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.050
 We collect everything 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:02.060
 Our remaining 9x ^ 2 - 42x + 49 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.050
 If we've got the same answer really 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.580
 Let's solve another issue, and we'll do it in a quick way 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.130
 If we have 8x - 3 - in fact, let me do one solution 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.920
 Contains more variables 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.370
 Suppose we have 4x ^ 2 + y ^ 2, we have that 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.360
 We square them 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.720
 Well, the same idea 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.820
 This is equal to the box for this statement, (4x ^ 2) ^ 2 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.840
 + 2 × Multiplication of each of the two terms, 2 × 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:39.210
 (4x ^ 2 × y ^ 2 + (y ^ 2 ^ 2 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.710
 Any phrase 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.800
 How much is this? 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.430
 This is equal to 16 - correct, 4 ^ 2 = 16 - y 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.320
 (x ^ 2) ^ 2, this equals 2 × 2, if equal 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.730
 x ^ 4 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.330
 Then +, 2 × 4 = 8, this 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.820
 8x ^ 2 y ^ 2 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.300
 And then (y ^ 2) ^ 2, and equal to y ^ 4 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.390
 Now, we are dealing with quadratic words 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.140
 In the following example I want to explain to you that when I take 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.700
 Total multiplier and difference 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.350
 This will be organized 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.160
 I will solve a general example 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:28.160
 Let us solve (a + b) (a - b) 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.400
 If this equals? 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.660
 This equals a × a - Let me put these 

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.260
 In different colors - if a - b, so 

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.900
 If this is equal to a green × this is a purple, a 

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:55.380
 A + or maybe I should say - a green 

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.670
 × b these 

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.560
 I've got this negative from here 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.370
 And then we have these green b, if + 

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.230
 b × a 

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.920
 I hit every phrase with every phrase 

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:17.250
 Then finally - b green - from here 

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.050
 The negative sign was - - b green 

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.370
 Purple 

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.590
 How much is this? 

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.220
 This is equal to a ^ 2, and then 

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.020
 - ab 

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.840
 These can be rewritten as follows + ab, and then we have 

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.039
 - b ^ 2 

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:39.130
 These are deleted, ie ab + ab, and 

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.600
 We have a ^ 2 - b ^ 2 

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.430
 It is already a perfect result 

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.120
 Things really simplify 

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.190
 So let's use that concept to do some beatings 

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:55.470
 If we say (2x - 1) (2x + 1) 

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.710
 Well, this stuff is equivalent 

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:01.810
 The 2x + 1, you can consider, if you wish, a + 

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:06.750
 b, and 2x - 1 you can consider a - b, where 

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.830
 That is a, and that b = 1 

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.440
 This b 

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.010
 This is a 

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.660
 Using this style that we have created now 

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.680
 So how much is this? 

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.820
 It equals a ^ 2, equals 2x ^ 2 

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.490
 - b ^ 2 - 1 ^ 2 

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.790
 2x ^ 2 = 4x ^ 2 

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.180
 1 ^ 2 = 1, if - 1 

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.210
 Becoming 4x ^ 2 - 1 

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.560
 Let us solve another example, that 

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.890
 The idea is clear 

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.590
 Okay 

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.290
 I will focus on the beating process now 

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:52.040
 If I have a 5A-2B, I want to hit this 

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.910
 B 5a + 2b 

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.640
 And remember, this only applies when I have 

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.750
 A multiplication of a sum or difference 

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.410
 Only in this case can I use it 

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.850
 The reason has been explained 

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.320
 If you suspect it, just hit them 

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.880
 This will take you a long time 

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.630
 You will see that the phrases are deleted 

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.070
 You can not do this for any double-edged operation 

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.590
 I saw this at the beginning of the show, when we were 

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.080
 We hit, when we squared them 

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.560
 If this equals, using the style, equals 

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:28.310
 5a ^ 2 - 2b ^ 2, which equals 25a ^ 2 

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.400
 - 4b ^ 2 

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.330
 And, well, I'll leave you here, and I'll see you in 

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.900
 Next view
