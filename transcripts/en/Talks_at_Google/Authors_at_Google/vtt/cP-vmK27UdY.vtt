00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.646
LASZLO BOCK: OK.

00:00:01.646 --> 00:00:03.380
Terrific.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.540
Well, thanks, everybody, for
showing up live, showing up

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.790
on the stream for this
Authors at Google talk.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.582
And I could not be
more excited to be

00:00:11.582 --> 00:00:12.790
introducing our guests today.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.160
So I'll read a little
bit to make sure I

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.060
don't miss the good stuff.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.290
Although, there's so much,
we could spend a whole hour

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.430
on this.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.160
JACK WELCH: We don't
need to do that.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.740
LASZLO BOCK: Just a little.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.050
Just a little.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.270
Some people may not
have heard of you two.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.894
JACK WELCH: OK.

00:00:21.894 --> 00:00:23.899
LASZLO BOCK: So just in case.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:25.940
We're thrilled to host
Jack and Suzy Welch today.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.170
Jack was chairman and
CEO of General Electric

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.410
during a revolutionary
time in its history,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.240
a time when it went
from a great company

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.500
to the greatest company.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.080
And the management practices
that Jack instilled

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.820
and the team he built have
been lauded ever since.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.140
And it's a once in a generation
kind of company, an institution

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.680
that he built and created.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.000
Suzy, an author and journalist,
former editor-in-chief

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.740
of "The Harvard
Business Review,"

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.326
a keen judge of people and
talent, and a fantastic writer.

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:56.950
They've been partners
and collaborators

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.477
for over a decade.

00:00:58.477 --> 00:01:00.560
They're both involved in
the Jack Welch Management

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.450
Institute, which is a
leadership development

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.740
program and an online
MBA program as well.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.281
And they're here to
speak to us today

00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:09.690
about their book, "The
Real Life MBA: Your no

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.490
BS guide to winning the
game, building a team,

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.370
and growing your career."

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.800
And everything that
you talk about in here

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.010
resonates incredibly deeply.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.700
It's a personal
thrill, actually,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.230
to be here because of my
own history, my few minutes

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.230
I spent at GE, unfortunately
after your tenure.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.430
And it's a delight to meet
you in person as well, Suzy.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.370
So as you can see, I had a
lot of comments and questions.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.290
So what we do is
I'd kick things off,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.950
and then we'll open
it up to questions.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.090
We also have an online page
where people online are

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.506
submitting questions,
and somebody

00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:43.150
will come up and tee those up.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.226
JACK WELCH: Great.

00:01:44.226 --> 00:01:46.100
LASZLO BOCK: And I have
the advantage in that

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.350
I've read this cover to cover.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.670
I don't know if everybody in the
room has yet had a chance to.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.730
But just for a context
setting question,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.070
it's been about 20 years
since you've been at GE,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.170
and you two have been partners
in crime for some time.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.340
What have you been up to?

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.910
What have you been doing?

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.030
JACK WELCH: Traveling the world,
selling a message of business.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.550
Business is good.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.060
Winning is good.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.340
When companies win,
good things happen.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.620
You get a cheerful crowd
like this in the room

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.740
because Google wins.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.980
You wouldn't have that
if it was in the tank.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.360
So basically we're out
selling how to make it win

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.420
and why winning is good.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.550
And we're also running 24
private equity companies.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.590
And we started a school,
which now has 900 MBAs.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.920
We've spoken to over a
million and a quarter people.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.790
Excuse my voice.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.430
I've been doing this
for three weeks.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.080
And I'm a burned out guy
now, but I love doing it.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.994
We both love doing it,
and we learn every day

00:02:47.994 --> 00:02:48.910
from different people.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.640
We've been in the Midwest.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.317
We've been across
the East Coast.

00:02:52.317 --> 00:02:54.150
And then we've been in
this beautiful bubble

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.106
called California.

00:02:56.106 --> 00:02:57.480
LASZLO BOCK: Now,
you were saying

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.564
when we were talking before
that what you see here

00:02:59.564 --> 00:03:02.063
in Silicon Valley-- and you've
been to some other companies.

00:03:02.063 --> 00:03:03.160
You've talked to folks.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.269
You were both telling me
it's a little different from

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.810
once you get 50 miles from here,
once you get in the Midwest,

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.893
once you get to the South.

00:03:09.893 --> 00:03:11.273
What are you seeing everywhere?

00:03:11.273 --> 00:03:12.075
How's it different?

00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:13.700
JACK WELCH: Well,
it's a tougher grind.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.730
It's a tougher grind.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.490
Since the 2008 recession, things
have gotten a lot tougher.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.690
And people out there aren't
back to employment levels

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.770
they were at before.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.020
They're not sure that the
company that they signed up for

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.270
is still the same company.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.590
They've lost some benefits.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.490
Some other things
have gone away.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.090
Companies have shrunk down.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.570
The word across most of the
country is do more with less.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.420
That's the slogan.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.209
No matter where you
go, do more with less.

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.250
It's not the slogan here.

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:48.470
SUZY WELCH: This
morning when we were

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.610
getting ready to come here--
we've been here for a few days,

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.080
and obviously we in
our lives had dealings

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.610
with Silicon Valley companies.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.010
And I just was ruminating.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.041
And I said to Jack, it is really
like a different planet here.

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:02.540
We've just been
through the Midwest,

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.210
Kansas City, Minneapolis.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.074
And just the questions
are different,

00:04:06.074 --> 00:04:07.490
and the expressions
are different.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.170
And it's like this
very-- and I'm

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.690
saying this in the most
positive way, because it's

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.440
a beautiful thing.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.000
But it's a very
shiny, happy place

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.750
compared to many other
pockets in the United States.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.710
Where the sense of
possibility here is amazing,

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.190
but we've been in rooms
filled with people

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.680
who have a very different
sense of what the world feels

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.909
like right now.

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:32.825
And wouldn't it be an
amazing, marvelous thing

00:04:32.825 --> 00:04:34.550
if the whole country
was experiencing

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.740
what you're experiencing?

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.410
It's great.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.010
JACK WELCH: The best way to
think about this is Google

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.022
runs a survey every quarter.

00:04:42.022 --> 00:04:42.980
SUZY WELCH: Not Google.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.938
JACK WELCH: Not Google.

00:04:43.938 --> 00:04:45.850
I mean Gallop runs
a-- I'm at Google,

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.360
so I got Google on the brain.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.980
LASZLO BOCK: We do surveys
every quarter, too.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.200
JACK WELCH: Gallop does
a survey every quarter

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.820
on employee
engagement in America.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.660
And in the recession,
it got down to the point

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.020
where 70%, in 2008, of employees
didn't like going to work,

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.220
were not engaged in their job,
didn't like what was going on.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.700
Today, six years later,
seven years later,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.355
it's 65% in the
last quarter that

00:05:16.355 --> 00:05:17.780
are disengaged with their work.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.840
They don't like work.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.710
Work isn't part of their life.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.440
They don't see it as
part of their life.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.740
It's a way to get a check.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.486
And that's a terrible thing.

00:05:27.486 --> 00:05:29.110
And so we're out
trying to change that.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.620
We're out trying to get
people to have this feeling

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.240
of excitement, about growth.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.210
Growth is an elixir.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.250
And what you can do to grow,
how you can grow, how you get

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.230
aligned-- all these things.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.780
We think-- and we've seen
it in private equity.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.770
I've been involved with 74
companies over the last 15

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.680
years, 24 are active now.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.570
And we've changed lives
at these companies,

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.760
because these companies were
orphans in big companies.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.030
They were broken companies.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.330
You don't buy a private equity
company because it's healthy.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.050
You buy a sick company
and try and fix it.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.880
And you spend several
years fixing it,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.620
and then giving it freedom.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.090
But that life is not going
on in many companies.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.140
LASZLO BOCK: But you
started out by saying

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.500
you're about preaching winning.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.206
And you famously are
known for-- at GE,

00:06:17.206 --> 00:06:19.205
you said you have to be
number one or number two

00:06:19.205 --> 00:06:21.690
in an industry,
or get out of it.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.000
You talk about the importance
of growth, of winning.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.520
What you write about here and
what you're hinting at now

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.810
is people just not
enjoying their work,

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.060
about there not being meaning.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.976
And in the book, you
talk about the importance

00:06:31.976 --> 00:06:33.170
of having a mission.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.114
Is a mission the
same as winning?

00:06:35.114 --> 00:06:36.030
Is winning sufficient?

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.571
Or is there something
bigger, better?

00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:38.970
JACK WELCH:
Winning's the product

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.970
of a good mission, and
a good set of behaviors,

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.040
and the consequences
that come from it.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.710
So winning is the result.
It's not a starting point.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.200
Like, for example, we say
the chief characteristic

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.210
of a leader is to be a
chief meaning officer.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.091
Give the work purpose.

00:06:57.091 --> 00:06:59.090
People come to work because
they want a purpose.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.150
They want to have
a reason for being.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.880
They want to be a part of it.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.830
And your job as a
leader is to let people

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.610
know why they're
there, where they're

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.450
going, why they're going there.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.170
And then when
everybody leaves out

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.730
in most places, what's in
it for them to go there?

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.476
And what are the consequences,
pro and con, of doing it right?

00:07:21.476 --> 00:07:23.350
LASZLO BOCK: But how do
you find that meaning

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.683
in the kind of places you've
been to over the last week?

00:07:25.683 --> 00:07:28.020
SUZY WELCH: I'm just think
about these two anecdotes.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.620
I hear your
question, and this is

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.620
a little bit of a roundabout
way of saying this.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.210
For many years
after Jack retired,

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.610
we ran a seminar called
"Two Days with Jack Welch."

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.460
Where 100 CEOs would come
in from around the world,

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.130
and they would work
with Jack for two days.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.770
And when we first did the
planning for this Jack said,

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.850
I'm just going to
spend the first hour

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.680
on just talking about mission.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.250
Because all these
CEOs surely know

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.040
what the mission is
of their company,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.810
and then we'll move
right on to X, Y, and Z.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.310
So the first day starts out,
and Jack looks at this crowd--

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.324
100 CEOs who had self-selected
to come to a group

00:08:02.324 --> 00:08:03.240
to work on management.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.125
So you'd think they'd
be very self-actualized

00:08:05.125 --> 00:08:06.320
and enlightened.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.010
And I was sitting at one
table with a bunch of CEOs,

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.930
so I could hear what
they were saying.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.100
And Jack said, OK, so just
jot down your mission.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.020
And there was this weird,
uncomfortable silence.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.600
And I was actually
sitting at a table

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.390
with two brothers who were
co-CEOs of a family company.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.530
And one brother said to the
other, what's our mission?

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.880
And you're here.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.560
We've been here.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.270
We've been at Google an hour
and a half or something.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.409
I've heard the mission
mentioned repeatedly.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:34.530
We got a demo.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.799
We met people in the hallway.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.640
And the mission is just
flowing all out of you,

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.490
and I actually think you also--

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.079
LASZLO BOCK: Are you
getting sick of it by now?

00:08:40.079 --> 00:08:41.745
SUZY WELCH: No, I
actually dig it a lot.

00:08:41.745 --> 00:08:44.300
I was saying to Jack, too bad
none of our kids are engineers.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.495
They know poetry and whatever.

00:08:46.495 --> 00:08:47.870
Because this is
the kind of place

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.370
a mother would want
her kid to work.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.660
And so because of that mission
and that sense of incredible--

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.670
I think you all know
what you're doing here

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.400
and how your work is
connected to the mission.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.020
And secondly, in
our 10, 12 years

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.040
traveling around
the world, we've

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.130
made the point
over and over again

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.860
that it's imperative
for leaders, no matter

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.100
if you're a leader of 300
people or three people,

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.270
to make sure that your
people know where they stand.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.434
How they're doing, what
they're doing well,

00:09:17.434 --> 00:09:19.600
what they could be doing
better, what the trajectory

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.250
of their career looks like.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:26.670
And when we travel around we
say to crowds, how many of you

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.950
know where you stand?

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:32.620
And it is a very, very good
day when 15% of the crowd

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:33.500
raises their hands.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.970
We were in Chicago
the other day.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.710
600 people we asked
this question.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.960
Four people raised their
hands, knew where they stood.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.360
It was a big business group.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.857
And so they didn't know
the meaning of their work.

00:09:44.857 --> 00:09:47.190
Clearly, if you're not having
a conversation about where

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.065
you stand and what you
could be doing better,

00:09:49.065 --> 00:09:51.360
you don't even know what
the meaning of your work is.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.134
This is why that number is
65% of people disengaged.

00:09:55.134 --> 00:09:56.550
So you should all
pinch yourselves

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.571
because I bet you
know where you stand.

00:09:58.571 --> 00:10:00.820
And we did this yesterday
at a Silicon Valley company,

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.180
and 85% of the hands went up.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.730
JACK WELCH: No,
it was about 60%.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:04.490
SUZY WELCH: But it
was still better

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.230
than any place we've been.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.430
JACK WELCH: Any place we've
been Do you want to try it here?

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.555
LASZLO BOCK: Oh no, no, no.

00:10:08.555 --> 00:10:09.660
I'm terrified.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.140
Do not.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:12.939
We can try it.

00:10:12.939 --> 00:10:13.980
SUZY WELCH: Let's try it.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.021
LASZLO BOCK: Let's do it.

00:10:15.021 --> 00:10:17.810
JACK WELCH: How many people
here know what their boss thinks

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.670
of them, they know
exactly where they stand,

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.410
and what their
career trajectory is?

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.370
LASZLO BOCK: Come on.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:25.500
Thank god.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:25.810
Thank god.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:26.643
SUZY WELCH: You win.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.350
JACK WELCH: Well, I'd say 60%.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.590
SUZY WELCH: No, no.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:31.880
I think a little
bit higher, Jack.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.490
Let's do it again.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:32.870
Let's do it again.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.328
LASZLO BOCK: Looks
like 110% to me.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.950
It was not 100%.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.450
There was like four
people in there.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.440
Kevin, I'm looking at you.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.494
SUZY WELCH: Taking names.

00:10:43.494 --> 00:10:44.910
LASZLO BOCK: No,
but it's actually

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.710
something we're not
always great at,

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:52.600
because we love-- we focus
on hiring great people.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.640
And then we try to give
them a lot of freedom.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.750
And we try to get
managers great.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.791
But it's a hard thing even
for us to get managers

00:10:57.791 --> 00:10:59.160
to have those tough messages.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.090
And later in the book,
you talk about this.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.780
You have a section-- I'm going
to skip ahead-- where you talk

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.640
about a woman named Lauren.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.010
Lauren is a financial analyst.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.190
She's 34.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.830
She'd heard whispers that she
might be made a partner as part

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.510
of a management transition.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.610
And you go on.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.260
But suddenly the
whispers stopped,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.130
and Lauren was
informed by a colleague

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.970
that her boss was the reason.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.820
And you continue on.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.547
And eventually
Lauren was asked--

00:11:22.547 --> 00:11:24.130
we asked Lauren--
you two asked Lauren

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.890
if her boss felt the same way
about her value to the firm

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.800
as she felt about her
value to the firm.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.360
And she said, he
just doesn't want

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.984
me to be a partner
because I'm a woman.

00:11:31.984 --> 00:11:35.030
He got pissed off when I went
to part time after my baby.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.030
And you write,
was that the case?

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.480
It's possible.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.580
But here's the story.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.150
Lauren was guessing.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.670
When we pressed
her, she admitted

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.940
she had no clue
how her boss really

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.530
felt about her performance
long before her baby

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.690
or after, because
he'd never told her.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.060
And so that makes me wonder.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.650
And it's great that we
actually weren't quite at 100%.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.972
Whose job is it to make
sure the employee knows

00:11:58.972 --> 00:11:59.680
where they stand?

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.120
Is it the boss's job?

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.230
Is it the employee's job?

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.405
Is it shared 50-50?

00:12:03.405 --> 00:12:05.280
JACK WELCH: No, I think
it's without question

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.110
the boss's job, but the
employee has a responsibility,

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.590
if they've got a bad boss,
to press on about it.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.740
And we talk about
career purgatories,

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.330
about working for
a boss that doesn't

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.350
have your interests at heart.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.050
That happens in
every good company.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:20.680
It'll happen.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.240
You'll get a bad boss.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.480
We talk about bosses that
don't have the generosity gene.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.510
That aren't generous
about their praise,

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.150
generous about their rewards,
steal ideas and take them up

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.140
as their own-- all those things.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.660
So you've got to put
timetables on those situations.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.750
But it really is the boss's job.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.590
We have a daughter.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.580
You might tell this
story, this one story.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.640
SUZY WELCH: So one of our
daughters works in LA.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.340
And she's in the
entertainment business

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.270
where she was very
happy to get a job.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.860
So she's working
away, and you can

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.340
imagine having your career
managed from afar by us, right?

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.010
So she actually
is working in LA,

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.300
and she doesn't know
how she's doing.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.180
She's working very,
very hard, but her sense

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.290
of her performance rises and
falls on her boss's mood, OK?

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.040
So he's in a good mood,
she's doing great.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.540
JACK WELCH: And we
get a phone call.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.372
If the boss grunts,
we get a phone call.

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:11.080
SUZY WELCH: The phone
calls and the texts

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.380
are related to his mood.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:17.270
So then one day, she
gets a raise in the mail,

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.010
in her paycheck.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.750
And she calls us, and
she's ecstatic, second

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.750
only to us being ecstatic,
that she got a raise.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.560
And she said, I got a raise.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.143
I got a raise.

00:13:24.143 --> 00:13:25.980
We said, well, why
did you get the raise?

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.820
And she doesn't
have any idea why.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.060
So because she's related
to us, we said to her,

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.310
you have to go in and find
out why you got this raise.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.670
No, no.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.650
I don't want to piss him off.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:35.899
We said, you've got to find
out why you got the raise.

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:38.030
So finally under
extreme pressure,

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.480
she went in, into his office.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.449
We can only imagine it was
like, hi, sorry to bother you.

00:13:42.449 --> 00:13:43.740
And so she said, I got a raise.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.080
I'm really happy.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.650
Can you tell me why?

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:52.153
And he looked at her,
and said to her, merit.

00:13:52.153 --> 00:13:52.860
Period.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:53.410
That's it.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:54.960
JACK WELCH: And what
do you do with that?

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.460
SUZY WELCH: And she
ran out the door.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.060
She was so happy to get
an answer and call us

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:57.893
and say, guess what?

00:13:57.893 --> 00:13:59.566
I got a raise as a merit!

00:13:59.566 --> 00:14:01.540
And she still doesn't
know what it was.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.600
Now, since then,
she's been promoted.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.450
So clearly they're happy
with her performance.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.220
But right now all she knows
about what she does well

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.534
is "merit."

00:14:10.534 --> 00:14:11.950
LASZLO BOCK: So
what's your advice

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.210
then to somebody who's got a
bad boss, who's not telling you

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:15.900
where you stand.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.510
Just that you're
fine, you're fine.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.590
Your bonus is kind of OK.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:19.090
It's great.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.980
Maybe it goes up a little
each year, whatever.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.190
Do you confront the boss?

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:24.990
Do you push for an answer?

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.455
What's your advice?

00:14:25.455 --> 00:14:27.205
JACK WELCH: No, I think
the way you go is,

00:14:27.205 --> 00:14:31.730
I'd like to talk to you about
how you feel about my work.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:32.590
How do you feel?

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.020
What do you think
I'm doing well?

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.740
And how do you
think I can improve?

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.380
How can I really improve?

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.690
Because I want to do
a better job here.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:44.250
And you don't ever
confront them head on.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.790
You go with what
can I do better?

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:46.540
LASZLO BOCK: Wait.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.040
Why don't you
confront them head on?

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.232
Why don't you just say,
what's going on with me?

00:14:50.232 --> 00:14:52.190
JACK WELCH: Well, you
can say, what's going on?

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.420
But you've got to ask
them, what can I do better?

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.060
Don't go in and start
challenging them.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.130
It doesn't make sense.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:57.920
It's suicide.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.552
LASZLO BOCK: Yeah.

00:15:00.552 --> 00:15:02.260
JACK WELCH: But come
at it the other way.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.410
How can I do better?

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.840
And what do you think I
have to do to move on?

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.000
What do you think would
be the criteria that

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.140
would get me the next level?

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:12.890
LASZLO BOCK: Yeah.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.090
Well, the two of you, you
talk about later in the book

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:16.320
when you're into
the personal advice.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.239
You have a section called
"Why Careers Stall,"

00:15:18.239 --> 00:15:19.280
which is related to this.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.381
Because often your career
stalls, probably you also often

00:15:22.381 --> 00:15:23.380
aren't getting feedback.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.890
And you're trying
to figure it out.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.900
And you talk about careers
stalling for a few reasons.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.520
You've got a blocker above you.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.830
You can't grow.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.430
You talk about how
to resolve that.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.510
You talk about
wrongheaded notions

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.970
about the importance of
multifunctional expertise.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:43.380
You talk about boss haters,
and you talk about purgatory.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.855
It's like Dante's "Inferno"
of career management here.

00:15:45.855 --> 00:15:46.760
It's awful.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.810
So can you talk a little bit
about-- if you feel stuck,

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:52.775
what is a blocker?

00:15:52.775 --> 00:15:55.400
What does that look like-- ahead
of you, above you, around you?

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.570
And how we can step
through each of these.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:57.944
JACK WELCH: A
blocker is somebody

00:15:57.944 --> 00:16:03.190
who's enjoying your great work,
and is very happy to keep you

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.270
in the draw to keep
getting all that good work,

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.330
so that they look very good.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.030
That could be one
case of a blocker.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.310
Another case of blocker is--
and these Midwestern companies

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.750
we were talking about
is-- there's no growth.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.180
The boss is going nowhere.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.490
That doesn't happen here.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.899
There's plenty of growth
creating opportunities

00:16:20.899 --> 00:16:21.440
all the time.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.250
But in many companies,
most of the world right now

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.650
with a GDP of 0.8%
growth doesn't

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.390
have all these jobs opening up.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.130
So you're stuck there
in a no-growth situation

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.530
with a good boss maybe.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.000
But what you have to do
in all these situations

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.650
is control your own destiny.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.850
You've got to put
a timeframe on it.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.600
I'll stick it out here for
two years, or one year,

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.230
whatever you decide.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.070
Pick a time frame
and I'll overdeliver.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.570
I'll give them more than
they have ever seen before.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:56.120
And if nothing happens, I've got
to take my wares and move on.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.140
LASZLO BOCK: Why do you
think-- when you say it,

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.410
that's fantastic advice.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:01.820
Most people don't do that.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.720
Why not?

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.530
JACK WELCH: Insecurity,
lack of self-confidence,

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.280
comfortable where they are.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.300
Or maybe family situations--
kids, can't move,

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.730
they're in high school,
college, whatever.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:20.920
SUZY WELCH: Momentum,
inertia, humanity,

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.280
and the fear of the unknown.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.656
And I think also
sometimes people

00:17:23.656 --> 00:17:25.113
don't do anything
because they have

00:17:25.113 --> 00:17:27.810
this little nagging voice inside
saying maybe the problem is me.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.710
And it's just much easier not
to look at that piece of it,

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:33.594
and so they'd rather
just bump along.

00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:35.260
JACK WELCH: I used
to go to Crotonville,

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
which is our education place.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.280
And I would teach every class.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.090
And I would spend three
hours in the class Q&amp;A.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.910
And then I'd spent
three hours at the bar,

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.030
and I'd learn more
at the bar than I

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.780
did in the teaching program.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.560
But basically what I
would always leave them

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:56.790
with-- always-- love being
here, love being at GE,

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.880
but be ready to leave.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:04.840
So that put the pressure
on the leadership.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.330
If the leadership wasn't
taking care of you,

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:10.440
and we started seeing
good people leaving

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.050
in a certain area-- and it
didn't happen very often

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.210
in those days.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:15.650
It didn't happen very often.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.770
But if it did, we knew
we had a bad boss.

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:21.027
Just like if you have
a plant, a factory--

00:18:21.027 --> 00:18:22.110
we had a lot of factories.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.500
And when a union showed up,
and a union took a vote,

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.650
and they got a
positive vote-- now,

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.420
we never formed a union in
the 21 years I was there.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.920
But whenever it
came up for a vote,

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.150
we knew we had a
jackass plant manager.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.110
Because otherwise it
wouldn't get there.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:44.240
If you had the right
atmosphere, the right feelings

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.290
in the place, a transparency--
we want transparency.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.850
Transparency is
the biggest virtue

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.880
you can have in a company.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.300
And if you have a
transparent spot,

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.980
you won't have unions forming.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.090
People will think they
have voice anyway.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.410
They will have voice.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.790
They only form a
union to get voice,

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:04.332
because nobody's
listening otherwise.

00:19:04.332 --> 00:19:06.331
LASZLO BOCK: So when you
have these situations--

00:19:06.331 --> 00:19:08.210
and I want to circle
back to the career side,

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:13.120
but you've both seen
a ton of companies.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.760
And every time in the book
you talk about a leadership

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.760
transition, you talk
about firing people.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.210
And this isn't the stack
rank 70/20/10 stuff.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:25.530
You talk about Eric
Fyrwald at Nalco.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.830
And he goes in, and he moved on.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.430
You say many top
leaders had to be

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.080
asked to move on-- more
than half of the top 100

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.412
So new CEO, 50% or more
of the people gone.

00:19:35.412 --> 00:19:37.370
And then you say a
personnel move speaks louder

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:38.500
than 100 speeches.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.705
And there's a few other
parts of the book where

00:19:39.705 --> 00:19:41.520
you talk about the
importance of when

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.690
you come in as a leader firing
some of the people under you.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.190
Is that just good hygiene?

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.460
JACK WELCH: We're talking
there about private equity.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.460
LASZLO BOCK: OK.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.834
JACK WELCH: So in
private equity,

00:19:51.834 --> 00:19:54.580
the reason why you
buy a company is

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.250
it's an orphan,
usually, in a company.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.747
It's a division
that isn't liked.

00:19:59.747 --> 00:20:02.330
I'm not sure at Google there are
some, but I'll bet there are.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.820
A division that's
the turkey over here.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.270
It gets less attention
from the top people.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.270
It doesn't get loved.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:13.160
It doesn't get enough
resources compared to others.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.840
There are those
in most companies.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.200
So you buy these companies
because the company

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.560
wants to trim down, particularly
with activists out there now.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.795
Companies are selling
off divisions,

00:20:23.795 --> 00:20:24.795
and you grab a division.

00:20:24.795 --> 00:20:28.500
Well, those people haven't
been looked at for 10 years.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.110
They've been sitting
over there, not growing,

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.930
not performing, but not
being told anything.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:38.670
So you bring them in, and
you've got to get a fresh eye,

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.110
look at the situation.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.470
So we're talking
mainly about companies

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:46.495
you're acquiring that have been
dead on their feet for years.

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:48.120
SUZY WELCH: And I
think a lot of times,

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.690
and especially in
those stories, when

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:54.340
you want your company to
be productive, and fast,

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:57.970
and creative, and innovative,
and all those things,

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.280
people pretty much need
to share the values.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:05.880
And the values have to
be things like teamwork,

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.720
and like maybe you have
here, fast failure.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.470
You have values that you
want people to demonstrate.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.605
And so when there are these
leadership transitions,

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.480
if a leader comes in
and says, you know what?

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.600
I am installing these values,
the values of urgency,

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.800
and speed, and boundarylessness.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.360
And you have people
who-- there's

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.670
a great story in
the book, I think,

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.970
when Dave Calhoun
came into Nielsen.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.166
And he knew that this
was a silo company where

00:21:30.166 --> 00:21:31.290
nobody spoke to each other.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.130
And he knew that if it was
going to survive and be

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:34.546
the company he
wanted it to be, he

00:21:34.546 --> 00:21:37.040
needed people who
wanted to share ideas.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.360
And he tried and tried
to get that value across.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:45.320
But when he found managers that
just would not share ideas,

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.590
he had to ask them to move on.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.390
So it's a lot about values.

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:49.837
You guys talk
about values a lot,

00:21:49.837 --> 00:21:51.670
so this should sound
pretty familiar, right?

00:21:54.907 --> 00:21:56.990
LASZLO BOCK: Imagine a
company that's going great,

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:58.870
and you have a leadership
change at whatever level, right?

00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:59.828
Doesn't have to be CEO.

00:21:59.828 --> 00:22:01.424
Could be division,
what have you.

00:22:01.424 --> 00:22:02.840
What are the odds
that they're not

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.890
going to have to fire anybody
from the direct reports?

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:08.790
JACK WELCH: We bought
two medical companies

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:14.120
in high growth industries
that were underfunded,

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.060
and we didn't touch a person.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:20.250
And we've had 6x returns
with just pouring money

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.440
at them, giving them
the resources to grow.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.860
They were flourishing.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.880
Now, you rarely find
those birds, OK?

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.740
Whenever you find a
blue bird like that,

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.530
you go home and
rub, rub your hands.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:31.720
Life is easy.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.860
It's all good.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.965
And you take it public, and
in two years and make 6x.

00:22:36.965 --> 00:22:38.710
LASZLO BOCK: And you
look like a genius.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.030
JACK WELCH: An absolute genius.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:43.250
All you did was give
good people money.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:44.750
LASZLO BOCK: That's
a good strategy.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.327
SUZY WELCH: Yeah.

00:22:46.327 --> 00:22:48.410
JACK WELCH: The thing you
have in your book, which

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:51.855
I like so much, and I've
never seen it written out.

00:22:51.855 --> 00:22:53.480
I write it all the
time, but I've never

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.370
seen, other than
you and I, this idea

00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:01.320
of paying great people lots.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.420
Paying great people.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:08.510
We have a story in
here of getting whacked

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.890
and recovering from a whack.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:15.030
And what we talk about
there is the 2008 Recession.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:16.160
We were so brilliant.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.350
We bought this company
called Home Depot Supply.

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.050
And Home Depot Supply
sold lots of goods

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.460
to the construction industry.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:28.010
In 2007, it was booming.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.440
Housing booming,
everything booming.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.120
And it was doing $12
billion in revenues.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:40.280
In 2008, four quarters later,
it was doing $7 billion.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.880
It collapsed on itself.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.140
And so our smart
decision to buy it

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.490
couldn't have been worst timing.

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:50.630
Could not have
been worse timing.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:54.852
We get it, and this guy Joe
D'Angelo brings his team.

00:23:54.852 --> 00:23:56.310
He'd been hiring
them for sometime,

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:59.640
a bunch of people he
worked with before.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.400
His first act was not let's
cut 10% across the board.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.850
We've got to save money.

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:11.610
No, his first thing was pay
the aces tons of equity,

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:13.060
tons of equity.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.930
I've got to keep the stars.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.490
If I'm going to get out of
this whack, where he's probably

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.780
going bankrupt, the first
thing I've got to do

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.880
is make the stars know we're
all swimming in the same tank

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.750
together.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.870
And I'm giving
you lots of money.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:27.890
Well, to make that
a long story short,

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.620
he did lots of other things
to get out of that whack.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.330
And we talk about
getting out of a whack.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:34.690
We'll all have whacks
business-wise, personal,

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.000
you'll get hit, and
how you get out of it.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.530
Well, this is a
story of this guy

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.750
taking the absolute
non-traditional way

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:43.910
of doing it.

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:47.950
He went at give me
the aces in the game,

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.840
and I'll give them
all the money.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.460
Well, they just went public
about six months ago.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.610
The top team-- now,
this isn't big money

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.740
by Silicon Valley
standards, but the top guys

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.530
got over $100 million.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.234
LASZLO BOCK: That's
big money even here.

00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:03.150
JACK WELCH: Even here?

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.170
LASZLO BOCK: Let me
correct you, yeah.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:06.200
That counts.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.670
JACK WELCH: No, and
the mid-level guys all

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.760
got $20 to $40 million.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.310
LASZLO BOCK: That's
also big money.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.160
JACK WELCH: But it was fabulous.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.580
But they hung in there
through six years

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.190
of fighting that mess.

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:22.000
But he did the opposite of
what you traditionally see.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.220
Nothing's worse than
anything across the board--

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:30.250
across the board raises,
across the board cuts--

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.910
they're all sinful
things to do in business.

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:34.020
They're just cowards.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.780
LASZLO BOCK: Well, we were
talking about this a little

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.280
beforehand.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.970
So you find your aces.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.590
You give them the big equity.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.810
The middle people,
they kind of get it.

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:43.790
They're worker bees.

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:44.310
The people at the bottom--

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.590
JACK WELCH: But they
get some equity.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:46.690
LASZLO BOCK: OK,
they get equity, too.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.148
What do you do
about the layer just

00:25:48.148 --> 00:25:51.270
below the ones who
get the giant awards?

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.270
JACK WELCH: That's the
toughest layer to manage.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:26:00.100
I We started out with a
system, Bill Conaty and I,

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.512
of going 10, 15, 50, 15, 10.

00:26:03.512 --> 00:26:05.470
LASZLO BOCK: And Bill
Conaty was your head of--

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:06.620
JACK WELCH: Head of HR.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.410
And we were partners in this.

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.240
We [? lived ?] people
the whole time.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.990
That was our whole job in GE.

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.990
We didn't spend a lot
of time on other stuff.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:20.440
And the trouble
always came in trying

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.520
to make these
careful slices of 10

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.480
between the top 10
and the next 15.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.520
We're all humans.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.190
We're making these
cuts, and we're not

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:34.320
really that good at making them,
so we piss off the next group.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:39.060
So we cut that down to top
20, middle 70, bottom 10

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:43.520
to try and get a distribution
that looked like this.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.730
And the biggest
problem you have is

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:50.150
taking good people in the
middle and telling them

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.130
they're in the middle.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.930
That by far is the hardest job.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:58.730
And so I always erred on pushing
them to the top of the middle

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.840
and getting them as close
as you could to the top.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.550
LASZLO BOCK: And
they're happy with that?

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:05.080
They live happily ever
after, or they were just

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.040
slightly less unhappy?

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.610
JACK WELCH: You've got to
understand that these ratings

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:10.680
are a period in time.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.980
They're not a lifetime sentence.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.690
I'm in the top 5%.

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:18.832
Am I there forever?

00:27:18.832 --> 00:27:20.540
No, if you stink,
you'd get out of there.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.340
And if you're in the
next group, you guys

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.080
have 5, 20, or whatever.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.502
You've got that five tier thing.

00:27:28.502 --> 00:27:33.650
And people that can move by
performance-- the thing we've

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:37.140
got to get clear though
on performance-- even you

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.860
in your letter had a
little misunderstanding

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.270
of what our thing was.

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:45.190
When you're looking at
valuing where people are,

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.880
there are two axes.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:53.990
On one axis is behaviors, the
values of the company-- speed,

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:56.220
boundaryless
behavior, et cetera.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:00.770
Now, you do that, a separate
evaluation of these things.

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:03.140
And you put a half
circle or a full circle,

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.710
because you can't put a
numerical number to those.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.290
You fill in a circle.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.160
If they're fully
qualified in that area,

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.030
they get a full circle,
half circle, quarter circle,

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:12.760
whatever.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.301
And then you come
up with a judgment.

00:28:14.301 --> 00:28:20.060
This is how this employee
adheres to the behaviors

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.810
we need to win.

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.640
Because it's where we're going.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.480
That's the mission.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.100
How we're going to get there,
or the behaviors, and then

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.480
the consequences.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.010
And then on the
bottom axis you've

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:35.270
got numerical performance.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:38.770
Whether it's sales quotas,
R&amp;D, new products--

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:42.150
whatever you pick as the
financial measurements.

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:46.470
Then you draw four
quadrants of people.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:51.331
And it's low to high
on each axis, OK?

00:28:51.331 --> 00:28:53.580
Low to high-- I wish we had
a little whiteboard here--

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.790
but low to high.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:29:02.490
In the top right, you've got
high values, high behaviors,

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.370
and high performance.

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:06.320
That's easy, onward and upward.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.750
On the bottom left
quadrant, you've

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:14.280
got low behaviors
and low numbers.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.740
That's easy, too.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.920
Give them some time to either
fix it, or they move on.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:26.620
Then the third type over
here on the upper left.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:31.300
You've got low performance but
high behaviors-- very good.

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.260
They're on your team.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.310
They believe in
everything you believe in.

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:38.040
You give them a second,
third, fourth chance.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.770
Because when you
get somebody who

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:43.130
buys into the whole system,
the mission, if you will,

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:47.880
the mission of Google, the
mission of company X, Y, or Z.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.630
You want that person.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:53.140
But it's the fourth
quadrant out to the right

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.540
that kills companies.

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.010
And I'm sure you've
seen them here,

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:58.470
and you've see them everywhere.

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:02.310
The high performer
who's a horse's ass.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:05.780
And every time you
tolerate that person--

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.540
and you talk about your
values and behaviors.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:13.080
And you've got some jerk who's
kissing up and kicking down

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:17.260
while getting good numbers,
you keep tolerating him.

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.860
And you give speeches on
values, and mission, and beauty,

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.090
and peace, and everything else.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:27.240
But you've got this person.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.890
Every promotion of
that person, every time

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:34.980
that person gets promoted, you
ruin 50 speeches, 500 speeches.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.130
Stop flapping your lips.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.740
Don't talk about it.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.040
So that person with
high performing numbers

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:46.540
and lousy values is
a killer of culture.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.429
It's a killer of culture.

00:30:49.429 --> 00:30:50.970
LASZLO BOCK: You
talk about, I think,

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:52.094
this is a category of that.

00:30:52.094 --> 00:30:53.499
You talk about boss haters.

00:30:53.499 --> 00:30:55.540
Like when you talk about
why careers get stalled,

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:59.250
to come back to that, some of
it is you've got a blocker.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.430
The other category was
you've spread too wide,

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.180
which if we have time,
we'll come back to.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.730
But talking about low values,
you talk about boss haters,

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:07.110
and how they don't know
they're boss haters,

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:08.129
or they don't admit it.

00:31:08.129 --> 00:31:09.670
But they're toxic,
they're poisonous.

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:10.230
JACK WELCH: I'm
going to come back

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:12.370
to that, because I want to stay
in this other thing a minute

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:12.900
more.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:13.130
LASZLO BOCK: Please.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:14.671
JACK WELCH: Because
you talked about,

00:31:14.671 --> 00:31:17.410
it in your book, Microsoft,
and you talked about Yahoo.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:23.120
And you talked about rank
and yank, that terrible word.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.990
It was destroying
those companies.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:27.650
You talked to, you
interviewed people, et cetera.

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:33.100
That facts are you couldn't
be in the top performing group

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.870
if you didn't have teamwork.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:36.650
Because you're in
the wrong place.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.970
They're looking at numbers.

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:41.870
Enron was all numbers, OK?

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:46.830
That's a misapplication
of a theory of the case.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:49.270
You're an important guy to
carry this message long term.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.510
That's why I'm pitching you.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:54.380
No, it's very real.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:32:00.880
You can't be a bad team player
or a bad behaving person

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.190
and be in the top 10.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:04.820
LASZLO BOCK: So
let's dig into that.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:07.475
So I agree, but let's
explore for the folks who

00:32:07.475 --> 00:32:09.392
are watching and listening.

00:32:09.392 --> 00:32:11.600
So somebody who has great
numbers, great salespeople,

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.470
brilliant engineer,
total jerk, horse's ass.

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:16.860
You can see that.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:20.700
What about the people where
they're not at both extremes?

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.390
Great numbers, but
they're a jerk sometimes.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:25.640
They kick down sometimes.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.890
They're kind of political.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:28.425
Where do you draw the line?

00:32:28.425 --> 00:32:29.300
Where would you call?

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.300
How much of that kind of
behavior is acceptable?

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.890
Is any of it, or is none of it?

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:35.690
JACK WELCH: You can
tell-- do people

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.590
want to hang out with them?

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:39.900
Do they have a place
where people want to work?

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.480
Are they attracting people?

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.830
Or are people dodging them?

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.600
LASZLO BOCK: Well, that's
one thing we've seen here.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.552
Because we do surveys.

00:32:46.552 --> 00:32:47.260
We love our data.

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.530
We do surveys about what do
you think of your manager

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:50.238
every six months?

00:32:50.238 --> 00:32:51.620
And one of things
that happens is

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.600
we see people who are
kind of brutal, really

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.760
rough, tough managers.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.120
And what ends up happening
is the teams end up

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.677
giving them positive scores.

00:32:59.677 --> 00:33:01.260
Because they say,
well, you know what?

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.300
I don't like working
for this person,

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.772
but I know where I stand.

00:33:03.772 --> 00:33:04.480
Or you know what?

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.060
I've learned more than
I've ever learned.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.010
Yeah, I get beat
up once in awhile,

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:09.218
but I'm learning so much
because this person's direct

00:33:09.218 --> 00:33:10.171
and in my face.

00:33:10.171 --> 00:33:12.420
And what's interesting is
when those people move jobs,

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.910
the leaders move jobs,
no one follows them.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:17.600
And the team kind of
goes-- [SIGH OF RELIEF]

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.126
But every measurement
we have along the way,

00:33:20.126 --> 00:33:21.250
you look at it objectively.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:22.070
And people go like, oh yeah.

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.903
You know, it's fine.

00:33:22.903 --> 00:33:24.117
I can deal with it.

00:33:24.117 --> 00:33:26.200
Is this like having a bad
boyfriend or girlfriend?

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.550
You just can't break up?

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:29.510
What's the secret?

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.334
JACK WELCH: No, you're
going to have some--

00:33:31.334 --> 00:33:33.250
LASZLO BOCK: And how do
you find those people?

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.500
JACK WELCH: Look,
you're going to look

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.605
till the last day you
breathe, and you're not

00:33:36.605 --> 00:33:39.150
going to get them all.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.200
You can get faked out
on this all the time.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.010
Nobody has a perfect system.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.280
The question is what's
a better system?

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.720
It's always going to be that.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.810
Because you can always
argue against the perfect,

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:53.390
but no system is perfect.

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.950
But you've got to be
able to evaluate people

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:58.630
on two axes, not one.

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.810
And now you may
not get it right.

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:03.870
You may not be
perfect, but you'll

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.620
be better than any
other system out there.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.953
LASZLO BOCK: I think you're
right about the second axis.

00:34:07.953 --> 00:34:09.080
I think we need that.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.013
We absolutely do.

00:34:11.013 --> 00:34:12.929
I have one question I
want to say for the end,

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:14.280
but I want to open
it up for questions

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.719
either that are
submitted online,

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:17.513
or if anyone in the
room has questions.

00:34:17.513 --> 00:34:19.929
Actually, I have a whole bunch
of questions, but if anyone

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:21.261
wants to start migrating.

00:34:21.261 --> 00:34:22.719
Do you want to just
run to the mic,

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:24.135
so we can get a
recording of that?

00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:26.870
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:29.480
Thanks again for
coming to Google.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.750
One of the challenges
that any large company has

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:35.114
is remote office workers
in developing their talent.

00:34:35.114 --> 00:34:37.030
What are some the best
strategies you've seen?

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:39.113
I know you developed talent
in your remote offices

00:34:39.113 --> 00:34:40.000
when you were at GE.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.500
What are some of
the best strategies

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.290
you've seen for owning your
own career as a remote office

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:45.659
worker?

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:48.230
JACK WELCH: Well, I'll try
a couple, and you try some.

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:51.960
We have an online
school, all remote.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.440
And the biggest
challenge is how do you

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.190
socialize that office to believe
they belong to the mothership?

00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:59.490
It's a huge deal.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.170
You've got to make
all kinds of efforts.

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:06.210
What we do is we have pivot
points on the computer screen.

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:09.530
We know how many
contacts the dean

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:11.990
has with every faculty
member per week.

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:15.160
We know how many
contacts every dean has,

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.740
every faculty member
has with every student.

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.400
An online school is the
toughest thing in the world.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.260
People are working all day, go
home and do the work at night.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.597
They got a sick kid.

00:35:24.597 --> 00:35:26.180
The worst thing can
happen and they'll

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.110
have to stay up all
night and do a paper,

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:31.360
turn it in, get back, nice job.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.300
Killer.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.870
So they've got to
have that strength.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:38.720
So we monitor totally
the socialization aspects

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:43.970
of faculty with the student,
the dean with the faculty.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:45.190
We've got to bring them in.

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:48.930
And we talk about
subcontractors-- same thing.

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:51.960
Subcontractor has seven clients.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.190
How do I make the
subcontractor like me

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:57.220
more so I get his
heart and soul?

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.720
Well, here, you feed him.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.800
You do all kinds
of things, but you

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.510
want to get that subcontractor
with more allegiance to you

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:10.640
than to the other
six clients he has.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.710
So you're always working
on socialization.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:15.610
You're always bringing him into
the core as much as you can.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.800
You're measuring how
many contacts you have.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:21.220
You're doing all these
things to be sure that nobody

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.830
feels they're out on an island.

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:26.200
SUZY WELCH: I think
the main thing

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.770
is that if you don't actively
manage people who are working

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:34.030
remotely or virtually, if
you don't actively manage it

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:38.130
and you let it manage
itself, it falls apart.

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:41.629
And so managers often can feel--
I felt that way myself when

00:36:41.629 --> 00:36:42.920
I was the editor of a magazine.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.179
I had a lot of people
not working in the office

00:36:45.179 --> 00:36:46.720
because editing can
be done anywhere.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.616
And so a lot of people
were in life stages

00:36:48.616 --> 00:36:50.490
where they wanted and
needed to work at home.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:51.656
I worked with a lot of moms.

00:36:51.656 --> 00:36:54.250
And you want to
accommodate them,

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:56.130
because they were so talented.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:00.090
And you're so busy with
what you're doing day to day

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.270
that you just let it go.

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:02.400
And then you realize
six months have gone by

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.760
and you haven't
seen this person,

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.150
and you haven't
really talked to them.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:07.608
Every interaction you've had
with them has been electronic.

00:37:07.608 --> 00:37:09.442
It was easy, and it was
working pretty well.

00:37:09.442 --> 00:37:11.982
And then you get that person
in, and you have a conversation.

00:37:11.982 --> 00:37:13.980
And you think how much
better it could've been.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:17.790
So I think you just have to
have it on your to-do list

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.130
to actively manage
remote relationships.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:22.020
And if you just
let them go, which

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.020
is the natural
human thing to do,

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:26.940
you just are not getting
everything you can out of it,

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.730
and teamwork suffers.

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:31.130
JACK WELCH: The one
thing that Google

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:33.780
could bring to the
world, if you will,

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:38.420
is the ability to
socialize online education.

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.920
No matter how hard we try,
whether it be Blackboard,

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.220
whether it be this system
or the other system,

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:47.570
we still are missing
the socialization link

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.300
in our MBA program.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.420
That's the weak
link in the system.

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.550
How do we get our students
more engaged in our game?

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:57.800
SUZY WELCH: And new technology
comes out all the time.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.650
Believe me, we've seen it.

00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.800
JACK WELCH: It's not enough.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.780
SUZY WELCH: There's
nothing there yet.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:01.290
JACK WELCH: We
need breakthroughs.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:01.680
SUZY WELCH: Please do it!

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.190
JACK WELCH: Please do it!

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:05.030
And it would apply
to these offices.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.406
LASZLO BOCK: Are you Google
for Education customers?

00:38:07.406 --> 00:38:09.080
Because we can introduce
you to someone.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.190
JACK WELCH: We looked at
Noodle and stuff like that.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.981
We've looked at it.

00:38:11.981 --> 00:38:14.260
It isn't good enough.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.526
SUZY WELCH: Oh, oh.

00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:17.050
JACK WELCH: It isn't!

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:20.393
No, it's a nice product,
but it isn't good enough.

00:38:20.393 --> 00:38:21.476
SUZY WELCH: Next frontier.

00:38:21.476 --> 00:38:22.322
LASZLO BOCK: OK.

00:38:22.322 --> 00:38:22.905
Next question?

00:38:25.767 --> 00:38:26.600
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.170
So I had a question on
your career management.

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:31.630
So there are two
approaches, right?

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:34.190
One is you stay
within a company,

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:38.010
and you grow, stay 20, 25
years within GE, or a company

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:38.840
like that.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.410
And in the Silicon Valley,
it's more like every few years

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:46.750
you get a promotion, as in
joining another company,

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.920
and move around every few years.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.810
So how would you contrast
the two approaches

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:54.049
to managing your career?

00:38:54.049 --> 00:38:56.090
JACK WELCH: I don't think
you manage your career.

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:57.790
I think you manage your job.

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:00.770
And what you do is you
overdeliver all the time,

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:03.940
so you become a
commodity with gold stars

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.820
everywhere so
everybody wants you.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.210
Anybody who's
managing their career,

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:11.480
picking, I'll go here next,
and I'll go here next.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.620
And if I get that job,
then I'll get that job.

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:15.660
Killer performer.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.360
Keep your eye on your job.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.860
Do better than anybody's
ever done on that job,

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.360
and good things
will happen to you

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.510
is my view of all those
things, whether you

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:25.824
stay in that company or
go to another company.

00:39:25.824 --> 00:39:27.990
LASZLO BOCK: That's actually
in your career chapter.

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:29.198
That's your first main point.

00:39:29.198 --> 00:39:30.670
You say don't
deliver, overdeliver.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:31.894
JACK WELCH: Yeah.

00:39:31.894 --> 00:39:34.060
LASZLO BOCK: And again,
that's something most people

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.180
actually-- we do our best.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.638
But most of us
don't think about it

00:39:36.638 --> 00:39:38.970
as I'm going to kick
butt every single day.

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:41.020
I'm going to exceed
everyone's expectations.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.830
SUZY WELCH: I think it's hard
to talk about that in this room.

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:44.704
Because I'm going to
presume that most of you

00:39:44.704 --> 00:39:48.137
have been overdelivering since
you were in kindergarten.

00:39:48.137 --> 00:39:49.220
LASZLO BOCK: Most of them.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.270
Most of them.

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:51.110
SUZY WELCH: OK,
but overdelivering

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:52.193
is an interesting concept.

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:57.040
For some people, it's
very natural, OK?

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.570
But for others, it's not.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:02.040
By overdelivering it
means doing-- in school,

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.230
you're taught to deliver.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:05.866
Even when you're at a fine
school, you get the assignment.

00:40:05.866 --> 00:40:06.990
You hand in the assignment.

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.980
You do the assignment very well.

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.600
And you're going to
get a great grade.

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.141
But when you get into the real
world, it's a different thing.

00:40:12.141 --> 00:40:14.380
It's about making the
assignment much bigger.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.300
You're asked to do
X. And you actually

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.350
give serious thought
to what more, what

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:21.790
would be the bigger question.

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:24.040
And so you deliver on X
and the bigger question.

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:28.670
Jack tells a great
story about when he was

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:29.950
trying to get out of the pile.

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:31.800
Early on he was a
chemical engineer PhD.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.250
And his boss asked
him to present

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:36.620
to his boss about some plastic.

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:40.140
And instead, he presented to the
boss about the entire picture

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.310
of the plastics industry
in 5 and 10 years,

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.960
and did this McKinsey-like
presentation.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.070
They couldn't believe it.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:48.730
But that's overdelivering.

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:52.365
And so the question is, are
you thinking expansively

00:40:52.365 --> 00:40:54.389
enough about your work?

00:40:54.389 --> 00:40:56.180
And that is the way to
manage your careers,

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.750
if you are constantly
overdelivering.

00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:59.870
And you've got to have
a certain natural love

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:01.550
and joy above the
work to be doing that,

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:05.420
and a certain natural engagement
and curiosity about the work

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.390
to be doing it.

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:07.847
Otherwise, it's
really hard labor.

00:41:07.847 --> 00:41:09.430
JACK WELCH: One thing
to think about--

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:13.010
and this is a simple little tip.

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:17.700
Is your boss a lot smarter after
the meeting you had with him

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:22.280
or her than before the
meeting took place?

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:26.150
Is your boss going out and
can go to a cocktail party

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:28.810
and can blow smoke
about something

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:32.430
you gave him beautiful
insights into, or gave

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:34.630
her insights into?

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:36.710
Can he just end up smarter?

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:42.640
Did the boss just sit through
a mind-numbing, boring regime

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.200
of you telling him what you've
done, and how you're doing?

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:50.670
Or have you given him
an expansive, broad view

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:52.810
of the subject
that he asked about

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:54.980
or the meeting was
supposed to be about?

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.550
Think about that every time.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.760
Never go to a meeting
without making

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.350
the boss you're dealing
with smarter for having sat

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:05.090
through that meeting with you.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:06.595
Simple tip, but think about it.

00:42:06.595 --> 00:42:08.470
LASZLO BOCK: But what
I love-- and then we'll

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:10.680
go to the question--
is that you keep

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.405
coming back to things that
I, as an individual, control.

00:42:14.405 --> 00:42:16.030
I control how much
work I'm putting in.

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:17.660
I control whether I'm
going above and beyond.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.868
I control what happens in
that meeting with the boss.

00:42:19.868 --> 00:42:23.250
I control do I ask about--
the woman who asks,

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:24.230
what's my rating?

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.430
What's going on?

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:27.930
There's a huge focus on that.

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:30.570
And that's very different
from the typical advice, which

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:33.350
is, well, chart your course,
and check these boxes,

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:34.414
and get this experience.

00:42:34.414 --> 00:42:35.330
JACK WELCH: I hate it.

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:36.870
Why would you?

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:38.610
We have an example in the book.

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:41.530
Everyone says, oh, get a lot
of multifunctional experience.

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:42.860
That'll do a lot for you.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:46.020
I always say, don't bring
skates to the basketball court.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.700
That's for hockey.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.970
Don't try skating on
the basketball court.

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:53.510
Michael Jordan tried
playing baseball.

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:55.470
He stunk at it.

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:56.580
OK?

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:58.580
He went into pro baseball.

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:03.040
And do what you're good at and
just excel like hell at it,

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.141
and the sky's the limit.

00:43:05.141 --> 00:43:07.140
LASZLO BOCK: That's how
a chemist becomes a CEO?

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:07.926
JACK WELCH: Yeah.

00:43:07.926 --> 00:43:09.670
LASZLO BOCK: Yeah.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:10.917
How good a chemist were you?

00:43:10.917 --> 00:43:12.250
SUZY WELCH: A very good chemist.

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:14.165
JACK WELCH: Pretty average
bear, chemical engineer.

00:43:14.165 --> 00:43:14.810
LASZLO BOCK: Yeah.

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:16.143
JACK WELCH: Pretty average bear.

00:43:16.143 --> 00:43:17.200
LASZLO BOCK: Really?

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.880
JACK WELCH: Compared
to other PhDs.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.680
But let me tell
you the difference.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.920
I got a PhD with a
Nobel Prize winner.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.990
I got out in three years.

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:28.800
Most of my peers took seven.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.050
They were all
smarter than I was.

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:32.500
But they doddled.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.780
They played in the lab.

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.710
They liked lab hours.

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:38.074
I wanted to get the
hell out of there.

00:43:38.074 --> 00:43:39.740
SUZY WELCH: He wanted
to be with people.

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.365
JACK WELCH: I wanted
to be with people.

00:43:41.365 --> 00:43:43.380
LASZLO BOCK: Yeah.

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:48.610
JACK WELCH: So I wasn't smarter
by any means, not even close.

00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:51.230
But I was in a hurry.

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:52.730
LASZLO BOCK: I think
that might have

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:54.870
made-- I think we could
debate the smarter part.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:56.344
I think you probably
did all right.

00:43:56.344 --> 00:43:57.510
JACK WELCH: I did all right.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:58.376
LASZLO BOCK: We'll see.

00:43:58.376 --> 00:44:00.140
We'll see, I guess,
in the next few years

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:03.940
how things work out
for you, Jack Welch.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.020
Another question.

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.320
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.060
I was wondering if I could
ask a question about smaller

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:08.580
companies.

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:10.204
Because I think we
have a lot in common

00:44:10.204 --> 00:44:12.850
here with small companies.

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:15.390
I was just curious if you,
having your experience at GE,

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:18.055
a big corporation, if there
are any-- because I think

00:44:18.055 --> 00:44:20.680
small companies are often proud
of the fact that they're small,

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.888
and they don't have much in
common with corporations.

00:44:22.888 --> 00:44:25.810
What do you think smaller
companies could incorporate--

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:27.540
practices, learnings--
from a big company

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.956
that you think
they often overlook

00:44:28.956 --> 00:44:31.400
or avoid intentionally?

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.710
JACK WELCH: Well,
what a company always

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:38.900
wants to be-- don't forget that
plastic story we started with.

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:42.890
I was the first employee,
and 18 years later, we're

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:45.610
a $16 billion company.

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:46.750
We had one technician.

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:49.635
I hired the first one, the
second one, the third one.

00:44:49.635 --> 00:44:52.320
Now, we had the luxury of
building that $16 billion

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:56.040
company in a big corporation
that didn't know anything

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.580
about plastics.

00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:59.530
So we were shielded, and
we had lots of money.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:01.030
We had a bank behind us.

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:03.530
So we weren't out starting
it up from the ground.

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:07.360
But what does a small
company never want to be?

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.342
It never wants to
be a bureaucracy.

00:45:09.342 --> 00:45:10.800
What does a big
company want to be?

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.530
It wants to get rid of layers.

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:14.902
It wants to de-layer and
become a small company.

00:45:14.902 --> 00:45:16.610
But what does a small
company want to be?

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:19.770
It wants to have leverage
in the marketplace.

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:23.180
So it has to have unique
products to get leverage

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:24.140
in the marketplace.

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.490
It must be unique.

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:28.100
It can't have just coverage.

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.350
So you want the muscle
of a big company

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:33.680
and the heart of
a small company.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.520
And all these things
don't go together.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:41.100
For example, when you talk
about business as a sport,

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.480
the team with the
best players wins.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.130
That's what I happens in sports.

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:49.100
The team with the best
players playing together wins.

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.070
That's what happens in business.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:52.530
So it doesn't matter
whether you're

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:54.770
a small business
or a big business,

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:55.970
you want the best players.

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:58.280
You want to constantly
reward the best.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.960
You want to do all the same
things, but you don't want--

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.710
I was talking at LinkedIn
yesterday and talking here

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:05.410
today.

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:07.007
You guys are now a bureaucracy.

00:46:07.007 --> 00:46:09.340
You can have all the food and
all the stuff around here,

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:10.610
but you're a bureaucracy.

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:11.720
Come on.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.690
You got guys like him with
forms and all that stuff.

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:16.190
It happens.

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.690
It happens.

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:18.898
LASZLO BOCK: I'm going to
survey them about this talk

00:46:18.898 --> 00:46:19.920
afterwards.

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.070
I want the forms.

00:46:22.452 --> 00:46:24.160
SUZY WELCH: You have
to fear and loathe--

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.743
JACK WELCH: You're
fighting every day,

00:46:25.743 --> 00:46:27.670
but you've got layers.

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:29.340
You're adding layers.

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:32.120
You can't have this many
people and not have layers.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.370
But you've got to fight.

00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:35.910
Every layer has to go through
the scrutiny of-- you've

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:37.610
got to start from
the standpoint of I

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:39.490
never want to have a layer.

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:44.325
When you're starting a small
company, give them a salary.

00:46:44.325 --> 00:46:47.170
You don't have to
give them a title.

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:48.000
Give them a salary.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.040
Give them more span.

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.740
I had 29 direct reports.

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.300
Ideally, I should
have had 60 probably.

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.580
Because if you don't have
a lot of draft reports,

00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:59.262
you can't meddle.

00:46:59.262 --> 00:47:00.720
And if you're good
people, you want

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.916
them to have their own heads.

00:47:02.916 --> 00:47:04.790
So you've got to fight
like hell all the time

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:06.820
not to layer up a place.

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:08.110
Every layer is evil.

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:10.430
It spins messages.

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:12.020
It delays decision making.

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:15.681
It does all these
terrible things.

00:47:15.681 --> 00:47:17.680
LASZLO BOCK: So on this
point, one of things you

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:18.560
talk about, one of these--

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.685
JACK WELCH: I probably
didn't answer your question,

00:47:20.685 --> 00:47:22.530
but you understand the theory.

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:23.240
LASZLO BOCK: One
of the things you

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.656
talk about in terms
of bureaucracy

00:47:24.656 --> 00:47:27.210
is you touch very
briefly on budgets.

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:29.510
And you talk about how every
company has these budget

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:32.170
negotiations internally about
how much you're going to spend.

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:34.724
And you write-- there's
this beautiful line about,

00:47:34.724 --> 00:47:36.890
and somehow, you always end
up in the middle, right?

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:40.832
Because people-- how do
you cut through that?

00:47:40.832 --> 00:47:42.290
How do you get
people to be honest?

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:45.970
JACK WELCH: Look, the
main point in this book

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:48.090
is what a leader's job is.

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:51.940
It's to create an atmosphere
of truth and trust,

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.510
where every meeting-- you can
have a neon light up here--

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:56.690
there's only truth
being spun here.

00:47:56.690 --> 00:48:00.590
No spin, no BS.

00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:02.180
We want the truth only.

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.950
Because everybody
comes in with a pitch,

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:05.790
and they have their own biases.

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:07.400
They're pitching
it, spinning it.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:10.910
Let's take the bunch of
review as a perfect example.

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:12.090
I'm in the field.

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:16.350
I come in to headquarters at
Google here with my budget.

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:19.470
And I'll come in and
say the market stinks.

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:23.240
The world's coming to an end.

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:24.670
The Chinese are killing us.

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:27.050
This is happening here.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:29.780
All I can do is two.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:34.910
And then the bosses here
will say, I need four.

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:37.670
And you go into
a windowless room

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:39.200
and sit there and bang heads.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:43.700
There'll be no customers,
no analysts, nobody around.

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:46.230
And you'll sit there for seven
hours with presentations,

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:48.390
and slides, and all that stuff.

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:51.300
And you'll come out with three.

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.760
That's the budget for the year.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.440
Nothing will have happened.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.170
The only measurements
that count is

00:48:57.170 --> 00:49:00.050
how did you do
against last year,

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:02.270
and how did you do against
any competitors you

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:03.410
measure against?

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:04.722
That's all that counts.

00:49:04.722 --> 00:49:06.680
Measuring against a budget
is the dumbest thing

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:10.860
that was ever invented in
business-- the dumbest thing.

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.560
Because a budget
is a negotiation

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.530
between two human beings.

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:16.340
It has nothing to
do with the world.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:17.520
It's crazy.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.020
It's stupid.

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.395
LASZLO BOCK: Yeah, you about
looking at variance instead,

00:49:20.395 --> 00:49:22.450
right?

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:24.210
You talk about variance instead?

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:27.110
JACK WELCH: Everything's
variance in my mind.

00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:31.690
We have a chapter in here--
"Don't be Afraid of Finance."

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:34.730
If you understand
variance analysis,

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:37.600
how does the marketing
budget compare to last year?

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.290
And are the sales
going up because you

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:42.240
doubled the marketing
budget, or are they not?

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.720
Everything against a
variance, against last year,

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.220
against two years ago.

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.530
And you're acquiring
a company, why

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:52.900
are you going to spend that much
versus what they spent before?

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:53.854
Everything's variance.

00:49:53.854 --> 00:49:54.520
It's arithmetic.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:50:00.160
Is not DCRRs, or DSDCFs,
or IRRs, and all that crap.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:02.010
You don't need it.

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:03.630
You need to understand variance.

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:06.132
That's what you need in finance.

00:50:06.132 --> 00:50:08.090
LASZLO BOCK: I don't know
if Cliff's still here

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:11.047
who has the Dory questions,
but if there's one--

00:50:11.047 --> 00:50:12.130
AUDIENCE: We got them all.

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:12.460
LASZLO BOCK: Oh,
we got them all?

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:13.572
OK.

00:50:13.572 --> 00:50:15.030
And if there's any
other questions,

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:16.830
we've got a few minutes left.

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:21.670
Two last things, one
super-- well, actually,

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:25.570
in all your travels, what's the
biggest business opportunity

00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:26.319
out there?

00:50:26.319 --> 00:50:28.610
What's the biggest, most
exciting thing on the horizon?

00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:32.682
And not at a high level, like
online learning, or digital,

00:50:32.682 --> 00:50:33.640
or something like that.

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:38.620
But if you were starting out,
what industry would you go in?

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:39.870
What problem would you tackle?

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:40.837
What would you do?

00:50:40.837 --> 00:50:41.920
JACK WELCH: You want a go?

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.349
SUZY WELCH: I think
that's one for you.

00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:45.140
I can do one thing.

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:45.660
I can write.

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:48.460
So for me, it's like the world
doesn't need that many more

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:50.946
writers.

00:50:50.946 --> 00:50:52.320
JACK WELCH: Well,
I think biotech

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.640
is just the most exciting
area in the world right now.

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.710
LASZLO BOCK: Why's that?

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:57.126
JACK WELCH: Because
you're dealing

00:50:57.126 --> 00:50:58.950
with a clear-cut mission.

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:00.300
You've got one mission.

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:01.660
It's easy.

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:04.670
Now, we have a medical
system business in GE.

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:06.090
We buy medical companies.

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:08.400
It's not a problem getting
the mission understood

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.110
by everybody.

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:11.620
You're changing lives.

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:12.760
You're making lives better.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.956
You're doing all that.

00:51:14.956 --> 00:51:20.167
I think it's a frontier now
with enormous upside to explore.

00:51:20.167 --> 00:51:21.750
LASZLO BOCK: But
people have said this

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:23.800
about biotech, like 10
years ago, 20 years ago.

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.020
Is it different
today than it was?

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.603
JACK WELCH: Yes,
it's much hotter now.

00:51:26.603 --> 00:51:27.940
There's much more breakthroughs.

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:32.470
Drugs are coming out much
faster through technology.

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:33.350
LASZLO BOCK: Yeah.

00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:35.370
What about-- well,
actually, do you want to?

00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:37.069
JACK WELCH: Yeah, sure.

00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.610
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:38.410
Thanks for coming.

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:40.660
I'm in a position where I'm
choosing a new team right now.

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:41.800
What are some of the
things that I should be

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.050
looking for in my new manager?

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:44.840
What should I look
for in a boss?

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.086
JACK WELCH: You are
choosing to go to a team?

00:51:47.086 --> 00:51:48.710
SUZY WELCH: No, you're
building a team?

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:50.200
AUDIENCE: No, I'm
moving to a new team.

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.350
SUZY WELCH: OK, so what are
you looking for in your boss?

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:53.270
JACK WELCH: Go through it.

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:54.162
SUZY WELCH: Your
generosity theme?

00:51:54.162 --> 00:51:55.335
JACK WELCH: Yeah.

00:51:55.335 --> 00:51:58.640
SUZY WELCH: So there's
one characteristic

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.770
that we think separates a
good boss from a great boss.

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:04.120
And that's this thing that
we call the generosity gene.

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:07.160
It's technically not a
gene, but it is a-- OK,

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.082
I have to say that.

00:52:08.082 --> 00:52:09.790
LASZLO BOCK: Hold your
questions on that.

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:11.910
She knows it's not a gene.

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:13.743
SUZY WELCH: And I only
say that because Jack

00:52:13.743 --> 00:52:16.050
calls it the generosity gene,
and I'm always there piping up,

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:16.758
saying all right.

00:52:16.758 --> 00:52:18.710
And maybe it is, what do I know?

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:20.895
But I think what it
is, and you've seen it,

00:52:20.895 --> 00:52:22.580
and you've all experienced it.

00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:25.620
It's this preponderance, this
desire, this burning desire

00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:29.670
in an individual to see
the people working for him

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:31.410
or her growing.

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:34.160
And they get really psyched
about giving promotions,

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:37.420
and raises, and seeing
people get things right,

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:41.560
and just getting better.

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:44.020
We've all worked for bosses
with the generosity gene who

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:48.990
have this incredible
heart of love, really,

00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:53.310
for people to grow, and to get
better, and really love you

00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:55.515
as an individual, and
see you get more money,

00:52:55.515 --> 00:52:57.890
and see you get promoted, and
see you even leave the team

00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:59.650
to go on to bigger
and better things.

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:02.290
And then we've all had the
bosses who steal your idea

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:06.010
and use it as their
own, and really

00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:08.390
get stingy around
raises, and really get

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:10.910
stingy about celebrating you.

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:12.650
And so if you're
looking for what team

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:15.770
you're going to go to-- because
you'll go the extra mile.

00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:17.860
And the team will be
that much more energized

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:21.850
when the leader has got
this generosity gene.

00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:24.350
JACK WELCH: And if you think
about it-- stay there a minute.

00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:26.490
If you think about
it, if you think

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:29.430
about it in this
room, all of you,

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:31.760
you've worked for both types.

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.300
You've worked for people
with a generous spirit.

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:37.010
You've worked for people
that didn't have it.

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:38.530
Where was it more fun?

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:41.400
Where was it more enjoyable?

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.920
Because when I look
at the people that

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:47.290
have led in our company, in
the companies I've worked with,

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:50.300
74 private equity
companies and GE.

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:55.230
If I look at these guys, the
winning people, male or female,

00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:57.190
they had this experience.

00:53:57.190 --> 00:54:00.400
They loved to see
their people grow.

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.850
The biggest thrill
for me is we've

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:03.940
got-- you can count
them-- 50, 60,

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:07.730
70 CEOs out there
now who work for me.

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:12.560
Many of them-- you refer to
one in your book, Dave Cote.

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:16.100
They were all chief
executives of GE businesses.

00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:17.960
That's the biggest
turn-on in the world

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:21.540
to have the Boeing CEO, the
Honeywell CEO, the Home Depot

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:22.950
CEO.

00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:26.050
All these people
were my partners.

00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:27.340
They're my friends.

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:29.720
And the nice thing--
Google's got to have that.

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.630
They probably have a
lot of it now already,

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:36.175
whether it be Marissa Meyer,
or whoever else is out there.

00:54:36.175 --> 00:54:37.890
You'll have the same
raft because you've

00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:40.990
got a human resource
process that works.

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:42.920
And that's one of the
great thrills of life

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:47.750
to see these people sprouting up
all over the place from Google.

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:51.760
And Google will be the
GE of the last 20 years,

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.140
20 years ago, going forward.

00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:57.310
They'll have tons of CEOs
out there running companies.

00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:59.739
And it'll be the biggest
turn-on for Google.

00:54:59.739 --> 00:55:00.530
LASZLO BOCK: It is.

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:01.029
It is.

00:55:01.029 --> 00:55:02.780
It's amazing to watch, folks.

00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:04.796
So last question
for each of you.

00:55:04.796 --> 00:55:07.310
JACK WELCH: Thanks
for that question.

00:55:07.310 --> 00:55:10.210
LASZLO BOCK: You write in one
of the concluding chapters.

00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:12.190
You say, to quote
from Mark Twain,

00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:14.380
"the two most important
days in your life

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:18.600
are the day you were born and
the day you figure out why."

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:20.740
I'd love, if you don't
mind, for you to share

00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:21.870
why were you each born?

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:23.740
Why are you here?

00:55:32.384 --> 00:55:34.300
SUZY WELCH: I happen to
be a devout Christian.

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.490
So for me the
answer is just going

00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:39.160
to be I was born to glorify God.

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.505
So I think that's a
really personal thing,

00:55:41.505 --> 00:55:43.880
and probably if there's any
other Christians in the room,

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:44.870
they would have the same answer.

00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:46.290
So that would be the answer.

00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:52.030
Now, how I glorify God is I
have a gift, which is writing.

00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:56.570
And I discovered that I had
that gift, like many writers do,

00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:58.010
when I was really young.

00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:01.340
I started a diary when
I was nine years old.

00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:02.950
And I wrote in it
every single day.

00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:05.530
And if I didn't write in
it, I felt like something

00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:06.290
was really wrong.

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:08.415
So I was really lucky to
be able to have that gift.

00:56:08.415 --> 00:56:10.440
And then I've been
unbelievably blessed

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:13.060
to find many different
ways to use that gift

00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:14.670
to change people's lives.

00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:17.000
And in fact, when
I was running HBR

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.960
when I would try
to recruit people,

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:22.220
I would say please come join
me help change the world.

00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:23.430
That was just incredible.

00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:24.730
So I was able to use my gift.

00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:26.959
And all writers use their
gifts in different ways.

00:56:26.959 --> 00:56:28.084
LAZLO BOCK: That's amazing.

00:56:28.084 --> 00:56:30.100
Thank you.

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:32.680
JACK WELCH: No, I just
happened to be lucky.

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:38.350
Luck plays an enormous part in
where you get to in these jobs.

00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:39.155
You bust your butt.

00:56:39.155 --> 00:56:40.210
You do all these things.

00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:42.130
But I love people.

00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:45.920
And when I took this job
on, from the first plastic,

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:48.430
I loved my first employee,
to my second employee,

00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:49.740
to my third employee.

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.331
I like hanging out.

00:56:51.331 --> 00:56:55.020
And I like being with people.

00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:58.460
And contrary to
what Laszlo feels--

00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:00.790
and he's smarter and
brighter in some ways.

00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:02.305
SUZY WELCH: Going for you.

00:57:02.305 --> 00:57:04.910
JACK WELCH: No, I
believe in my gut.

00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:06.660
I'm a gut guy.

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:07.930
I'm not an analyst.

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:11.990
I have a PhD and all that stuff,
but I believe in gut, and feel,

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:14.290
and touch, and people.

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:18.120
And I'll hire, and I'll
make mistakes with my gut

00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.310
many times.

00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:20.740
But so far, people like me.

00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:21.790
They work hard for me.

00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:23.370
We all work as a team.

00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:24.670
It isn't me.

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:27.560
But I always hire people
smarter than me in every job

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:29.260
I've ever been in.

00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:30.190
And I like them.

00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:32.380
I like hang around with them.

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:36.556
If you like people,
it's a fun job.

00:57:36.556 --> 00:57:37.940
It's a great job.

00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:41.330
And that's what I like,
and so it all worked out.

00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:43.660
I was captain of sports
all through college.

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:46.330
I was captain of
sports in high school.

00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:50.160
People tend to
let me be captain.

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:54.400
So it seemed to be fun, and
I've never stopped liking it.

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.240
That's why we keep doing this.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:57.530
We love these interchanges.

00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:59.420
We learn everywhere we go.

00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:02.480
We see these magnificent
people doing things.

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:04.480
And it's wonderful
to be out here where

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.730
you're seeing all this growth.

00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:09.750
Because growth really
is an elixir of life.

00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:11.100
It truly is.

00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:14.906
It gives you a whole
new jolt. And we're

00:58:14.906 --> 00:58:16.280
lucky enough and
fortunate enough

00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:18.500
to have people come
and listen to us.

00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:19.906
So thanks for being here.

00:58:19.906 --> 00:58:20.822
LAZLO BOCK: Thank you.

00:58:20.822 --> 00:58:22.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:25.742 --> 00:58:29.680
And if I can just say two
quick things in closing.

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.870
One is it's not often you have
a discussion about a business

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:36.540
book that then hinges on
talk about God, and love,

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:39.116
and changing the world,
and transformation.

00:58:39.116 --> 00:58:41.240
So it's an incredible gift
to have both of you here

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.270
and to have you share the
wisdom you've both accumulated.

00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:45.710
So thank you on
behalf of Google.

00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:46.540
SUZY WELCH: Thank you.

00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:48.250
LAZLO BOCK: The other thing
is I know just for this room

00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:50.749
that you both offered to hang
around and say hello to folks,

00:58:50.749 --> 00:58:53.310
anybody wants to
come up and chat.

00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:54.810
And we have some
books back there

00:58:54.810 --> 00:58:56.560
that you're free to
take, some others when

00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:59.270
we run out that you're free
to purchase at a discount.

00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:02.034
I imagine your hands aren't
completely sore and broken?

00:59:02.034 --> 00:59:03.950
JACK WELCH: No, we're
happy to sign any books.

00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:05.630
LAZLO BOCK: You can probably
get a few signatures.

00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:07.310
But thank you, sincerely,
for sharing your message.

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:07.690
SUZY WELCH: Hey, thank
you for being here.

00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:08.000
Thank you.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:08.350
JACK WELCH: Laszlo, thank you.

00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:09.250
LAZLO BOCK: Really
appreciate it.

00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:09.850
Real pleasure.

00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:12.600
[APPLAUSE]
