them they all need to be there to tell
this

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600
this
 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.690
this
correctly and they're mostly handled

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700
correctly and they're mostly handled
 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.280
correctly and they're mostly handled
well but that's my biggest issue with

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290
well but that's my biggest issue with
 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.400
well but that's my biggest issue with
this movie it is very long and it feels

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410
this movie it is very long and it feels
 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.380
this movie it is very long and it feels
long because those subplots are

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390
long because those subplots are
 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.660
long because those subplots are
improperly balanced it's easy to say

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670

well this movie's over long well why is
it over long because parts of it were a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990
it over long because parts of it were a
 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.900
it over long because parts of it were a
little bit boring because the actual

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910
little bit boring because the actual
 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.000
little bit boring because the actual
story wasn't as cohesive as it could

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.740
