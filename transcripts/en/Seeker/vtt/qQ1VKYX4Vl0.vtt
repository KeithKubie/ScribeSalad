00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.170
There is one thing all babies have in common,
they’re born with weaker immune systems

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.320
than adults.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.930
We know there are some terrible diseases out
here in the cold, cold world, and we also

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.620
know that if you train the immune system to
recognize those threats, they’ll fight them

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.620
off!

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.449
The problem is, vaccinations make parents
uncomfortable.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.630
There’s this thing, and you’re stabbing
it into my tiny princess or bouncing baby

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.689
boy or princess boy or whatever!

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.329
In order to train the immune system in the
best way possible, parents have to follow

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.829
a strict schedule of injections… often returning
to the doctor.

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:32.829
All The time.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.370
Look at this schedule!

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.120
Different things every month, and ranges and
specific vaccines at specific times.This is

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.730
so much scheduling.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.660
And different countries have different schedules
because they’re exposed to different diseases

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.100
at different times.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.519
What if you have another kid in 2 years?

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.510
Then you have to balance two of these schedules,
plus your regular parenting and non-parenting

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.510
lives.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.690
What if I told you that researchers had figured
out how to do this all in one.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.690
Shot.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.690
Literally.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.690
One.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.690
Uno.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.410
This is Kevin McHugh
I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the Massachusetts

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.660
Institute of Technology

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.150
He’s worked with a team to engineer a solution.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.580
Micro-fabricated tiny ‘coffee cups’ or
cubes that slowly degrade once inside the

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.580
body.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.010
You can just go one time, and deliver all
your vaccines potentially in that one visit,

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.540
then you can have someone fully protected
against an array of infectious diseases.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.280
This vaccine has the same contents as a regular
vaccine but it contains a special polymer

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.630
called polylacticcoglycolic acid or PLGA.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.120
It's in a lot of different FDA approved devices
so we think it can be translated to the clinic

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.350
more readily than perhaps a new material”

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.540
The little coffee cups are made using a process
similar to the one for computer chips, but

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.540
instead of silicon they use PLGA.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.860
The coffee cup analogy works, we actually
have a bottom, we have a top, and we fill

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.070
the liquid in the middle.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.630
The particles are small enough to flow through
a needle, so a doctor just needs to inject

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.800
it into the muscle.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.190
Over the next few months, water in the body
slowly reacts with the copolymer in a process

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.870
called hydrolysis.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.850
It breaks down into tiny bits of glycolic
acid, cleared by the kidneys, and lactic acid

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.730
which breaks down into CO2 and water, it’s
natural!

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.660
When you feel the burn, that’s lactic acid!

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.350
So again, instead of dozens of visits and
injections and worry… one injection, and

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.350
done.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.350
Science take the wheel!

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.010
Kevin’s paper shows that the PLGA breaks
down in a predictable way, so they can plan

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.560
the vaccinations and boosters depending on
what needs to happen.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.160
The particles are too big for the immune system
to worry about, but too small to bother the

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.160
patient.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.510
Even still, we can’t talk vaccinations without
worries.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.380
A 2015 report found 93% of physicians were
told by some parents ‘No Way.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.770
That’s too many shots at once for my baby.’

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.100
Let’s go by our own schedule.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.470
Even though almost 90-percent of doctors felt
by deviating from this schedule, they’d

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.340
put the kid (or community) at risk… some
doctors deviated anyway because parents were

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.010
worried or upset.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.180
The CDC mentions some parents (with no evidence
or training mind you) felt all these vaccinations

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.840
might overwhelm their kid’s immune system…
which science says -- it will not.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.750
Having one vaccination that does the whole
job, could relieve a lot of worried parents,

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.200
we don’t have to poke your baby a lot, just
one time!

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.569
This future tech isn’t just convenient for
overbooked middle-class parents either, a

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.130
single vaccination is life changing in the
developing world.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.390
There's a lot millions of infants every single
year that either don't get any vaccines or

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:39.280
get one vaccine but don't get the full complement
of injections along the way on a schedule

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.040
and … it's not necessarily, you know, a
cost issue, it's a delivery issue -- how do

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.920
you get the vaccines to the people.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.680
Having a single, time-release vaccination
for children could quite literally change

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.680
the world.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.020
Helping millions of people with and without
healthcare security develop immune-strength,

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.430
and live longer, healthier lives.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.790
I hope you liked this video!

It really helps us make the show better!

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.340
Thanks.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.319
If you think this vaccine is weird, the very
first vaccine was way weirder.

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.010
It had to do with cows, and kids and weird
science.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.010
Check it out here.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.380
