00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.540
They say boys don’t cry, but they also say
not to bite into a molten lava Hot Pocket,

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.870
so… which is it?

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.849
Hi boys and girls, Jules here for DNews.

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.390
Babies cry, children cry, and doves cry.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.690
But under no circumstances are boys supposed
to cry.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.420
It just isn’t manly, we’re told.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.840
It’s something that women do, apparently.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.090
But it turns out, that’s not quite true.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.080
In fact studies show that from infancy until
around age 5, boys express their feelings

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.160
more than girls.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.160
A 1999 study by Harvard Medical School and
Boston Children’s hospital found that boys

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.440
were more likely than girls to fuss, ask to
be picked up, and most importantly, cry.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.140
So if you want to be very literal, boys do
cry.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.210
But what happens after age 5?

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.250
Do they slowly become less emotional until
they are stoic pillars of strength and officially

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.410
a “man”?

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.120
That doesn’t seem to be the case either.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.690
One study by psychology research institute
Mindlab gathered a group of 15 fathers and

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.260
15 mothers and showed them a series of videos.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.950
The researchers categorized the videos as
either funny, exciting, blissful, or heartwarming.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.940
While they watched the videos, participants’
emotional responses were monitored by electrodes

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.140
on their fingers.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.280
The electrodes recorded marginally higher
responses for men when they watched blissful,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.100
funny, or exciting videos.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.680
But when the men watched a soldier coming
home to his daughter,they were a mess inside,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.830
recording twice the physiological response
women did.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.150
Men are still emotional on the inside, even
more so than women, it would seem.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.479
But they don’t show it.

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.360
That Mindlab study surveyed the men and women
after they watched the videos, and men consistently

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.530
self-reported having less of a reaction than
women.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.759
So boys don’t shed their feelings when they
grow into men, but they do seemingly cry less.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.759
Why?

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.330
Well, while some are quick to blame societal
structures, there is also a bit of biology

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.580
behind it too.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.540
The American Psychological Association reports
that testosterone, which floods young boy’s

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.260
bodies during puberty, may actually inhibit
the crying reflex.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.640
Meanwhile, prolactin, which is found in higher
amounts in women and stimulates milk production

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.290
after childbirth, may promote crying.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.370
But this isn’t the end-all reason boys don’t
cry.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.239
When society teaches men that expressing their
emotions is unacceptable, they repress them

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.239
instead.

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.010
Niobe Way, a professor of applied psychology
at New York University has been studying how

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.420
emotional repression affects boys.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.390
Her research has shown that boys form deep
and meaningful friendships in early and middle

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.870
adolescence that are just as emotionally intimate
as the friendships young girls develop.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.290
But by age 16 they’ve distanced themselves
from other men, even though the desire for

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.239
those strong bonds remains.

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.400
Other research has shown this is about the
same time men start falling behind in schools.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.129
Sociologists Thomas Di Prete and Claudia Buchmann
found that boys who strive for good grades

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.700
are mocked by their peers.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.430
Meanwhile boys who participate in “un-masculine”
but more expressive activities like music,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.100
art, and drama tend to get better grades.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.860
Better grades can lead to better colleges,
so proving you’re manly to your teenage

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.360
buddies can have lasting consequences for
the rest of your life.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.970
It can even cut your life short.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.239
Age 16 is also the point when male suicides
begin to rise.

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.550
Psychologists believe the correlation with
emotional repression is not coincidental.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.910
Men who are depressed are less likely than
women to ask for help.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.950
So while society is quick to say “man up”,
it may ultimately be hurting all of us.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.490
It’s 2016, go ahead and cry, whoever you
are.
