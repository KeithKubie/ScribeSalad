00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:22.350
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington D.C.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.150
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Well,
good afternoon to all,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.970
and welcome to the
Library of Congress.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.980
My name is Robert Newlen, I
have the pleasure of serving

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.540
as the deputy Librarian of Congress
for institutional advancement,

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.540
you're sitting in our
magnificent member's room,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.520
a room I think Bob would've
appreciated very much.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.920
It's my pleasure to
welcome you today --

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.950
to today's event, announcing
the gift

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.500
of the Bob Adelman photo archive
to the Library of Congress,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.240
and honoring the life and work

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.570
of this incredible
photographer and artist.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.440
It's wonderful to see so many
familiar faces here this afternoon,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.970
specially the members of
Bob's family, his friends

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.650
and fellow artists,
who traveled from all

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.830
over the country to
join us here, today.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.990
In particular I want to welcome
Bob's daughter; Samantha Ray,

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.250
and his colleague Steven Wadd,
who collaborated with our staff

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.750
to help created an event that Bob
would be proud of, our thanks too,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.700
to Helena Zinkham and Erika White
for bringing us all together today.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.270
Today's guess speakers are
befitting an icon like Bob.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.080
You will hear from the Librarian
of Congress, the Poem Laureate,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.640
an award winning New York Times
photographer, a legendary novelist

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.610
and short story writer, and a
renowned curator of photography.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.530
After the formal speaking program,
there will be a brief question

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.730
and answer section, and we will
conclude with the reception

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.190 position:56%
where you can view some of the
remarkable images from this archive.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.740
I also want to mention that today's
program is being live streamed

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.080
on YouTube, and recorded for a
webcast that will be available

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.410
on the Library of Congress website.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.120
Before I turn it over
to Doctor Hayden,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.870 position:56%
I just want to say what good fortune
it was for me to spend some time

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.250
with Bob over the past several
years, during one of his visits

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.630 position:56%
to the library, my partner and I had
a small cocktail party at our home

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.460
in his honor, at some
point during the evening,

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.110
Bob began examining the art
on our walls and he smeared

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.010
on a small water color that was
painted by Gloria Vanderbilt,

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.590 position:56%
and this led to the most remarkable,

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.940
and I'm guessing undocumented
story about this commission.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.740
Bob said that he rarely
accepted portrait commissions,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.730
but he made an exception for Miss
Vanderbilt, and he did the portrait

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.120
at her home at [inaudible] place,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.460
and was really quite an
extraordinary portrait.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.220
The present time prevents me
from recounting the whole story,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.330
so I'll just leave it as a
very, very warm memory of Bob.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.040
And now, it is my pleasure
to welcome the Librarian

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.090
of Congress, Doctor Carla Hayden.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.390
[ Applauses ]

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:41.680
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Good
afternoon and it's an honor

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.020
and a pleasure for
me to be here today.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.930
I am pleased that the Library
of Congress is now entrusted

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:58.560
with the preservation and eventual
exhibiting of the collection

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.220
of the photography
of mister Adelman.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.130
In his own words, "Life's
work is about the many

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.840
and the diverse social concerns on
America; poverty, mental illness,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.540
alcoholism, inadequate housing,
the immigrant experience"

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.710
and his collection, so
marvelously documented;

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.500
the struggle to overcome
racial discrimination,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.310
and like so many other
Americans, I was deeply moved

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.430
by the photographs he took on
Birmingham, Alabama in 1963,

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.520
when the police in Ingram
Park used fire hoses

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.920
to push back African-Americans
who demanded civil rights.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.810
It's especially significant as
I'm the first African-American

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.140
to lead the Library of Congress.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.350
As he said, the fire
hoses were brutal.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.040 position:56%
They ripped the bark from the trees,
and nevertheless the people held

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.230
on to one another, and
were able to resist.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.400 position:56%
The images which I've learned since,
that were used to promote the march

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.400
in Washington, made me think
about Doctor King, and the message

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.430
that change does not roll in on the
wheels of inevitability but comes

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.710
through continuous struggle.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.320
And I was personally struck by
his own message that photography,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.830 position:56%
and his photography was not only
quote, "Intend on telling the truth,

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.780
but doing something about
it" and in his own words,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.040
it was a constant effort, not only
to document what he was seeing,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.180
but to figure out how
to change things.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.380 position:56%
Change, as we know, is a continuous
struggle and demands constant effort

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.900
and [inaudible] which is why, the
Library of Congress is so proud

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.440
to preserve his work and
collection for future generations,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.330
and thanks to the generosity
of an anonymous donor,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.810
the library has acquired over
600,000 prints, negatives, slides,

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.950
and other materials documenting
not only the African-American civil

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.840
rights movement, but the many
changes in American culture brought

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.360
about by remarkable
individuals like him.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:27.250
Sadly, he passed away last March,
and I was not able to meet him.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.890
But I have heard many
stories from staff members,

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.210
in particular Mister Newlen,
who left out a little something,

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.660
if you get him at the reception,
he might tell you the true glory

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.300
of Vanderbilt story that he
has actually meant him to.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.800
He was a graduate of Berkley

well as Life, People, and Squire.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.360
He also authored, edited, and
illustrated over a dozen books,

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.700
including Martin Luther King as
celebration, award and image,

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:28.250

F. Kennedy, and Out of Left Field,

of the Civil Rights Movement".

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.400
He was awarded a Guggenheim
Fellowship,

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.640
and multiple art directors'
clubs honors.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.570
He went to University of Missouri

and his work was included

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:02.250
And now, we are honored that
his collection will be preserved

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.930

see, to notice the photographs,

and I was very moved when I
looked at the various books

that Bob put together, and his
photographs, it was something

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.160
that made my life, when I was
a child as immigrant -- some --

interesting and creative,

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.890

that we can still look at,

its Pittway, has wallpapers

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:29.710

There's a way through, to freedom,
yes indeed, yes sir, yes madam.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.270
There's a way through to freedom.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.440

while you hold on an
Adelman's camera.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:22.420
A is for Adelman as he holds you,
as he holds onto you, into you,

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:29.440
as you hold onto him and if stops,
but 550,000 exposures that hidden,

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.380
not on page [inaudible],
not silent, not invisible.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.650
A is for America, A is for Adelman;

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:39.700
put the alphabet together,
put freedom together.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.400
Everybody say freedom --

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.700
&gt;&gt; Freedom.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.000

&gt;&gt; Everybody say freedom again --

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.900
&gt;&gt; Freedom.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.200
&gt;&gt; Not silent, not invisible.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.450
Put freedom together, S is for
segregation, separation between you

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.970
and yourself, I is for
innocent while arrested,

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:00.260

and S is for school integration
until you get too close.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.870
But you have to, you
have to get close.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.820
Everyone say, you have
to get close --

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.430
&gt;&gt; You have to get close.

&gt;&gt; You have to get close --

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.320
&gt;&gt; You have to get close.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.620
&gt;&gt; And that's what
the camera is for --

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.250
&gt;&gt; That's what the camera is for.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.700
&gt;&gt; That's what the lens is for.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.000
&gt;&gt; That's what the lens is for.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.920
&gt;&gt; And that's why we get respect --

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.630
&gt;&gt; That's why we get respect.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.930

of tenant farmers,

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.040

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:42.310
Where's brown?

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.790
Brown is black, black as brown.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:50.820 position:56%
R is for Rosa Park sitting on a bus,

&gt;&gt; Is for we --

00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:59.450
&gt;&gt; Is for we.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.050
&gt;&gt; Shall not.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:03.350
&gt;&gt; Shall not be moved --

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.650
&gt;&gt; Shall not be moved.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:05.950
&gt;&gt; And Adelman's camera is for --

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:10.790
lay down, lay down in front
the tractor, L is for lie down,

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:15.580
lie down in front the tractor, so
you can stop unfair labor practices

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.370
at the Downstate Medical Center.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.440
Adelman keeps moving,
Adelman keeps America moving

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.000
in front of your eyes.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.850

of trouble, like Mimi Feingold

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:36.710 position:56%

West Feliciana Parish, at Louisiana.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.900
Oh, everyone say, oh --

&gt;&gt; Oh.

Marching, everyone say marching --

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.910
&gt;&gt; Marching.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.210

&gt;&gt; Come on up --

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:08.810
&gt;&gt; Come on up.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.110
&gt;&gt; To the front free,
with your gut fiddle,

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:11.410
and march until race
beating disappears.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:12.850
Can you see it in the camera?

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:17.590
M is for memorial services, for
Doctor Martin Luther King Junior,

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:21.220
M is for memorial services
for Malcolm X,

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:25.290
L is for LGBTQ parades,
no more gay bashing.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:26.850
No more gay bashing.

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:32.570
V is for Vietnam War that you can
pray and touch, and consider all

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:36.390
of those that gave their
lives for you, America.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:41.090
W is for women's liberation,
say it as Lillie explodes.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:42.960
Everybody say women's liberation --

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.260
&gt;&gt; Women liberation.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.760
&gt;&gt; Everyone say, W is
for women's liberation --

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.970
&gt;&gt; W is for women's liberation.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.840
&gt;&gt; Say it, as a Lillie explodes,
and C is for civil rights,

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.580
L is for let my civil rights go.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:00.260
C is for camera; Adelman's
camera, with an S, for see.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:04.310
And a C for compassion
action, and an L for love,

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.750
and a Y for yes, it is possible.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:12.660 position:56%
And an E, and an E for is the engine
that moves us together, with Danny,

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.130
and Vincent, walking
down the concrete world,

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:19.500
and W for what are you going to do?

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.110
What are you going to do?

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:28.180
Because you are in this picture,
because S is for saying grace

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.740
at dinner, in Sumter,
South Carolina.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:37.630
And Z is for Zen, monk,
meditating in Rochester, New York.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:42.690
And H is for humanity;
Adelman's humanity, our humanity,

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:46.870
our humanity it spells America.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:19:07.570
Thank you so much.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:08.870
[ Applause ]

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.730
&gt;&gt; That was remarkable, thank you.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.890
And as you visit the photographs,
or the books later this afternoon,

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:20.000
I think you will see the whole
alphabet coming to life visually.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:26.430
We have three other
speakers this afternoon,

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:31.110
I'll ask if you could come up in
the stage, and each take a chair.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.300 position:56%
Beginning perhaps with James Estrin,

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:39.140
there's some steps
on the other side.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:42.700
I'm going to take care of all the
introductions in one fell swoop,

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.220
and then we can settle
in to hear the talks.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.010
So, James Estrin is a photographer
for himself, who began working

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:53.380
at the New York Times in
the 1980s, he also found it;

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:58.480
the New York Times photography
blog, which is called The Lens.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.960
So, many echoes are going
to go back and forth

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.440
with your poem this afternoon.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.820
In 2014 -- actually, earlier,

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.850
but then in 2014 you
interviewed Bob Adelman at length,

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.330
and that's been published, this is
the blog post, and it was called,

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.260
"Photographs that make
a difference".

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.800
So, James is going to talk with
us about Bob's career and work,

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.220
in relation to American
social justice

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.680 position:56%
and documentary photography overall.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.500
Verna Curtis, who -- she'll
speak second, retired last year

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.470
as a wonderful curator of
photography at the Prints

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.720
and Photography's Division here,
at the Library of Congress.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.380
She found much common
ground with Bob Adelman,

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.200
not only through the
exhibition march in Washington,

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.370
co-curator with Marisha
Badle [phonetic],

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:48.600
but also through home town
territory in Miami Beach, Florida.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.540 position:56%
With more than 30 years of
experience in the fields of both art

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.740
and documentary photography, Verna
is ideal to help us dive deeper

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:00.980 position:56%
into Bob's images, and show how well
they fit with some other collections

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.190
at the Library of Congress.

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:09.300
Our final speaker is Ann Beattie,
author of novels and short stories;

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.800
I've read that she's been
referred to as a pal of Bob's.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.780
We'll make that more formal,
along standing and good friend.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:21.260
Sure as a philosophy,
and long conversations.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.440
And Anne is here today as
one of Bob's close friends.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.980
She reportedly rejected Bob's
request to photograph the people

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.970
in places in her own
stories, but has written

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:37.490
about his amazing work
with love and affection.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:42.850
James, you're up.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:50.950
&gt;&gt; James Estrin: When I
was asked -- excuse me.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:55.710
When I was asked to speak about
Bob Adelman, my first thought was,

00:21:55.710 --> 00:22:00.220
"I didn't really know him that
well" I've met him a few times,

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.080
and I've interviewed him twice,

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.660
but upon reflection I
realized I did know him well,

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:11.070
but that was mainly
through his photographs.

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:16.140
His images affected me as a young
child looking at them in the pages

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.800
of Life and Look magazines.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.160
They affected me as a young
photographer, finding my own path

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:27.790
in the field, and they continued
to affect me today as a testament

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:33.170
to what can happen when people
stand up against injustice.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:36.460
Bob's photos were always
honest, compassionate.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:41.700
As a photographer, he worries hard
on its sleeve, and always forth

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.610
on the side of the angels.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:48.190
As a photo journalist,
I've always my images

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:53.350
to affect the situations I
document, but as I got older

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:58.010
and images became more ubiquitous
with the digital revolution,

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:01.130
I've come to believe that
there are few situations

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.640
where a photo makes a
difference that is measurable.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:11.020 position:56%
Louis Hynes photos of young
children at work changed labor laws.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.020
Perhaps Nick Ootes Napalm
Girl, and Eddie Adams photos

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.810
of the Saigon Execution,

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:20.730
helped galvanize opposition
to the Vietnam War.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.370
I've made a few photos in my career

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:27.800
that drew attention,
but measurable change?

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.250
Not so much.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:33.840
We, photo journalists, risk
our lives covering war,

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.340
famine and injustice, yet
there's still as much war,

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.200
famine and injustice
as when we start.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.890
So, I've come to the
conclusion that for me,

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.720
it is enough if I document
those terrible things,

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.070
and people see them, at
least they can not say

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:56.280
that they didn't know
what was happening.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.680
And I'm OK with that.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.320
Most older photographers
I've interviewed

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.310
for the Lens blog be
known the lack of effect

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.530
that their photos have had.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:10.520
Don McCullin, whose images
of war and famine were seen

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.010
around the world, suddenly
said to me flat out,

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:16.030
that he feels that
he wasted his life.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:19.280
But when I spoke to
Bob Adelman, he said,

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.810
"Of course photos change things."

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:23.590
He noted that Garry Winogrand,

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:26.580
the street photographer
once famously said

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.260
that photographs don't
change things.

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:34.440 position:56%
Bob, who was in his 80s at the time,
told me that that was, and I quote,

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:39.350
"The silliest thing he had ever
heard" Bob's photos and those

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:44.210
of his fellow's civil rights -- OK.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:52.390
OK. Bob's photos and those

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:58.690
of his fellow's civil rights
photographers clearly did help end

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:02.800
the Jim Crow statues; they
help change those laws

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.050
by exposing the hideous
nature of racial segregation,

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:11.170
and turning American
opinion against it.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:16.030
He told Jet magazine in
2014, in a profound sentence,

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.780
"The movement realized
how segregation was ugly,

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:21.140
and un-American.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.680
The photographs were the evidence."

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:30.960
Bob's images were born out
of optimism, and the belief

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.140
that the American people,
when confronted with the scope

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:39.580
of racial injustices, would
support the movement's goals.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.270
It's an optimism that
Bob continued to display

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:46.790
in his latter work, in
communities in need.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:51.550
Bob was not just a documentarian
of the civil rights movement,

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.650
he was a passionate participant.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:59.450
He was a volunteer for CORE,
the Congress of Racial Equality,

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.370
and SNICK [phonetic], the Student
non-Violent Coordinating Committee,

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:08.660
he was not an outsider; he won
the trust of movement leaders,

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.690
and that gave him some
kind of access,

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:16.420
that resulted in knowing the
insider view of the movement.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:21.800
His intimate images were
instrumental in putting the message

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.620
of equal rights for all,
forward at the time.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.210
Today they're useful for
understanding the complexities

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:30.630
of what made the movement tick,

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.530
and how leaders presented
themselves publically.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.750
Helena Zinkham has
tasked me with trying

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:42.030 position:56%
to describe Bob Adelman's
importance in the photography world.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:46.270
Of course, he documented a
critical period of American history

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.990
in a comprehensive manner.

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:51.790
But I think what really sets
him apart, it's the respect

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.740
that Bob had for its subjects.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.760 position:56%
There were other white photographers
who made important contributions

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.560
to the documentation of
the civil rights movement,

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.810
but too many of them --

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:09.130
though, perhaps well meaning
portray their subject as symbols

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:13.550
of oppression, not as
fully rounded human beings.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:17.330
Some photographers fantasized
the black Americans they were

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:21.840 position:56%
photographing, where others
focused mainly on images of violence

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.220
and black bodies being violated.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:28.980
But in Bob's images,
the people involved

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.350
in the civil rights movement,
were treated with respect,

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:35.490
and portrayed in the
most dignified manner,

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:40.260
whether they were famous leaders
or foot soldiers in the struggle,

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.370
he approached everyone
with equal respect

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:47.710
and this approach followed him
throughout his lustrous career.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:50.550
This is what I noticed in
his images when I studied him

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:56.390
as a young photographer, and this
is what influenced me profoundly.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:28:01.330
Like Bob, I strived to encounter
all people on the same level,

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:04.160
whether they were the most
rich and most powerful person,

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.830
or the poorest and most vulnerable.

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:11.900
Encounter everyone on
your level as equals,

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.350
that's what I learned
from Bob's work.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:18.390
Bob made the critically
important historic photos

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.420
of the reverend Martin
Luther King Junior,

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.860
giving his I have a dream
speech, at the Lincoln memorial,

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:27.380
not far from where
we sit here today.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:31.020
Doctor King knew Bob, and
was comfortable with him.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.300
Where most of the press was
stuck in a far away pin,

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:39.170
Bob was able to get a close up
photo, because everyone knew him,

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:41.590
and everyone trusted him.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:46.640
Bob had a master's degree
from Columbia in Philosophy.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.080
I once asked him to tell
me something I didn't know

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.770
about Doctor King, since Bob had
several opportunities to spend time

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:58.900
with him, and apparently between
jokes, they discussed philosophy.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.740
Bob told me, and I quote,
"He was a personalist

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:07.910 position:56%
in his religious vocation, he
believed that everyone was an aspect

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:11.980
of god, and that when we spoke to
them, they deserved the attention

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:17.550
and concern as if you were
directly talking to god."

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:21.720
While Bob was much, much less
certain of the existence of god

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.840
than Doctor King, as he
approached the people

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.310
that he photographed
echoed that sentiment.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:34.760
Look at the photo of Reverend
Joseph Cornell standing sentinel

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.970
on its front porch, holding a rifle

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:41.210
against the possible
Ku Klux Klan ambush,

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:43.670
after he became the
first black resident

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.410 position:56%
of West Feliciana [phonetic] Parish,

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:50.360
in Louisiana to register
a vote in six decades.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.420
Bob was also their
leader, when a multitude

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:56.190
of shots were fired
trough the house.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:30:00.420
This was just one of many times
when Bob encountered violence

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:04.260
and gun shots during the
struggle for civil rights.

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:11.430 position:56%
He told me, "I realize that my
involvement would be very dangerous,

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.130
but I had a long think with myself,

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:18.710
and decided that this was something
worth risking your life for."

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:20.410
In my last interview with him,

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.740
he told me that he had
found workable answers

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:28.620
in his philosophy studies,
before turning to photography;

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:32.690 position:56%
I asked him what those answers
were, because if he knew the meaning

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:35.610
of life, I wanted to know it.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:39.190
He said that in the sense of
the Middle Ages, he didn't think

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.990 position:56%
that there was an equate focus to
life, or that this world was a drama

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:47.160
of salvation, preparing us for
the next life, he didn't think

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.900
that there was any over
arching purpose to life,

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:55.830
but that we were given meaning
through families, experiences,

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.840
affections we have and values
that we care deeply about.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:04.780
He said that funding projects
would be meaningful in connection

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.430 position:56%
with those values, and that would
be as much purpose as he could find.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:13.880
And I quote, "For me, if I've
gotten involved in something,

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.540
it had to mean something, I
had to see some purpose to it,

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.090
and that would be something
I care about."

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.870
So, Bob studied philosophy,
primarily to find his way

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:28.370
in the world, but it
was through photography

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:32.430
that he discovered the meaning
that he was searching for.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:37.700
He said, "I realize that I wanted
to get involved in the world,

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:55.390
to make a difference" and he has.

00:31:55.390 --> 00:32:01.530
Thank you.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.830
[ Applause ]

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:06.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Verna Curtis: Thank you,
Helena, and all of the library staff

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:10.110
for their support, for
the Adelman acquisition

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:16.410
and for organizing this lovely
and significant occasion,

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:21.640
I think it's appropriate to really
look at Bob's career visually.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:27.690
So, that's what I will
bring to you this afternoon.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:33.150
In fact, you may be seeing
his images in many places,

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:36.800
and not even be aware of it.

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:41.030
Are we going here?

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:48.970
Don't see it here.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:58.960
Oops. This is a poster from Raoul
Peck recent academy award nominated

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:04.230
film, about writer James
Baldwin, "I'm not a negro."

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:09.470
Baldwin's penetrating eyes
comes from one of Bob's photos.

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:12.430
Bob got to know him during
the civil rights movement,

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:15.910
and photographed him
during the run of his play,

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:20.500
"Blues for Mister Charlie" If
you haven't seen Peck's film,

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:25.530
it is in fact likely author's
eyes, it delves into the essence

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:29.730
of the man, and does this
in a very creative way.

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:33.220
Peck uncovered an unpublished
manuscript of Baldwin's

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:37.460
and uses those words to
quote his life and times,

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.540
offering an unusual authenticity.

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:46.160
The quality of authenticity
also distinguishes Bob's work,

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.990
and makes it so very appropriate

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:52.290
for the library's photographic
collections.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:59.400
Bob came to the attention of the
library staff about 10 years ago,

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.390
when he arrived to examine,

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:03.740
potentially for a photo
book project,

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.900
negatives made by Ralph Ellison.

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.080
Ellison's archive is in
the manuscripts division,

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.430
and his relatively unknown
photographic work resides

00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:15.730
in the prints and photograph's
division.

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:20.220
My colleague, Marisha Badle, met
Bob and subsequently visited him

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:23.780
to acquire a selection of
civil rights photographs.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:32.010
And one of them was this iconic
image we've been looking at,

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:34.810
Doctor King.

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:38.730
We organized the photographic
exhibition commemorating the 50th

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:43.620
anniversary of the march on
Washington, in August, 2013.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:47.410
And the following January
held this symposium with some

00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:50.660
of the photographers who
had witnessed the march.

00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:55.760
Bob was one of the stars and
spoke, and subsequently was invited

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.660
to give several lectures
about his work at the library.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:03.480
He was asked in effect, to
take on a role of photographer

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:06.070
in the residence, in
the hope that some day,

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:10.040
such a position might
officially be designated.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:18.950
Here is an energized Bob, during
his civil rights work in the 1960s.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:23.650
In the movement, he found that
cause that Jim just mentioned.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:28.560
He saw others give their lives, and
he felt he die for the same cause.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.500
He spoke to the cameraman, one of
these photographs ran on the cover

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.830
of News Week, and a participant

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:39.890
at the Seldom March
in the spring of 1965.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:46.090
You've already seen his most famous
photograph in Birmingham Spring,

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:50.050
1963, and he was there

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:52.880
and he witnessed how the
students wouldn't run away,

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.020
holding on to each
other for their lives.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:01.390
Bob's teacher, Alexey Brodovitch
claimed this image; quote,

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:05.310
"Seared itself into his memory".

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:08.750
Bob did not have much formal
training in photography;

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.920
his real introduction
was through his father,

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:16.660
who was a serious amateur
with a dark room at home.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.340 position:56%
Bob attended Manhattan's [inaudible]
in high school, and then [inaudible]

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.510
for a master's degree at
Columbia, he majored in Philosophy,

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.180
as we've heard, focusing
on aesthetics,

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:30.000
and continued studying about art.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.960
He spent a year at
law school at Harvard,

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:37.130
but returned to New York City,
and began talking his way

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.630
into photographer studios.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:43.360
Eventually, in 1959 he enrolled

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.480
in [inaudible] famous
design laboratory,

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.410
at the new school for
social research.

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:53.120
For an assignment, to
shoot in Times Square,

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:58.470
Bob settled on something different;
he took a graphical look down,

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:02.000
on a group of sailors
from the hotel Astor.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.540
For the assignment,
to photograph an egg,

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:09.020
Bob researched whatever [inaudible]
had done with the subject,

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.400
and then tried everything.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.960
Persevering until he
could find something

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.330
that would be uniquely his own.

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:20.470
This image of a crumbled
hard cooked egg.

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:25.740
Bob believed that besides
qualities of design, his activities

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:29.260
on photography needed
to have purpose,

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:33.030
and the purpose he found was
to fight for equal rights,

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:36.140
support justice, and
help make change

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.320
in peoples lives, for the better.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.270
He first got involved
with the Brooklyn Congress

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:46.000
of Racial Equality, and became
their national photographer.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.210
Brooklyn was where CORE
began the freedom rights.

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:56.270
As you can see, people here --
they were picketing for education,

00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:01.000
as well as a livable community
and economic opportunity;

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.480
themes that Bob would
later expand upon.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:13.360
Through the civil rights movement,
Bob met many great people; Baldwin,

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:17.690
the political thinker Michael
Harrington, but he was close --

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:19.570
closeness he felt to Doctor

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:22.770
and Reverend Martin
Luther King Junior was

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:27.300
such that Bob always
referred to him as Doc.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:32.020
He attended King's funeral in
1968 and took intimate photographs

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.920
of the family, which
have a permanent

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:38.580
in the National King
Historic site in Atlanta.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:47.050
Bob's magazine work began in
the 1960s, often dove tailed

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:51.310
with his civil rights photography,
which concerned voter drives

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:55.360
in the south, as on the
left of the man registering

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.210
in Sumter, South Carolina.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:02.000 position:56%
For Albany, he followed the Reverend
Joe Carter, the first black man

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.490
to register and vote in West
of Louisiana, and in fact,

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:11.590
I think he told you James that this
was the most dangerous situation he

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:14.120
had ever faced.

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:22.740
Bob was awarded a Guggenheim
foundation grant in 1964,

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:27.290
and here are two examples of
that work; his proposal was

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:30.730
to quote continuous work
on the efforts of Negroes

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:35.510
to achieve equality in America,
and to begin the study of poverty

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:38.930
in the context of contemporary
affluence.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:42.150
His application was supported
by Edward [inaudible],

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:48.990
who loaded the valuable project,
and Bob as a serious thinker.

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:54.020
His teacher, Brodovitch, pointed
to Bob's integrity and courage,

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:58.020
and the vitality, and
necessity of the project.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:03.560
Dorothy Norman, [inaudible] future
biographer concurred, that Bob was,

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.410
quote, "Dedicated and selfless,

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:09.760
a person of integrity,
and shows promise.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.080
It's one of the most
effective photographers

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.370
of the American social
scene" end quote.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:25.800 position:56%
On assignment, Bob was unafraid and
a charmer, with a gift for repartee.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.490
His editorial worked for
numerous magazines, included --

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:31.580
we've already heard, Look, Live,

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:35.320
New York Times magazine,
too many to say.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:39.640
The assignments were very
varied, and these are from a story

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.130
about the daily life of
Sumter, South Carolina Sheriff,

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:45.810
Jay [inaudible] Bornell [phonetic].

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:55.490
Bob documented this drug raid
in New York, it was for Look.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:41:01.850 position:56%
He met and photographed many people,
such as Sidney Poitier, B.B King,

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:04.450
Miles Davis, Tina Turner.

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:10.830
One of the crowds he most
enjoyed hanging out with,

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:16.670
were the pop artists;
James Rosenquist, Roy --

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:18.530 position:56%
[inaudible], Andy Warhol and others.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:23.580
Being represented by art
gallery dealer Leo Costelli.

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:26.650
For a magazine article,
Bob cleverly decided

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.770
to take Andy Warhol
grocery shopping.

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:39.160
[Inaudible] became a close
friend, Bob's love for art comes

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.910
through here, in this portrait in
which the artist stays in position

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:46.540
as the sculpture base,
bellow his own representation

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:50.480
of Brancusi's 1910 Sleeping Views.

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:59.030
Bob was a prolific producer
of more than 60 books,

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:01.670
as well as many bookazines
[phonetic],

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:05.920
continuing after he moved
from New York to Miami Beach.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:12.150
Some were his own, others were
with and for other people.

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:14.970
This collage gives you
an idea of the range

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:17.300
of these many book projects.

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:23.920 position:56%
Some unusual, as in the lower right,
even body as [inaudible] of bibles

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.530
on the lower right, the book

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:31.030
about the right bold underground
comics, as a form of fog art.

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:33.380
Bob, and the influential cartoonist

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.300
and Editor Art Spiegelman
worked on it together.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:41.120
Next to that book cover, is this
project about the Bill of Rights,

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:45.110
with the head of the American civil
liberty's union Aaron Glazer who's

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:48.630
here today, called,
Visions of Liberty.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:52.510
Never far from Bob's mind
was concerned for equality,

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:56.280
and education, and about
poverty, which eluded people

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.630
from those American values.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:04.150
Here's an example of the
graphically art full lay out,

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:07.650
that characterizes
Bob's book projects.

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:11.920
An assignment looking at children
growing up without their fathers,

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:17.800 position:56%
led in the 1970 to a serious of
small books for, and about children.

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.650
Some elevating a play,
and many finding a way

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:23.080
to improve reading skills.

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:31.300
Down Home, photographed from
1956 to 1970 and published

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:36.590
in 1971 was Bob's major
first book project,

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:41.890
it is a sociologically study of
people living in Candem, Alabama.

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:47.650
Bob continued photographing the
same people for over 30 years.

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:50.840
He intended to publish Home again,

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.170
but it became an unfinished
projects.

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:59.830
Two of the young folks Bob met in
1956 are shown on the book pages

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:04.360
on the left, and on the right
is how he found those two girls,

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.750
ten years later.

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:09.080
Bob was looking for
positive results,

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:13.240
from the kind of civil right
actions he had participated in.

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:18.260
In general, he was a
keen observer of process.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:21.750
There would be more of
this kind of photography.

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:27.700
The better man of America
was Bob's focus.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:31.860
The next America, in 1974
was a project Bob did

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.910
with Michael Herrington,
whom he had met

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:36.260
through his earlier work with CORE.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:40.170
Harrington had written the other
America, which had had an impact

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:44.640
on the Kennedy administration,
this time he and Bob would update

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.180
that book with the decline
and rise of the United States.

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:57.070
Bob was always showing America
how he saw it, and then attempting

00:44:57.070 --> 00:45:00.830
to do something about making
life in America better.

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:05.350
He was putting his photographs
to use for social causes,

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:10.110
how the other half still lived was
a petition to President Carter,

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:14.240
to pay attention to the South
Bronx, done under the auspices

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.810
of the Philps [inaudible]
Foundation.

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:20.790
The library borrowed a rare
copy of these photographs,

00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:22.580
for its recent exhibition,

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.650
highlighting the mock
breaking journalism

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:26.310
of Jacob Breeze [phonetic].

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:28.820
Brezze's [Inaudible] original how
the other half [inaudible] gave

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:32.710
voice to the New York City
ten amends, of the 1880s.

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:40.450
You can see that Bob was all
about America, here's a glance

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:43.870
at the great American past time.

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:45.690
Bob's study of the
Pittsburgh [inaudible],

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:50.250 position:56%
as was during this season, following
the death of Roberto Clemente,

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:54.530
who was killed in a
plane crash in 1972.

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:56.820
It featured their all star player,

00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:01.790
and left fielder Willie
Stargell, during the 1973 season.

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:06.120
As you can see, Bob got
into the game himself.

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:14.390
Bob's own involvement in
things is most clearly seen

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:19.670 position:56%
in the diet, which examined obesity.

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:22.920
He produced photographs on
this subject for Esquire

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:27.250
and for the London Sunday
Times on 1979 to 80.

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:31.480
He took on, on an experimental
diet himself, he exercised,

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:37.020
and under doctor's care
lost 100 pounds in a year.

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:42.570
Bob relished the outcome, and
was never more proud of anything

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:48.430
than this [inaudible] group of
photographs he made of himself.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:55.130
As you can see, Bob
liked to observe process.

00:46:55.130 --> 00:47:01.510
He followed how artist worked,
with close friend Roy Lichtenstein;

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:07.430 position:56%
he was on set, as the artist applied
color, outline and dot matrixes

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:12.030
for a mural size view,
of an iconic Oval office.

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:14.330
Bob delighted in watching
the artist work.

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:22.070
Carver County, produced in 1990
is a unique visual biography

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:24.980
of the short story
writer Raymond Carver.

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:27.820
Carver's letters and
poems provided the texts,

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:32.050
and Bob's photographs helped
us match those gritty words,

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:35.600
with images of the
bleak, blue colored towns

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.770
of the author's native
Pacific North West.

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:46.180
I'd say that Visions of
Liberty, from the early 1990s,

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:48.800
summarizes what Bob stood for.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.140
And the body of photographs
he left us.

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:56.840
Native American children in
the south west or women's march

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:03.950
on New York City, a protestor
at an anti-Vietnam War rally,

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:09.960
a family supporting gay rights.

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:14.070
One of Bob's most popular
images, is this one,

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:19.780
taken at the People's wall, at the
IBM at the world's fair in Queens

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:24.840
in 1964, it is been
interpreted as a statement

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:28.860
about race and class in America.

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:32.870
Actually, this image revels
-- or reveals, I should say --

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:37.400
Bob's delight in technology
and humanity.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:43.390 position:56%
He has manipulated his camera, so
as to flatten the ceiling for a ride

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:46.670
that actually was on an incline.

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:52.290
The people appear wary, or excited
as they're about to be sucked

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:58.240
up into an ovoid multi-screen
theater, designed by Charles Eames,

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:03.220
in order to view a film about
design in the technological age.

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:12.770
Bob's career epitomizes what Ralph
Ellison said about his work, quote,

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:18.090
"It moves into the rear sneer,
where in technical ability

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:23.930
and social vision combined
to create a work of art."

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:27.890
His archive now joins
forces with the Library

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:31.890
of Congress's great collections,
which preserves the contributions

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:36.460
to our society, of Ellison, leaders
of the civil rights movement,

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:39.710
and the designers Charles
and Ray Eames,

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:43.010
among so many other
American creators.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:46.240
His work will continue
to have a place

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:51.650
in American history alongside
his heroes, and ours.

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:58.040
We can just imagine that the
ever smiling, serious, wild,

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:01.520
devilish Bob would be joyful now.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:07.770
[ Applause ]

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:21.560
&gt;&gt; Ann Beattie: Those were
really wonderful talks,

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:33.130
I've been sitting here
so lost that I forgot

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:35.240
that I have to get [inaudible].

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:42.750
Yes. Bob, well, Bob and I met in
New York City, I believe in 1981,

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:48.690
I was living there with my dog,
and I didn't know about Bob's work,

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:50.700 position:56%
but I certainly did know his images.

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:55.030
And when I got to know Bob, I got
to know his work very well indeed,

00:50:55.030 --> 00:51:00.420
but he came to photograph
me for a cover of a magazine

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.380
that folded over the weekend.

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:05.120
So, it was a wonderful cover shot,
I can still see it, with that,

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:10.120 position:56%
I could've brought it today, but
that's something I've lost track of.

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:13.640
But, that's really how we
got to be friends, and then,

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:17.680
after New York City, when our
lives went different places,

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:21.680
we were just never out of touch, we
did still sometimes work together.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.010
When I first met Bob, we
worked together a bit more,

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:29.190
because he was always kind enough
to have me be the, you know,

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:33.230
the sudden famed epiphany, "I
know who should do this assignment

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:35.030
with me, the writer should be --

00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:38.410
long pause, and then he got so the
editor would fill it in, and say,

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:42.860
"Write Ann" yes, "Send Ann again"
but then, I married my husband,

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:44.160
and my husband sort of got --

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.180
began the unofficial driver
for all of these adventures.

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:49.870
Bob was the photographer,
I was the writer.

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:55.050 position:56%
One of the things that really
interested me about Bob, was that --

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:58.310
yes, I'm a writer, and you
can't be that, I think,

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:01.050
without having a somewhat
visual sense of the world,

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:06.830
even if your tools are words, but
if Bob and I did the same thing

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:09.920
of an evening, if it was just
the most ordinary kind of thing,

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:13.090
just going to a dinner and
getting a bite to eat or something.

00:52:13.090 --> 00:52:18.360
I would sometimes say to
him, "Wow, did you see that?

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:23.710
That sort of broke chair
that was up there, you know,

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:26.690
above the wing's coding
[phonetic]" and he'd say, "Yes,

00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:29.550
yes" and I'd say, "Oh"
because it was right --

00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:31.140
over your back shoulder,
and he'd say, "Yes, yes.

00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:32.880
I saw it when I walked
in, and it was another one

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.090
on the bottom right" -- OK.

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:37.510
Then he'd say to me, "Did
you hear that discussion

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:39.520
about the people who
were breaking up?"

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:44.700 position:56%
and I'd say, "No" and then, he would
narrate all of that for me too.

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:46.900
So, you know, it does
make sense in a way,

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:51.440 position:56%
because he was very butch known,
and very hugely talented, obviously,

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:53.860
as a documentary photographer.

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:57.290
But, his interest was on
watching things in lapse of time,

00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:58.960
and if you where with
him personally,

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:02.190
this is nearly anecdotal, but,
you know, you would get to know --

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:05.870
no response, I mean, it
was almost like, you know,

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:08.560
he was holding the cards close to
the vest, because he didn't want

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:12.110
to say anything that might in
some way, take away from it

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:15.750
as a potential image, or as what
it was to him, and you can --

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:18.180
writers know this too, you
can talk something away.

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:20.590
I mean, that's the way we
talk about it sometimes.

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:23.470
So, a writer doesn't necessarily
like to paraphrase their work,

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:26.300
because you fell like,
"Well, is that all I wrote

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:30.420
or I'm just giving the
highlights of that plot?"

00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:34.070
but he was in name with the maze,
certainly he was -- as we, now --

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:36.820
I'm just curious to know, how many
of you in the audience in one way

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:38.700
or another professionally,
or personally --

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.950
how many people here
actually knew Bob?

00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:44.930
Oh, like -- lots of
people, yes, yes.

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:49.780
OK. Well, it is a big group, but
that -- that's very interesting.

00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:52.260
I think the thing that, you
know, I would say to someone

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:56.710 position:56%
who didn't know Bob, though, was
abundantly clear in the work anyway,

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:59.020
but still maybe should
be remarked upon,

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:02.330
and that is how really
hard he worked.

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:04.500
I mean, if my husband
and I were visiting Bob,

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:07.490
I got up to the bathroom
at 4:00 at the morning,

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:11.380
the computer screen was glowing,
he was sending something somewhere,

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:14.790
and he was before us at the
morning, and after us at night.

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:18.450
And that was just around the house
that was just keeping up with a lot

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:24.040
of the work that he had to do with
his wonderful assistant, but --

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:27.490
You know, the sheer vigor,
and the amount of energy

00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:30.140
that Bob spent was
absolutely amazing.

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:33.030 position:56%
Because he certainly could've
rested on his laurels at some point,

00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:35.890
he could've said, "Please, come to
my studio for me to make a portrait

00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:38.740
of you, Doctor King"
no kidding, I mean,

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:41.830
it wouldn't mean how famous
you were, that is what a lot

00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:45.870
of photographers do, and perhaps
do well, and get what they want

00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:49.420
out of those things, but
Bob always wanted chance

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:51.690
to be the thing that intervened.

00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:56.590
And that's not so likely to happen
if you're set up in your studio,

00:54:56.590 --> 00:55:00.730 position:56%
I mean, somewhat, but certainly not
like being in Birmingham, come on --

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:02.890 position:56%
that's just a very different matter.

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:07.430
But I think, it was always
that reflexive me that Bob had

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:12.620
to be surprised, whether
for the better or for worse,

00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:16.060
it really got him like out
of the streets so many times,

00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:19.110 position:56%
when he wasn't just doing the things
that we all have to do to follow

00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:22.670
through on, you know, the things
that we've gotten in the scene,

00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:24.880
or registered in our
minds at the moment.

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:28.030
So, he was really among many
hard-working people I've known,

00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:29.330
surely we all have.

00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:31.880
He was really one of
the most hard-working,

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:35.330
and always with such
a sense of generosity

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:37.940
and sincerity about him too.

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:42.350
He of course had his own cosmos,
and we talked to each other

00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:46.360
in short end, or we just went like
that to the other, because we were

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:49.400
so sick of the other's different
opinions, or whatever we did.

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.440
But if you heard about
Samantha, it didn't need

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:53.270
to be said that, "My
daughter Samantha".

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:56.580
If you've heard about John, there
was only one John in the universe

00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.020
that was Baldwin's guard.

00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:01.160
If you've heard about Ira, you knew
perfectly well it was [inaudible].

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:05.560
I mean, these people were always
on the back of Bob's mind though,

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:09.920
and I think that is a thing that's
true of artist -- visual artist --

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:13.350
artist in any medium is that, you
know, they really want to think

00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:18.370
of themselves too, as bolstered by
and contextualized by their peers,

00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:21.380
or their betters -- see, it
felt to that broader edge.

00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:24.890
And so, you know, that was an
important thing for Bob, to --

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:27.210
I do want to say, though,
that I seemed to me,

00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:29.840
I don't know if this will ring
a bell or not with those of you

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.050
who knew him, but it
took me a long time

00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:34.590
to just realize there's a simple
truth about Bob, which is,

00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:38.020
that he was one of those guys that
would always keep you waiting,

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:40.930
he could wear 10 wrist
watches and, you know,

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:46.670
a stopwatch around his neck -- he
was always late, he never could get

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:47.970
out of the house in time.

00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:50.200
I mean maybe he didn't get out
of the house the whole day,

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.120
when you were waiting
at the front door.

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.840
But it took me a long
time to realize that.

00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:57.860
Professionally, he was up
for anything, you know,

00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:00.060
OK a meteor is coming
down in the middle

00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:02.210
of this protest march,
what do I photograph?

00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:06.670
You know? He absolutely wanted
that, he wanted that intrusion

00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:10.660
of the real world in a lot of
ways, but personally speaking,

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:14.560
I think the way he tried to keep a
handle on things, maybe, you know,

00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:17.390
maybe very stern kind
of grip that he had,

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:21.020
was that he would not be
made to conform to the clock,

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:24.170
he would not be made to get going,

00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:27.510
even if he might miss
what he needed to get to.

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:29.760
He hated transitions.

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:34.070 position:56%
I just realized that, very recently,
that he would do almost anything,

00:57:34.070 --> 00:57:35.930
including, look [phonetic] bad,

00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:39.900 position:56%
get yelled at because he simply
didn't want to tolerate transitions,

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:43.650
and I don't just say that
anecdotally, I say it in terms of,

00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:47.720 position:56%
you know, the things that we all do,
that maybe we're not so aware of,

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:52.230
or that maybe not quite as easy
to discern is that about Bob,

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:55.370
but we all have these things that
we do to give us a little handle

00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:58.900
on the world, and to feel like,
yes, things are always complicated,

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:03.260
but we have to take -- we have
to watch ourselves, we have to,

00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:05.140
you know, we have to be mindful.

00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:06.910
And he was all of those
things in his work,

00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:09.190
when he got there you
couldn't pry him out, either.

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:11.600
But to get Bob out of the front
door, if you've heard that Airlock

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:15.480
that I did, here's to
you, and it's really --

00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:17.080
he was really well
leagued with that.

00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:19.920
The other thing that I
do want to say, though,

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:23.300
that I think transcends
being just an anecdote,

00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:26.350
because I was thinking,
"What will I say?

00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:28.970
I did spend so much time with him

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:33.400
in so many different circumstances"
but, one time I was the writer,

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:38.060
and Bob the photographer of course,
and we went out to photograph --

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:40.900
you all know the famous
painting, the American Gothic,

00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:44.500
Grant Wood's painting, and
we went to Eldon, Iowa.

00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:48.140
I can even remember though,
obviously, 100th anniversary

00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:50.480
of being painted, or
something like that,

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:53.510 position:56%
but it was some impressive occasion.

00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:59.020
And Life was documenting this, and
we went out there, and Bob decided

00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:02.100
that what would be very amusing
would be to have the real house

00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:05.750
in the background, and then,
a photograph of the house

00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:09.650
and he needed somebody to hold this
photograph of the house for him.

00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:14.490
Well, not at street level, that
wasn't what he wanted at all.

00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:18.300
He wanted it from up high,
but we were in Eldon, Iowa.

00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:23.630 position:56%
About as flat as this floor, and so,
no problem whatsoever, so Bob says,

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:27.470
"Come on" and climbs up on the
rental car, huge rental car,

00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:29.880
with this tripod, all these
cameras and everything,

00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.620
and he's standing there in the
middle of the car, and I said,

00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:35.240
"Come up there" -- "Yes" -- You
know, I reached just down, "OK.

00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:40.120
Great." So, I'm standing up there,
on top of the car, and you know,

00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:43.130
he's got me holding a photograph
he's already taken of the house,

00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:44.980 position:56%
like this, and holding with my hand.

00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:47.480
And he says, "Could you put your
fingers, you know, more" So,

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:51.190
I'm really kind of holding it,
really out as much in the margins

00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:58.010 position:56%
as I possibly can, I suddenly hear
-- Bob has gone down about this much

00:59:58.010 --> 01:00:01.460
on the car, you know, him
and the tripod, you know,

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:02.980
not that he ever comes
up from behind.

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:06.500
And he just goes like
this, and I say, "Bob, Bob,

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.800
I'm standing up there too."

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:12.550
OK, that's not my anecdote, that's
just another day of work with Bob.

01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:17.160
However, it turned out that I was
leaving Iowa two days before Bob

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:21.180 position:56%
was, and he said, "OK, so, you know,
the Life crew can give me a ride

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.460
to the airport, but you just
return the rental car, OK?"

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:28.930
And I said, "Well, Bob,
what am I going to say?"

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:32.020
And he said, "It's a rental car,
you know, you just -- this is --

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:37.150 position:56%
it's a rental car, you just do your
best" and I said, "Well, but I mean,

01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:40.760 position:56%
just wait and give me my license is
here" I drive the car in, and the --

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.310
and he said, "Oh no, they're
not even going to notice, who --

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:45.990
they don't look, you know,
they look at the odometer,

01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:48.140
they look at if you leave
anything in the trunk, you know?"

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:51.120
and he had such a -- he was
-- he could be so convincing,

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:54.540
and sometimes I really wanted to
believe it, did believe it, so I --

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:59.760
drove the car in, people looked as
the car is coming in to the lot.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:05.930
It's like -- the car comes into
the lot, the roof is like this,

01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:08.990
he says, "What happened?"

01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:10.860
and I said, "What happened
with what?"

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:15.170
[ Laughter ]

01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:18.030
And he said, "The roof?"

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:25.370 position:56%
and I went -- I said, "I don't know"
and he said, "Want to take a guess?"

01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:28.280
and I said, "A meteor?"

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.580
I did.

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:30.880
[ Laughter ]

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:35.290
And then, of course that all turned
out all right, at least for me,

01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:38.400
because Bob would just say, "Oh,
it's, you know, it's working for,

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.980
you know, the magazine, they
understand you have these sort

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:44.720
of setbacks on assignment, and
you just do the best you can" So,

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.050
he was really an artist,
he was not just

01:01:47.050 --> 01:01:50.470 position:56%
out there [inaudible] believe me, he
was really doing the best he could

01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:54.750
and we've seen such
absolutely amazing things today.

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:59.940
I just -- to leave you with one
very brief quote, because Bob was

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:03.340
so modest that if anyone
complimented or anything like that,

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:09.580 position:56%
he would never hear about it, but in
the famous photograph of Birmingham

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:12.260
with the fire hose -- with
the fire hydrants opened,

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:14.800
and the hoses strained on
the people, and so forth.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.640
What Bob said about that day was,

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.740
"There was as much water behind
the cameras, as there was in front

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:22.910
of it" and you know, it's
just an amazing photograph,

01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:24.790
and he hung in there
too, to get that.

01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:27.170
They weren't letting him just
stand here, like they didn't see

01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:28.850
that he was there, you know?

01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:31.080
Very brave person as well.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.580
So, he did, he got that
wonderful photograph, and then,

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.830
which I didn't know
until fairly recently,

01:02:35.830 --> 01:02:37.880
he printed it up fairly
quickly and gave it

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:43.290
to Doctor Martin Luther King, and
he said, about that photograph,

01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:47.810 position:56%
"I'm startled that had so much pains
and beauty came" So, when you say,

01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:50.900
you know, does it do any social
good, does it not overall?

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:55.150
I'm sure from time to time, if
not constantly, tortured by that,

01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:56.450 position:56%
and what we're doing, you don't have

01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:58.460
to be an artist to
be tortured by that.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:01.330
Well, what I do, you
know, really mattered,

01:03:01.330 --> 01:03:04.110
but I think it was
certain comments like that,

01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:08.040
that were tremendously encouraging
to Bob, and really just write

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.710
on as far as I'm concerned.

01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:11.510
So, thank you.

01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:15.940
