&gt;&gt; Recorded Message:
From the Library

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.260
of Congress in Washington, DC:

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.193
&gt;&gt; Please welcome Professor
Edward O. Wilson.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.510
[ Applause ]

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.416
&gt;&gt; Edward O. Wilson: Thank you.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.683
[ Background Noise ]

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.350
.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.550
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much [inaudible].

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.283
And thank you all for coming.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.750
This has been a wonderful
day for me.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.883
I'm sure it has been for you, if
you could stand the Washington heat.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.350
[ Laughter ]

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.853
&gt;&gt; I would, I think, most
appropriately address the writing,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.646
and meaning, and the goals,
that I had been writing a novel

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.590
for the first time in my life.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.653
After the first book I wrote,
after 43 years of non-fiction,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.226
more than 25 books, and
after 42 years at Harvard,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.503
teaching undergraduates in science,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.150
its evolutionary [inaudible]
biology, I decided to venture

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.190
across the great boundary
of the creative arts --

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.333
into the creative arts,
and write a novel.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.150
I think it's a fairly rare
thing for a scientist,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.616
particularly a lifelong
scientist, to make that journey,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.710
to take that dare,
to undergo that risk.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.256
Because more than one critic,
most of them have been friendly,

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.003
a critic has said, I risked a
lot by doing that, and now I want

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.216
to tell you why I did it.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.556
But first before I do, I'll tell
you a broad outline of the --

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.416
give you a broad outline
of that book, <i>Anthill</i>,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.953
published March of this year.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.843
The story is really basically a
coming of age story of a young boy

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.043
in Alabama, south Alabama, I guess,
that part is autobiographical.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.823
And I should add right now that one
of my reasons for writing it was,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.133
after being away from
Alabama for 60 years

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.220
where I grew up; I
wanted to go home.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.393
I can't pick up and
leave Harvard right away,

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.616
so I take frequent visits there,
and I decided to write and film,

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.903
that's one of the motivations
for writing it.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.630
And I have just finished a history
of Mobile in collaboration with one

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.776
of America's great photographers,
Alex Harris [assumed spelling].

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.463
We will bring that out next
year in which I celebrate,

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.430
and also present very frank
pictures in the history of Mobile

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.543
from Desoto [assumed
spelling] to the Oil Spill.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.863
I've enjoyed writing that,
and that brought me back home.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.460
But one of the main reasons that
I undertook to write this book was

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
with Harper Lee in mind, and I
incidentally recently was able

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.780
to visit Harper in her home in
Monroeville, not Nell Harper Lee,

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.596
she does not see many visitors.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.410
But I managed to get in there.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.010
We had a wonderful talk.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.743
I had heard my -- just 50
years ago, she published,

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.806
<i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, and
it had an enormous impact,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.920
in part because it's an
extraordinarily good book...

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.320
[ Laughter ]

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.730
&gt;&gt; ...and an extraordinarily
good movie was made of it.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.310
But also it came at the cusp
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.643
And it brought, in novelistic form,

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.660
to vivid clarity what
the difficulties were

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.923
that faced the South,
and its deep divisions.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.753
Now [inaudible] coming out of that.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.100
And now we have entered a new crisis

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.156
of which southerners
are only vaguely aware.

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.476
And that crisis is the reckless
destruction of their environment,

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.450
of many of their expendable,
nonexpendable,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.186
non-replaceable resources to be
sure, including not least the water;

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.763
but also the precious
natural environments

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.866
that they have inherited
which include the species

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.360
for species first where meter,
the richest botanical environment

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.536
in numbers of species of any
place on the northern hemisphere.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.350
And I'll be not many of
you know what that is.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.816
It's the picture plant logs that
are sprinkled throughout the South,

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.903
with as many as 70 species of
plants all crowded together

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.830
in one square meter, beating
anything in a tropical rain forest.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.020
But the South has so
much else in it:

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.160
the great long leaf pine
savannah that once covered 60%

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.326
of the [inaudible] of the South,
rich from one end of the Carolina's

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.460
to the Texas in beauty and in
variety of species, almost all cut

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.796
down but now [inaudible].

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.190
So our young man growing up in
southern Alabama discovers one

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.370
of the remaining old growth patches
of old long leaf pine savannah;

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.616
and because he's a lonely kid,
and he loves to roam in the woods,

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.300
and because he comes in contact
quite early with a mentor,

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.263
a professor in ecology coming

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.463
up from Florida State who's
studying this patch scientifically,

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.156
he becomes deeply bonded
to that land.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.923
And then as he matures, to
the idea of doing something

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.900
to save this particular tract,
and then other parts of the South

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.063
so rapidly disappearing
before a thoughtless onslaught

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.486
of unplanned development.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.530
And so he does.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.726
And that's the major
part of the book.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.933
It unfolds as our young Raphael
Semmes Cody [assumed spelling],

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.376
his mother named him after
Admiral Raphael Semmes,

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.436
the great naval hero
of the Civil War.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:43.110
She does that partly because
she's a social climber,

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.650
or at least she's trying to
get back at the highest levels

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.096
in Mobile society, which
includes the Mobile Semmes family,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.746
and she's married below her station,
as a head strong young woman

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.136
and now she realizes
that she's not --

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:05.670
doesn't belong anymore
exactly where she grew up,

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.136
and she's trying to
work her way back in.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.870
That's another -- that's a sub plot.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.723
But any rate, young
Cody finds the way.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.953
He has to deal with the developers
in a novel fashion, and in dealing

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.990
with them, he had to go
through law school first.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.653
And he finds a solution to
[inaudible] beyond the juggernaut

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.430
of development and combine goals of
conservationists and of developers

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:42.163
in a way to create a win-win
situation, not a complete victory.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.630
He also has to deal with a
radical right evangelical cult.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.560
It is now we get into
the messy part of the --

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:55.380
the brutal part of the novel,
and I won't go into that.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.113
I'll leave that for those
of you interested to find

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:00.533
out how it happens,
and how it's resolved,

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.840
in the course of this book.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.786
He has to study the treasure
tract that he has become familiar

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.063
with in more detail for
his college honors work.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.876
And then he's introduced
to the anthills.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.190
These are one of the many
species of ants in this tract

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.103
that have never been studied,
and so we stepped out to do it --

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.576
and some might add are not just
runny little specks running

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.366
around at your feet, but
they make up a two thirds

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.806
of the biomass of all the insects.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.880
If you take the insects, all the
insects of a region, of a plot,

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.710
and weigh them, two
thirds of that --

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.676
in other words this is an ant's
world that we're living in,

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.763
and it's been an ant's
world for 150 billion years.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.286
They own the earth.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.786
Ants are among the little things
that rule the world, so --

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.526
and they also have the most
complex social behavior outside

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.646
of human beings.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.446
So with little or young
Raphael Semmes Cody,

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.336
I take you into the
world of the ants,

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:22.940
and for the first time
this full quarter

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.273
of the book show you what
ants really are doing,

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:33.190
how they are organized, how
they are communicating, and --

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.793
it's like studying
society on another planet.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:42.073
And you get the first realistic
view of these ants as they display

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.053
to one another in tournaments,
run colony against colony,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.133
like military squadrons or
parades passing one another

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.716
to demonstrate their
strength when they go to war.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.050
It's all out in one,
light's out the other.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.133
They come in epic dimension when
you get down with them in cycles.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.433
Civilization after civilization
speeded up to turn over two,

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.603
three or five years, and I hope
you like -- find that interesting.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.663
But now we really come to
this matter of a red flag

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:25.510
to my fellow southerners, namely now
is the time to save what we have.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.586
I hope this is a message that
can be seen as global too,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.480
because in the current
environmental movement,

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.976
we find success beginning
-- we are turning green;

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.590
it is a pastel green globally.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:49.130
But most of it is focused, and this
is true of political life on --

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:56.883
a cynical environment on -- the
depletion of natural resources,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.293
on evolution, on climate change.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.196
And so we know all those things,
we do now, and we worry about them.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.750
But we have the neglected
disproportionately the living

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:12.500
environment, and the massive
destruction going on of ecosystems,

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.566
of species, many of them
millions of years old.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.863
Each one exquisitely
adapted to its environment.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:23.526
We're wiping them out without even
in many cases knowing what they are.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.140
So I propose Wilson's Law
modestly, Wilson's Law,

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.510
and this has been mentioned in the
New York Times; and I don't want

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.416
to mention this in
the presence of one

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.620
of the forces of the
Washington Post.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:43.693
But I would say that since it's been
mentioned in the New York Times,

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.393
Wilson's Law has, then
it must be true.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:55.850
[ Laughter ]

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.450
&gt;&gt; Well anyway, Wilson's Law says:
If you save the living environment,

00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:59.050
our ecosystems, the best of life,

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:01.826
you will automatically save
the [inaudible] environment.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.490
Because you can't save the living
environment unless you take those

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.656
measures that make the physical
environment sustainable.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.550
But if you save only the
physical environment,

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.370
and you ignore the living, then
you ultimately will lose them both.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.890
So this is the message I take
to my fellow southerners.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.263
I'm very active incidentally
in their conservation movements

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.213
down there, and I go and am
gradually reasserting myself,

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.556
and I'm using every method
I can to sell the message.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:52.210
And I'm using the Billy Sunday
[assumed spelling] method: lectures,

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.313
books, [inaudible], letters,
so on, and now the novel.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.883
Because ladies and gentleman,

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.913
people respect nonfiction,
but they read novels.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.750
[ Laughter ]

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:13.216
&gt;&gt; So this is the Billy
Sunday method.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:15.750
[ Laughter ]

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:17.883
&gt;&gt; Do everything.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:19.283
Do whatever you can,
give a little bit.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.813
And I chose Billy Sunday because
I've had a record of Billy Sunday

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.020
in the 1920's giving one
of his great sermons,

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.280
and I'm going to give it to you in
his words, in his accent right now.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.500
[ In a thick southern accent ]

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.633
&gt;&gt; Oh I hate him.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.346
I hate him so much,
I'm going to fight it

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.053
until I can't move my arms no more;

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.976
and when I can't move my arms no
more, then I'm going to bit him.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:49.426
And when all my teeth are
gone, I'm going to gum him.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:52.900

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.300

I have been doing.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.366
&gt;&gt; And that is why I dared
cross from the safe havens

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.683
of fact based non-fiction into
the wild and wooly wilderness

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:14.910
of the creative arts,
and that novel.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.910
And I'd now love to take
some questions or comments.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.620


00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:28.650
Yes?

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:30.650
&gt;&gt; Yes. Hello.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:33.316
I almost feel like I need to
apologize for this question

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:34.316
because it's of a highly
personal nature.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.850
But I feel a real need to ask it,

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:41.516
because I have the opportunity
to have your presence.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:43.170
When you have someone like Steven
Hawking, who, after a lifetime

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:49.890
of exploring the field of
astrophysics, seems to have decided

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:54.490
that the idea of the existence of
God is a fiction, not a non-fiction.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.466
I was wondering, after a lifetime
in exploring the field of biology,

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.550


00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.256
what are your ideas on that issue?

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.990


00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.416
&gt;&gt; Edward O. Wilson: I'm a scientist
who tries to base personal beliefs

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.836
on fact, and on defensible theory.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.923
I think without any credit is one
way or the other about his opinion,

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.776
Mr. Hawkins has stepped
outside the boundary

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.630
and the clear responsibility
of a well-known scientist.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.670
[ Applause ]

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:35.670
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.670


00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:40.666
&gt;&gt; Ginger: Dr. Wilson,
my name is Ginger.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:42.916
And hello from your friends
at Triple A-S by the way.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:45.683
&gt;&gt; Edward O. Wilson: From where?

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.350
&gt;&gt; Ginger: From Triple A-S.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.150
&gt;&gt; Edward O. Wilson: Oh.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:51.683
&gt;&gt; Ginger: Good to see you here.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:54.750
This is wonderful.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.950
You talked about all of your efforts

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:58.883
to help save the physical
environment in the South,

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.083
and I was just curious how
somebody could get involved

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.350
in whatever you're
doing if they wanted to.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:04.120
Is there an official
organization or...?

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.313
&gt;&gt; Edward O. Wilson: Yeah.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.246
That requires a rather lengthy
answer but I -- let me just say --

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:14.313
pick your -- the geographic area
you'd like to get involved in,

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.343
and get directly involved
in any one of them directly;

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.996
and that would be one of the great
global conservation organizations

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:23.470
of which there are approximately
four that I would recommend,

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.503
but will not because
of the possibility

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.083
of [inaudible] comparison.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:33.343
But then of course there
are also national ones,

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.890
there are regional ones,
and there are action groups

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.036
within each community which
are focusing directly,

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.713
and with direct action on
particular environmental problems:

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.406
saving a last tract of some kind
of precious woodland, a lake,

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.316
or helping to protect
a species that's right

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.050
on the brink, and so on.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:01.050
There's [inaudible]
opportunities, and I wish you well.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:04.450


00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:07.870
We need you.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.270
[ Inaudible audience talking ]

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.626
&gt;&gt; Edward O. Wilson: I'm -- Oh.

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.620
I'm sorry.

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.086
Yeah. I didn't realize
there were two.

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:24.570
Yes.

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:27.510
&gt;&gt; My favorite book by you is,
<i>Biophilia</i> and I was really struck

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:28.813
when I read the book, about the
deep connection that you talked

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.380
about between the human race and
nature, our great love for nature,

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.786
and our deep connections to it.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.200
And because I'm a teacher, I
wonder what you would say about how

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.700
that should impact education,
about teaching young people?

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.603
&gt;&gt; Edward O. Wilson: I think that
the idea -- you mentioned the word,

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.403
<i>Biophilia</i> and that's now
solidly routed in science.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:02.270
It's become a major study in
areas of psychology and biology.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.043
There's also a basophilic
architecture movement and --

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:09.470
so I think that would
be an excellent --

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.716
if I were teaching at
say, the secondary level,

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.680
I would consider using the idea
of basophilic, and what it means

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.160
to the human mind and human
history; I'd combine that with hands

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.330
on work -- especially
in the environment

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:35.130
where you can actually go out
and make actual discoveries.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.013
And that would be how I would --

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:40.276
that's how I personally would
like to talk to young people,

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:48.376
and to get them interested in
science as well as the environment.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:51.670
Sir.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:56.270
&gt;&gt; I've enjoyed reading your
writings for quite awhile.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.206
On the question of conservation,
and a lot of other things,

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:03.356
I've noticed that there's a lot of
discussion out there about trying

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:05.266
to do things on a grand scale,
climate change, a lot of things

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:08.383
like that with the
fairly large, essentially,

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:15.470
takings of natural lands through
things like cities, suburbia, etc,

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:17.890
I'm wondering -- I'd be interested
in your opinions on how much all

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:24.590
of us can actually do
in our own little areas,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.400
like in our own lots then, and what
the sum total of that could end

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.690
up being, compared to, for
example, a major national thing

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:35.816
where it's unlikely a lot

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.156
of this legislation will
actually come to pass.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.833
But for example, planting native
species instead of non-native lawns,

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.973
a wide variety of things like that.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.293
&gt;&gt; Edward O. Wilson: Sir we know
with increasing precision what needs

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.433
to be done to save the environment
and we know what big steps can be,

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.473
and what little steps can be.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.073
And we further know that
there's nothing more powerful

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.746
than people becoming
the boots on the ground

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:16.176
and actually changing the
policy at different levels,

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.170
but including the levels
where they are the most,

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:21.403
can be the most effective.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:25.836
And as that proceeds
[sound skips] the totality

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.360
of our common effort [sound skips]
huge amount will be achieved.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.976
But, in addition, we will
be developing an electorate

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:40.156
that puts the pressure upward
into our political leaders

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:48.403
to create the policy of
legislation and the executive action

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.510
that makes the big changes possible.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:56.110


00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:57.963

Sorry about that.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.430
&gt;&gt; Dr. Wilson, I've been reading
your books for quite a time.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.096
Your book that you co-authored
of the ant I think is one

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.963
of the high points of
publishing in the past 30 years.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.136
But it was more the question of,
are you and Catherine [sound skips]

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:21.103
who came to the sciences the way you
did, which is through just the love

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.320
of the natural world and
then working your way

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.160
up into the formal science.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:26.460
I have one friend who's a
professor, a biology teacher,

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.393
and he came the same
way as a farm boy.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:35.590

are there in large numbers wishing,

if the positions were open, that
science and teaching and technology,

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:08.216

opening, they really will come in,

kind of passion in large numbers.
