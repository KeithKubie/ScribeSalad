00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.340
When you think about Lyme disease you probably
think of this, a tick.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.180
Or maybe more specifically, a tick bite. Which is not wrong, you should.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.040
But what exactly is it about a tick bite that
makes us sick?

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.480
This is Borrelia burgdorferi, one of many
bacteria that ticks can pass onto humans and

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.210
the one responsible for Lyme disease.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.760
It causes an array of symptoms, which can
be anything from fatigue, arthritis, facial

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.320
palsy and occasionally a bulls-eye rash. (Erythema
migrans, if you want to get technical).

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.880
We’ve only known about the pathogen since
the early 1980’s, but it’s been around

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.780
for much longer than that...potentially for
thousands of years longer.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.010
Traces of its effects were even found in Otzi
the Iceman, the 5,300-year old hunter found

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.440
mummified in the Italian Alps.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.710
But while we’re not sure exactly where and
when Borrelia originated, we do know a lot

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.780
about how the disease works and how it’s
spread.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.410
My name is Raphael Stricker.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.489
I'm a medical doctor. I practice in San Francisco.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.400
I have more than 4000 Lyme disease patients in my
practice.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.980
And I've written more than 200 papers about Lyme disease.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.180
Ticks have been called sewers of infection.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.340
Anything that they feed on they can pick up
and transmit to you.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.650
These “sewers of infection” need blood
to survive.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.580
Sometimes that’s bird blood, sometimes that’s
reptile blood, but a lot of the time its mammal

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.230
blood, like mice and deer.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.270
If a tick feeds on one of those animals and
they are infected with the bacteria, the tick

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.700
will carry it and then spread it to other
animals, who then spread it to other ticks,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.790
and so on.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.320
Occasionally, those ticks spread the disease
to us, and they do that by passing the pathogen

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.310
through the tick’s saliva, which some people
call a pretty fascinating substance.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.670
Tick saliva is really a pretty fascinating
substance.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.670
It has several components.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.120
One is it has an anesthetic that numbs the
bite site so that the person doesn't know

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.120
that he or she is being infected.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.270
It also has an anticoagulant that keeps the
blood from clotting so that the tick can feed

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.330
continuously at that site. And then it also
has this immunosuppressive substance that

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.640
suppresses the immune response at the bite
site so that the host can't fight off the infection.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.400
And it's been shown that a tick bite can inject
about 70,000 bacteria with the lyme bacteria,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.939
so you're getting a pretty hefty dose of this spirochete, it's called a spirochete, with a tick bite.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:24.700
So, what does Borrelia burgdorferi actually
do to your body?

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.080
Technically....nothing.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.920
The bacteria itself doesn’t harm your cells,
but your body knows the pathogen shouldn’t

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.650
be there, so it launches an all-out assault.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.310
Your immune system will first try to fight
off disease by targeting proteins on the bacteria’s

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.140
cell walls, but the spirochete can just change
which proteins it expresses and evade detection.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.640
So, so much for that idea.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.890
Then, as the pathogen moves through your bloodstream
to other parts of your body, your immune system

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.980
continues to fight it by producing cytokines,
which work to regulate your immune system

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.849
and produce inflammation.This inflammation
then occurs in the areas that the bacteria

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.359
travels to, which, depending on the strain
of Borrelia, can occur in the joints, muscles,

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:02.969
heart and even the brain.

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:06.670
But due to the bacteria’s ability to evade
detection, this inflammation does nothing

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.040
to destroy it and everything to make you feel
sick.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.280
So that's what really causes the symptoms.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.209
It's not the bacteria per say it's the body's
response to the bacteria that causes a lot

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.470
of these symptoms.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.400
Basically, Borrelia burgdorferi isn’t doing
much of anything other than trying to survive

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.579
in its host.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.090
Well my medical school teacher told me not
to anthropomorphize you know bacteria,

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.780
basically I mean the goal is to survive.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.019
The goal of any bacteria or any organism is
to survive.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.000
So Borelia has evolved a way to do that that's very efficient.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Of course, we're doing whatever we can to make sure the disease can't survive.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.840
Currently lyme disease is treated with antibiotics.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.480
And while a vaccine was created around 16
years ago, it’s no longer being produced

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.159
due to low usage and potential side effects.

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.069
But there is interest in developing a new
vaccine in two different ways.

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.480
One idea is to target the proteins expressed
by the Borrelia itself, which fights lyme

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.120
disease, while the other idea would involve
fighting the compounds in tick saliva, which

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.420
would fight lyme as well as a number of tickborne
diseases.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.230
Because ticks are, after all,

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.720
Sewers of infection.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.340
So, if ticks, mice, deer and any other number
of animals can be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi,

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.340
why don’t they also get Lyme disease?

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.320
So deer have a kind of protein in their blood
that kills the Lyme bacteria.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.031
And the question always comes up well why
don't why can't we put that into humans?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.540
And the answer is because humans aren't deer.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.520
So there you go, humans aren't deer.
