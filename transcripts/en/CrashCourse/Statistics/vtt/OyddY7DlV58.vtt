00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.860
Hi, I’m Adriene Hill, and Welcome back to
Crash Course, Statistics.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.920
If you’ve ever seen a face in an onion,
or a grilled cheese, or any other inanimate

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.900
object, you’ve experienced pareidolia, which
is a product of our brains that causes us

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.460
to see the pattern of a face in non-face objects.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.800
This happens because our brains are so good
at seeing patterns, that they sometimes see

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.400
them when they’re not really there, like
a face in this bell pepper.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.460
And faces aren’t the only patterns we see.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.800
Our brains recognize patterns in everything,
especially in sequences of events, like the

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.580
kind we’ll see today as we start talk about Probability.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:46.620
INTRO

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.360
Alright, first let’s just establish a more
specific definition of what probability is,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.940
because the way we use the word in everyday life can be different from how we use it in Statistics.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.700
Statisticians talk about two types of probability:
empirical, and theoretical.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.480
Empirical probability is something we observe
in actual data, like the ratio of girls in

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.270
each individual family.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.110
It has some uncertainty, because like the
samples in experiments, it’s just a small

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.520
amount of the data that is available.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.700
Empirical probabilities, like sample statistics,
give us a glimpse at the true theoretical

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.380
probability, but they won’t always be equal
to it because of the uncertainty and randomness

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.470
of any sample.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.651
The theoretical probability on the other hand,
is more of an ideal or a truth out there in

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.240
the universe that we can’t directly see.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.600
Just like we use samples of data to guess
what the true mean or standard deviation of

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.880
the population is, we can use a sample of
data to guess what the true probability of

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.910
an event is.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.051
Say you play a slot machine over and over,
you’ll be able to guess the probability

00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:53.930
of winning the jackpot by counting the number
of times you win, and dividing it by the number

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.280
of times you played.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.560
If you play 100 times and win 6 times, you can be pretty sure that the probability of getting

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.180
a jackpot is around 6/100 or 6%.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.980
Now this isn’t to say that you can rule
out that the true probability is 5% or even

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.600
10%, but you’re relatively sure that it’s
close to 6%, and not, say 99%.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.720
So, the empirical probability can be a good
estimation of the theoretical one, even if

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.580
it’s not exact.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.340
So far we’ve been talking about the probability
of just one event, but often there may be

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.470
two or more events that we want to consider,
like what if you want to know the probability

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.819
of picking a purple OR a red skittle from
a bag.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.000
The proportion of each color in a bag of Skittles
is roughly equal, 20% for each of the 5 colors.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.040
So let’s say you randomly select a Skittle
without looking.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.000
For this, we need the addition rule of probability.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.920
Since a Skittle can’t be two different colors
at once, the color possibilities are Mutually Exclusive.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.540
That means the probability of a Skittle being
red AND purple at the same time is 0.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.579
So, we can use the simplified addition rule
which says that the probability of getting

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:59.159
a Red or Purple Skittle is the sum of the
probability of getting a Red, and the probability

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.000
of getting a purple.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.660
Since we’re going to be talking a lot about
probability in the next few episodes I’m

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.800
going to introduce a little notation.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.420
Instead of writing out “the probability
of Red” we can use the notation P(Red).

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.240
The probability of getting a red OR purple
would then be written P(Red or Purple).

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.520
So far we know what the probability of Red
or Purple is, P(Red) + P(Purple), or 0.2+0.2

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.820
That equals 0.40 or 40%.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.320
I like all skittles so the probability that
I will get a skittle I like is 0.2 + 0.2 +0.2

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.840
+0.2 +0.2.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.010
That’s 100%.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.980
Good odds!

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.460
Red and Purple Skittles are mutually exclusive, but not all the events we’re interested in are.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.090
For example, if you roll a die and flip a
coin, the probability of getting a tails is

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.489
not mutually exclusive of rolling a 6, since
you can both roll a 6 and flip tails in the

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.489
same turn.

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.050
Since P(tails or 6) ≠ 0, these two events
are not mutually exclusive, and we’ll need

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.689
to adjust our addition rule accordingly.

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:05.720
The full version of the addition rule states
that P(tails or 6) = P(tails) + P(6) - P(tails and 6).

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.340
When two things are mutually exclusive, the
probability that they happen together is 0,

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.540
so we ignored it, but now the probability
of both these things happening is not zero,

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:16.630
so we’ll need to calculate it.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.500
You can see here that there are 12 possible
outcomes when flipping a coin and rolling a die.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.880
There are 6 outcomes with a tails, and 2 outcomes
with a 6.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.780
If we add all of those together we get 8,
but by looking through the chart, we can tell

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.680
that there are only 7 possible outcomes that
have either a tails or a 6.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.300
When we count T’s and 6’s independently,
we double count the outcomes that have both

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.300
If we didn’t subtract off the probability
of (tails and 6), we would double count it.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.460
Let’s put these probabilities into a Venn
Diagram we can see even more clearly why we

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.990
need to subtract P(Tails and 6).

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.720
If this Circle is all the Times we flip tails,
and this circle is all the times we roll a

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.620
6, this overlapping area is counted twice
if we simply added the two circles together.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.150
In this simple case, we could easily see what the probability of tails and 6 is, but sometimes

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.840
it’s not so easy to figure out.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.390
That’s why we have the Multiplication Rule,
which helps us figure out the probability

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.990
of two or more things happening at the same
time.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.120
Let’s say you just found out that actor
Cole Sprouse goes to your local IHOP pretty

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.860
often, and there’s a 20% chance that he’ll
be there for dinner any given night.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.520
And yeah, I know that’s not how people work
but we’re going to say that’s how Cole

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.240
Sprouse works.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.360
Anyway to top that off, your local IHOP has
a promotion where they randomly select certain

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.400
nights to be “Free Ice Cream Night” in
the hopes that customers will keep coming

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.250
back in case that night is the night.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.190
Each night there’s a 10% chance that it
will be “Free Ice Cream Night”.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.370
Now, you love ice cream and you like like
Cole Sprouse--as do we all--and your perfect

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.920
night would include them both.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.530
So you try to calculate the probability that
will happen on your visit tonight.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.210
Using the multiplication rule, multiply the
probability that Cole Sprouse will be at IHOP,

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.900
0.2, with the probability that it will be
Free Ice Cream Night, 0.1.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.280
And you come to the sad realization that there’s
only a 2% chance that you’ll get to see

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.500
Cole and get free dessert tonight.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.980
When we want to know the probability of two
things happening at the same time, we first

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:19.610
need to look at only the times when one thing--Cole
is at IHOP--is true, which is 20% of the time.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.750
Now that we reduced our options to just Cole
nights, out of all these Cole times, how often

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.430
is it free ice cream time?

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.080
Only 10% of Cole nights.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.290
10% of the original 20% leaves only a 2% chance
that both will happen at the same time.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.690
But you could always change your expectations
and calculate the probability of getting either

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.180
by using the addition rule.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.000
Cole or free Ice cream which, is calculated
by adding the probability of Cole, to the

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.420
probability of Free Ice Cream, minus the probability
of both--so we don’t double count anything.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.990
You realize that there’s a 28% chance that
something good will happen tonight, so you

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.440
decide to still go, no matter what you’re
going to get French Toast.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.390
Cole Sprouse and Free Ice Cream Night are
independent.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.840
Cole doesn’t have any secret knowledge about
when it’s Free Ice Cream Night, so it has

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.520
never affected his decision to come.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.990
Two events are considered independent if the
probability of one event occurring is not

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.270
changed by whether or not the second event
occurred.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.440
In more concrete terms, if Cole’s decision
to go to IHOP is independent of IHOP’s decision

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.530
to give out free ice cream, than the probability
of Cole showing up should be the same on both

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.720
ice cream and non ice-cream nights, since
he’s just choosing randomly.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.620
We write conditional probabilities as P(Event
1 | Event 2).

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:38.420
Conditional probabilities tell us the probability of Event 1, given that Event 2 has already happened.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:43.880
If two events are independent--like Cole and ice cream night--then we expect P(Cole | Ice Cream Night)

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.950
to be the same as just plain ole P(Cole), since the two things are unrelated.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:54.030
If P(Cole | Ice Cream) wasn’t the same as
plain ole P(Cole), then that means that Ice

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.110
Cream night might somehow affect Cole’s
decision to show up at IHOP.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:04.770
We calculate conditional probability P( Event
2 | Event 1) by dividing the probability of

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:08.840
Event 1 and Event 2 by the Probability of
Event 1.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:14.220
The role of conditional probabilities are
particularly important when we consider medical screenings.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.580
For example, when screening for cervical cancer
it used to be recommended that all adult women

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.180
get screened once a year.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.860
But sometimes the results of the screenings
are wrong.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.050
Either they can say there’s something abnormal
when there isn’t (called a false positive)

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.110
or that everything is all clear when it’s
really not (called a false negative).

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:35.459
This is exactly the kind of scenario where
knowing the likelihood that something is actually

00:08:35.459 --> 00:08:39.680
abnormal in this case cervical cancer given
that you’ve gotten positive tests results

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.300
would be useful.

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.620
That is P(Cancer | Positive Test).

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:50.060
When looking at the data of people who DON’T
have cancer, 3% will get a false positive.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:55.139
And people who DO have cancer will get false
negatives 46% of the time.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.310
This means we miss a lot.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.360
And maybe freak some people who don’t need to be freaked out.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:04.160
The logic of conditional probabilities can
help us make sense of why doctors have recently

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.769
recommended that these tests be done less
frequently in some cases.

00:09:08.769 --> 00:09:15.680
In the United States, the rate of cervical
cancer is about 0.0081%, so only about 8 in

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.800
100,000 women get cervical cancer.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.240
Using our rates of false negatives and positives,
we can see that for every 100,000 women in

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:29.240
the US, only about 4...and we’re rounding
here of the about 3,004 people with positive

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.040
tests actually had abnormal growths.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.230
That means the conditional probability of
having cancer, given that you got a positive

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:41.260
test is only 0.1%. Give or take. We're rounding.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.060
And these positive tests require expensive
and invasive follow up tests.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:50.000
And I just want to point out that conditional
probabilities aren’t reciprocal.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.900
That is to say P(Cancer|Pos Test) isn’t the same as P(Pos Test| Cancer) which would be about 50%.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.360
In real life you’re not always going to
know the probability of Cole Sprouse showing

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.380
up at the iHop--he’s unpredictable that
way.

00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:07.579
Unpredictable like ...pretty much the rest
of life.

00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:12.120
It can be very difficult to put a specific
probability on a lot of everyday situations.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.490
Like how likely it is that your teacher will
call-in sick today.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.620
Like whether or not you’re going to catch
all the red lights on your way to school.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.220
Probabilities can--as we’ve seen--require
a lot of calculations--and there’ not always

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.220
time for that.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:28.279
But that doesn’t mean they belong only on
the school-only side of your brain.

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:30.410
Say you want to go out on a Friday night with
friends.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.300
More than anything you don’t want it to
suck.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.850
Last week you wound up on the couch watching
Sandy Wexler, again.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.600
You know it’ll be hard to get tickets to
see Black Panther so you make a backup plan

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.380
just in case.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.100
You can always stream Get Out without stealing
it of course.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.629
But if you’re determined to see Black Panther
in the theater, Probability will help set

00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:51.199
your expectations.

00:10:51.199 --> 00:10:56.080
If you’ll only settle for center row tickets
you’re more likely to be disappointed.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.660
Your chance of seeing Black Panther is going
to be greater if you’re willing to settle

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.440
for whatever tickets you can get.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.520
Probabilities help us understand why it makes
sense to apply to more than one college.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.700
Why we should shouldn’t expect that the
first short story you write will be get an

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.160
A and be published in the New Yorker.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.740
And how likely it is that you’ll get mono.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.620
Given your significant other has mono.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.220
Probability can help you figure that out too.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.960
Thanks for watching. We'll see you next time.
