00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:04.166
&gt;&gt;presenter: Thanks, again, everyone for
coming to another fantastic AtGoogle event.

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:08.400
Today, we're very proud to welcome
to the Google office musician,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.333
comedian, and self-proclaimed tech geek,

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.200
Reggie Watts.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.367
[audience applauses and cheers]

00:00:14.367 --> 00:00:22.400
Yeah. [audience clapping]

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.467
Reggie is known for his borderline,
absurd comedy, if I may say so,

00:00:26.467 --> 00:00:29.266
and I think we can appreciate
that here at Google, right?

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.000
I, I mean,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.967
we've clearly got a
twisted sense of humor.

00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:34.900
Hell, we did buy ORKUT.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.233
[audience chatters]

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:39.500
And, I know someone was laughing
when we launched Lively,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.200
so we can poke fun at ourselves.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.300
If you haven't seen or heard
his work before,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.800
I'll let you experience it
firsthand in just a moment.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.900
Though, if it means anything he was
handpicked by Conan O'Brien

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.600
to be the opening act on Conan's

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.166
"Legally Prohibited from Being Funny
on Television" tour.

00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.100
[audience chuckles]

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.433
That said,
Conan is currently unemployed,

00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:04.133
and by the looks of his scraggly beard,
he's letting himself go.

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.066
So, take that as you will.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.700
But, but Reggie's comedy is distinct,
to say the least.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.266
One of the comments I've heard most
about him is that he's a comedian's comedian.

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.433
You know, like a man's man,
he's a comedian's comedian.

00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:16.266
But, what does that mean?

00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:20.700
Well, it usually means that the audience
spends the first third of the show

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.667
laughing in kind of awkward
uncomfortableness.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.433
They spend the second
part of the show laughing,

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:28.500
but not understanding why,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.266
and then they , spend the last part
of the show laughing their asses off,

00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:35.734
but it doesn't matter
what the comedian says.

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:37.867
And then there's always
about three or four people

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:40.400
laughing hysterically
throughout the entire show;

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.333
those are the other comedians
for the night.

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.633
That's what a comedian's comedian is.

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:48.133
And, and a comedian's comedian
would appreciate that joke.

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:49.934
But comedy is only one half
of the equation.

00:01:49.934 --> 00:01:53.200
Many of, many of people would call
that the "sum of what he's does."

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.500
He's much better known,
I think, as a musician;

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.900
a master of beats, tracks, loops,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.767
primarily using his own voice,

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:03.600
and a technique of beat boxing
to produce his own unique sound.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.000
Beat boxing,
for those of you who don't know,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.667
is when you use your own vocal cords

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:10.100
to produce seemingly electronic
or synthetic, sounds.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.500
If you'll allow me to demonstrate.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.734
[deep breath in]
No, that's retarded.

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:16.500
This guy's a master.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.600
I'm gonna let him do
that and after the show,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.133
once you realize that you've gotta
get your hands on more of his work,

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:24.433
once again, you can always find him
on YouTube and Vimeo.

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:25.667
But, come May 18th,

00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:28.533
he'll be releasing his new
Comedy Central special DVD,

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:29.834
"Why Shit's So Crazy."

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:32.166
So, let's welcome to the stage
Reggie Watts.

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:36.500
[applause, cheering, clapping]

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.100
Thank you, sir.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.533
&gt;&gt;Reggie: Thank you very much.

00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:43.433
Thank you.

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:48.333
Thank you so much.

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:51.667
Google has been around
for quite some time.

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:58.367
It's core application is one of
never seemingly ending stream

00:02:58.367 --> 00:03:00.066
of contemplative,

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:02.233
yet industrial,

00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:04.066
feel-good,

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:05.233
binary,

00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:07.967
nonsocial, yet social,

00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:10.967
activated premises,

00:03:10.967 --> 00:03:12.100
oriented,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.767
border controlled,

00:03:13.767 --> 00:03:17.934
butt free and open applications.

00:03:17.934 --> 00:03:19.533
And that's just the beginning.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:20.934
[laughter]

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:27.800
Google will strive over the next year
to expand its reach to 6, 322.7,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.967
as opposed to the 333 that
it's currently involved in now.

00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:35.100
Many of the search algorithms
that we're using now,

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.600
currently using the Baptiste
algorithmic phrase

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.900
for identifying non-semantic approaches

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.266
and will continue to do so
until the Wolfram|Alpha Engine becomes

00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:51.433
artificially aware of itself.
[laughter]

00:03:51.433 --> 00:03:54.333
What does this mean for Google?

00:03:54.333 --> 00:04:02.400
Where is it going and
what it be about and shit? [laughter]

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.800
Google entered the field in 1981
as one of the strongest companies

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.500
to ever emerge out of a
nontechnically-minded society.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.934
California seemed like the right place.

00:04:17.934 --> 00:04:19.433
When the creator of Google,

00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:21.967
as [inaudible] much,

00:04:21.967 --> 00:04:24.400
found himself wondering,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.533
"What could we do, electronically,

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:30.300
that would influence
and change the world?"

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.900
He came up with Google.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.500
Originally titled,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.433
"googol" for the French word
"to lay about." [laughter]

00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:45.367
I'm here to talk to you about a new project
that we will be working

00:04:45.367 --> 00:04:46.900
on over the next few months.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.667
I represent an independent
consortium of designers and engineers

00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:52.667
that are working with Google

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:58.233
to freshen up and tighten up some
of its loose projects on the fringes.

00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:03.000
Of course, some of you know
of the top secret program AE752.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.033
This is probably one of the most
anticipated projects

00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:11.300
that we've been working on,
on the sidelines.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.867
And, obviously, some people
around here are totally indifferent.

00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:20.066
But, we're very excited.
[laughter]

00:05:20.066 --> 00:05:21.767
When I was a child,

00:05:21.767 --> 00:05:24.800
I was very small.
[laughter]

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.133
Or, at least, far away.

00:05:27.133 --> 00:05:31.266
And people would say to me,

00:05:31.266 --> 00:05:34.800
"Stop doing that!"

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.567
Ok.
[laughter]

00:05:39.066 --> 00:05:44.867
[paper
rustling]

00:05:44.867 --> 00:05:48.834
What is an algorithm?

00:05:48.834 --> 00:05:55.000
An algorithm is someone
who feels good on a rainy day.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.567
It's a bowl of porridge when the rain
is soaked to our bones

00:06:00.567 --> 00:06:04.300
and we need nourishment
that is warm and comforting.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.767
An algorithm is the touch of
a baby's breath on a mother's shoulder.

00:06:09.767 --> 00:06:14.433
It is the acquiescence of a
large piece of information

00:06:14.433 --> 00:06:17.033
that identifies us as a species.

00:06:17.033 --> 00:06:20.934
It is that person from which
whence we would not know

00:06:20.934 --> 00:06:22.633
as though he would say,

00:06:22.633 --> 00:06:26.633
with own words doth bated breath
as she did not lay in the sun,

00:06:26.633 --> 00:06:31.266
did she not see the smiling
of that natural landscape

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:36.300
she did within be her--
[laughter]

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.000
there a lot.
[laughter]

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.900
[with deepened voice, like a Shakespearian actor]
Did she not know

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.100
that of all the times in history,

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.066
of all the people
that have been around,

00:06:51.066 --> 00:06:56.233
with the love of her life beats
live so not so far away behind tree

00:06:56.233 --> 00:07:01.633
as did every day did watch
a stream did bathe the young girl

00:07:01.633 --> 00:07:09.533
in the likeliness's of the refreshing
waters of Delanusca?

00:07:09.533 --> 00:07:12.567
Did not she know that
as she walketh upon road,

00:07:12.567 --> 00:07:16.266
past peasants carrying supplies to where,

00:07:16.266 --> 00:07:17.233
who knows?

00:07:17.233 --> 00:07:21.934
They had a better day
because of seeing such a visage;

00:07:21.934 --> 00:07:31.100
roamingly, seemingly floating down said road
in a way that there a-, uh-, [laughter]

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.300
Me thinketh not.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.633
But, with one word she can change
the future of the world.

00:07:37.633 --> 00:07:40.834
Let not your dirks and daggers
do bequeath thee and sheath

00:07:40.834 --> 00:07:44.567
as they do lie dormant inside
your side armors for peace

00:07:44.567 --> 00:07:47.567
has been in this land for far too long.

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:54.700
Let the war of nations fall upon
us now as a great race of humans

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.066
and nonhumans alike.
[laughter]

00:07:58.066 --> 00:08:00.066
Let not the noose be splayed,

00:08:00.066 --> 00:08:01.500
launched but yesterday,

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.266
robotic and militaristic in space.

00:08:04.266 --> 00:08:13.066
Do start such wars that we dream
of only in [inaudible].

00:08:13.066 --> 00:08:16.567
But I digress.
That's a piece-- [laughter]

00:08:16.567 --> 00:08:18.967
from my new play coming out,

00:08:18.967 --> 00:08:20.667
which will be at PS122,

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.100
it's Under the Radar Festival.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.433
In January.

00:08:25.433 --> 00:08:28.266
A few other points
I'd like to bring up.

00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:30.333
First song of the evening,

00:08:30.333 --> 00:08:32.900
in case Carey was talking to you about it,

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.767
is going to be,

00:08:34.767 --> 00:08:38.934
a song that's gonna be a rendition
that was written by Eric in engineering.

00:08:38.934 --> 00:08:41.600
So, good for you, Eric.
[laughter]

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.867
We all gotta do something besides engineer.

00:08:43.867 --> 00:08:45.633
[laughs]

00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:47.700
[Train sound]
Wooo! Wooo! Chug-a-chug-a-chug-a.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:57.200
[laughs][laughter]
So, get on you engineers.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.734
So, this is a song about,

00:08:59.734 --> 00:09:01.166
about mourning,

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:02.567
depression,

00:09:02.567 --> 00:09:04.100
the loss of everything,

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.200
and hopelessness that
inevitably strikes all of us

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.834
in the moments in which we're not strong.

00:09:09.834 --> 00:09:11.300
Alright, here we go.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:27.500
[snaps fingers in a rhythmic fashion]

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.500
Ok, that works.
Ok, here we go.

but like, last year or whatever,

00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:42.233
there were all those guys.

00:11:42.233 --> 00:11:46.500
They were like,
hanging out at my, my building 64.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.200
And like, and they were just
being such dicks.

Just like, total dicks.

00:11:58.533 --> 00:12:01.934
And I wrote this song.

00:12:01.934 --> 00:12:07.767
This is a trilogy and it occurs
over the course of two years

00:12:07.767 --> 00:12:10.867

"I'm just like dickin' around,

00:12:26.767 --> 00:12:30.533
And this is a song

that into one thing or whatever,

00:12:33.166 --> 00:12:36.667
and I figure since it's one day
after Earth Day

00:12:36.667 --> 00:12:38.266
that we would pay attention,

00:12:38.266 --> 00:12:40.600
honor our planet, Gaia,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.200
for all of the miracles
that she provides,

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.233
the sun and solar systems,

00:12:45.233 --> 00:12:48.367
for entering into the dark rift in 2012,

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:49.800
according to Maya,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.500
it's re-entering a new
phase of consciousness.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.867
And all this consciousness
is inherently instracted

00:12:55.867 --> 00:12:57.934
inside of the outskirts of the universe,

00:12:57.934 --> 00:13:02.667
which is the holographic fence to allow
us to feel as though we're here now.

00:13:02.667 --> 00:13:06.066
And so I'm super stoked about
that and shit,

00:13:06.066 --> 00:13:07.066
so check it out.

00:13:07.066 --> 00:13:11.700

and I've been a Googler

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.800
since Google has been on the scene.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.300
I use almost all of
the Google products.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.667
I was in Australia
and I was checking out Google Wave

00:19:03.667 --> 00:19:09.567

[laughter]

00:19:09.567 --> 00:19:10.500

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.433

00:19:14.433 --> 00:19:16.800

No, but I use like all,
I use the search engine.

00:19:34.834 --> 00:19:36.133
I like the idea of it,

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:37.934

00:19:37.934 --> 00:19:38.834
That's like,
you know what I mean?

00:19:38.834 --> 00:19:40.100
It's like when you're

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.734
and you're like,
"I don't like it."

00:19:41.734 --> 00:19:43.834
That's what it's like using Bing.
[laughter]

00:19:43.834 --> 00:19:45.767
It's like; it's kind of like Google.

00:19:45.767 --> 00:19:46.467
Isn't that horrible?

00:19:46.467 --> 00:19:49.467
It's like, you're like using something and
you're like, "Well, it's kinda like Google."

00:19:49.467 --> 00:19:53.400
It's like, almost guys,
it's like,

It's like "Well, it's kinda like,

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.767
it's kinda like Android, isn't it?

00:19:57.767 --> 00:19:58.600
It's pretty close, well;

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.967
maybe I'll switch to it
if gets exactly like it."

00:20:00.967 --> 00:20:02.400

[laughter]

00:20:04.133 --> 00:20:06.667
I'll keep doing that,
how about that?

00:20:06.667 --> 00:20:10.133
No, but, I was checking out
the NexusThree a little bit,

00:20:10.133 --> 00:20:13.033
and it looks really good, guys.

00:20:13.033 --> 00:20:17.667
It's 50% thinner and
has a slight curve to it.

00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:21.934
It uses a fiber optic
display that's bendable.

00:20:21.934 --> 00:20:24.166
You can remove the back
in the battery and it's clear

00:20:24.166 --> 00:20:27.133
so you can see the componentry
through the system itself,

00:20:27.133 --> 00:20:30.033
which is kind of nice.

00:20:30.033 --> 00:20:35.367
A lot of the functionality has been
limited on purpose-- [laughter]

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:37.000
I don't know what to tell you guys.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.467
I mean, the new iPhone 4G,

00:20:40.467 --> 00:20:43.333
which I checked out some pictures of
and checked out as well.

00:20:43.333 --> 00:20:44.667
I used a,

00:20:44.667 --> 00:20:47.834
I took pictures of it online
and then I had it rendered

00:20:47.834 --> 00:20:50.834
with an artificial intelligence that could
kind of reproduce all the componentry

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:51.633
that it was showing,

00:20:51.633 --> 00:20:55.000
so that I could do a mock-up
model of it using rapid prototyping.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.800
And it feels pretty good, I guess.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.767
I don't know if I got
the ceramics right, but--

00:21:01.767 --> 00:21:02.533
Interesting phone,

00:21:02.533 --> 00:21:06.033
but I think that the, the NexusThree
is gonna be a lot better.

00:21:06.033 --> 00:21:09.567
And we've, we're skipping two this year.

00:21:09.567 --> 00:21:11.033

and I'd like to do a moment
of silence, ok? [laughter]

00:21:48.567 --> 00:21:54.166
I turned gay recently because
being gay is a choice.

00:21:54.166 --> 00:21:59.166
And I remember when I made that choice,
that one afternoon,

00:21:59.166 --> 00:22:02.333
I registered online--
[laughter]

00:22:02.333 --> 00:22:06.200
and they sent over a gay integration
counselor right away.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.000
And he suggested the easiest way
to jump into gay culture

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.600
is to go out dancing.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.934
So, I was like, "Sure, that sounds
like a good idea."

00:22:15.934 --> 00:22:20.667
Went down to this place on 55th and 1th--
[laughter]

00:22:20.667 --> 00:22:24.300
called "The Manhole"
and we were inside,

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.000
and lemme tell you,
this place was club.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.433
If you've ever been to a club,

00:22:29.433 --> 00:22:31.333
but like,
this place was like so club.

00:22:31.333 --> 00:22:33.033
Like, you go inside,

00:22:33.033 --> 00:22:35.367
there's a floor--
[laughter]

00:22:35.367 --> 00:22:42.500
and a ceiling and a structure to
make sure those things stay separated.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.667
And then kind of an atmosphere
that was collectively decided

00:22:44.667 --> 00:22:47.767
by a few individuals that represent
a larger system at whole

00:22:47.767 --> 00:22:50.367
that philosophically keeps things
intact in a safe environment

00:22:50.367 --> 00:22:52.633

00:36:38.767 --> 00:36:41.333
and Williamsburg
for giving me a home

00:36:41.333 --> 00:36:48.166
to develop a lot of my new
performance technologies.

00:36:48.166 --> 00:36:51.600
I'd like to thank Sherry Shafer,

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:55.333
if there is a person out there
with that name.

00:36:55.333 --> 00:36:59.300
Thank you.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:04.133
I'd also like to thank Jeff Hahn

00:37:04.133 --> 00:37:09.500
for providing the, the popularized
multi-touch interface that we see,

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:15.533
but yet not occupying every day
of our lives cause there's a problem.

00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:18.867
As people start getting all touchy-feely,

00:37:18.867 --> 00:37:21.300
you know, kids are just gonna start
touching laptop screens,

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.233
they're like,
"Why doesn't it work like that?"

00:37:23.233 --> 00:37:26.633
And then I'm like,
"I know, I know, I know."

00:37:26.633 --> 00:37:30.767
[mimics child-baby voice]

00:37:30.767 --> 00:37:32.100
I know, its 2010,

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:36.867
you would've think something
different would've happened by now.

00:37:36.867 --> 00:37:38.800
But you can change that.
You can change that here.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:44.333
Please help me make this world
a touch-screen based world.

00:37:44.333 --> 00:37:46.266
I'm tired of mice.

00:37:46.266 --> 00:37:47.767
I think they're great,

00:37:47.767 --> 00:37:48.767
seeing them scurry,

00:37:48.767 --> 00:37:50.967
they have efficient teeth,

00:37:50.967 --> 00:37:52.934
nice claws and stuff like that
and they have fur

00:37:52.934 --> 00:37:58.567
and they can regulate their internal
temperatures at will, but--

00:37:58.567 --> 00:38:01.333
not into that.

00:38:01.333 --> 00:38:04.700
We should be using
OWL-based technology.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:08.200
And I'm giving that to you for free
if you wanna give Google the edge.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.333
I know Google's a start-up,

00:38:09.333 --> 00:38:10.900
but you guys can,

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.734
you guys can make it in this world.

00:38:12.734 --> 00:38:17.867
I know you can and I think using
the OWL model will get you there.

00:38:17.867 --> 00:38:20.567
Some of the important things to
remember about the OWL model

00:38:20.567 --> 00:38:24.100
is that you have very good site and vision.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.367
You also have two ears
that are asymmetrical.

00:38:27.367 --> 00:38:28.533
One is higher than the other;

00:38:28.533 --> 00:38:31.133
they are to auto locate sounds
three-dimensionally,

00:38:31.133 --> 00:38:34.233
even through surfaces such as snow.

00:38:34.233 --> 00:38:38.200
They also have tattered feathers
on the trailing edge of the wing span

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.500
in order to disrupt airflow,

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.367
and to create a nearly,

00:38:42.367 --> 00:38:44.900
completely silent flight and glide
as it swoops down

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.000
from the trees to locate the prey
that it needs to get through sight

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.900
and through stereophonic auto location.
[laughter]

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.400
It also has a powerful beak.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.066
Extremely powerful.

00:38:57.066 --> 00:39:00.233
One of the most powerful beaks
in the world; extremely sharp,

00:39:00.233 --> 00:39:02.133
really pointy,

00:39:02.133 --> 00:39:03.734
very pointy beaks--

00:39:03.734 --> 00:39:05.367
owls have.

00:39:05.367 --> 00:39:06.867
And talons.

00:39:06.867 --> 00:39:08.066
Very sharp talons,

00:39:08.066 --> 00:39:09.533
good grip, strength,

00:39:09.533 --> 00:39:11.033
retractable gear,

00:39:11.033 --> 00:39:13.734
it's really good shit.

00:39:13.734 --> 00:39:15.233
So, use that Google.

00:39:15.233 --> 00:39:16.967
That's, you have the two zeros,

00:39:16.967 --> 00:39:19.333
you know, you, you, you're there.

00:39:19.333 --> 00:39:20.734
You're there already.

00:39:20.734 --> 00:39:23.567
It's an OWL looking at you
every day and yet,

00:39:23.567 --> 00:39:24.934
you're not taking
advantage of it.

00:39:24.934 --> 00:39:25.834
So,

00:39:25.834 --> 00:39:29.400
[laughter and applause]

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.800
Thank you very much, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.633
&gt;&gt;presenter: Reggie Watts,
everyone, give it up!

00:39:34.633 --> 00:39:36.667
May 18th, Why Shit's so Crazy,

00:39:36.667 --> 00:39:39.400
a Comedy Central DVD coming out.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.633
Thank you very much for attending.

00:39:40.633 --> 00:39:48.934
[wild applause]

00:39:48.934 --> 00:39:49.934
I'm sorry;

00:39:49.934 --> 00:39:53.166
did I mention there'd be
explicit lyrics at this?

00:39:53.166 --> 00:39:55.233
I might have forgot to leave,
to put that part in there.

00:39:55.233 --> 00:39:58.934
[applause]

00:39:58.934 --> 00:40:01.500
Now, Reggie, typically we do
have a little bit more time in here,

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.834
typically we do a short Q&amp;A.

00:40:02.834 --> 00:40:04.800
Would you be able to stick
around for a few more?

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.800
Alright, so,

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.934
since we do only have one mic
at this time,

00:40:07.934 --> 00:40:09.734
raise your hand and Reggie
will take a question,

00:40:09.734 --> 00:40:12.033
and if you could just repeat
the question into the mic.

00:40:12.033 --> 00:40:15.867
&gt;&gt;Reggie: You got it.

00:40:15.867 --> 00:40:17.333
&gt;&gt;presenter: Who's gonna be the first?

00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:19.333
&gt;&gt;Reggie: And action!

00:40:19.333 --> 00:40:21.133
&gt;&gt;female 1: What do you like better
[inaudible].

00:40:21.133 --> 00:40:27.033
&gt;&gt;Reggie: Whew, you know it's hard
because if you just said fuck all the time,

00:40:27.033 --> 00:40:33.066
well you can do that,
but it's good to have variation.

00:40:33.066 --> 00:40:36.000
&gt;&gt;male 1: I'm a big comedy,
[inaudbile ] radio fan.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.333
I heard you talk a bit about how much
has changed over the last few years.

00:40:40.333 --> 00:40:44.066
About how technology has changed in
promoting yourself and having a career.

00:40:44.066 --> 00:40:44.600
&gt;&gt;Reggie: Ok, yeah.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.567
Promoting, promoting a career,

00:40:46.567 --> 00:40:52.734
how technology has changed comedians
lives in promoting their careers.

00:40:52.734 --> 00:40:56.834
I think, I mean, people are a lot less shy
about utilizing the technology.

00:40:56.834 --> 00:41:00.533
I think that before when someone
would mention "podcast"

00:41:00.533 --> 00:41:02.734
they just didn't know how to react,
you know?

00:41:02.734 --> 00:41:07.500
And, and, and now the tools are so easy
and so many people do it and there's,

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.767
and comedians are eager to share
that technology with other comedians.

00:41:11.767 --> 00:41:16.166
And use it in innovative ways,
like Paul,

00:41:16.166 --> 00:41:18.767
Paul Fuckin' Thomas,
no, sorry,

00:41:18.767 --> 00:41:20.033
Paul Thompson,

00:41:20.033 --> 00:41:22.100
but no, Thompson S. Hunter?

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:27.300
No, he, he uses his Twitter

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.600
and I think it's mostly his Twitter
and his blog

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.233
to basically get a certain amount
of people

00:41:32.233 --> 00:41:34.066
to subscribe to his show in a town,

00:41:34.066 --> 00:41:38.033
and then he comes to the town if
enough people have subscribed to,

00:41:38.033 --> 00:41:39.233
you know, to come to the show.

00:41:39.233 --> 00:41:41.834
So, I think that there are
these beautiful, clever ways

00:41:41.834 --> 00:41:45.533
that don't really require that
much energy for any artist,

00:41:45.533 --> 00:41:46.867
whether comedic or not,

00:41:46.867 --> 00:41:50.333
to take advantage of and so I think that

00:41:50.333 --> 00:41:52.467
it's changed in that
it's become more ubiquitous

00:41:52.467 --> 00:41:59.467
and much much simpler to use.

00:41:59.467 --> 00:42:01.433
&gt;&gt;male 3: Do you like Bobbie McFerrin?

00:42:01.433 --> 00:42:02.033
&gt;&gt;Reggie: I do.

00:42:02.033 --> 00:42:03.400
I, I, I liked him,

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.700
I was,

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.166
you know when I heard
"Don't Worry, Be Happy",

00:42:06.166 --> 00:42:09.333
that was incredibly inspirational

00:42:09.333 --> 00:42:13.100
and that is just a,
just a vocal only tune.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:16.567
It's probably one of the only songs in,

00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:20.800
I think, would be maybe in history
that's all vocally produced by one person

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.266
and then also being a hit.

00:42:23.266 --> 00:42:25.533
So, --
[laughter]

00:42:25.533 --> 00:42:27.100
so, I think that that's pretty amazing.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.233
That, that really affected me,

00:42:28.233 --> 00:42:34.767
but I'm also a big fan of
Michael Winslow from Police Academy

00:42:34.767 --> 00:42:36.967
who did all the sound effects.

00:42:36.967 --> 00:42:40.233
That was incredibly influential on me.

00:42:40.233 --> 00:42:43.433
I was constantly trying to imitate sounds,

00:42:43.433 --> 00:42:45.900
doors closing and whatever.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.033
So, that was huge,

00:42:47.033 --> 00:42:51.367
but, I do like Bobby McFerrin
although he's kind of a little,

00:42:51.367 --> 00:42:55.700
he's kind of gotten a little weird
on the slightly religious tip,

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:58.367
which I'm always, you know,

00:42:58.367 --> 00:42:59.400
like if I'm with someone,

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.033
this is just a pet peeve
I've come into recently

00:43:01.033 --> 00:43:04.100
so I might as well share it here
because it's not being recorded.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:05.433
Just kidding.

00:43:05.433 --> 00:43:07.433
But, like, before people go on stage,

00:43:07.433 --> 00:43:09.800
like if you're part of someone's project
and then they kind of like,

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.533
do some kind of like a weird prayer
or something before going on,

00:43:12.533 --> 00:43:14.066
it always ruins the mood for me.

00:43:14.066 --> 00:43:17.133
Not because I'm anti-religious
or anything like that,

00:43:17.133 --> 00:43:18.033
it's just like, to me,

00:43:18.033 --> 00:43:20.333
the religious experience
is performing on stage,

00:43:20.333 --> 00:43:25.500
and so why not ensure the maximum of,
ability of someone to express on stage.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.133
So, when I heard some of the stories of,

00:43:28.133 --> 00:43:29.900
from some friends of mine
who did some vocal summits,

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.734
I was just like,
"Aw, man!"

00:43:31.734 --> 00:43:34.900
Just like, holding hands
in a circle and like,

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.400
saying thing about energy and like and,

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.633
I think, some Christian stuff or whatever,

00:43:40.633 --> 00:43:42.400
which is fine, but I'm like,

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.133
"Aw, that's weird cause
what if someone's not?"

00:43:45.133 --> 00:43:47.300
What if they're just not?

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.734
Why not just do it at all?

00:43:49.734 --> 00:43:53.633
So, anyways, but so, Bobby McFerrin,
yes, in principle.

00:43:53.633 --> 00:43:57.166
[laughter]

00:43:57.166 --> 00:43:59.567
Yes?
Sanjay Gupta?

00:43:59.567 --> 00:44:01.300
He's not here.

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.433
Yeah.

00:44:02.433 --> 00:44:05.667
&gt;&gt;male3: You seem to have a pretty
solid knowledge of the tech industry.

00:44:05.667 --> 00:44:07.133
Could you just talk
a little bit about,

00:44:07.133 --> 00:44:09.767
you know, [inaudible] and how
you brought that into comedy,

00:44:09.767 --> 00:44:11.600
[inaudible]?

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.133
&gt;&gt;Reggie: Yeah, I mean,

00:44:13.133 --> 00:44:14.233
you know I've,

00:44:14.233 --> 00:44:15.133
I like the idea of,

00:44:15.133 --> 00:44:19.367
of technology in the, as used in a,
in a way to kind of create magic,

00:44:19.367 --> 00:44:22.166
I guess, or magical elements.

00:44:22.166 --> 00:44:26.033
And I've always been a gadget freak at,

00:44:26.033 --> 00:44:29.166
I, I, I kind of had this realization like,

00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:30.433
I don't know,
two years ago,

00:44:30.433 --> 00:44:34.333
that I had pretty much every
organizer that ever came out.

00:44:34.333 --> 00:44:38.533
Like, starting in, starting from 1988,
I think, '87.

00:44:38.533 --> 00:44:40.033
When they were just like address books,

00:44:40.033 --> 00:44:43.433
like fancy calendars that could
store names and numbers

00:44:43.433 --> 00:44:47.567
and I like, went all the way through like
the Zaurus series all the way to iPacks

00:44:47.567 --> 00:44:49.934
and all that shit and
personal digital assistants.

00:44:49.934 --> 00:44:53.400
But, I've always liked the idea
of technology being a,

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:59.000
a powerful tool used to creatively
to make an experience

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.700
that you may not normally get otherwise
with just a person standing on stage.

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.767
So, I like technology,

00:45:05.767 --> 00:45:08.834
but I don't like it
overshadowing the content.

00:45:08.834 --> 00:45:10.133
The, the art has to,

00:45:10.133 --> 00:45:11.800
has to supersede the technology.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.000
The technology only aids the idea

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.600
so the idea is still a human idea
that's being represented.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:21.567
But the technology is simply a medium
by which to expand the creative idea,

00:45:21.567 --> 00:45:24.367
which I think is very important
cause a lot of people are gear heads,

00:45:24.367 --> 00:45:26.700
and you just see a bunch of gear
on stage and you're like,

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.233
"It wasn't really that good."
It doesn't matter.

00:45:28.233 --> 00:45:30.667
If, if the experience isn't good
then it doesn't matter

00:45:30.667 --> 00:45:34.467
how much technology or how
little technology you have.

00:45:34.467 --> 00:45:35.734
&gt;&gt;female 2: I have two questions.

00:45:35.734 --> 00:45:37.800
One is, uh, growing up,

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.200
what was it like in your household?

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.300
Did your parent encourage you,
or did they think, "Oh, my God?"

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:44.834
Or did [inaudible].

00:45:44.834 --> 00:45:47.567
And then number two is do
you actually speak German?

00:45:47.567 --> 00:45:53.200
[inaudible]

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.834
&gt;&gt;Reggie: Well, my mother's French

00:45:55.834 --> 00:46:02.700
and so I grew up speaking French
and I was born in Germany,

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:05.767
but only there for like six months.

00:46:05.767 --> 00:46:07.500
And then my dad's American,

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.533
so I grew up in kind of
like this bilingual, bicultural,

00:46:10.533 --> 00:46:14.033
biracial household in Montana.

00:46:14.033 --> 00:46:15.600
So--
[laughter]

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.033
so, as an only child.

00:46:17.033 --> 00:46:21.734
So, so, it created a lot of time
for me to just kind of drift off

00:46:21.734 --> 00:46:24.734
and think about who,

00:46:24.734 --> 00:46:29.367
who I am and try experiments
with what I think the world is like

00:46:29.367 --> 00:46:33.767
and watch lots of television
and PBS and BBS, or BBC shows.

00:46:33.767 --> 00:46:37.834
I was an Anglophile growing up
and I love like, fantasy novels

00:46:37.834 --> 00:46:41.333
and science fiction
and romantic comedies.

00:46:41.333 --> 00:46:44.500
And, I pretty much like anything human.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:47.934
I mean, pretty much anything human
based culturally,

00:46:47.934 --> 00:46:50.000
I just kind of look at it anthropologically,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.600
I guess without being
an anthropologist, but--

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.433
&gt;&gt;female4: Was your mom [inaudible]?

00:46:53.433 --> 00:46:54.633
&gt;&gt;Reggie: Yeah, my mom was cool, man.

00:46:54.633 --> 00:46:55.834
She was like, you know,

00:46:55.834 --> 00:46:57.567
"You wanna take piano lessons,
take piano lessons."

00:46:57.567 --> 00:47:00.367
And, and, they were hard workers, too,

00:47:00.367 --> 00:47:03.000
so when they agreed to do things,

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.233
they worked for it
for my ability to do them

00:47:05.233 --> 00:47:07.266
so I was very appreciative of that.

00:47:07.266 --> 00:47:12.300
But, my parents were very encouraging
and, and strict at the same time.

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:16.667
But I was always able to have
the appearance of following the rules,

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:19.300
but breaking them
behind their backs, which is,

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.934
I don't know if that's good or bad,
but, anyway, yeah.

00:47:21.934 --> 00:47:23.400
It was fun.
It was fun.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.467
It was fun growing up.

00:47:24.467 --> 00:47:25.100
In Montana.

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.633
And growing up, too.

00:47:26.633 --> 00:47:27.900
It's really fun, guys.

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:28.834
I don't know if you guys remember,

00:47:28.834 --> 00:47:33.000
some of you guys didn't do that.
[laughter]

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.367
&gt;&gt;presenter: We have time
for one more question.

00:47:34.367 --> 00:47:37.967
Are there any out there?

00:47:37.967 --> 00:47:39.700
&gt;&gt;male 5: What was
your musical training like?

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:44.667
&gt;&gt;Reggie: I studied classical piano
from age five to sixteen,

00:47:44.667 --> 00:47:48.066
although how good at it
I became is questionable.

00:47:48.066 --> 00:47:51.500
And then I studied classical
violin in the school system,

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:55.667
public school system from 5th grade,

00:47:55.667 --> 00:47:58.066
basically eight years.

00:47:58.066 --> 00:47:59.800
And then, yeah.

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:04.000
And then, a brief, a two and half years
at Cornish College of the Arts,

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.233
I studied jazz voice,

00:48:05.233 --> 00:48:07.700
cause I figured
since I do a lot of singing,

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.300
I figured the ear training would be good

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:12.967
because improvising over complex
chord structures as they change,

00:48:12.967 --> 00:48:16.633
but finding a graceful melody over them,

00:48:16.633 --> 00:48:20.266
would be probably the ultimate ear
training and I think that it was effective,

00:48:20.266 --> 00:48:23.233
in that, in that, in that regard.

00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:26.000
&gt;&gt;presenter: Well, that brings us
to the end of the hour.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.867
Thanks everyone, again,
and technology or no technology,

00:48:27.867 --> 00:48:31.433
I think we all agree that your comedy
and your work stands on its own.

00:48:31.433 --> 00:48:33.734
So, thanks again and give a round
of applause for Reggie Watts.

00:48:33.734 --> 00:48:44.300
[applause]
