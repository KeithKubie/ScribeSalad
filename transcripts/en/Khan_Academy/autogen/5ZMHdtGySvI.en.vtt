00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.730
 We have a blank plus 261 is equal to 630 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.970
 and I advise you to stop the video 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.326
 and check if you can find out how empty it is. 

00:00:07.326 --> 00:00:09.550
 There are several ways to solve this. 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.115
 Let's picture it on a numerical axis. 

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:15.283
 This is my numerical axis here. 

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:17.540
 And we could start from the empty, 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.400
 or I will mark it with a question mark. 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.550
 We could start with the question mark 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.390
 and if we add 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.249
 261 to it, 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:28.980
 plus plus 261, 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.371
 we will get to 630. 

00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:34.920
 We'll get to 630. 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.020
 This is the number 630 here, 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.550
 which means that if 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.240
 we had started at 630, 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.880
 and we had to subtract 261, 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.190
 if we had to go in the other direction, 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.898
 if we had to get 261. Let's do it. 

00:00:50.898 --> 00:00:53.540
 So minus 261, 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.550
 minus 261, 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.620
 we would go back to the empty, 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.533
 we would go back to our questionnaire. 

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.270
 There are many ways to calculate this, 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.960
 but I will try to solve it in a way, 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.010
 which I would actually use if I decide in my mind, 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.020
 or who will simplify my calculations. 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.520
 Just one of many ways 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.501
 to find this. 

00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:16.741
 The way I would think is, first of all I would have taken out 200, 

00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:18.840
 I would first get 200. 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.343
 This is roughly drawn, I do not exactly observe the scale. 

00:01:23.343 --> 00:01:25.000
 So I would get 200, 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.470
 this here is minus 200, 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.650
 which I would reach 430. 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.850
 This can be calculated in mind. 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.725
 I just took 2 hundreds out of here. 

00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:36.969
 Let's see now, I want to get 60. 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.196
 So then I would get 60. 

00:01:40.196 --> 00:01:42.452
 Minus 60. 

00:01:42.452 --> 00:01:44.580
 Let's think, 430 minus 60. 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.709
 That's 43 decades minus 6 tens. 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.470
 That would be 37 dots or 370. 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.095
 So we get to 370. 

00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:56.640
 And finally we'll get another 1. 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.440
 We have to pull out 200, 60 and then 1 (261). 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.710
 So, 370 minus 1 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.700
 is 369. 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.830
 Therefore, this is 369, 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.493
 369. 

00:02:13.493 --> 00:02:15.190
 Another way we could figure this out 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.420
 is to exchange the order. 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.925
 We could say: "If blank plus 261 is 630, 

00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:24.260
 then 261 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.340
 plus empty is equal to 630 ". 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.470
 All I did was change the order here, 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.890
 but this is displayed differently 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:37.988
 on the numerical axis. 

00:02:37.988 --> 00:02:40.950
 Let me again make a numerical axis. 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.714
 Here is my numerical axis. 

00:02:45.714 --> 00:02:48.540
 And I could start from 261. 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.860
 So this time I start from 261. 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.550
 261. 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.942
 And I want to get to 630. 

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:58.220
 And I want to get to 630, 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.440
 and the number it adds will be equal to the blank. 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.133
 Let's see how much I need to add to get 630. 

00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:07.870
 And I'll add numbers that are easy to read. 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.110
 I could add 9, I could add 9. 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.640
 And why 9? 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.330
 Because that's how I get to 270, 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.570
 which is a sympathetic, round number. 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.700
 And then I could add 30 here, 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.709
 to get to 300. Let me do it. 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:21.960
 Plus 30. 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.790
 I do not respect the scale, 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.355
 but that will take me to 300. 

00:03:26.355 --> 00:03:28.890
 And then, from 300 to 630, 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.190
 I would just add 330. 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.540
 I would just add 330 here. 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.000
 How much did I add? 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.800
 That's 39 plus 330, 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.130
 this is 369. 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.310
 I added 369. 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.250
 These are the ways to find the above value, 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.900
 all the ways to solve the problem.
