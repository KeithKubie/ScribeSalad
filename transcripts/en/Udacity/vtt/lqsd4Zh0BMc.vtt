00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Then we also learned about control. You implemented your first controller.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Control is what makes things like the following experiment possible.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Here's my quiz.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You learned about PID control and, specifically, the P term, the I term, and the D term.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Which of the terms is most associated with the idea of avoiding overshoot,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
minimizing error relative to a reference trajectory, and compensating drift.

00:00:33.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I want you to check exactly one check box for P, one for I, and one for D.
