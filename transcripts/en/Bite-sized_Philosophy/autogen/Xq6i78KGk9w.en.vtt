00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
maybe some of them need to be moved
 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.539
maybe some of them need to be moved
around a little bit and that's what the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
around a little bit and that's what the
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.280
around a little bit and that's what the
political dialogue is for but that

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290
political dialogue is for but that
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.679
political dialogue is for but that
doesn't mean that borders themselves are

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689
doesn't mean that borders themselves are
 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.350
doesn't mean that borders themselves are
a bad idea they're a great idea because

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
a bad idea they're a great idea because

without borders everything mashes into

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880
without borders everything mashes into
 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.940
without borders everything mashes into
the same untenable state of

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950
the same untenable state of
 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.100
the same untenable state of
undifferentiated chaos and you can't

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
undifferentiated chaos and you can't
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.139
undifferentiated chaos and you can't
live in that and so the people who are

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149
live in that and so the people who are
 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.429
live in that and so the people who are
trying to tear down the borders

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439
trying to tear down the borders
 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.740

conceptually politically and practically
what they want is the chaos that that

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
what they want is the chaos that that
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.370
what they want is the chaos that that
would bring they either want that or

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
would bring they either want that or
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.469
would bring they either want that or
they're too foolish to know that their

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
they're too foolish to know that their
 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.810
they're too foolish to know that their
pursuits will produce that so let's

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820
pursuits will produce that so let's
 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.359
pursuits will produce that so let's
let's let's be a little bit clear that

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
let's let's be a little bit clear that
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.819
let's let's be a little bit clear that
if you stand up and say yeah borders

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829
if you stand up and say yeah borders
 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.830
if you stand up and say yeah borders
they're okay they've got their problems

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
they're okay they've got their problems
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.609
they're okay they've got their problems
but they're okay that doesn't make you a

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619
but they're okay that doesn't make you a
 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.559
but they're okay that doesn't make you a
bigot beyond redemption it just makes

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
bigot beyond redemption it just makes
 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.290
bigot beyond redemption it just makes
you someone with some sense and it's

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
you someone with some sense and it's
 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.850
you someone with some sense and it's
actually okay to be someone

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860
actually okay to be someone
 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.630
actually okay to be someone
some sense limits on immigration are

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640
some sense limits on immigration are
 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.070
some sense limits on immigration are
also reasonable well we need to figure

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080
also reasonable well we need to figure
 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.930
also reasonable well we need to figure
out what those limits are and that's

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940
out what those limits are and that's
 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.610
out what those limits are and that's
what the bloody political dialogue is

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620
what the bloody political dialogue is
 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.900
what the bloody political dialogue is
for but the fact that it should be

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910
for but the fact that it should be
 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.280
for but the fact that it should be
limited to some degree is also

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290
limited to some degree is also
 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.440
limited to some degree is also
reasonable otherwise why not just open

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450
reasonable otherwise why not just open
 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.420
reasonable otherwise why not just open
the borders and let everybody come in

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430
the borders and let everybody come in
 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.040
the borders and let everybody come in
well the reason you don't do that is

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050
well the reason you don't do that is
 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.920
well the reason you don't do that is
because a complex system cannot tolerate

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930
because a complex system cannot tolerate
 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.080
because a complex system cannot tolerate

extensive transformation over too short
a period of time now you want immigrants

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310
a period of time now you want immigrants
 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.070
a period of time now you want immigrants
to come in especially if they're the

to come in especially if they're the
sorts of immigrants who are likely to

here's something I've been thinking
about this a lot lately

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190
about this a lot lately
 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.449
about this a lot lately
it should not be assumed that citizens

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459
it should not be assumed that citizens
 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.840
it should not be assumed that citizens
of societies that have not evolved

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850
of societies that have not evolved
 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.240
of societies that have not evolved
functional individual rights predicated

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250
functional individual rights predicated
 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.190
functional individual rights predicated
policies will hold values in keeping

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200
policies will hold values in keeping
 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.250
policies will hold values in keeping
with such qualities so we could say look

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260
 
 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.240
 
there are a lot of countries in the

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250
there are a lot of countries in the
 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.280
there are a lot of countries in the
world that are not governed well the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290
world that are not governed well the
 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.320
world that are not governed well the
vast majority of them right and they be

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330
vast majority of them right and they be
 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.740
vast majority of them right and they be
not governed well forever and to me that

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750
not governed well forever and to me that
 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.720
not governed well forever and to me that
means that there's something wrong with

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730
means that there's something wrong with
 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.420
means that there's something wrong with
the values that are held collectively by

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430
the values that are held collectively by
 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.920
the values that are held collectively by
the people who've established those

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930
the people who've established those
 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.740
the people who've established those
policies well you shouldn't be naive and

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750
policies well you shouldn't be naive and
 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.780
policies well you shouldn't be naive and
assume that merely because you moved

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790
assume that merely because you moved
 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.580
assume that merely because you moved
them to a new country they're going to

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590
them to a new country they're going to
 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.039
them to a new country they're going to
let their innate democratic longings

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049
let their innate democratic longings
 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.660
let their innate democratic longings
flourish it doesn't work that way

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670
flourish it doesn't work that way
 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.560
flourish it doesn't work that way
