00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:09.368
We hear about calories all the time.

00:00:09.368 --> 00:00:11.264
How many calories are in this cookie?

00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:13.862
How many are burned by 100 jumping jacks,

00:00:13.862 --> 00:00:15.305
or long distance running,

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:16.497
or fidgeting?

00:00:16.497 --> 00:00:21.408
But what is a calorie, really,
and how many of them do we actually need?

00:00:21.408 --> 00:00:25.460
Calories are a way of keeping track
of the body's energy budget.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.795
A healthy balance occurs when we put in
about as much energy as we lose.

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:34.703
If we consistently put more energy
into our bodies than we burn,

00:00:34.703 --> 00:00:38.854
the excess will gradually 
be stored as fat in our cells,

00:00:38.854 --> 00:00:40.419
and we'll gain weight.

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:44.377
If we burn off more energy 
than we replenish, we'll lose weight.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:48.198
So we have to be able 
to measure the energy we consume and use,

00:00:48.198 --> 00:00:51.513
and we do so with a unit 
called the calorie.

00:00:51.513 --> 00:00:56.286
One calorie, the kind we measure in food,
also called a large calorie,

00:00:56.286 --> 00:00:58.605
is defined as the amount of energy

00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:02.654
it would take to raise the temperature
of one kilogram of water

00:01:02.654 --> 00:01:05.830
by one degree Celsius.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.724
Everything we consume has a calorie count,

00:01:08.724 --> 00:01:13.505
a measure of how much energy 
the item stores in its chemical bonds.

00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:17.745
The average pizza slice has 272 calories,

00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:20.634
there are about 78 in a piece of bread,

00:01:20.634 --> 00:01:23.720
and an apple has about 52.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.320
That energy is released during digestion,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.536
and stored in other molecules

00:01:28.536 --> 00:01:32.529
that can be broken down to provide energy
when the body needs it.

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:34.449
It's used in three ways:

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:36.980
about 10% enables digestion,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.974
about 20% fuels physical activity,

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:42.506
and the biggest chunk, around 70%,

00:01:42.506 --> 00:01:46.845
supports the basic functions 
of our organs and tissues.

00:01:46.845 --> 00:01:51.757
That third usage corresponds to 
your basal metabolic rate,

00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:54.233
a number of calories 
you would need to survive

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:57.259
if you weren't eating or moving around.

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.492
Add in some physical activity 
and digestion,

00:01:59.492 --> 00:02:01.812
and you arrive at the official guidelines

00:02:01.812 --> 00:02:06.688
for how many calories 
the average person requires each day:

00:02:06.688 --> 00:02:10.103
2000 for women and 2500 for men.

00:02:10.103 --> 00:02:11.957
Those estimates are based on factors

00:02:11.957 --> 00:02:16.527
like average weight, physical activity 
and muscle mass.

00:02:16.527 --> 00:02:20.567
So does that mean everyone
should shoot for around 2000 calories?

00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:22.396
Not necessarily.

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:24.554
If you're doing 
an energy guzzling activity,

00:02:24.554 --> 00:02:26.380
like cycling the Tour de France,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.779
your body could use 
up to 9000 calories per day.

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:33.997
Pregnancy requires 
slightly more calories than usual,

00:02:33.997 --> 00:02:37.523
and elderly people typically 
have a slower metabolic rate,

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:41.437
energy is burned more gradually,
so less is needed.

00:02:41.437 --> 00:02:45.005
Here's something else you should know
before you start counting calories.

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:50.456
The calorie counts on nutrition labels
measure how much energy the food contains,

00:02:50.456 --> 00:02:54.379
not how much energy 
you can actually get out of it.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.194
Fibrous foods like celery and whole wheat
take more energy to digest,

00:02:59.194 --> 00:03:04.072
so you'd actually wind up with less energy
from a 100 calorie serving of celery

00:03:04.072 --> 00:03:07.410
than a 100 calorie serving 
of potato chips.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.328
Not to mention the fact that some foods
offer nutrients like protein and vitamins,

00:03:12.328 --> 00:03:15.666
while others provide 
far less nutritional value.

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:17.110
Eating too many of those foods

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.032
could leave you overweight 
and malnourished.

00:03:21.032 --> 00:03:23.437
And even with the exact same food,

00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:27.112
different people might not 
get the same number of calories.

00:03:27.112 --> 00:03:29.439
Variations in things like enzyme levels,

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:30.981
gut bacteria,

00:03:30.981 --> 00:03:33.104
and even intestine length,

00:03:33.104 --> 00:03:37.479
means that every individual's ability
to extract energy from food

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:39.338
is a little different.

00:03:39.338 --> 00:03:41.846
So a calorie is a useful energy measure,

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:45.605
but to work out exactly 
how many of them each of us requires

00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:48.260
we need to factor in things like exercise,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.514
food type,

00:03:49.514 --> 00:03:52.022
and our body's ability to process energy.

00:03:52.022 --> 00:03:54.976
Good luck finding all of that
on a nutrition label.
