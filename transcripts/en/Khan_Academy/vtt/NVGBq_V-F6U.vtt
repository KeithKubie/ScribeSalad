00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.795
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.795 --> 00:00:04.447
is talk about the various
types of discontinuities

00:00:04.447 --> 00:00:07.359
that you've probably seen
when you took algebra,

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.010
or precalculus, but then
relate it to our understanding

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.876
of both two-sided limits
and one-sided limits.

00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:18.727
So let's first review the
classification of discontinuities.

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:22.274
So here on the left,
you see that this curve

00:00:22.274 --> 00:00:25.642
looks just like y equals x squared,

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:28.502
until we get to x equals three.

00:00:28.502 --> 00:00:31.243
And instead of it being three squared,

00:00:31.243 --> 00:00:33.111
at this point you have this opening,

00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:35.893
and instead the function at
three is defined at four.

00:00:35.893 --> 00:00:37.420
But then it keeps going
and it looks just like

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.543
y equals x squared.

00:00:39.543 --> 00:00:42.163
This is known as a point,

00:00:42.163 --> 00:00:44.663
or a removable, discontinuity.

00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:47.523
And it's called that for obvious reasons.

00:00:47.523 --> 00:00:49.821
You're discontinuous at that point.

00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:52.665
You might imagine defining
or redefining the function

00:00:52.665 --> 00:00:54.747
at that point so it is continuous,

00:00:54.747 --> 00:00:57.853
so that this discontinuity is removable.

00:00:57.853 --> 00:01:00.140
But then how does this
relate to our definition

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.833
of continuity?

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:05.243
Well, let's remind ourselves
our definition of continuity.

00:01:05.243 --> 00:01:07.772
We say f is continuous,

00:01:07.772 --> 00:01:08.689
continuous,

00:01:10.156 --> 00:01:11.406
if and only if,

00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.343
or let me write f continuous

00:01:14.343 --> 00:01:17.010
at x equals c, if and only if

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:20.594
the limit as x approaches c

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.565
of f of x is equal to the
actual value of the function

00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:28.739
when x is equal to c.

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:30.714
So why does this one fail?

00:01:30.714 --> 00:01:33.460
Well, the two-sided limit actually exists.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.232
You could find, if we say
c in this case is three,

00:01:37.232 --> 00:01:38.708
the limit

00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:40.708
as x approaches three

00:01:41.637 --> 00:01:42.470
of f of x,

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:46.412
it looks like, and if you
graphically inspect this,

00:01:46.412 --> 00:01:48.679
and I actually know this is the
graph of y equals x squared,

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.410
except at that discontinuity
right over there,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.066
this is equal to nine.

00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:57.511
But the issue is, the way
this graph has been depicted,

00:01:57.511 --> 00:02:00.342
this is not the same thing
as the value of the function.

00:02:00.342 --> 00:02:01.909
This function

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.864
f of three, the way it's been graphed,

00:02:04.864 --> 00:02:07.890
f of three is equal to four.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.305
So this is a situation where
this two-sided limit exists,

00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:14.679
but it's not equal to the
value of that function.

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:16.594
You might see other
circumstances where the function

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.144
isn't even defined there,

00:02:18.144 --> 00:02:20.144
so that isn't even there.

00:02:20.144 --> 00:02:22.391
And so, once again, the limit might exist,

00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:24.437
but the function might
not be defined there.

00:02:24.437 --> 00:02:28.273
So, in either case, you aren't
going to meet this criteria

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:29.523
for continuity.

00:02:30.427 --> 00:02:34.153
And so that's how a point
or removable discontinuity,

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:36.169
why it is discontinuous

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:40.770
with regards to our limit
definition of continuity.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.281
So now let's look at this second example.

00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:45.924
If we looked at our
intuitive continuity test,

00:02:45.924 --> 00:02:48.629
if we would just try to trace this thing,

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.461
we see that once we get to x equals two,

00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:55.139
I have to pick up my
pencil to keep tracing it.

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.222
And so that's a pretty good
sign that we are discontinuous.

00:02:58.222 --> 00:03:00.512
We see that over here as well.

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:03.595
If I'm tracing this function,
I gotta pick up my pencil to,

00:03:03.595 --> 00:03:04.518
I can't go to that point.

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:06.018
I have to jump down here,

00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:07.681
and then keep going right over there.

00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:09.686
So in either case I have
to pick up my pencil.

00:03:09.686 --> 00:03:12.355
And so, intuitively, it is discontinuous.

00:03:12.355 --> 00:03:14.934
But this particular type of discontinuity,

00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:17.381
where I am making a jump from one point,

00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:19.584
and then I'm making a jump
down here to continue,

00:03:19.584 --> 00:03:22.379
it is intuitively called a jump

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.546
discontinuity,

00:03:24.432 --> 00:03:25.599
discontinuity.

00:03:27.754 --> 00:03:31.245
And this is, of course, a
point removable discontinuity.

00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:33.775
And so how does this relate to limits?

00:03:33.775 --> 00:03:37.704
Well, here, the left and
right-handed limits exist,

00:03:37.704 --> 00:03:39.242
but they're not the same thing,

00:03:39.242 --> 00:03:41.925
so you don't have a two-sided limit.

00:03:41.925 --> 00:03:45.566
So, for example, for
this one in particular,

00:03:45.566 --> 00:03:48.580
for all the x-values up to
and including x equals two,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.022
this is the graph of y equals x squared.

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:53.159
And then for x greater than two,

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.179
it's the graph of square root of x.

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:57.059
So in this scenario,

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:59.417
if you were to take the limit

00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:00.250
of f of x

00:04:01.502 --> 00:04:03.002
as x approaches

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.042
two

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.167
from the left,

00:04:08.191 --> 00:04:09.570
from the left,

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.010
this is going to be equal to four,

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.192
you're approaching this value.

00:04:12.192 --> 00:04:14.683
And that actually is the
value of the function.

00:04:14.683 --> 00:04:18.598
But if you were to take the
limit as x approaches two

00:04:18.598 --> 00:04:20.995
from the right of f of x,

00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:22.881
what is that going to be equal to?

00:04:22.881 --> 00:04:24.070
Well, approaching from the right,

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.534
this is actually the square root of x,

00:04:25.534 --> 00:04:28.606
so it's approaching
the square root of two.

00:04:28.606 --> 00:04:29.714
You wouldn't know it's
the square root of two

00:04:29.714 --> 00:04:30.716
just by looking at this.

00:04:30.716 --> 00:04:32.417
I know that, just because when I,

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:34.394
when I went on to Desmos
and defined the function,

00:04:34.394 --> 00:04:36.157
that's the function that I used.

00:04:36.157 --> 00:04:37.842
But it's clear even visually

00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:39.586
that you're approaching
two different values

00:04:39.586 --> 00:04:41.066
when you approach from the left

00:04:41.066 --> 00:04:42.770
than when you approach from the right.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.917
So even though the one-sided limits exist,

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:46.401
they're not approaching the same thing,

00:04:46.401 --> 00:04:48.230
so the two-sided limit doesn't exist.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.850
And if the two-sided limit doesn't exist,

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.541
it for sure cannot be equal to the value

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:54.508
of the function there, even
if the function is defined.

00:04:54.508 --> 00:04:58.744
So that's why the jump
discontinuity is failing this test.

00:04:58.744 --> 00:04:59.885
Now, once again, it's intuitive.

00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:01.459
You're seeing that, hey, I gotta jump,

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:02.546
I gotta pick up my pencil.

00:05:02.546 --> 00:05:06.158
These two things are not
connected to each other.

00:05:06.158 --> 00:05:08.752
Finally, what you see here is,

00:05:08.752 --> 00:05:10.000
when you learned precalculus,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.617
often known as an
asymptotic discontinuity,

00:05:13.617 --> 00:05:14.534
asymptotic,

00:05:17.462 --> 00:05:19.124
asymptotic

00:05:19.124 --> 00:05:20.291
discontinuity,

00:05:21.508 --> 00:05:22.675
discontinuity.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.525
And, intuitively, you
have an asymptote here.

00:05:27.525 --> 00:05:30.388
It's a vertical asymptote at x equals two.

00:05:30.388 --> 00:05:33.602
If I were to try to trace the graph

00:05:33.602 --> 00:05:34.855
from the left,

00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:36.803
I would just keep on going.

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:40.134
In fact, I would be doing
it forever, 'cause it's,

00:05:40.134 --> 00:05:42.126
it would be infinitely,

00:05:42.126 --> 00:05:44.484
it would be unbounded as
I get closer and closer

00:05:44.484 --> 00:05:46.332
to x equals two from the left.

00:05:46.332 --> 00:05:48.936
And if try to get to x
equals two from the right,

00:05:48.936 --> 00:05:51.132
once again I get unbounded up.

00:05:51.132 --> 00:05:52.757
But even if I could,

00:05:52.757 --> 00:05:55.067
and when I say it's unbounded,
it goes to infinity,

00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:57.317
so it's actually impossible

00:05:58.634 --> 00:06:02.367
in a mortal's lifespan to
try to trace the whole thing.

00:06:02.367 --> 00:06:04.418
But you get the sense that,
hey, there's no way that I could

00:06:04.418 --> 00:06:08.656
draw from here to here
without picking up my pencil.

00:06:08.656 --> 00:06:12.466
And if you wanna relate it
to our notion of limits,

00:06:12.466 --> 00:06:13.715
it's that

00:06:13.715 --> 00:06:16.930
both the left and right-handed
limits are unbounded,

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.398
so they officially don't exist.

00:06:18.398 --> 00:06:21.675
So if they don't exist, then
we can't meet these conditions.

00:06:21.675 --> 00:06:23.076
So if I were to say,

00:06:23.076 --> 00:06:24.363
the limit

00:06:24.363 --> 00:06:28.450
as x approaches two from the
left-hand side of f of x,

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.053
we can see that it goes unbounded
in the negative direction.

00:06:31.053 --> 00:06:33.352
You might sometimes see someone
write something like this,

00:06:33.352 --> 00:06:34.601
negative infinity.

00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:36.975
But that's a little
handwavy with the math.

00:06:36.975 --> 00:06:41.010
The more correct way to say
it is it's just unbounded,

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.617
unbounded.

00:06:42.617 --> 00:06:44.920
And, likewise, if we
thought about the limit

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.751
as x approaches two

00:06:46.751 --> 00:06:48.606
from the right

00:06:48.606 --> 00:06:49.918
of f of x,

00:06:49.918 --> 00:06:52.953
it is now unbounded
towards positive infinity.

00:06:52.953 --> 00:06:54.367
So this, once again,

00:06:54.367 --> 00:06:55.786
this is also,

00:06:55.786 --> 00:06:57.983
this is also unbounded.

00:06:57.983 --> 00:06:59.297
And

00:06:59.297 --> 00:07:01.440
because it's unbounded and
this limit does not exist,

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.631
it can't meet these conditions.

00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:04.950
And so we are going to be discontinuous.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.696
So this is a point or
removable discontinuity,

00:07:07.696 --> 00:07:09.931
jump discontinuity, I'm jumping,

00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:12.217
and then we have these
asymptotes, a vertical asymptote.

00:07:12.217 --> 00:07:15.045
This is an asymptotic discontinuity.
