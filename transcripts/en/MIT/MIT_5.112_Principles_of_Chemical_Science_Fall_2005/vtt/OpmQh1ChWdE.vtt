00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.643
Last time we started talking
about the internal motions of

00:00:20.643 --> 00:00:24.900
molecules, the vibrations and
the rotations.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.049
And we talked about how the
different ways in which a

00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:35.000
molecule can store energy were
called modes.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.169
Or, sometimes called the
degrees of freedom.

00:00:41.169 --> 00:00:48.200
And so, in general,
if we have a molecule that has

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.230
N atoms, it has 3N degrees of
freedom or 3N modes.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.404
And we said last time,
that three of those 3N modes

00:01:02.404 --> 00:01:11.195
are always translational modes.
We live in a three-dimensional

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:16.309
universe, so there are three
translational modes,

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:21.529
three directions in which the
molecule can travel,

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:24.085
can move.
And, therefore,

00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:29.305
if we use three of these 3N
modes for translation,

00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:34.845
then we have 3 minus 3 modes
that are internal modes,

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:42.355
internal degrees of freedom.
And that is what we really want

00:01:42.355 --> 00:01:47.335
to start looking at today.
On the diagram here,

00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:51.123
on the side,
here is our N molecule.

00:01:51.123 --> 00:01:57.077
There are 3N total modes.
I just said three of them were

00:01:57.077 --> 00:02:02.797
translational modes.
Now, how do we separate those

00:02:02.797 --> 00:02:07.234
remaining modes between rotation
and vibration?

00:02:07.234 --> 00:02:12.250
The way we do it this.
If you have a molecule that is

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.495
linear, you always have two
rotational modes.

00:02:16.495 --> 00:02:19.581
I will show you that in a
moment.

00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:24.308
Linear molecules always have
two rotational modes.

00:02:24.308 --> 00:02:30.000
Nonlinear molecules have three
rotational modes.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.531
Therefore, if we use,
in a linear molecule,

00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:40.465
three of them for translation,
two of them for rotation,

00:02:40.465 --> 00:02:46.184
the number of vibrational modes
are what is left over.

00:02:46.184 --> 00:02:51.794
For a linear molecule,
we have 3N minus 5 vibrational

00:02:51.794 --> 00:02:56.002
modes.
If we have a nonlinear

00:02:56.002 --> 00:03:02.476
molecule, since we have three
rotational modes in a nonlinear

00:03:02.476 --> 00:03:08.842
molecule, we have leftover 3N
minus 6 vibrational

00:03:08.842 --> 00:03:11.000
modes.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.834
Now, let's take a look at this
a little bit more in detail.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:25.455
Let's start with nitrogen.
Two atoms.

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:29.076
Six modes total.
Three translational.

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:33.000
Two rotational modes of
nitrogen.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.441
What are those rotational
modes?

00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:39.695
Well, here is our nitrogen.
And one of those rotational

00:03:39.695 --> 00:03:44.263
modes is going to be rotation
about an axis in the plane of

00:03:44.263 --> 00:03:47.808
this board, and its rotation
around this axis.

00:03:47.808 --> 00:03:52.376
That axis goes through the
center of mass of that molecule.

00:03:52.376 --> 00:03:56.000
That is one of the rotational
modes.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.437
Another rotational mode is
rotation around an axis,

00:04:00.437 --> 00:04:03.988
here, that is perpendicular to
the board.

00:04:03.988 --> 00:04:06.739
This is another rotational
mode.

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.887
It is going to turn out that
these two rotational modes are

00:04:11.887 --> 00:04:17.213
degenerate, meaning they are
going to have the same frequency

00:04:17.213 --> 00:04:21.029
of rotation.
They are going to have the same

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.136
energy.
We will talk about that in a

00:04:24.136 --> 00:04:28.574
moment.
What I want to point out,

00:04:28.574 --> 00:04:33.002
here, is that if you look at
the axis, here,

00:04:33.002 --> 00:04:38.460
in the plane of the board that
is along the bond axis,

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.021
this, hey, you know what,
this is not a rotational mode

00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:50.097
because there is cylindrical
symmetry around that bond axis.

00:04:50.097 --> 00:04:55.143
It has no meaning,
rotation around that bond axis.

00:04:55.143 --> 00:05:01.425
The molecule looks the same for
all of the angles from zero to

00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:06.779
360 degrees.
That is not a rotational mode.

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:10.486
Linear molecules,
diatomics, you have two

00:05:10.486 --> 00:05:14.749
rotational modes.
They are going to turn out to

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:18.177
be degenerate,
as we are going to see.

00:05:18.177 --> 00:05:22.625
And then, our table over there
says for nitrogen,

00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:26.054
we ought to have one
vibrational mode.

00:05:26.054 --> 00:05:30.435
And we do.
That one vibrational mode,

00:05:30.435 --> 00:05:33.994
here, is the nitrogen-nitrogen
stretch.

00:05:33.994 --> 00:05:38.584
It is a stretch mode.
We said last time that these

00:05:38.584 --> 00:05:43.643
bonds function like a spring.
The molecule can stretch,

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:48.982
the molecule can compress.
We are going to look at that in

00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:54.415
more detail in just a moment.
Next, in our table over here,

00:05:54.415 --> 00:05:59.286
let's look at CO two.
CO two has three atoms.

00:05:59.286 --> 00:06:05.000
Nine total modes.
Three of them are translation.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.209
CO two,
even though it has three atoms

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:14.541
in it, is a linear molecule,
so it has only two rotational

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:17.816
modes.
Let's look and see what those

00:06:17.816 --> 00:06:22.867
two rotational modes are.
One of those rotational modes

00:06:22.867 --> 00:06:28.480
is, again, rotation around an
axis in the plane of the board,

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.000
here, around the center of mass
of that molecule.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.777
That is one rotational mode.
The other rotational mode is

00:06:39.777 --> 00:06:44.523
around an axis perpendicular to
the board here.

00:06:44.523 --> 00:06:47.825
That is a second rotational
mode.

00:06:47.825 --> 00:06:53.809
These two modes are going to be
degenerate because they are

00:06:53.809 --> 00:07:00.000
actually the same motion,
just in a different plane.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.801
These are degenerate.
And then, again,

00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:08.527
just to emphasize,
if you think that you have a

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:13.356
rotation here along that linear
bond axis, well,

00:07:13.356 --> 00:07:18.184
the answer is no,
this is not a rotational mode.

00:07:18.184 --> 00:07:23.424
So, we have two rotational
modes for CO two.

00:07:23.424 --> 00:07:30.000
And now what does our table say
in terms of vibration?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.313
Well, in terms of vibration for
a linear molecule,

00:07:35.313 --> 00:07:40.734
3N minus 5,
we have used now five modes.

00:07:40.734 --> 00:07:45.072
We have four left,
3N minus 5.

00:07:45.072 --> 00:07:48.000
What are those modes?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:03.000
One of these modes is what we
call a symmetric stretch.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.500
A symmetric stretch means that
this oxygen and this oxygen are

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:20.786
simultaneously stretching or are
simultaneously compressing.

00:08:20.786 --> 00:08:26.008
My body is the carbon,
and my arms are the oxygen.

00:08:26.008 --> 00:08:31.975
A symmetric stretch is the
oxygens both moving in or both

00:08:31.975 --> 00:08:36.687
moving out.
That is one vibrational mode,

00:08:36.687 --> 00:08:41.507
this symmetric stretch.
That is one vibrational mode.

00:08:41.507 --> 00:08:44.473
What is another vibrational
mode?

00:08:44.473 --> 00:08:49.941
Well, if you have a symmetric
stretch, it must mean you have

00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:53.000
an anti-symmetric stretch.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.111
In this case,
we have one oxygen moving out

00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:03.703
while the other oxygen is moving
in.

00:09:03.703 --> 00:09:07.111
And this carbon is kind of
moving in like that,

00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:09.333
too.
Or, this one is moving in,

00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:12.666
this one is moving in,
this one is moving out.

00:09:12.666 --> 00:09:15.185
That is the anti-symmetric
stretch.

00:09:15.185 --> 00:09:18.962
If my body is the carbon and my
arms are the oxygen,

00:09:18.962 --> 00:09:23.111
this is the anti-symmetric
stretch with the carbon moving

00:09:23.111 --> 00:09:25.629
just a little bit to the side,
too.

00:09:25.629 --> 00:09:30.000
The anti-symmetric stretch,
another mode.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.390
These two modes are not
degenerate.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.570
They have different
frequencies.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:39.000
They have different energies.
We will see that in a moment.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.432
What are the other modes?
Well, the other modes are a

00:09:58.432 --> 00:10:02.403
bending mode.
What can happen is that this

00:10:02.403 --> 00:10:07.811
oxygen and this oxygen can move
in, and this carbon will kind of

00:10:07.811 --> 00:10:09.785
move out.
Or, of course,

00:10:09.785 --> 00:10:11.416
the other way,
here.

00:10:11.416 --> 00:10:14.763
These go like that,
this goes like that,

00:10:14.763 --> 00:10:20.000
or that goes like that.
This is a bending vibration.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.051
Again, if my body is the carbon
and these are the oxygens,

00:10:32.051 --> 00:10:37.000
the bending vibration looks
like this.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.911
That is the bending vibration.
However, you could also imagine

00:10:43.911 --> 00:10:48.103
that you have a bend in another
plane.

00:10:48.103 --> 00:10:53.201
In other words,
you can imagine that these two

00:10:53.201 --> 00:11:00.000
oxygens here are coming out at
you or going in at you.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.555
And so, in other words,
if I am the carbon,

00:11:04.555 --> 00:11:10.196
these are the oxygens.
We also have a bend like this.

00:11:10.196 --> 00:11:14.861
These two bending vibrations
are degenerate.

00:11:14.861 --> 00:11:18.657
These are four different
vibrations.

00:11:18.657 --> 00:11:23.864
They are the four vibrational
modes, two bending,

00:11:23.864 --> 00:11:27.769
one symmetric stretch,
and the other,

00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:34.903
the anti-symmetric stretch.
That is what we have in 

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:38.387
CO two.
What about another molecule?

00:11:38.387 --> 00:11:41.870
How about water?
We have three atoms.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:47.096
Again, nine total modes.
Three of them are translation,

00:11:47.096 --> 00:11:50.870
but now water is not a linear
molecular.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:56.774
So, we are going to have three
rotational modes in the case of

00:11:56.774 --> 00:12:00.258
water.
Let's look at what those three

00:12:00.258 --> 00:12:05.000
rotational modes ought to look
like.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.087
Here is our water molecule.
One of those rotations is,

00:12:18.087 --> 00:12:24.520
again, a rotation around an
axis here in the plane of the

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.000
board.
That is one rotational mode.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.509
If I am the oxygen and my hands
are the hydrogen,

00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:37.172
this is a rotational mode.
You got that?

00:12:37.172 --> 00:12:40.178
Okay.
And then another rotational

00:12:40.178 --> 00:12:44.124
mode, here.
It can be a rotation around the

00:12:44.124 --> 00:12:48.539
center of the mass,
centered on the oxygen here.

00:12:48.539 --> 00:12:52.672
Axis perpendicular to the plane
of the board.

00:12:52.672 --> 00:12:56.148
This is that rotation.
And I am sorry,

00:12:56.148 --> 00:13:02.799
but I cannot do cartwheels.
That is one rotational mode.

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:07.799
And then a final rotational
mode involves rotation,

00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:13.000
now, around this axis.
It is an axis perpendicular to

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.899
this one, but in the plane of
the board.

00:13:16.899 --> 00:13:23.000
And this is a rotational mode.
We have three rotational modes.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.299
This one requires me to do some
flips, which I am also not going

00:13:29.299 --> 00:13:33.583
to do.
But each one of these modes has

00:13:33.583 --> 00:13:37.333
a different frequency,
has a different energy.

00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:42.416
And you can see we have three
of them now because we no longer

00:13:42.416 --> 00:13:46.916
have a linear molecule.
We have three rotational modes.

00:13:46.916 --> 00:13:50.250
Now, what about the vibrations
for water?

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:54.833
Well, you can see from our
graph up here that 3N minus 6,

00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:59.416
in this case for
water, is going to be three

00:13:59.416 --> 00:14:07.000
vibrational modes.
Let's look at that.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.838
One of those vibrational modes
is a symmetric stretch,

00:14:25.838 --> 00:14:30.225
again.
The hydrogen is moving in or

00:14:30.225 --> 00:14:35.000
both moving out at the same
time.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.296
A picture of the symmetric
stretch is, again,

00:14:39.296 --> 00:14:43.006
I am the oxygen,
arms are the hydrogen.

00:14:43.006 --> 00:14:46.521
This is the symmetric stretch,
right?

00:14:46.521 --> 00:14:50.525
And then, if there is a
symmetric stretch,

00:14:50.525 --> 00:14:55.016
there is going to be an
anti-symmetric stretch.

00:14:55.016 --> 00:15:00.777
What that means is one of the
hydrogens is moving in and the

00:15:00.777 --> 00:15:06.194
other one moving out.
Or, this way.

00:15:06.194 --> 00:15:15.311
Of course, a picture for that
is this kind of a motion.

00:15:15.311 --> 00:15:22.064
You get the idea.
Anti-symmetric stretch.

00:15:22.064 --> 00:15:30.000
And then, finally,
we have a bending mode.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.550
A bending mode,
meaning these hydrogens moving

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:40.854
this way or those hydrogens
moving that way.

00:15:40.854 --> 00:15:46.035
And, of course,
a picture for that is this.

00:15:46.035 --> 00:15:50.969
That is a bending mode for the
hydrogens.

00:15:50.969 --> 00:15:58.000
We have three vibrational modes
for the hydrogen.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.379
Now we are going to look at
some of the principles behind

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:04.960
these internal degrees of
freedom.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.324
But, of course,
the other reason for telling

00:16:08.324 --> 00:16:12.000
you about this-- Did you have a
question?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.589
It can, but it is not a
separate mode.

00:16:20.589 --> 00:16:23.500
That is correct.
That is right.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.798
It looks like a rotation,
actually.

00:16:26.798 --> 00:16:32.243
That is absolutely correct.
The other reason for talking

00:16:32.243 --> 00:16:37.129
about this is to tell you that
each one of these vibrations or

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:41.215
rotations occurs at a frequency
at an energy that is

00:16:41.215 --> 00:16:45.861
characteristic of the molecule.
If we had a way to actually

00:16:45.861 --> 00:16:50.828
measure the frequency of these
vibrations or the frequencies of

00:16:50.828 --> 00:16:54.433
the rotations,
well, then we have a great tool

00:16:54.433 --> 00:16:59.000
for identifying what kind of
molecule we have.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.661
Analytically,
this is a wonderful technique

00:17:02.661 --> 00:17:06.584
for identifying,
ultimately, the molecule that

00:17:06.584 --> 00:17:11.641
you have, if you can measure
those frequencies of vibration

00:17:11.641 --> 00:17:15.302
or rotation.
And we are going to do that in

00:17:15.302 --> 00:17:18.615
just a moment.
But what we also have to

00:17:18.615 --> 00:17:23.323
understand, before we go and
measure these frequencies,

00:17:23.323 --> 00:17:28.030
is we have to understand that
the energies with which a

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:33.000
molecule vibrates or rotates are
quantized.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.750
So, that is what we have to
spend some time thinking about

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.000
right now.
Let's do that.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And we are going to start with
vibration.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.558
To illustrate this,
I am going to draw one of these

00:18:04.558 --> 00:18:09.571
energies of interaction,
again, one of these curves that

00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:14.676
we have been talking about.
And I am going to set my zero

00:18:14.676 --> 00:18:18.232
of energy at the dissociated
atom limit.

00:18:18.232 --> 00:18:21.696
So, I am going to talk about H
plus Cl.

00:18:21.696 --> 00:18:25.524
And, of course,
right here, we talked about

00:18:25.524 --> 00:18:29.809
this being the equilibrium bond
length, r sub e,

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:33.000
for the HCl molecule.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.546
That is the energy of
interaction.

00:18:42.546 --> 00:18:49.102
I am going to now draw in the
ground vibrational state of HCl,

00:18:49.102 --> 00:18:53.294
which I am going to represent
as a line.

00:18:53.294 --> 00:18:59.742
It is going to be the energy.
There is the ground vibrational

00:18:59.742 --> 00:19:04.859
state of HCl.
The ground vibrational state,

00:19:04.859 --> 00:19:09.591
that energy is characterized by
a quantum number.

00:19:09.591 --> 00:19:15.014
The quantum number is the
vibrational quantum number for

00:19:15.014 --> 00:19:20.830
the ground vibrational state.
The vibrational quantum number

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:26.154
is v equal zero.
What this line represents is

00:19:26.154 --> 00:19:32.936
the ground vibrational energy.
It also represents the extent

00:19:32.936 --> 00:19:38.303
to which the molecule's bond
stretches and compresses.

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:42.151
The bottom line,
here, is that the bond

00:19:42.151 --> 00:19:47.316
stretches up to here.
The inner section of this line

00:19:47.316 --> 00:19:52.987
with the interaction energy,
here, represents the maximum

00:19:52.987 --> 00:19:57.544
distance of the bond,
the maximum bond length,

00:19:57.544 --> 00:20:02.000
the most that the bond
stretches.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.804
r is going this way.
The intersection of this energy

00:20:07.804 --> 00:20:14.861
with this curve represents the
closest that the two nuclei get.

00:20:14.861 --> 00:20:21.349
This represents the most that
the molecule has compressed.

00:20:21.349 --> 00:20:24.878
This is the smallest value of
r.

00:20:24.878 --> 00:20:30.000
That is what that diagram
represents.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.568
If you start out,
here, with an HCl molecule at

00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:40.030
the equilibrium bond length,
right here, what happens is

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:45.294
that the HCl will stretch,
and it will stretch to this

00:20:45.294 --> 00:20:48.571
position.
This is an exaggeration.

00:20:48.571 --> 00:20:54.232
This is how much it stretches.
And then, it comes back and

00:20:54.232 --> 00:20:59.000
goes through the equilibrium
position.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.734
Over here, and this is another
exaggeration,

00:21:02.734 --> 00:21:06.208
this is how close they get to
each other.

00:21:06.208 --> 00:21:11.506
This is how much they compress.
This point is often called the

00:21:11.506 --> 00:21:15.240
inner turning point,
inner because it is the

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.843
smallest bond distance.
This is often called the outer

00:21:19.843 --> 00:21:24.359
turning point because it is the
larger bond distance.

00:21:24.359 --> 00:21:28.007
It is outer because it is at
this distance,

00:21:28.007 --> 00:21:34.000
now, that the bond turns around
and begins to compress.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.297
This HCl molecule here is
vibrating, equilibrium position.

00:21:39.297 --> 00:21:44.501
Then it goes to the maximum
extension, comes back through

00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:49.427
the equilibrium position,
and then goes to the maximum

00:21:49.427 --> 00:21:54.167
compression, comes back to the
equilibrium position.

00:21:54.167 --> 00:21:59.000
That is what this line
literally represents.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.649
It is also the energy,
which I will explain a little

00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:08.754
bit more in just a moment.
So, this molecule is vibrating

00:22:08.754 --> 00:22:12.766
from here to here to here and
back and forth.

00:22:12.766 --> 00:22:18.236
Now, what I also want to point
out to you is something that I

00:22:18.236 --> 00:22:23.797
have been kind of misleading you
about for the last few weeks.

00:22:23.797 --> 00:22:28.994
That is that this molecule is
not sitting in the bottom of

00:22:28.994 --> 00:22:33.638
this well.
Remember that when we were

00:22:33.638 --> 00:22:39.220
drawing bond association
energies, I was drawing it from

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:44.599
the bottom of this well to the
dissociated atom limit?

00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:49.471
I told you this was delta E sub
d.

00:22:49.471 --> 00:22:54.952
Well, the bottom line is that
it is not really correct.

00:22:54.952 --> 00:22:59.011
The reason is,
is because the molecule is

00:22:59.011 --> 00:23:05.000
never really sitting at the
bottom of this well.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.492
It is sitting this much above.
It is sitting at the v equal

00:23:10.492 --> 00:23:15.416
zero state.
It is not sitting at the bottom

00:23:15.416 --> 00:23:19.109
of the well.
If it were, it would not be

00:23:19.109 --> 00:23:22.234
vibrating.
If it is not vibration,

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:28.011
it will violate the Uncertainty
Principle, something we didn't

00:23:28.011 --> 00:23:33.225
talk about.
But the bottom line is that it

00:23:33.225 --> 00:23:37.096
cannot sit at the bottom of the
well.

00:23:37.096 --> 00:23:42.258
It is always vibrating by about
this much energy.

00:23:42.258 --> 00:23:48.817
When you have an experimentally
determined dissociation energy

00:23:48.817 --> 00:23:54.086
for the bond energy,
the experimentally determined

00:23:54.086 --> 00:24:00.000
energy is actually the energy
from this level.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.546
From v equal zero up
to this dissociation limit.

00:24:05.546 --> 00:24:09.050
This is the experimental bond
energy.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:14.500
Because, if you are going to
measure a bond energy in the

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:18.879
laboratory, well,
you can only measure it from

00:24:18.879 --> 00:24:24.523
the lowest level at which that
molecule can possibly be at.

00:24:24.523 --> 00:24:29.000
It is not at the bottom of the
well.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.517
The difference between where
this level is and the bottom of

00:24:34.517 --> 00:24:39.942
the well actually has a name.
That difference is called the

00:24:39.942 --> 00:24:42.000
zero point energy.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.184
And I will explain that in a
moment, when we look at the

00:24:52.184 --> 00:24:55.200
energies a little more
carefully.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:00.573
Now, just for completeness,
and this is not something that

00:25:00.573 --> 00:25:04.438
you have to know,
let me tell you what the

00:25:04.438 --> 00:25:10.000
nomenclature usually is here for
these well depths.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.085
The nomenclature from the
bottom of the well to here,

00:25:14.085 --> 00:25:18.407
which is not experimentally
measured, is usually D sub e,

00:25:18.407 --> 00:25:21.000
dissociation sub e.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.712
From the v equal zero
level to the dissociation limit,

00:25:33.712 --> 00:25:37.248
that energy here is D sub zero.

00:25:37.248 --> 00:25:42.417
You don't have to know these,
but I just want to tell you,

00:25:42.417 --> 00:25:46.316
when you see that.
All dissociation energies

00:25:46.316 --> 00:25:51.121
experimentally measured are
measured from here to here

00:25:51.121 --> 00:25:56.108
because that is the lowest
energy the molecule can have,

00:25:56.108 --> 00:26:01.186
is being in the v equal zero
ground vibrational

00:26:01.186 --> 00:26:07.411
state.
Well, now let's take a look at

00:26:07.411 --> 00:26:13.000
the energies a little more
carefully.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.351
Here is our favorite diagram
again, our intermolecular

00:26:37.351 --> 00:26:41.425
interaction potential.
This is HCl,

00:26:41.425 --> 00:26:45.859
so here is the dissociated atom
limit.

00:26:45.859 --> 00:26:51.371
This is v equal zero,
right in there.

00:26:51.371 --> 00:26:57.723
Now, there is an excited state
for the HCl, or for any

00:26:57.723 --> 00:27:02.443
molecule.
v equal one is the first

00:27:02.443 --> 00:27:08.145
vibrationally excited state.
v equal two is the

00:27:08.145 --> 00:27:11.607
second vibrationally excited
state.

00:27:11.607 --> 00:27:15.272
v equal three is the
third.

00:27:15.272 --> 00:27:18.938
v equal four is the
fourth.

00:27:18.938 --> 00:27:22.501
v equal five is the
fifth.

00:27:22.501 --> 00:27:28.000
These are the allowed
vibrational energies.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.749
In other words,
the molecule can vibrate with

00:27:32.749 --> 00:27:38.577
this energy or this energy or
this energy, but not some

00:27:38.577 --> 00:27:43.219
arbitrary energy,
like right in here or like

00:27:43.219 --> 00:27:47.104
right in there.
These are the allowed

00:27:47.104 --> 00:27:52.285
vibrational states.
And we have a nice analytical

00:27:52.285 --> 00:27:56.279
expression to describe those
energies.

00:27:56.279 --> 00:28:02.000
That analytical expression is
right here.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.422
That energy is h times nu times
(that vibrational quantum number

00:28:07.422 --> 00:28:10.263
plus one-half).

00:28:10.263 --> 00:28:13.706
So, v is that vibrational
quantum number.

00:28:13.706 --> 00:28:17.407
This nu, here,
is the fundamental frequency,

00:28:17.407 --> 00:28:22.141
which is the frequency with
which the molecule vibrates.

00:28:22.141 --> 00:28:26.789
It is the frequency with which
that molecule stretches,

00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:31.093
comes back to the equilibrium
position, compresses,

00:28:31.093 --> 00:28:36.000
and comes back to the
equilibrium position.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.541
It is the number of cycles per
second that molecule makes.

00:28:41.541 --> 00:28:47.277
So, nu is the number of cycles,
here, that the molecule in v

00:28:47.277 --> 00:28:50.777
equal zero makes per
second.

00:28:50.777 --> 00:28:55.541
Stretches, compresses,
and back to the equilibrium

00:28:55.541 --> 00:28:58.458
position.
Notice it is also the

00:28:58.458 --> 00:29:04.000
vibrational frequency of v equal
one.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.200
The vibrational frequency does
not depend on the vibrational

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.990
quantum number.
You see no dependence of the

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:16.781
vibrational quantum number on
the frequency.

00:29:16.781 --> 00:29:21.541
v equal two vibrates
with the same frequency.

00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:23.920
v equal three.
v equal four.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.534
v equal five.
All of these states have the

00:29:27.534 --> 00:29:30.884
same nu here,
have the same fundamental

00:29:30.884 --> 00:29:34.602
frequency.
What does that mean?

00:29:34.602 --> 00:29:39.249
That looks a little strange in
the sense that if you have a

00:29:39.249 --> 00:29:43.816
molecule in v equals zero,
the number of cycles per second

00:29:43.816 --> 00:29:48.222
that it makes is the same as a
molecule in v equal five.

00:29:48.222 --> 00:29:52.869
Well, you can see that in v
equal five, the molecule has to

00:29:52.869 --> 00:29:56.635
stretch further,
and it has to compress further.

00:29:56.635 --> 00:30:02.571
It has to travel more distance.
And so, if it has to travel

00:30:02.571 --> 00:30:06.571
more distance,
but it still carries out the

00:30:06.571 --> 00:30:11.904
number of cycles per unit time,
the same as v equal zero,

00:30:11.904 --> 00:30:17.523
well, then it must mean that
the molecule in v equal five is

00:30:17.523 --> 00:30:21.047
moving more quickly,
is moving faster.

00:30:21.047 --> 00:30:26.285
And that is what that means.
The energy of this state is

00:30:26.285 --> 00:30:30.000
higher.
It is moving faster.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.271
But it is moving with the same
frequency nu.

00:30:34.271 --> 00:30:37.549
That is the fundamental
frequency.

00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:42.516
That fundamental frequency,
of course, is in hertz,

00:30:42.516 --> 00:30:45.794
our unit for all frequencies
here.

00:30:45.794 --> 00:30:51.258
Now, I drew on the board and
called this energy from the

00:30:51.258 --> 00:30:56.920
bottom of the well to v equal
zero, the zero point energy.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:01.943
That is what it is.
But numerically what that

00:31:01.943 --> 00:31:05.831
energy is, is one-half h nu.
Stick in v equal zero,

00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:08.785
you get one-half h nu.

00:31:08.785 --> 00:31:11.739
This energy,
here, is measured from the

00:31:11.739 --> 00:31:15.160
bottom of this well.
It is important that you

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.659
understand where this energy is
measured from.

00:31:18.659 --> 00:31:22.002
It is measured from the bottom
of this well.

00:31:22.002 --> 00:31:25.112
v equal one,
you put that in here and get

00:31:25.112 --> 00:31:29.000
three-halves h nu.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.251
v equal two,
you get five-halves h nu.

00:31:33.251 --> 00:31:35.781
v equal three,

00:31:35.781 --> 00:31:40.032
you get seven-halves h nu.

00:31:40.032 --> 00:31:45.801
The other thing to notice is
that these states are equally

00:31:45.801 --> 00:31:49.546
spaced.
The energy spacing between any

00:31:49.546 --> 00:31:54.000
two adjacent states is h times
nu.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.789
That is incorrect.
What I am drawing,

00:32:05.789 --> 00:32:09.684
here, is right.
I am sorry about that.

00:32:09.684 --> 00:32:16.105
One-half h nu is
from the bottom of the well to v

00:32:16.105 --> 00:32:20.315
equal zero.
I think I know what happened.

00:32:20.315 --> 00:32:24.210
What I have shown you here is
correct.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:30.000
What is in your notes is
printed incorrectly.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
You should make note of that
and change that.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.875
Suppose we have a molecule in
the v equal zero state,

00:32:49.875 --> 00:32:54.562
where the energy is one-half h
nu,

00:32:54.562 --> 00:33:00.000
that molecule can be excited to
the v equal one state.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.389
That molecule in v equal zero
is still vibrating,

00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:09.510
but we can make it vibrate even
faster, with more energy.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:13.899
The same cycles per second,
but with more energy,

00:33:13.899 --> 00:33:19.477
by promoting it to v equal one.
We can do that if the molecule

00:33:19.477 --> 00:33:23.684
absorbs a photon.
And the energy of that photon

00:33:23.684 --> 00:33:28.348
has to be equal to the
difference in the energies of

00:33:28.348 --> 00:33:33.053
these two states.
So, if the final energy,

00:33:33.053 --> 00:33:37.760
here, of the v equal one state,
that is the final state,

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:43.066
if that energy is three-halves
h nu and the energy

00:33:43.066 --> 00:33:47.430
of the initial state was
one-half h nu,

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:52.222
then the difference in energy
between the states is h nu.

00:33:52.222 --> 00:33:56.672
We have to have a photon that
has exactly this energy

00:33:56.672 --> 00:33:59.410
different, delta E.
That delta E,

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:04.459
then, has to be gotten by a
photon with a frequency equal to

00:34:04.459 --> 00:34:07.923
nu.
And the frequency of that

00:34:07.923 --> 00:34:12.538
photon that is going to make
that transition is actually also

00:34:12.538 --> 00:34:15.692
the fundamental frequency of the
molecule.

00:34:15.692 --> 00:34:19.692
We are lucky on this one.
Nu is delta E over h.

00:34:19.692 --> 00:34:23.153
We have to have a photon with

00:34:23.153 --> 00:34:28.000
that frequency for the molecule
to be promoted from v equal zero

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.122
to v equal one.
How do we know what that is?

00:34:33.122 --> 00:34:39.368
Well, we do an experiment.
We do an infrared spectroscopy

00:34:39.368 --> 00:34:44.832
type of experiment.
The difference in the energies

00:34:44.832 --> 00:34:51.189
between vibrational states is in
the infrared range of the

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:56.877
electromagnetic spectrum.
And so we are going to use

00:34:56.877 --> 00:35:02.483
infrared radiation.
We have some source of infrared

00:35:02.483 --> 00:35:05.286
radiation.
It puts out all different

00:35:05.286 --> 00:35:09.852
frequencies in the infrared.
And then we send it through a

00:35:09.852 --> 00:35:13.136
monochromator.
The monochromator disperses

00:35:13.136 --> 00:35:17.782
that radiation in space and
allows only a certain frequency

00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:22.268
of radiation to come right
through the slits and out into

00:35:22.268 --> 00:35:24.912
our sample.
It is like you had the

00:35:24.912 --> 00:35:28.276
diffraction glasses,
where we disbursed the

00:35:28.276 --> 00:35:32.700
radiation in space.
Well, a monochromator is

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.740
essentially the same thing.
There is a diffraction grading

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.078
in it.
It allows, out of the front

00:35:39.078 --> 00:35:42.905
end, only radiation of a certain
frequency to come out.

00:35:42.905 --> 00:35:46.944
And we can adjust what that
radiation is or what frequency

00:35:46.944 --> 00:35:49.992
that radiation has.
We then allow it to pass

00:35:49.992 --> 00:35:51.905
through our sample,
say HCl.

00:35:51.905 --> 00:35:54.881
And then there is photo
detector over here,

00:35:54.881 --> 00:36:00.390
some kind of photomultiplier.
And what will happen is that if

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:05.016
this molecule is going to absorb
frequency of that radiation,

00:36:05.016 --> 00:36:08.871
well, then the number of
photons reaching the photo

00:36:08.871 --> 00:36:13.497
detector is going to go down.
If the frequency does not match

00:36:13.497 --> 00:36:16.813
the frequency of the vibration
of HCl, well,

00:36:16.813 --> 00:36:20.436
the photons go right through,
onto the detector.

00:36:20.436 --> 00:36:24.214
But if it matches,
then the molecule absorbs those

00:36:24.214 --> 00:36:27.761
photons and they never make it
to the detector.

00:36:27.761 --> 00:36:33.132
So, a plot looks like this.
This is the intensity at the

00:36:33.132 --> 00:36:36.635
detector versus the frequency of
the radiation.

00:36:36.635 --> 00:36:40.671
The intensity will be high,
but now at some frequency,

00:36:40.671 --> 00:36:45.012
which will turn out to be the
vibrational frequency of the

00:36:45.012 --> 00:36:47.829
molecule, the intensity goes
down low.

00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:52.322
And then, as you go to higher
frequency, the intensity comes

00:36:52.322 --> 00:36:55.064
back up.
Right here, the molecule has

00:36:55.064 --> 00:36:59.861
made the transition from v equal
zero to v equal one because the

00:36:59.861 --> 00:37:04.659
frequency of that photon matches
the energy difference between v

00:37:04.659 --> 00:37:09.000
equal zero and v equal one
divided by h.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.924
It also happens to be the
fundamental frequency of the

00:37:13.924 --> 00:37:18.106
molecule for HCl.
So, that is how we know what

00:37:18.106 --> 00:37:21.172
those fundamental frequencies
are.

00:37:21.172 --> 00:37:24.982
Let's now look at what those
energies are.

00:37:24.982 --> 00:37:30.000
We have gone from v equal zero
to v equal one.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.947
Delta E equal h nu. We just

00:37:34.947 --> 00:37:39.157
measured nu as 8.6x10^13 inverse
seconds.

00:37:39.157 --> 00:37:44.105
Multiply it by h.
That is going to give us delta

00:37:44.105 --> 00:37:46.842
E.
The difference in energy

00:37:46.842 --> 00:37:51.368
between the two states is
5.7x10^-20 joules.

00:37:51.368 --> 00:37:57.789
If I turn that into kilojoules
per mole, that is 35 kilojoules

00:37:57.789 --> 00:38:02.620
per mole.
That is the energy difference

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:06.867
from here to here,
about 35 kilojoules per mole.

00:38:06.867 --> 00:38:12.108
How strong is the HCl bond?
Well, the HCl bond from here to

00:38:12.108 --> 00:38:15.451
here is about 420 kilojoules per
mole.

00:38:15.451 --> 00:38:20.150
This is about a tenth,
a little bit less than a tenth

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:23.222
of the total bond strength for
HCl.

00:38:23.222 --> 00:38:27.831
If we make it vibrate,
we are not going to make that

00:38:27.831 --> 00:38:32.929
bond break.
It is an order of magnitude

00:38:32.929 --> 00:38:38.788
less energy here than what you
need to break that bond.

00:38:38.788 --> 00:38:44.105
Now, here is something that is
a little confusing.

00:38:44.105 --> 00:38:50.507
These fundamental frequencies,
it turns out that we actually

00:38:50.507 --> 00:38:56.692
use a different convention to
label them, different units.

00:38:56.692 --> 00:39:03.093
We do not use Hertz very often
to talk about the fundamental

00:39:03.093 --> 00:39:09.566
frequencies of molecules.
We use something called a

00:39:09.566 --> 00:39:15.111
wavenumber instead of hertz.
A wavenumber is an inverse

00:39:15.111 --> 00:39:19.732
centimeter, centimeter to the
minus one power.

00:39:19.732 --> 00:39:25.892
The symbol for a wavenumber is
a frequency sign with a bar on

00:39:25.892 --> 00:39:30.000
top of it.
That is a wave number.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000
How do we get a wavenumber?
Well, we get a wavenumber by

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.181
taking the frequency in Hertz,
inverse seconds,

00:39:39.181 --> 00:39:42.545
and dividing it by the speed of
light.

00:39:42.545 --> 00:39:46.727
But the speed of light,
of course, has to be in

00:39:46.727 --> 00:39:50.545
centimeters per second.
The seconds cancel,

00:39:50.545 --> 00:39:56.000
and what we have then left is
inverse centimeters.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.763
For example,
if the fundamental frequency of

00:40:00.763 --> 00:40:06.746
HCl was 8.6x10^13 hertz,
we divide that by the speed of

00:40:06.746 --> 00:40:12.396
light in centimeters per second
and the wavenumbers,

00:40:12.396 --> 00:40:17.825
or the fundamental frequency in
wavenumbers, then,

00:40:17.825 --> 00:40:24.472
is 2,886 wavenumbers for HCl.
These are the common units that

00:40:24.472 --> 00:40:29.900
are used to talk about the
fundamental vibrational

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:35.981
frequencies of molecules.
And these are the common

00:40:35.981 --> 00:40:40.357
numbers used to discuss infrared
spectra of molecules.

00:40:40.357 --> 00:40:44.155
This unit of a wavenumber.
It is a non-SI unit.

00:40:44.155 --> 00:40:47.788
In other words,
what you will often see is an

00:40:47.788 --> 00:40:51.504
infrared spectrum intensity at
the photodiode,

00:40:51.504 --> 00:40:56.045
now, versus wave number.
And right at 2,886 wavenumbers,

00:40:56.045 --> 00:41:01.000
that is the fundamental
frequency in wavenumbers.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.717
That is where the molecule
makes the transition from v

00:41:06.717 --> 00:41:11.787
equal zero to v equal one.
Now, the question is,

00:41:11.787 --> 00:41:18.259
what determines the frequency
of the vibration of a molecule?

00:41:18.259 --> 00:41:23.976
Well, what determines the
frequency of that vibration,

00:41:23.976 --> 00:41:29.909
and here, I have now gone back
to frequency because I am

00:41:29.909 --> 00:41:34.655
writing it in terms of some
other parameters,

00:41:34.655 --> 00:41:40.106
are two parameters.
One is the force constant k,

00:41:40.106 --> 00:41:44.394
and the other is the mass.
What I have here is the reduced

00:41:44.394 --> 00:41:46.952
mass.
I will explain that to you in

00:41:46.952 --> 00:41:50.037
just a moment,
but this is essentially the

00:41:50.037 --> 00:41:52.595
mass.
The frequency is given by one

00:41:52.595 --> 00:41:57.034
over 2pi times the square root
of this k, the force constant

00:41:57.034 --> 00:42:00.043
over the mass.

00:42:00.043 --> 00:42:04.158
sqrt(k / m)**
That force constant,

00:42:04.158 --> 00:42:09.122
k, is a measure of the
stiffness of the spring.

00:42:09.122 --> 00:42:13.223
Another words,
if you have a very stiff

00:42:13.223 --> 00:42:19.158
spring, k is very large.
That is you need a lot of force

00:42:19.158 --> 00:42:25.309
to pull that spring apart,
a lot of force to compress that

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:29.410
spring.
A large k means you have a very

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:34.481
stiff spring.
If you have a small k,

00:42:34.481 --> 00:42:38.766
that means you have a very weak
spring.

00:42:38.766 --> 00:42:45.195
It does not take very much
force to stretch that spring or

00:42:45.195 --> 00:42:50.609
to compress that spring.
So k is a measure of the

00:42:50.609 --> 00:42:56.248
stiffness of the spring.
It also tells us something

00:42:56.248 --> 00:43:02.000
about the shape of the
interaction energy.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.467
Another words,
what k actually tells us here

00:43:06.467 --> 00:43:09.896
is kind of the width of this
well.

00:43:09.896 --> 00:43:14.571
Here is my interaction energy,
potential well.

00:43:14.571 --> 00:43:19.766
If you have a very narrow
width, this is a large k.

00:43:19.766 --> 00:43:25.480
If you have a very broad width,
here, this is a small k.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:30.779
So, k, the force constant,
tells us about the shape,

00:43:30.779 --> 00:43:36.711
here, of this well.
Very narrow well,

00:43:36.711 --> 00:43:40.539
large k.
Very broad well,

00:43:40.539 --> 00:43:46.122
small k.
Now, I think that maybe you

00:43:46.122 --> 00:43:55.055
have seen this before in 8.01.
Have you done the harmonic

00:43:55.055 --> 00:43:57.926
oscillator yet?
No?

00:43:57.926 --> 00:44:00.791
Yes?
Some yes.

00:44:00.791 --> 00:44:03.868
Some no.
Mostly no, it sounds to me.

00:44:03.868 --> 00:44:07.384
This expression,
here, for the frequency,

00:44:07.384 --> 00:44:10.725
you are going to see in 8.01
some time.

00:44:10.725 --> 00:44:14.505
It comes from the harmonic
oscillator model.

00:44:14.505 --> 00:44:18.725
You will remember that you have
seen this before.

00:44:18.725 --> 00:44:23.120
Those of you who have know what
I am talking about.

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:28.043
Those of you who have not,
just remember you are going to

00:44:28.043 --> 00:44:35.792
see this very soon once again.
Now, the other parameter here

00:44:35.792 --> 00:44:42.592
that is important is this mu
here, this reduced mass.

00:44:42.592 --> 00:44:49.000
What the reduced mass is,
is essentially the mass.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.361
Now, if you had already done
this in 8.01,

00:44:54.361 --> 00:45:02.338
what you are going to look at
is a mass on the end of a spring

00:45:02.338 --> 00:45:08.022
attached to a wall.
There will be a wall,

00:45:08.022 --> 00:45:13.222
then you will see a spring,
and then there will be some

00:45:13.222 --> 00:45:16.688
mass m.
When you do this problem as a

00:45:16.688 --> 00:45:21.503
harmonic oscillator,
you are going to write nu here

00:45:21.503 --> 00:45:26.607
as k over this mass right there.
But, in this example,

00:45:26.607 --> 00:45:32.000
this mass here is the only body
that is moving.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.745
Your wall is still.
But, in the case of a molecule,

00:45:36.745 --> 00:45:40.732
both atoms are moving.
What mass do we use?

00:45:40.732 --> 00:45:46.332
Well, the fact that both are
moving means we have a two body

00:45:46.332 --> 00:45:49.654
problem.
And we are going to have to

00:45:49.654 --> 00:45:55.159
change the coordinate system to
take into account that both

00:45:55.159 --> 00:46:00.000
masses are moving.
We can do that easily.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.699
And doing that easily involves
using something called the

00:46:04.699 --> 00:46:08.139
reduced mass.
The reduced mass takes a two

00:46:08.139 --> 00:46:13.258
body problem and reduces it to a
single body, where the single

00:46:13.258 --> 00:46:18.293
body is this fictitious body
with a mass given by the reduced

00:46:18.293 --> 00:46:19.720
mass.
It is exact.

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.909
I did not make any
approximations here.

00:46:22.909 --> 00:46:27.776
But the bottom line is that
this reduced mass is simply the

00:46:27.776 --> 00:46:31.552
mass of one atom,
times the mass of the other,

00:46:31.552 --> 00:46:36.000
divided by the sum of the two
masses.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.326
And sometimes a useful
approximation is when one of the

00:46:42.326 --> 00:46:49.238
masses is much lower than the
other mass, so when m1 here is

00:46:49.238 --> 00:46:54.744
smaller than m2.
Well, you can see in that case,

00:46:54.744 --> 00:47:01.656
if m1 is very small compared to
m2, we are going to treat it

00:47:01.656 --> 00:47:06.203
like a zero.
And then these two m's are

00:47:06.203 --> 00:47:10.186
going to cancel.
You can see the reduced mass is

00:47:10.186 --> 00:47:14.423
roughly equivalent to the mass
of the smaller body.

00:47:14.423 --> 00:47:18.661
Sometimes I will ask you to use
that approximation.

00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:22.305
Other times,
I will ask you to calculate the

00:47:22.305 --> 00:47:25.949
reduced mass.
Let's look at some frequencies

00:47:25.949 --> 00:47:29.000
for some molecules,
here.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.982
I have an array of molecules.
All of them roughly have the

00:47:33.982 --> 00:47:38.352
same force constant.
I am going to look at the mass

00:47:38.352 --> 00:47:41.760
dependence on the fundamental
frequency.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:46.568
I have got the frequencies
written both in terms of wave

00:47:46.568 --> 00:47:50.676
numbers and Hertz.
The first thing I want you to

00:47:50.676 --> 00:47:54.871
notice is the fundamental
frequency for hydrogen,

00:47:54.871 --> 00:47:59.241
4,159 wave numbers.
That is the highest vibrational

00:47:59.241 --> 00:48:04.621
frequency that we know about.
Why is it so high?

00:48:04.621 --> 00:48:08.765
Well, because those two
hydrogens are so light,

00:48:08.765 --> 00:48:13.540
and the mass is in the
denominator of that fundamental

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:17.234
frequency.
So if it is in the denominator,

00:48:17.234 --> 00:48:20.927
it is small,
and the fundamental frequency

00:48:20.927 --> 00:48:25.342
is going to be high.
Then look at these molecules,

00:48:25.342 --> 00:48:28.135
HCl, HBr, HI.
In this case here,

00:48:28.135 --> 00:48:33.000
it is all a hydrogen bonded to
a halogen.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.173
For the most part,
the reduced mass of these three

00:48:37.173 --> 00:48:41.687
molecules is that of hydrogen.
If that is of hydrogen,

00:48:41.687 --> 00:48:45.946
since that is in the
denominator for the expression

00:48:45.946 --> 00:48:50.119
for the frequency,
well, the frequencies are going

00:48:50.119 --> 00:48:53.100
to be high in general.
And they are,

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:56.252
2,886, 2,559.
Not as high as molecular

00:48:56.252 --> 00:49:03.179
hydrogen, but still pretty high.
And then we look at these three

00:49:03.179 --> 00:49:06.871
molecules, chlorine,
bromine, iodine.

00:49:06.871 --> 00:49:12.205
Both particles very heavy.
The reduced mass is large.

00:49:12.205 --> 00:49:16.615
Look at what happened to the
frequency here.

00:49:16.615 --> 00:49:22.769
The frequency really has gone
down much lower than it was for

00:49:22.769 --> 00:49:28.000
HCl, HBr or HI.
So, that is one parameter.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.132
The other parameter,
of course, is the force

00:49:32.132 --> 00:49:35.591
constant.
Here are a set of molecules

00:49:35.591 --> 00:49:39.723
that have all roughly the same
reduced mass,

00:49:39.723 --> 00:49:41.645
fluorine, oxygen,
NO.

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:46.834
And I have written down their
frequencies, both in wave

00:49:46.834 --> 00:49:51.447
numbers and Hertz.
For molecular fluorine,

00:49:51.447 --> 00:49:56.540
which has a single bond,
that frequency here is pretty

00:49:56.540 --> 00:50:01.656
low, 892 wave numbers.
It is pretty low.

00:50:01.656 --> 00:50:06.234
This is a single bond,
which is easy to stretch.

00:50:06.234 --> 00:50:10.131
It is not very stiff.
It is a loose bond,

00:50:10.131 --> 00:50:14.320
so to speak.
But now, look at oxygen and NO.

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:18.315
They have double bonds,
which are stiffer.

00:50:18.315 --> 00:50:21.432
If they are stiffer,
k is larger,

00:50:21.432 --> 00:50:24.842
the fundamental frequency is
higher.

00:50:24.842 --> 00:50:27.959
Then, we look at CO and
nitrogen.

00:50:27.959 --> 00:50:34.000
They have triple bonds,
which are even stiffer.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.057
Stiffer bonds,
larger k, higher fundamental

00:50:38.057 --> 00:50:43.468
frequency, that are those two
parameters that dictate the

00:50:43.468 --> 00:50:47.816
frequency of vibration.
We will do rotation on

00:50:47.816 --> 00:50:49.349
Wednesday.
See you then.
