00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.573
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.883
&gt;&gt; If Jerry Pinkney
hasn't illustrated it,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.800
it probably isn't worth
illustrating.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.510
[ Applause ]

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.403
Among his more than 100
books, there are such classics

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.083
as "The Little Match Girl," "The
Ugly Duckling," "Uncle Remus,"

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.810
"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi," "Tales from
Africa," "Myths from Greece,"

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.710
"Little Red Riding
Hood," "Aesop's Fables."

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.083
So sumptious are Jerry's
illustrations, so perfectly in tune

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.593
with the subject matter,
that it sometimes seems

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.193
as if the source material
was written only

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.896
to be illustrated by him.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.650
You haven't read "Aesop's Fables"

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.570
until you've seen Jerry's
interpretation of them.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.530
In fact, just the other day --

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.196
I don't know if you heard

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.596
about these tigers being
discovered really high

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.883
up in the Himalaya 9,000,
13,000 feet up or something.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.643
When I heard that story,
I thought to myslef,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.643
"That would make a great
Jerry Pinkney book."

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.850
He's a native of Philadelphia.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.183
He took an interest in
drawing at a very early age.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.050
All right, Philly.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.706
He has illustrated, as I said, more
than 100 books, started in 1964,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.330
and along the way, he's been
honored multiple times of Caldecott

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.456
and Coretta Scott King
awards and honors.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.970
He's taught illustration,
conducted workshops at universities

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.276
across the country, created art

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.436
for the US Postal Service's
Black Heritage stamps,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.483
and had more than 20
one-man retrospective shows

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.736
at major US venues.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.090
He also created the art work for
the 2005 National Festival poster.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.316
So please give a warm welcome
to the incredible Jerry Pinkney.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.510
[ Applause ]

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.440
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.506
I was here last year, remember?

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.173
It was raining like crazy?

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.656
Yeah. So I asked the person upstairs
to -- but he went overboard.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.490
Little too hot.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.420
Little too hot, but thank
you, guys, for staying.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.426
My new book is "The Three
Little Kittens," which is out,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.200
and you guys can get
a chance, actually,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.733
the opportunity to get it today.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.600
But this comes out next month.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.280
And it's always interesting
for me because I've done

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.786
so many books, to talk
about the book.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.023
I will do that, but I think
there are other, probably,

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.690
stories that are connected to what
and how and the choice of a book

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.433
that I want to share
with you this afternoon.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.553
So I want to talk about two
stories, and then I want to talk

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.863
about the inspiriation for
this book, but before I get

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.870
to that point, you're
going to have to help me

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.600
because there's some point
I'm going to ask you to sing

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.100
"The Three Little Kittens," okay?

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.816
So you don't have to -- I
want you to think about it.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.203
now, I would join you, but
I have a terrible voice,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.826
so I'm going to lean on you.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.240
Okay. But the first story really has
a lot to do with how did I happen

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.146
to get to this point where
there's 100 books under my belt,

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.803
and where did that come from?

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.003
And I know there's a lot of kids
and children in this audience,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.346
and also parents that might be
interested in it because I grew

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.693
up in a family that --
there were no artists.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.716
There were no artists in the
family or in the neighborhood.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.570
I grew in the Germantown
section of Philadelphia,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.433
and I loved to draw as a kid.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.833
I drew all the time.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.233
And my parents were great.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.813
They always supplied me even
with the simplest of materials.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.253
My father -- my father
was a jack of all trades,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.556
and he did wallpaper
hanging, and he did painting.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.190
He would bring home
scraps of wallpaper.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.933
And I would turn the pattern of the
wallpaper, you know, against a floor

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.280
or a desk, and I would
draw on the other side.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.400
So I was constantly drawing and
always had a sketchbook with me.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.706
So at the age of 12,
I took my first job.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.680
And I was selling newspapers at a
very busy intersection on the corner

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.220
of Germantown and Shelton Avenue.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.173
And I would take a
drawing pad with me,

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.860
and inbetween selling newspapers,
I would draw people waiting

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.320
for the bus or the trolley.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.986
There was a department
store, Raoul's,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.700
when they would change
the window displays,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.406
I would treat the changing window
displays like changing still life.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.863
And so I had this sketchbook, and
you know, I'm not sure what kind

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.756
of job I did with selling
newspapers, but my boss was okay.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.190
Matt was great.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.190
So one day, one of my
customers is John Liney.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.376
He's a professional artist
of a strip called "Henry."

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.883
And he invites me up to his studio.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.110
He sees me.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.183
He takes note, and he asked
if I would share my sketches.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.936
I do. He looked through
my sketchbook,

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.153
and he invited me up to his studio.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.080
Now, remember I said no
artists in the family.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.160
It's my first introduction
to an artist.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.796
I go to visit John, beautiful day,
third floor, big space, sketches,

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.370
projects on the walls, in the center
of that space, a drawing table

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.126
with a taberet with a whole array
of brushes and pencils and inks

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.466
and watercolors and all kinds of
size pads, which you can imagine

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.533
for a young boy, 12,
experiences this wonderous space,

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.003
this magical space, but
really, what impressed me most

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.693
and what struck me most
about that day was here,

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.943
here was a grown man doing the
very same thing that I loved doing.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.030
What was that?

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.430
What do I love doing?

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.296
What did I tell you I loved doing.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.163
Drawing. And this is the
way he made his living.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.030
This is the way he
[inaudible] for his family.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.896
Now, did I know that,
when leaving that day,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.400
that some day that Jerry Pinkney
would grow up and be an artist?

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.526
I'm not sure about that, but I know
tha the possiblity, the possibilty,

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.180
the seed was planted that day.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.446
And that was a pretty special day,

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.443
and we remained friends
for many, many years.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:23.050
The other story, which also
deals with Germantown section,

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.716
was I grew up in this sort of
small, deadend street of rowhouses,

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.113
and there was six of us
kids and mom and dad.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.416
It was a five-room house with
a bathroom without a sink.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.890
So -- and we didn't have pets.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.156
There were no pets.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.023
A few of our neighbors had pets,

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.340
and I always wondered
why we didn't have pets.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:54.740
Now I know.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.006
There was no space.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.866
We couldn't cram anything
else that was living in there.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.946
So I didn't really
understand about pets,

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.896
I sort of shied away from animals.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.806
We went to the zoo and that kind
of thing, but -- until an adult.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.140
And as an adult, your
kids what pets.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.166
And I think we still kept it
at bay until we had a neighbor

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.280
who had a litter of kittens,
and we went over to see them.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.946
And it was in a cardboard
box, and they were all inside.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.876
And there was one striking kitten,
and it looked as if someone took,

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.193
like, bleach or something.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:40.993
It was spotted in an interesting
way of browns and blacks

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.526
and light grays and whatnot.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.700
And we called her "Clorox."

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.366
So Clorox -- and Clorox was a great
cat to start with because she --

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.330
well, she just didn't want to
be bothered, I mean, at all.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.793
So I mean, you could sneak
in a pet here and there,

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.946
but -- so she was very easy.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.476
And then we got hooked,
and we found Brillo.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:16.390
Brillo we found he, for some reason,
found him outside of our home.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.966
We were in Boston at the time,
and we started, you know,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.020
we started giving him
little bowls of milk,

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.206
and finally he didn't go
away, and we took Brillo in.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.830
Brillo was the opposite.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.963
I don't think he was the
brightest cat, but he was funny,

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.773
and he was always in trouble.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.616
And he always made
me feel like a hero

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:41.156
because I was always
saving him from something.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:43.816
He could climb a tree;
he couldn't get down.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.673
He'd chase the birds, and
the birds would beat him up.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.180
It was constant, and we felt so
badly, but it was really wonderful.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.633
And then there was Shadow.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.146
Shadow was over an
overhang when we moved

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.620
into Croton, and he
only had one eye.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:01.893
We got him down, patched him
up, and we had several cats.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.860
And the last one, the last
cat's name was "Pumpkin,"

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.783
and it was our granddaughter's cat.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.150
And she moved into an apartment
that didn't allow pets.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.816
So we took in Pumpkin.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.053
Now, I have to ask
you guys a question.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.550
What color do you think pumpkin was?

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.150
&gt;&gt; Orange.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.150
&gt;&gt; Yes. Orange.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.150
Any other?

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.216
Yes? What color?

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.150
&gt;&gt; Black.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.483
&gt;&gt; How did you know?

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.150
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.616
&gt;&gt; His name was Black.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.150
She wasn't planted in
the audience by the way.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.083
Pumpkin was black for
some reason or another.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.683
So there's always been this
wonderful history of cats.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:50.353
And we don't have a cat
now because I travel a lot,

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.426
and we lost the last one, but
just in this whole experience

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:02.190
of "The Three Little Kittens," you
get a sense that when my life calms

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:03.980
down a bit, I'm going to be
on the search for a kitten.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.566
I mean, there fabulous animals,

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.680
and I think was always this
attachment to finding a stray.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:13.880
That was something
very important there.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.413
Now, inspiration for the
"Three Little Kittens."

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.300
Well, my wife, Gloria Jean, who's an
author, oftentimes suggests projects

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.076
for me, and she suggested
"The Three Little Kittens."

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:35.443
Now, I had trouble with the three
little kittens eating the pie

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.683
with the mittens, okay?

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:41.933
I struggled with that piece
a little bit, and then I knew

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:44.646
that it was a nonsense rhyme, so
things didn't really always have

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:48.263
to add up, but I was still
trying to make sense of it.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.830
Now, I have a great
granddaugher, Zion, and Zion,

00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:00.550
I've been observing her for
awhile now, and she's my teacher.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.360
And why and how things
don't always have

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.283
to match up to have a good time.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.963
And she has this wonderful
imagination,

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.356
and I also love the idea, the
way she plays with things.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:18.396
I remember once, we were going out
for a walk, and it was kind of brisk

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.326
that day, and she's
pushing her stroller,

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:22.023
and you could tell
her hands were cold.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.373
So I thought there were
gloves in her pocket.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.540
It turns out there's only one.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:28.153
So she puts the one
on, and she's warm.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.760
And the other -- it's like the
other hand is covered as well.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.400
so there's always this kind
of wonderful kind of energy

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.503
and excitement about
things just being.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.226
She loves two different shoes,
you know, go on the right foot,

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:47.890
but a different shoe,
one right and a left.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:50.933
And you could see her
playing with things.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.206
And so you see that in
"The Three Little Kittens."

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.453
You see a kind of exploring and
trying to engage and connect

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.466
with the same kind of
imaginations that kids have.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.286
How do you teach kids?

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.753
You feed them where they are.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.173
And so I've tried to do that.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.040
Now, okay, all right, okay.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.373
You've thought about "The
Three Little Kittens."

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.040
Well, here's what happened.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:19.506
Now, we're going to sing it first.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:21.573

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.906

their mittens and then began to cry,

"Oh mother dear, oh mother
dear, see here, see here,

Okay, all right, you
guys aren't doing great.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.596
I'm -- now I changed -- I
changed it a little bit.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:20.866
That's why I'm kind of struggling.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:22.953
Also, I didn't want to do what
I just did and embarrass myself.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.513
But it's over now, and I'm fine.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.643
I'm fine. So anyway,
here's what I did.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.666
So it's a sparse little
text, right, in this book.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.316
And I'm always sorry for you guys
all the way over the end there.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.196
Hi. We begin to understand
a little bit more

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.190
about the kittens and
their families.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.096
We know that they would
like to go out to play.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.623
And I love -- oh, gosh, you
guys did you buy these copies

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.316
because you can share them
with -- well, that's okay.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:00.993
anyway, these kittens are
really curious about the world,

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.106
and you know cats are, okay?

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.566
So they're curious, and
we actually see the mother

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.346
in the process knitting,
so we know where --

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.700
now we know where the
mittens came from.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.253
The mother knits.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.253
None of cats did.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:25.913
So they want to go out and play.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:28.933
And there you see, I'm setting
you up to the fact that going

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.100
out to play, they're
going to need mittens.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:33.820
All right?

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:39.286
So here's where I try to take these
classic folktales, in this case,

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:45.076
a nonsense rhyme, and expand
on it because what I do is,

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.560
when the kittens lose their
mittens, it's three spreads

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.363
where the kittens are
out in nature, playing,

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.013
and you actually see
them lose their mittens.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.020


00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.376
And again, it's -- I watched --

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.243
if my great granddaughter
is doing something,

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.186
and something distracts
here, whatever she was doing,

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.560
that's gone, and she moves on.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.713
so the kittens actually --

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:16.706
and so the children can actually
follow the kittens while they --

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.453
when they lose their mittens.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.526
So it's a number of spreads,
and they return home,

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.336
of course, without the mittens.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:29.890
Now, here's the other part
that I hope to engage you with,

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:37.576
and that is that the kittens now
return to find their mittens.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.706
So this is the circle.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.773
And so they return to the
same place where, of course,

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.310
they've lost their mittens.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.976
And so now the children can
now follow in the process

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.523
of finding the mittens, okay.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.670
All right?

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.443
And they all find them.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.576
So someone suggests
it's a counting book,

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.700
but my granddaughter was counting
past three a long time ago,

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.206
so I'm not sure.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:17.230
But it is this process of discovery.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.316
Okay, they find the mittens.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.683
They return, and of course,
they -- how's the sound on this?

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.760
Okay? And they begin to eat the pie.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:34.843
And it goes through a lot
of differernt spreads,

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:41.063
and it finally -- oh, of
course, they wash their mittens.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.503
Now, you can't see this,
but I have to tell you,

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.960
these kittens aren't just
voluntarily doing that chore.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:51.150
One is playing, the --
you know how kids --

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:53.456
you ever ask kids to do something?

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:59.390
And they -- well, this is the --
my son, Brian, the illustrator,

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.890
says that these kittens
are stand-ins

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.290
for my great granddaughter.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:08.290
And we see them hang
the mittens up to dry,

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.113
and mother is walking home
with a basket of apples.

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.530
Now, the first pie was blueberry,

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.336
and this spread, which
I expand on again.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.760


00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.836
The kittens say, "Can we
go out to play again?"

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:32.940
All right?

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.073
And the endpapers, they do with
now not only mittens, but caps.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.146
And we find -- though
it's hard to see --

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.596
one of the kittens
has lost their cap.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.130
So we go full circle.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.200
So here's the other thing
about the singing part.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.643
I -- by the way, you guys were
pretty good, and especially you.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.010
You were really into it.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.410
anyway, so when I would talk to
people about the why of doing

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:11.843
"The Three Little Kittens,"
they would always --

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.056
adults would always sing it.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.273
So I said, "Oh, that's interesting.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:19.300
In order to bring it back to
mind, they would sing it."

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:26.846
so I went to my editor, Lori Hornick
[assumed spelling] and we rewrote,

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.610
adapted some of the text, so I
said, "Why don't we make it singable

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.363
so that you could sing it like
you could sing the rhyme?"

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:35.096
So we came to that point,
and I said, "Okay, then,

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:38.393
wouldn't it be great if
people knew about it.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.133
So here's the bonus.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.253
Here's the bonus.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.206

jacket, we had music scored

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.426

And there's really, really
terrific, wonderful story.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:11.330
I was signing, and of course,
you don't come upon this.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.196
there's a little note
on the copywrite page,

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.976
but most people go
past the copywrite.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.513
So I mentioned to a woman.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:23.586
She was excited about buying
it and whatnot, and I said,

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:25.660
"I want to just show you something."

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.220
And I took of this -- the
cover, and I showed it.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.266
And she said, "Oh,
and I play the piano."

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.280
And she got so excited
about this whole thing.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.503
And it's kind of, in a way, it's --

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.466
for me, I think the physical book
is really incredibly important.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.173
so it's a way of building
in to the physical,

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.423
traditional book something else.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:53.686
Something that the child can
experience or you can experience.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.580
It's not interactive because it
takes effort in a different kind

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:06.290
of way, but it's still engaging a
child, especially the children today

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.960

and whistles around them.

to sort of do that.

certain amount of time left.

and write the things that you know,

put something down on paper

at it and then know how

it's in the act of doing.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:03.730
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.196
&gt;&gt; Yes, good question.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.730
Who's next?

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:09.730
We got to go left from
right -- right to left.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:12.196
&gt;&gt; Um, what's your favorite
book that you've written?

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:13.730
&gt;&gt; Pardon me?

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:15.930
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
book that you've written?

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.263
&gt;&gt; Would I read a book?

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.263
&gt;&gt; That you've written?

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.596
&gt;&gt; Oh, that've I've written?

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:23.730
A famous one?

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:25.730
&gt;&gt; Favorite.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:27.130
&gt;&gt; A favorite one that I've written.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:29.923
I -- you know, I think -- you
know, what's really special

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.603
about having a new book
published is the excitement

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:37.816
that surrounds that book.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:38.473
So the question, I'm going
to answer that today,

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:41.553
it really is "The Three
Little Kittens"

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:43.626
because that's the
one that's really most

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.586
on my mind and my heart right now.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.083
Okay. I feel like this
thing is a tail.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:59.556
&gt;&gt; When I was four, I had a little
movie that's called "Repunzel"

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.850
and it's a Barbie movie,
and it's about a girl

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.926
who escapes her evil stepmother --

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.520
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.653
&gt;&gt; -- By drawing.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.520
&gt;&gt; Um-hum.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.653
And the question?

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.186
&gt;&gt; Can you give me
advice to be a drawer?

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.713
&gt;&gt; Can I do what?

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.180
Help me out [inaudible].

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.180
&gt;&gt; Give me advice -- give me
the advice to be a drawer.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.646
&gt;&gt; Oh, can I give you
advice to being a drawer.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.180
I think that microphone
is feeding back.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:40.900
I -- you know, I mentioned
that I had carried a sketchbook

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:44.333
when I was your age, and I think,
still, that's the best way to do it

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.430
because if you carry a little
sketch book around with you,

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.943
you can jot down ideas
when they come to you.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.330
Or if you see something you want
to kind of record, it'll help you,

00:23:58.690 --> 00:23:58.870
but if you don't have
the tools around you,

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.176
you're never going to do it.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.843
so make sure you have
the tools around.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.366
Make sure mom and dad
gets you a sketchbook.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.320
&gt;&gt; What inspired you to
write "The Talking Egss?"

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:12.993
&gt;&gt; Actually I illustrated
"The Talking Eggs."

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.793
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.260
&gt;&gt; I collaborated with
the author, Bob San Souci.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.993
Now, and there's something
special about "The Talking Eggs."

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.526
Does it kind of parallel
"Cinderella?"

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:24.763
Yeah, it's sort of a take
off from "Cinderella."

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:29.856
By the way, I love
"The Talking Eggs."

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:31.583
It's a special book.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:32.316
You know the pony in that book?

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:35.250
&gt;&gt; Um-hum.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.250
&gt;&gt; My Uncle Osby [assumed
spelling] had a pony

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:38.583
with a cart, and I used to ride it.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:41.250
Yes?

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:42.710
&gt;&gt; How much drawing do
you practice every day?

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:48.390
&gt;&gt; I draw as much as I can
because I have the projects.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:52.150
But it's how much time do I
take in practicing drawing.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.786
This is a very good question because
most often, if I'm not travelling,

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.520
I still go to a drawing
workshop on Monday evenings.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.856
Why? Because I can still
improve my drawing,

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.710
so I draw as much as possible.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:11.230
Yes?

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:13.946
&gt;&gt; Were you ever teased as a child
because you were into drawing,

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:15.800
and what would you say to
children who are into maybe writing

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.296
or drawing or acting or singing,
who aren't necessarily into sports,

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:22.063
who get teased as little
kids for that?

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:27.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that you have
to kind of combat that with

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:31.843
as much exposure as you can
to people with like minds.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:33.370
You take them to the theater or
to the museum so that they build

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:41.590
up a sort of protection from the
fact that what they want to do,

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.600
that is important to them, may
not be important to others.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.120
And that's always going to be there.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:48.963
If you're true to your
goal, and it's different,

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.610
that's going to be part of it.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:54.306
So find yourself surrounded by
the things that support you.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.780
Yes?

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:03.313
&gt;&gt; Do you have a special and unique
way to personalize your drawings?

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:05.443
&gt;&gt; Do I have special --

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:09.043
&gt;&gt; And unique ways to
personalize your drawings?

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:10.530


00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:14.270
&gt;&gt; Oh, special ways to
personalize my drawing.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.586
There is a way of describing
it and saying its style.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:22.870
There's a style that
you find with the I --

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:29.056
more important than the way I draw
things, but the way I see things.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.646
That determines what I draw.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:36.750
It's a kind of finding a
unique way of seeing something

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.123
and then finding these
skills to record that.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:41.753
So now, I do things in my work
that are, I think, unique.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.086
I tend to hide things in it.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.753
But basically, it's about
learning to see differently.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.080
Yes?

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.480
&gt;&gt; When you draw -- when
you were a drawer as a kid,

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.496
did you teach yourself
how to get better at it,

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.700
or did you just draw a lot?

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.700
&gt;&gt; I did, and I think a lot
had to do with really wanting,

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.540
an overwhelming sense that
this was important to me,

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.390
and I don't remember that
there was effort involved.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.060
I -- because I loved
every minute of it.

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.423
And I was fortunate enough,
also, to be encouraged,

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.256
but I loved every minute of it.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:29.856
And I didn't have any
great expectations.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:30.940
I didn't know I was going
to become an artist.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:32.096
It was something that
made me feel better

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:36.650
about myself, and it centered me.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.760
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.760
&gt;&gt; Hi there.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.760
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:42.960
&gt;&gt; I wanted to ask, who were some

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.293
of your favorite illustrators
growing up, or even now?

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:46.893
&gt;&gt; Oh, I came from Pennsylvania.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:52.626
N.C. Wyeth and Howard Pyle,
that whole school of recording.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:56.010
My work isn't necessarily
representational,

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:58.656
but it had that feel
and that quality.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.053
So you can imagine, you
know, what N.C. Wyeth --

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.680
and as a kid, every kid
wants something bigger

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.613
than life, and he painted that way.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.813
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'd like to know as a
children's book illustrator,

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.556
how long does it take you to
actually do a book, I mean,

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:15.943
with sketchs, and you know,
corrections, and painting.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:19.516
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I -- how long does
it take me to finish a book?

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.436
I ask for, like, six months.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:29.890
Some books will strecth into nine,
very few that I come in on time,

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:34.630
but -- and there are some where I
let it grow on me to the point where

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:38.890
"The Old African" took me two years.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:42.676
I was very fortunate to have
a publisher who understood.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.380
So that's what you want.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:45.783
You want to invest in
something that you love so much,

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.976
it doesn't matter how
much time it takes,

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:50.723
and that's where you want to be.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.656
And I'm blessed.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:55.923
I'm in that place now,
which publishers understand.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:57.590
Yeah.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.590
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:01.590
&gt;&gt; Over time.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.123
I know what that means.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.190
Couldn't be a zero with a
minus or something like that?

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.990
I want to say one thing to you guys.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:09.056
thank you for hanging
around for this.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.990
this is an amazing,
amazing festival.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.796
It's the 10th anniversary, so
let's all say happy anniversary.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:16.896
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:21.203
