manage configuration called login hint

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480
manage configuration called login hint
 

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.060
manage configuration called login hint
which your app can send to its SAS

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:16.070
which your app can send to its SAS
 

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.100
which your app can send to its SAS
back-end which will help it resolve the

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:18.110
back-end which will help it resolve the
 

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:20.980

familiar let's see how this login hint

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240
familiar let's see how this login hint
 

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.170
familiar let's see how this login hint
field should be used so the

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:29.180
field should be used so the
 

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.940

android app will send the login hint in

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:36.350
android app will send the login hint in
 

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:38.950
android app will send the login hint in
the configuration bundle down when your

request to your SAS back-end it contains

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:44.300
request to your SAS back-end it contains
 

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.510
request to your SAS back-end it contains
also sends down that login hint

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:46.520
also sends down that login hint
 

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.630
also sends down that login hint
so the SAS back-end can then resolve the

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.640
so the SAS back-end can then resolve the
 

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.880
so the SAS back-end can then resolve the

Chrome browser itself this is what's
 

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:38.920
Chrome browser itself this is what's
going to give you that persistent login

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:38.930
going to give you that persistent login
 

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:42.280
going to give you that persistent login

you've got three main points first of

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:02.840
you've got three main points first of
 

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.570
you've got three main points first of
all you've got the device owner the

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:04.580
all you've got the device owner the
 

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:05.800
all you've got the device owner the
device owner is going to go on the

own that device that's really important

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:10.460
own that device that's really important
 

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:11.890
own that device that's really important
because you don't want the user of the

because you don't want the user of the
 

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.180
because you don't want the user of the
device to have to configure it at all

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:13.190

then you're gonna have an NFC

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:15.050
then you're gonna have an NFC
 

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:17.170
then you're gonna have an NFC
provisioning app the NFC provisioning

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:17.180

in its setup wizard and it transfers the
 

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:23.200
in its setup wizard and it transfers the
data for that device owner to be

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:23.210
data for that device owner to be
 

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:24.730
data for that device owner to be
installed and then you've got your

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:24.740
installed and then you've got your
 

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.470

guppy delivery drivers application so
here I'll show you how to get the NFC

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:31.160
here I'll show you how to get the NFC
 

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.660
here I'll show you how to get the NFC

app and the device owner app in a minute
 

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:36.160
app and the device owner app in a minute
but once you've got the NFC app you give

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:36.170
but once you've got the NFC app you give
 

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:37.360
but once you've got the NFC app you give
it some configurations and these

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:37.370
it some configurations and these

so as a developer there's a couple of
things to consider first single-use

00:38:56.349 --> 00:38:56.359
things to consider first single-use
 

00:38:56.359 --> 00:38:58.750
things to consider first single-use
devices first of all you're gonna want

00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:58.760
devices first of all you're gonna want
 

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.490
devices first of all you're gonna want
sorry single-use applications you're

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:00.500
sorry single-use applications you're
 

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.349
sorry single-use applications you're
gonna want your application to be

00:39:02.349 --> 00:39:02.359
gonna want your application to be
 

00:39:02.359 --> 00:39:04.359
gonna want your application to be
entirely self-contained you know what I

00:39:04.359 --> 00:39:04.369
entirely self-contained you know what I
 

00:39:04.369 --> 00:39:06.490
entirely self-contained you know what I
owned that user journey if you're a

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:06.500
owned that user journey if you're a
 

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.320

hotel kiosk app you're going to not want

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:08.330
hotel kiosk app you're going to not want
 

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:10.900
hotel kiosk app you're going to not want
to let the user somehow click a link and

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:10.910
to let the user somehow click a link and
 

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:12.220
to let the user somehow click a link and
get into a web browser and then just

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:12.230
get into a web browser and then just
 

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.540
get into a web browser and then just
start browsing the web on your hotel

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:13.550
start browsing the web on your hotel
 

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.160
start browsing the web on your hotel
kiosk you're going to want to keep them

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:15.170
kiosk you're going to want to keep them
 

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:18.760
kiosk you're going to want to keep them
in the room booking system so so you

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:18.770
in the room booking system so so you
 

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:21.130
in the room booking system so so you
have a web view like a web site you want

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:21.140
have a web view like a web site you want
 

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.540
have a web view like a web site you want
to link to put it in a web view or a

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:22.550
to link to put it in a web view or a
 

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:24.220
to link to put it in a web view or a
chrome custom tab and own the entire

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:24.230
chrome custom tab and own the entire
 

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:26.920

experience if you do need to link out to

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:26.930
experience if you do need to link out to
 

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:28.570
experience if you do need to link out to
other apps you're defining kind of a

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:28.580
other apps you're defining kind of a
 

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.210
other apps you're defining kind of a
multi app kosu system and you'll have to

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:31.220
multi app kosu system and you'll have to
 

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.500
multi app kosu system and you'll have to
figure out the entry points and exit

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:32.510
figure out the entry points and exit
 

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:33.820
figure out the entry points and exit
points or maybe just decide that you're

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:33.830
points or maybe just decide that you're
 

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:35.050
points or maybe just decide that you're
going to want to have a launcher and

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:35.060
going to want to have a launcher and
 

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.030
going to want to have a launcher and
have a slightly more complex system you

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040
have a slightly more complex system you
 

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.260
have a slightly more complex system you
can still have launches on single-use

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:38.270
can still have launches on single-use
 

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:41.230
can still have launches on single-use
devices if you want to so we have that

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.240
devices if you want to so we have that
 

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.240
