00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.980
By God, we've had so many Disney sequels they can't even give them full numbers anymore.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.500
This is "Lion King 1½".

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.940
Well, how does that work?

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.180
It's because this film is a prequel. Eh, kind of.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.420
It's focusing more on Timon and Pumbaa and where they came from,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.280
and all the funny ways they were interacting through the Lion King film without us even noticing it.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.560
A cute concept, if you like Timon and Pumbaa, which...

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.580
...ehhh, I don't hate 'em, but I don't know if I want to watch a movie with these guys.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.680
The story is, not surprisingly, about as generic as it gets.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.960
Timon is an outsider among his group and one day he's put in charge to make sure the hyenas don't attack.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.100
Of course, he gets distracted, the hyenas attack,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.920
He feels awful, and he has to go find his own way.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.160
He ends up leaving, coming across a companion named Pumbaa,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.620
They form a bond with both of them being outsiders,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.040
And, yeah you just sort of see them insert themselves in random clips.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.460
Some are funny, like when you see what actually ended the "Can't Wait to be King" song.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.940
But a lot of them just kind of seem pointless,

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.220
You just kind of point and go: "Tee hee, oh, that's what was going on, ha-ha"

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.340
And half the time there's really no connecting story to it.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.440
When the story does come back, it's...okay.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.120
I mean, there's sort of a nice connection with Timon and his mother.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.040
Once in a while there's an okay laugh.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.640
But it's so strange seeing such good animation put to something that's clearly just an in-between prequel.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.260
Like I said, they call it "1 ½."

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.700
How is a movie called "1 ½" given this good animation?

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.460
The only thing I can figure is because, it is Lion King, and that's one of their biggest properties.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.240
It kind of figured to give them the really nice animation,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.560
especially when it's supposed to connect back to the original film.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.980
But, *sigh* it's Timon and Pumbaa.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.180
Why are these great backgrounds being used for Timon and Pumbaa?

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.700
That is to say, if there was a good story that went with it, like a really great story that surprised you,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.380
like Kung Fu Panda, or the Lego Movie, something that you didn't think was going to be phenomenal but was,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.140
THEN I would understand it.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.240
But it's just kind of them inserting themselves into certain parts, and not really flowing at all.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.860
And I don't know, it just kind of seemed like a mess.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.280
But, not a god-awful mess, it still looked nice in parts.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.640
The only thing I can really say about it is, if you like Timon and Pumbaa, you'll like this fine.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.760
It's basically the Timon and Pumbaa movie.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.840
I don't hate Timon and Pumbaa, I just don't feel like watching an entire film dedicated to them.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.000
But if you do, maybe you'll like it fine.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.540
One or two of the songs are surprisingly kinda catchy,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.240
I swear that digging melody is going to be in my head forever.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.140
And...that's about it.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.820
Again, I think that's all it was supposed to be,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.340
I don't know if it was supposed to be like this grand film or this grand comedy,

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.560
It's just supposed to be Timon and Pumbaa being Timon and Pumbaa.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.760
And if you like that, you'll like this fine.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.320
Me? I think the cartoon show was a little funnier,

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.240
but I guess if you're looking for better animation, this is the one to check out.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.060
Give it a watch, and see if it's slimy, but satisfying, enough.
