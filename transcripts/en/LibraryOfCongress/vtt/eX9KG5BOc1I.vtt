00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.520
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: Good
evening everybody,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.710
thanks so much for
being here tonight.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.080
I'm very excited about
tonight's concert.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.730
I've been listening to the
rehearsals and everything.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.460
It's sounding really great,
so you're in for a real treat.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.930
But I'm also very grateful
and excited to be joined

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.600
by composer Brian Ferneyhough,
who is here and is the recipient

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.800
of the commission work that will
receive it's world premier tonight.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.960
And also the conductor
of Talea, James Baker.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.520
And so we're just going to have
a conversation about the piece

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.070
and about some other things
and see where that goes,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.920
but there will also be some
time at the end for you

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.150
to ask any questions
that you might have.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.450
So please bear those in mind.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:17.400 position:56%
So maybe just a starting point, what
can you tell us about the piece?

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.700
[laughter]

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.060
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: You want
me to give it away in advance?

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.580 position:56%
[laughter] Well, first of all,
thank you, David, for the commission

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.120
for the Library of Congress.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.420
It's a great [inaudible].

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.800
I've never been here
in Washington before,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.770
and so it was very interesting
to walk around a little bit today

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.640
and get some feel for the
atmosphere of the building,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.960
which is quite extraordinary
of course.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.420 position:56%
Let me start answering this
question by citing another composer,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.300
Arnold Schoenberg, who has
many works I think lodged here

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.840
and was commissioned also by the
Library of Congress in his time.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.680
He wrote a book called Style and
Idea, and style is fairly clear.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.040
You can statistically
ascertain, for instance,

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.900
if a play was by Shakespeare
or perhaps by somebody else

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.760
and then put under his name because
there are stylist discrepancies.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.980
So style is fine, but idea
is a very strange word

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.200
when you apply it to the arts.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.700
We don't know in fact,
although books have been written

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.010
on the topic, whether he was
talking about a musical motif,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.730
about a way of treating
musical motifs.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.240
We don't know if it was
concrete musical material at all.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.030
Some of his pieces clearly weren't.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.940 position:56%
I mean, things like Erwartung or Die
gluckliche Hand, the operatic works,

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.490
clearly had a fundamental idea
which by and large I suppose came

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.000
from a mixture of expressionism
and Freudian psychology.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.920
But for a composer today,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.460
it's an issue which is
fraught with problems.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.720
The idea of a piece of music
expressing, incorporating,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.550
articulating an idea or a set
of ideas is problematic simply

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.520
because music, although we
can treat it like a language,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.090
probably is not a language.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.070 position:56%
It doesn't have the semantic context
that an everyday language has.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.510
We can't point to things
in music by and large,

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.220
which relate to something
outside music,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.940
which can be related back
to the inside of music.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.850
So one of the things
that's concerned me

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.870
over the years has
been the idea indeed

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:47.470 position:56%
of how much one may derive the
nature of a piece of music from sort

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.930
of act of prior conceptualization,
yes?

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.130
And over the years, I've done this.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.540
I started composing some from
the late '50's and by the time

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.890
of the mid '60's, early
'70's, I was writing works

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.300
which in some way tried to reflect
bodies of ideas, if you like,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.620
intellectual or [inaudible]
disciplines.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.770
They could be historic.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.400
They could be philosophical.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.420
They could be something else
indeed, poetry or what have you,

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.550
but I've always felt that
contemporary music suffers

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.240
in many respects by being the
art which does not relate easily

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.120
to the everyday sensations,
which we are a party to.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.360
And so we find contemporary
music more difficult to enter

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.820
into precisely because we have
to make certain presuppositions,

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.880
which A, we are not on the
whole used to doing, and B,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.970
without knowing if
those presuppositions

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.380
that one's making have anything
to do with that piece, in reality.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.990
So, I've always looked to see if I
can find something in other areas,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:17.330
which one can, one can focus
on, one can sit on or stand on,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.620
one can circle around it, rather
like an artificial flat earth,

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.560
which is sitting on
top of a tortoise,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.690
which is sitting on
top of an elephant.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.180
[laughter] Of course these
things are always not [inaudible]

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.310
arbitrary, but these things are
a reflection of one's own unease

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.490
about the means with
which one works.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.590
And part of the drama of
contemporary music in my view

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.190
at least since the '70's perhaps
has been understanding how much the

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.170
sociology of musical
creation is involved

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.990
in the actual creation
of musical works.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:10.730
Many works have for instance some
sort of improvisatory aspects

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.970
to them, which implies that
the person performing the work,

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:24.500
the mediator, is aware of the
unspoken criteria of rectitude,

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.400
if you like, which he has to apply

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.980
to an authentic performance
of the work.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.930
And so most of my work,
certainly the last ten years,

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.730
have been based upon
ideas of this [inaudible],

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.750
which can in part be
transcribed into musical means,

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.120
but you all know program music.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.860
Richard Strauss' Alpensinfonie,
where you go up a mountain,

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.440
the sun comes out at
midday, you came down,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.960
there are sheep [inaudible]
in the meadows.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:07.800
Yes, that is program music, or
earlier [inaudible] or [inaudible].

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:15.430
All these things are based upon
musically external formal markers.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.990
Now this is something I try
to distance myself from.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.130
Well you can't do it entirely.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.620
Okay. This piece, [foreign
language].

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.920
Why Italian?

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.160
Well it sounds good in Italian.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:33.980
[laughter] And if I were to put
it in German, [foreign language],

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:39.070
it would have implications
about the [inaudible] and lately

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:46.420 position:56%
of the philosophy of [inaudible] and
his near Marxian sort of rhetoric.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.960
All right [inaudible]
entirely out of the ballpark.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.410
Nevertheless, I obviously
don't want people to have

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.290
to have the presupposition of the
listening and reading philosophy

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:58.590
in order to hear my music.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:03.670
It's not, it's not sounding
philosophy in any means at all,

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.710
although I might [inaudible]
otherwise 40 years ago,

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.480
I don't know.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.010
Yes, so English, the [inaudible]
word [foreign language] I guess the

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:21.360
word most of you would
be, what is the word now.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.660
&gt;&gt; Rebound.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Rebound.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.260
Recoil. I think that's
the word, yes.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:30.800
And it's in fact a lot of
things in music attempt

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:37.280
to take different musical
objects or ways of working,

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.830
bringing them together,
and in so doing,

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:44.200
create a sort of third synthesis,
which demonstrates the skill

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.470
of the composer and also
provides unexpected perspectives

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.920
for the listener who has
followed the process [inaudible].

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.630
However, this piece implies
not a sort of dialectal process

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:01.550
of that sort, A, B, A,
B, sometimes mixed up.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:07.550
What it does is present you with
two sometimes crassly opposed types

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:15.250
of musical [inaudible], and each of
these types of [inaudible] develop

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.210
in its particular way over
the course of the piece,

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.970
but [inaudible] take
incognizance of what the other sort

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.780
of material is doing since they
are always placed together.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.170
There are joined together
with very sudden breaks.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.850
So one of the problems I had with
writing this piece, I always think

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.840
of myself as a fairly, fairly
adequate formalist, but of course,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.130
the idea of taking two
totally different things,

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.430
sticking them one next to the other
over the course of a piece, A, B,

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.880
A1, B1, and so on,
really was something

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:51.520
which I was not particularly
easy with in my own soul,

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:59.160
and so that was a challenge, but
also it was a challenge not to give

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.470
in to attempting to make
these things so similar

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:08.450
that they would be [inaudible]
that I could show my skill

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:13.580
because these things didn't
offer any recoil, any resistance,

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.260
and it's the offering of resistance
of these things to each other,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.250
each in its own way of
progression throughout the work,

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.370
which is basically forms
the idea of the composition,

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.040
apart from the beginning.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:30.980
The beginning has 12 little
sort of things, resonance.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.480
So you've always got one
type of thing, resonance,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.780
another type of thing, resonance,

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.670
and the ending is a much
expanded version of that,

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.990
so we do have these
sort of formalists,

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.960
you might almost call
them traditionalist,

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.510 position:56%
[inaudible] with respect to how
pieces may begin and pieces may end.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:52.800
But it really was difficult for
me to write a piece precisely

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.420
because each of these things has
its own demands to be placed on me.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.070
For instance, one of the major
constraints of the first type

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:06.000
of material is that it's
all built around piano.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.530 position:56%
So you've got piano plus, piano
plus plus, piano all in double base.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.740
And whilst the registers of
these things are always changing

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:23.850
and the density of the materials
which are being sort of revolved,

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.870
like a revolving door, are
being brought round and round

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.930
in a canonic sort of game.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.250
This sort of thing was
entirely unappropriate

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.550
to the other type of material.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.550
So the other type of material
is defined [inaudible].

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:39.650
In other words, you'd
say, oh, this, yes,

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.800
this is this because
it's not something else.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.560
And it's an extremely weak thesis

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.670
to basically entirely
compositional, but it does work.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:53.090
I mean very often we recognize
that we don't recognize something.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:56.360
So what you will be hearing in this
particular piece is not an attempt

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:01.770 position:56%
to create a global synthesis between
two however created, however molded

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:08.230
and manipulated [inaudible], but
it's a very, very provisional

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:14.510
but insistent attempt to lock
them into some sort of interplay,

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.220
reactive interplay with each
other, which does not involve them

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:23.060
in taking on the characteristics
of its opposite number.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.460
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: One
followup question

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.710
to that contragolpeous
[phonetic] to that question,

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:35.570
that's just a throughout of that
[inaudible], would be you mentioned

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.920
with respect to program
music, and there's an element

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.810
of composer fiat that's
involved when you're titling,

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:46.450
an so is the title
more about any sort

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:50.000
of programmatic component might
be, it's indication of a process.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Well this is,
and that's why I put in the language

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.330
which comes, is not everyday
language for many people.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.610
Most of my titles are
not in English.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.640
Those of my titles
that are in English,

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.070
I've taken from obscure
poetic sources.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:08.090
So there's always a sort of
second level behind these things.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:12.120
And I leave people to puzzle.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:18.930
If you know any Italian, you know
first of all [inaudible], but yes,

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.920
against blows, yes, okay.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.980
But if you think there is
recoil, something bangs

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:29.250
up against something else,
which is somewhat intransigent,

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.470
and it bounces off, it
gets bent in the process.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.540
And if this bending of both
materials to accommodate a sort

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.280
of energy and trajectory
of [inaudible],

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:45.090 position:56%
which is really what the expression
of the work in my mind is all about.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.210
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: Well one of
the, again, I've only a chance

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.040
to hear it just a bit in
rehearsal, but one of the things

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.110
that really struck me was with
respect to the bending is the use

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.830
of steel drums with the keyboard.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:00.450
The interplay is really beautiful,
and you'll enjoy it very much,

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.920
but you get this, just a
wonderful sense of it kind

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.160
of exploring this inter-realm in
terms of just what's happening

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.470
versus the rest of the composition.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.770
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Well,

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.730
I use the piano [inaudible] has
an electric keyboard as well

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:20.510
as a piano, and since the piano is
at the center of these first types

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:23.410
of material which keep
on going around,

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:26.700
the other sections
don't use normal piano.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.020
They use a piano keyboard with
piano sounds but tuned in third

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:36.430
and sixth tones, so they are by
and large belonging to a sort

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.990
of alien universe of expression.

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:42.600 position:56%
You'll particularly hear this at the
end of a piece where I put delivery

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.130
with normal pictures and
then the same rhythms

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.810
in these microtonal
[inaudible] underneath.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:55.060
So that's the first thing
that I've never done before,

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:59.060
and the second thing,
yes, the steel drums.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.700
Lovely instruments.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.500 position:56%
I've never used those before either.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.070
You know, as you get older, it's
good as a young man or woman

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:09.940
for that matter no doubt, to keep
a couple of instruments in reserve.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:16.110
[laughter] A harp was one of those.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:22.050
Guitar was certainly one
of those 20 years ago.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:25.050
I suppose some instruments
just don't fit very well

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:28.300
into the contemporary music
context like a cornetta [phonetic]

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.400
or a serpent or something
or a [inaudible]

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.300
but the steel drums are [inaudible]

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.260
and perfectly consistent
within themselves.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.490
I expected them to be must
more crass than they are.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.120
They are extremely
subtle-sounding objects,

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.030
and the players said this was the
first time they're actually trying

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.620
to build these things into
a composition I understand.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.010
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: Well, you know,
one other thing that struck me

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:59.070
and then I'll move onto maybe James
has some, talk about the process

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:03.860
of putting together the work, one
thing that I was also hearing is

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.210
that there is quite a bit
of not just things moving

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:11.270
against each other but
also some, I don't know how

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:15.650
to describe them except
as maybe moments of stasis

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:19.140
or [inaudible] pedal points almost,
or gestural pedal points that are--

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.480
are those types of kind
of connective tissues

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.120
or are those also more
just extrapolations

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.420
of a particular [inaudible].

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.250
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Well, I
promised I wouldn't get into--

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.410
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: Okay, [inaudible].

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:35.580
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: They're not
put there as it were to allow you

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.690
to refresh your palate [inaudible].

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:42.580 position:56%
I don't know if [inaudible]
comparisons [inaudible] of any sort,

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:47.710
but they arise by virtue
of the processes

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.080
which I'm applying [inaudible].

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.130
It may be in some sections
there are more notes there

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.220
because I cut fewer notes out.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:59.690
One long note may be there
because I cut out all the notes

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:04.980
which would have been around
it by following a sort of,

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.970
some sort of intellectual
[inaudible].

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:13.220 position:56%
And a lot of things that I do in my
music start out as a tremendous sort

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:18.330
of bustle of materials like the
rhythmic structures of this work,

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:23.730
22 layers and they go on for
140 pages [inaudible] 140 pages.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:29.060
[laughter] Then I find
secondary procedures to them,

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.800
which either brings
out particularity

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.040
of the rhythmic process at that
moment on that level or seeks

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.740
to obscure it by eliminating it
compared with something else.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.410
So really that's what's happening
is [inaudible] you've got a sort

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:45.950
of mental rubber as you're rubbing
out things, and you are meant

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:50.430
to feel time differently, because
when time is filling itself

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:54.170
up with lots of activity,
that's one thing,

00:17:54.170 --> 00:18:00.690
but when that activity disappears
and time is left in a sort

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:07.910 position:56%
of naked form as a polyphonic sort
of counter entity with the material,

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:10.380
that's the moment when we
perceive time most [inaudible],

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:15.310
and that's always been
something that fascinates me.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:19.930
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: Well the work
is clearly a very difficult work

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:24.100
to put together but it seems like
it's so effortless to the ensemble.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.460
It seems that they're doing
a really fantastic job for me

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.790
and from the outside,
and I'm just wondering

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:32.160
about that process of
putting it together.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.620
How do you get started on a work
like this when you receive it.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.660
&gt;&gt; James Baker: Well, yeah,
it's, on the page it looks,

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.030
it looks extremely difficult.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:47.250 position:56%
There are aspects of it that could
be daunting to look at just in terms

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:52.640
of sort of the varied rhythms upon
rhythms that need to be revealed

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.680
in the rehearsal process,
but the, you know,

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:59.070
the members of the group are just,
they're so good, and so smart,

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:04.700
and so prepared that at the first
rehearsal it's possible just

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:10.670
to steam, full steam ahead and
really work on the things that I

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.520
from studying feel that
I need to accomplish.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.580
And I'm, you know, it's, I don't,

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.490
I try to analyze the
piece as much as I can.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:23.930
Obviously I can't get into the
mind of the composer completely

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:28.100
or even nearly in terms of, you
know, really all the procedures,

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.420 position:56%
procedural stuff, but, you know,
Brian writes such beautiful phrases,

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.660
and the ideas of section
stuff, sectional architecture,

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:40.010
the way that the piano reveals
each time the new section

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.920
or the electric keyboard as he
said, you know, those are the kind

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.700
of things that are, and then the
materials as there are, you know,

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.330
the dual materials
that are happening

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.260
and then [inaudible] back up again.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.730
I mean those are things that I
can, that I can see very clearly

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.910
and then there are
rhythmic things that I need

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.040
to make sure are together.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.790
There are pitch things that I
want to make sure that I tune,

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:07.050
that everyone's aware of
when pitch is coming together

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.300
or coming apart [inaudible],
so there, you know,

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.560
there are all these just, those
are all just basic musical nuts

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.000
and bolts things that we
are, that's what we do.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.300
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: Sure, sure.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.570
&gt;&gt; James Baker: So they're,
fortunately they're so prepared

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:19.870
that it makes it very easy.

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:22.740
Now once a composer
enters the picture,

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.210
then things are even more
revealed from his point of view.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.620
He can really talk to us about
his process and the things

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.210
that really need to be
more carefully taken care

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:31.960
of that I may have just--

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.740
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: Is there
any sort of a general thing

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:37.910
that you might say about when
Bryan entered that conversation,

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:39.630
what sorts of things
came to the fore?

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:45.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; James Baker: Well I think he's
particularly eloquent about what he,

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:48.130
what he's done, what he's
made, and what he needs to hear

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.430
from what is on the page.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:54.050
Some composers are very obtuse,
you know, or less than able

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:58.110
to even communicate with the group,
but his, he has an amazing ability

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:03.450
to tell me exactly what I need to
find the character or find the--

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:06.730
those things are, those
things are important.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.600
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough:
[Inaudible] a work of this size,

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.300
it's not [inaudible] the
number of instruments,

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:16.970
it's peculiarly sensitive to the
performers knowing what's going on.

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.000
If you're in a string
quartet, you work together

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.930 position:56%
and you discuss things, and you come

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.590
to a liberated interpretation
on that basis.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.890
But if you've got say
10 or 12 performers,

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:28.710
it's neither chamber
music nor orchestra.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.010
&gt;&gt; James Baker: Yeah.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: And
the composer has to take note

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.610
of that and act accordingly.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.130
&gt;&gt; James Baker: And it's good
for us to know what he needed

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.300
to hear in terms of balance.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.970
You know, our sense of four or
five P's up to three, you know,

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:45.780
to three F's, that space, how
it's filled, he was very helpful

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.470
in saying like this is what my
idea of 3P is at this point.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:50.770
This is the voice that
I need to hear

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:52.200
and how the balance should work.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.510
He is very helpful in balancing.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.930
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: Did you feel that
there was much adaptation that had

00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:59.230
to be done to your approach

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:03.130
to playing it once you
arrived in Washington.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:04.430
&gt;&gt; James Baker: Well,
we've slowed it

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:05.910
down a little bit I think
because of the room.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:07.920
The room is so bright and so,

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.240
and I think it's good
exercise for me because I tend

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.930
sometimes with slow tempos I tend
to be a little on the fast side,

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.280 position:56%
which is a bad habit that I am
getting into as I get older I think,

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.780
but I used to be proud of
being able to do music slowly,

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.230
but I'm getting worse at
it, I think [laughter].

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:25.310
But I mean it's really,
we've expanded out,

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:29.080
and it feels really nice, I mean I
feel like we opened things up more.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.870
In New York, you know, the
rehearsal studio we have is,

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:36.200
it's nice to have a rehearsal
studio in New York City,

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.500
that's your home dedicated space.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.960
I would never put that down, but
it's a very, it's a smallish,

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:46.820
very strident, ugly,
ugly room [laughter].

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:51.730
And the piano we have is not
a very good instrument, etc.,

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:53.050
etc. Those kinds of things.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.180
And so to get in here
in a beautiful room

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.260
with a beautiful piano
that's making, you know,

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.560
that's generating is
one of the things

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.440
that we need to have to generate.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.670
It just, it makes it a little
different piece, so it's a pleasure

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:07.410
to do it in a room like
that, that's for sure.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.850
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: I'm wondering if I
can take a step back for a moment.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:16.920
I heard an anecdote earlier
today about a performance

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:23.850
of Cassandra's Dream Song in which
you demonstrated on the flute,

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:27.420
and so I guess I'm wondering
if you could say a few words

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:32.090
about your experience as a former
[inaudible] and how that impacted.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:33.390
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough:
Well it's strange really.

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:37.280
The flute has always
been an instrument

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.290
that I've written most
for, I suppose,

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:44.090 position:56%
[inaudible] there have been, I don't
know, seven or eight [inaudible]

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.960
or piece with significant
flute in it anyway.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.760
I never had a lesson in
my life on the flute.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.410
I learned it, I picked
it up myself at school.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:55.260
There was a heap of
military band equipment,

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:59.750
which my music teacher had
piled, he used to be the director

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:04.240
of the lyrical band in
the wartime circumstances,

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.340
and he piled all these
instruments, which were broken.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.630
They were sometimes old with
half the keys missing [inaudible]

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:14.720
or models which no longer
were being built anyway.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.410
And I went in there, and I took
a flute, and I took an oboe,

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.430
and I took a clarinet, and
I stuck them together again,

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:22.730
and I repaired them.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:25.200
I put rubber bands where
I couldn't find springs.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.670 position:56%
And I started learning to play them.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.630
And the reason that,
well, this funny thing

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:35.160
about Cassandra Dream Song, this is
my first flute solo piece I wrote

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.760
in 1970, I had just moved
from England to Switzerland.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.660
I was living in the town of Basel.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.730
And I only had a very
small room, of course.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:49.190
I was a graduate student at
that time in the [inaudible],

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:55.410
and the flute was the
only instrument

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.920
that realistically I
could take with me.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:02.770 position:56%
No piano, no trumpet, which was my
other instrument, and so when I came

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.460
to start a new piece it was
obvious that I did on the basis

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.760
of the instrument that
I had available,

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.730
and I could work everything out.

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.140
And in fact, it was
that particular piece,

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.720
you shouldn't be too impressed
by my picking up the instrument

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:17.780 position:56%
and playing it for someone else,
it's the only one of my flute pieces

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:22.310
that in fact I could ever play.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:23.610
[laughter]

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.620
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: Did that
knowledge kind of set the tone

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:29.900
for how you would approach dealing,
coming to intimate knowledge

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.360
of each instrument that you
write for, because it seems

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.320
like that's just something
that you very clearly possess.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Well you can't
write difficult music unless you

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.940
know what the degree of difficulty
is that you're asking people

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:43.590
to deal with, both the
conductor and the performers.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:47.590
If you can't tell an oboe
player or a trombone player,

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:52.040
try this position instead
of that position,

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.880
it means you haven't done
your homework essentially,

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.110
and many things, by learning
instrumental technique very

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:01.400
precisely, many things become
available, become opened up to you,

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.740
that wouldn't have been obvious

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:07.970
if you just followed the
basic trail most travelled.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:16.270
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: I think one thing
that I'm always just interested

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:20.050
in asking composers is what they're
up to now and what they might be,

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:25.330
what's on the horizon, and maybe
there's another theatrical operatic

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:27.850
work, and, you know, that sort--

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:29.530
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough:
What am I doing?

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:32.580
Well, at my age it's probably
not good to ask people

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:37.010
to look too far into the future.

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:41.310
I'm doing a piece based upon a
re-reading of the [inaudible]

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:44.770
of Christopher Tye, English
Renaissance composer.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.880
And I'm going to do 10 of those.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.460
I've done several already.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.390
Each of which will approach
the original material,

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:56.000
the [inaudible] in a different way.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.050
The interesting thing is that these
[inaudible] are totally motile

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:04.800
[phonetic], they are not
grammatic in any way.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.020
They don't fit in with
my musical ideas at all.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.940
So it has been challenging
for me to make each one

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.950
of these little pieces, and
it's re-reading of the original

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:20.720
if I am using [inaudible],
examine different aspects

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.780
of the original than
one might expect.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:28.480
For instance, the one I'm
doing now is for solo cello,

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.540
and what I did was, the
only thing that I take

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.630
from the original is the innominate
dominate [phonetic] thing,

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:38.150
which [inaudible], and I
counted up all the notes

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:40.040
that occurred [inaudible]
so a lot of notes.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.590
And I counted up all the notes
in every measure, and the number

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:49.490
of notes in every measure went from
three to like 17 and back again.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:56.210
I used that as an input instruction
for how many notes would follow one

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.870
of the innominate dominate pitches.

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:03.810
So you get a pitch, and then you
get a flurry of other pitches,

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:05.310
it doesn't matter how
they're created,

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.850
say 15 because that
measure has 15 notes in it.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.560
Now that's got nothing to
do whatsoever with the music

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:16.450
of Christopher Tye apart from
in a very, very density way,

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:19.410
as you know with polyphonic
music of that sort,

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:20.770
it will start with a few notes.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:24.490
It will build up, typically
I measured 30 or something

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.160
to a very high density and
then it will fall off again

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.010
to a slightly less
density at the end,

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:30.770
and these things happen
all the time.

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:34.820
So at least I knew that I
would have a sort of curve

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.560
of densities to work with.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.860
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: So
what seemed like a,

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:43.290
might seem like an arbitrary
thing actually has this very clear

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:46.430
projection into what the
possibilities are as your--

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:47.730
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Yeah,

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:49.030
and every one of the pieces
does something different,

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:53.760
so it's like one of those old,
those old pinball machines.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.420
If you're very skilled at it,
you can get more money out of it

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.400
or points out of it
than everybody else.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.510
And that's what we try to do.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:06.100
We try to, composers try to
created elevated pinball machines.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.400
[laughter].

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.940
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: What's your
favorite pinball machine?

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.240
[laughter]

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.300
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: No,
actually I am not a gambler myself.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:24.260
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: Is there a
chance that you'll be working

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.270
on another theatrical
project down the road,

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.690
another opera or something along--

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:31.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Nobody's asked
me for one, and nobody had asked me

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.800
for one when I sat down
to write my first one.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.090
I have to explain that my first
one was like 10 years ago,

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:39.770
and it was a piece called
Shadowtime, and it was in fact done

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.520
in New York around that period.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.470 position:56%
And it deals with the life and death

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:49.530
of the German Jewish
philosopher, Walter Benjamin.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:53.770
He has always been someone I've
felt some sort of affinity for.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:58.720
He was a very chaotic individual in
his life, if not in his thinking.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.630
And, I was always proud of the fact

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.710
that this opera is probably
the only one ever written

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:09.510
in which the main character dies
at the end of the first scene.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:13.240
And his avatar, or his
spirit, wanders the underworld

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.990
in various ways thereafter.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.440
So, what is an opera,
well that's the question.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.760
I was asked by the Munich
Biennale to write a piece,

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.620
and they commissioned me on the
opera, so I said, okay, opera, yes.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:31.620
But you know, many many of
the early theater works,

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:32.920
things like [inaudible]

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:37.250
of the Florentine court
and things like that.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.220
They were written, that
was a collaborative action

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.590
by several composers.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:43.130
Some guy wrote the ballet,
some guy wrote the songs.

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:47.430
You have to do it that way
otherwise you'd never do it.

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:51.230
And there were a lot of religious
[inaudible] which boarder

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:58.170
on the dramatic in the conventional
sense even though the characters

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:02.390
have names like Virtue or
Spite or something like that.

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:05.420
So I think the interesting thing
about opera for me is not opera

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:10.480
as such but the idea that you
can, you put a theater of the mind

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.340
and this theater of the
mind can be illuminated

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:17.070
with a feeble torch perhaps
or even just a match.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:21.380
That Helmut Lachenmann's Little
Match Girl just [whooshing noise]

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.910
the sound of a match, illuminating.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:26.560
It was the structure
of the whole piece.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.400 position:56%
So, yeah, I said I wouldn't write an
opera because I didn't know anything

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.670
about human beings, but luckily
the human beings were all dead

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:36.970
so [laughter].

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:40.410
I don't know what, that doesn't
answer your question, I'm sorry.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:41.710
I don't know.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:44.200
I might be interested
in doing a chamber one.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.910
This was a very big one.

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:49.790
I might be interested in
doing something which rather

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:53.160
like [inaudible] has four or five
players and four to five singers.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: One of the, I mean,

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:59.600
you had an interesting
collaboration [inaudible] one

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.920
of the poetry [inaudible].

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Ah, yes.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:07.760
The very well-known poet, Charles
Bernstein, is a friend of mine.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.080
He kindly agreed to write
the lyrics for this piece

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.850
under the stringent rules
that I am imposed upon him.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:18.570
One of those rules that every line
must have this number of syllables

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:22.780
and no more and no less,
so there were patterns.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:27.620
Also, words in principle
should be permutable,

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.460
that you could change the
order of words in a line

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.040
and still have some
sense come out of it.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:39.070 position:56%
And the third, the third
constraint was that he would be able

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:41.580
to publish it as a
book, because you know

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:47.050
so many opera techs are
shamefully illiterate.

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:48.530
Maybe it just belongs to the genre,

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:50.410
but some of them are
really, really, really bad.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:55.940
Like a lot of the texts used
[inaudible], hey lasso [phonetic].

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.350
So I wanted it to be poetry
that he would feel comfortable

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:04.070
about in spite of me imposing
these limitations upon him,

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.370
and indeed he did do it.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.850
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: I think before
we get to taking some questions

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:16.930
from the audience,
you're playing this,

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:18.830
you're performing this
work again fairly soon

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.180
in New York, is that right?

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.120
&gt;&gt; James Baker: Yes,
next Wednesday night.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.180
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: What type
of space, what kind of a,

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.500
what kind of a situation is
that compared to this and--

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:37.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; James Baker: It's in a theater
in Brooklyn I think called Roulette,

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:38.870
which is a pretty good sized room.

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:41.480
It's a ball, I think it
was a ballroom in a hotel

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.410
at one point or something.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:46.520
It has the [inaudible] that goes
around and a floor for seating,

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:51.440
for seating of the type that is
extended out to hold larger groups.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.740
So it's not as big.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.730
I don't think it holds as many
people as this auditorium,

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:59.410
but it's not a small
space, and I'm hoping

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:01.000
that they don't do what
they normally do there,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.200
which is they have
this alarming tendency

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.920
to amplify everything slightly.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.570
Everything, no matter what.

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:13.530
And I'm trying to hope that
they don't, to find out,

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:15.030
to try to make them not do that.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:19.140
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: I hope you don't
have to fight against impulse.

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:20.970
&gt;&gt; James Baker: Yeah, that's
an impulse that's out there,

00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:23.980
it's just really disconcerting.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.760
It turns into a really, it turns
into a nightmare very quickly.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.060
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: Oh sure, sure.

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.640
&gt;&gt; James Baker: For those of us
that, I mean, you know, I love the,

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:37.940
I love amplified music, but I, you
know, if you deal most strictly

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:41.840
with acoustic music, it's just
a, it's just a, it's a horror.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.140
So--

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:45.290
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: Well we're so
pleased that, that it's going

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.960
to have a second performance
[inaudible] following the first--

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.930
&gt;&gt; James Baker: Oh, yeah, no,
we're looking forward to it.

00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:52.670
I mean it's always great to be able
to play something that you work

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:54.660
so hard on, you know, as
many times as possible.

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:58.530
I hope this piece is, I hope
we give it a ball of life--

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:00.270
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: It
has a chance to grow--

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:01.950
&gt;&gt; James Baker: Oh,
yeah, absolutely.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:13.020 position:56%
I mean it's already starting to feel
a little more organic, you know,

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:20.660
with just a few run throughs,
you know, in the last few days,

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:24.130
so hopefully that will
just continue.

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:29.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Well it has
to get to the point where instead

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:37.170
of saying [inaudible] 67 and not
63, you say it goes like this.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:42.500
In other words, the conductor
himself is not thinking

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.500
in these rigorous ratio
relationships [inaudible] baseline,

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.800
but you know how music goes.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.100
&gt;&gt; James Baker: Exactly, right.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.400
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: It's
just a little shorthand

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.700
to actual personal
reliving forth as it were--

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.000
&gt;&gt; James Baker: Yeah.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.300
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: --
and what's in the material.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.600
&gt;&gt; James Baker: And for
me it because really,

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.900 position:56%
it really becomes a physical, I feel
it in body, I feel it in my bones,

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.200
I feel the movement, I feel
the piece move in my body,

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.500
and once I get to the place where
it feels right, and it's right

00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.800
with Brian, then I,
that's a good feeling.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.100
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: Right, I'm sure.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.400
Well, why don't we
take some questions

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.700
from the audience, anybody?

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.040
We have a microphone
that'll come to you.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.630
Your comments, all three of your
comments were very interesting.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:19.280
Especially because the Library has
a new, a new practice of sending

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.820
out the program notes
the day or before,

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.350
and I notice that you did not want

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.870
to give an extensive
program note to this piece.

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:32.080
I found that very interesting,
and I also noticed

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.510
that your piece takes up, unless
it's been changed, one-half of the,

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:42.430
it's after the intermission, and I
was wondering with the commission

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:44.180
from the three organizations,

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:49.510
did you feel you were being
asked for a longer piece?

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:53.920
Could you extend a
little bit what you said,

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.070
because I would somewhat be
encouraged, if it's a short piece,

00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:00.390
as you said, to hear it
twice here and not, you know,

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:04.660
have to go up to Zurich or to
Brooklyn to hear it a second time.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:07.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Well, yeah,
strictly speaking the tradition

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:11.840
in these commissioning things is
that the commissioning body by

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:17.140 position:56%
and large states the instrumentation
which they want you to write for,

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:20.500
not necessarily right down to
the very last guitar string,

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:24.050
but in general terms, and you
know what the ensemble's got.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:32.650
And the other thing--
yes, duration, thank you,

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:35.410
good Lord, it's been a long week.

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:38.790
[laughter] They also
specify duration.

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:42.040
I had a terrible time with the
Festival De Tante [phonetic]

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:47.540
in Paris three or four years
ago where for one reason

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:51.380
or another the organizer
thought that my piece was two

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.680
and a half minutes too short.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:58.070
[laughter] And got very upset,
and of course if it's going

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:01.310
to be broadcast live on the radio
as in France many things are,

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:06.260
yes what are you going to fill
two and a half minutes with?

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:10.040
But in fact it was
conducted very, very fast.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.830
But that's, you know, the
composer is the always the one

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:14.570
who takes the flack, right.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:17.740
No, it's interesting though
with contemporary music.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.090
I think we've got pieces
which are very short

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:22.500
in contemporary music
today, and we've got pieces

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:29.170
which are enormously long, and
that wasn't really always the case

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:32.080
in the high, serial
or modernist period.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.120
I think there were many different
approaches we can take now

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:40.280
if feeling our way as it were with
the somatic mechanisms of our body,

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:44.090
the sinews of time, through a
particular sort of argument.

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:47.320
So yes, 20 minutes, where it's
19-1/2 minutes that's one thing.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.880
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, if I
could just quickly,

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.890
could you give us a few
more benchmarks within the--

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:55.720
he talked about there's 12
little things [inaudible] forces.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:59.560
Can you give us a few other
things [inaudible] through that--

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.810
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Well
what you'll hear is different,

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:05.440
you'll hear different types of
combinations of instruments.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.780
It's a very colorful ensemble, and
the big challenge was of course

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:13.890
to use two percussionists
because in general the integration

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:18.560 position:56%
of percussion into chamber music has
always been a somewhat problematic

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.890
issue, and when you've got two
of them, then you've really got

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:25.830
to think what it is you're going
to do with them, and so I wanted

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:29.510
to build in the steel drums and
one or two other little things.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:32.630
So my music, if I use
percussion, my music tends

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:34.590
to change color very quickly.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:38.950
I don't just stick with
[inaudible] you'll hear all sorts

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:46.480
of things going on, ratchets and
things, which sound rather strange.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.250
So that would be something to
listen to, to try and feel.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:54.880
The piano is quite
clear, but the percussion

00:39:54.880 --> 00:40:00.240
in a sense are a double avatar in
negative if it were, in retrograde,

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.870
of what the pianist is doing,
because they are mainly

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:09.890
in the other sections, and so each
of the sections is characterized

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:13.800
by a particular grouping
and strategy

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.720
of the percussion instruments
available.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:21.610
Other things are, for instance,
subsets of the ensemble,

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:25.030
the first appearance of the
second material is actually

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:27.330
for woodwind quintet.

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:30.990
It's not something I think we think
about, but it does happen to be

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:33.000
like that, and that's
the way I planned it.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.550
This is a quite interesting
little poignant fragment

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:39.910
for string quartet
later on in the piece.

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:45.700
Well I'm not sure it's poignant,
but it's string quartet.

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.420
[laughter] So it is true that there
are lot of [inaudible] in the piece

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:52.650
where many, many things are
going on at the same time.

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:56.320
I do urge you to look to see how
many instruments are playing,

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.300
which instruments are playing.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:03.620 position:56%
Certainly with the first material
you'll be able to do that very well,

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:09.080
but with the second, the
argument is a little bit

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.170
at an angle if you like.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:18.180
It's not directly source to ear,
but it's going through a windy sort

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:22.220
of [inaudible] strip type
twisty motion in order

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:25.550
to bring it where it needs to go.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.300
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: Wait until
the-- there's a question up here.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.030
My take away from that also is

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:37.390
that we're owed 30
seconds, is that right?

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:38.690
[laughter]

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:39.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Yes.

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:41.290 position:56%
But I wasn't going to tell you that.

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:42.590
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: Oh it's true.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.060
&gt;&gt; James Baker: I can
add 30 seconds easy.

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:46.260
&gt;&gt; So, you mentioned that
you don't, you don't care

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:50.330
for the culinary analogies
but you've been using a lot

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:53.580
of mathematical and you just
interjected Mobius strip.

00:41:53.580 --> 00:42:00.930
Are there any sort of mathematical
cues, themes that you used

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:03.720
in sections of this piece.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough:
Well, I do, yes.

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:11.380
This is a problem for you
because you don't get [inaudible].

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.200
I work with two screens on my desk.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.990
One is a calculation
screen, which uses Patchwork,

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:21.450
which is a mathematical to
a musical interface program,

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:26.020
and on the right screen is me
writing down the score that results

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.330
in [inaudible] original processes.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:35.950
So, yes. Before about 1992
everything was done by hand.

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:40.590
After that point, [inaudible]
was trying to codify some

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:43.040
of the procedures that
I'd used ad hoc in

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:49.070
earlier pieces as I
cannot [inaudible] in a way

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:53.470
that a computer could
chew on and come

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:57.200
up with many different strategies
[inaudible] as I do do that.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.580
But there aren't many sketches now.

00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:59.880
[laughter]

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.960
&gt;&gt; So do the musicians kind of
achieve now more than they used

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.410
because you have all of these--

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:09.150
I mean the technical
tools could get you

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:11.560
down the rabbit's hole
fairly quickly.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Well

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:16.490
when I first started doing
electronic calculations

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:21.270
for my instrumental music, they
said what did you want to do?

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:26.300 position:56%
I was at Airtime [phonetic] in Paris
at the time, and so we were going

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.050
to do a little three
months of [inaudible],

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:36.220 position:56%
and I said what want this thing to
do is what I've done already by hand

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:40.040
because otherwise how will
I judge it [inaudible]?

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.510
You've got to know, you've
got to own the procedures

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:45.690
that you've employed
to get satisfactory,

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:48.050
subjectively satisfactory results.

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:50.580
The only thing that a
program does for you,

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:52.530
it gives you 100 choices instead

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:57.000
of working two weeks
to produce one choice.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.760
And that might be seen to
be somewhat trivializing

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.170
of compositional invention,
but I think that's not so.

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:11.340
I mean we always react with some
sort of preferential sensibility

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:15.250 position:56%
with whatever type of material we've
got [inaudible] I believe in this.

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.040
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: There's
another question back there.

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:28.390
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:30.670
I'm very much looking
forward to hearing your piece,

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:36.600
as I think we all are, and I also
hear what you said at the beginning

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:40.460
or toward the beginning about
program music and the dang--

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:43.510
I mean of course I understand it's
impossible to produce any piece

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:46.100 position:56%
of music through an outside program,

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:50.440
and I haven't heard the
piece yet obviously.

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:53.910
That being said, I found
what you did write in terms

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:55.760
of program notes quite fascinating,

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.920
and I wanted to offer just a
few comments for your reaction,

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:03.270
even if it's to excoriate
what I'm about to say.

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:08.220
And the first comment I'm
probably much too involved

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:12.350 position:56%
in the everyday here, but your third
paragraph, and thinking of a person

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:14.700
in Washington, I couldn't
help but be reminded

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:17.710
of our current national
politics to be honest.

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:21.620
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Well, I
have to emphasize very politely

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:25.140
and certainly respectfully to you
that I am not an American national.

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.030
&gt;&gt; Of course, of course.

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:33.310
[laughter] I guess I'm just
relating perhaps somewhat stream

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:38.120
of consciousness how this struck
one American this evening,

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:41.600
and my apologies, you can
excoriate me if you would.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.900
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough:
No, no, not at all.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.580
I mean I've always
contrived to live in countries

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:50.120
where I never have to vote.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.870
[laughter] There must
be a reason for that.

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:55.280
But this is probably
providing us with more

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.430
of a reason than we might like.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:00.800
May we live in interesting times
of the Chinese [inaudible].

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:05.020
&gt;&gt; Well, in a more general
sense, I mean I'll be interested

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.840
to hear this, when you speak

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:13.170
of obstinately pitting two
aggressively distinct musical

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:16.020
character types against each
other, it just makes me wonder

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:17.990
if it's expressive somehow

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:21.610
of the world we're living
in or living through.

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:24.680
Again, probably much
too simplistic, but--

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:28.070
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: As I said
earlier on, we like to think

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:31.670
that music has a relevance over
and beyond just making sounds

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:42.370 position:56%
in the air, like any form of ordered
intellectual or inventive procedure.

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:46.160
I think music surely can
bring forth these things,

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.590
but I think it's the
deeper reflection upon what

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.240
in the-- okay, [inaudible].

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.830
What makes art interesting
is that it deals

00:46:55.830 --> 00:47:00.460
with the general in the particular.

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:04.910
So it depends which of these
poles you're going out from.

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:09.080
If you, if you say, okay, all
music should be accessible

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.260
because it should be tonal
or it should be modal

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.030
or have regular rhythms, well
that's a big general prescription,

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:17.940
but then there's no piece in
the world that could ever live

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:23.150
up to that, to the hundred percent
of those structures because just

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:26.010
for logical reasons that it
would not be an individual piece

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:27.820
if it lived up to all
those structures.

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.580
It would be a general
expression of the general.

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:37.310
And a piece of music is always
internally dissonant in the sense

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:43.660
that those general aspects should
ideally inform our listening

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:48.200
to some extent, but it's the
particularities of the work

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:56.290
which lend wings to the retention
and reworking of those impressions

00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:57.590
after the piece is finished.

00:47:57.590 --> 00:47:59.550
And I think it is very important,

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:03.740
rather like a perspectival
vanishing point,

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:06.100
sometimes the vanishing point
could be off the compass,

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.800
it could be somewhere else.

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.200
Or if you've got a fragment
where the arm is missing,

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.920
you can extrapolate the arm but
not exactly where the arm was

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:17.590
but the sort of armness
of that situation.

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:22.670
So, yet, of course I believe
there are general things

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:30.680
which will allow the individualness
and to confront certain aspects

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.280
of present day experience but
at the same time it wouldn't be

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.580
of any value.

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:39.100
I could write an article for
Time Magazine now I suppose

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:41.930
if I did not compose music.

00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:49.520
If you didn't [inaudible],
the largely passive background

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.990
of generality with
the very [inaudible]

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:57.780
and specific invention
of a particular piece.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.080
&gt;&gt; You said it much
better than I could,

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.380
and thank you for indulging me.

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:01.680
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Well greater
length and I'm sorry about that.

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.250
&gt;&gt; No, thank you for indulging me.

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:06.830
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: We'll take one
or two more questions [inaudible].

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:12.350
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:13.650
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Hey.

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:16.770
&gt;&gt; So, correct me if I'm wrong,
I know you've done a piece or two

00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:19.110
at least for-- that
involved electronics--

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:22.510
am I correct to say
that you have not

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:26.120
yet done strictly electro-acoustic
composition?

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.420
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: No.

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:28.720
&gt;&gt; No, I'm sorry.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.210
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: No,
in fact, how would you know?

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:32.060
&gt;&gt; Okay, well I--

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:35.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: I had the word
about five to six years ago I did,

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:38.070
I finally decided that
whilst I didn't want

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:43.340
to do extremely sophisticated
electronic generation using god

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:47.770
knows how much software, what I
did was I gathered together all the

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:52.500
dreadful deadbeat programs you can
get off the Internet free of charge

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.580
and wrote music using only those.

00:49:54.580 --> 00:50:01.700
[laughter] So, yes, some of
it's pretty gruesome, but it's--

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:05.360
one of them has been played
in public several times.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:09.510
One of them only at Stanford in one

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:14.160
of their Friday afternoon
weirdness sessions.

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.030
[laughter] I wouldn't call myself
an electronic composer though.

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:20.890
I mean I do sell electronics in
other pieces, like a chorale piece,

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:29.160
which is part of the opera, in
which the singing triggers attacks

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.450 position:56%
of different types of sonic material
as the piece goes on transforming

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:36.230
into the voice so that
the two come together

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:38.340
in a sort of [inaudible] flow.

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:39.790
&gt;&gt; The reason I ask
is because I know

00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:42.620
that your music is highly specific
rhythmically, and I would think

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:46.290
that with the emergence of
electronics this allows for that

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:49.370
to be much, for your music to
be performed with perfection.

00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:55.000
Do you, perhaps the reason that you
might not do strictly electronic

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.820
music is because you
like the concept

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:01.920
of the performers having the, I
guess, I don't know, you might want

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:05.090
to a struggle, or the
human aspect to it.

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:06.920
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Well,
I don't like word perfection.

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:10.690
I think that was a scientificist
view of the 1950's and early '60's

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:17.470
in America, a sort of subclass
of the European serial system,

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:21.970
which came to reside in
American Universities only

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:26.190
because the people concerned could
convince the appointment committees

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:30.930
that these were objectively
valuable principles, yes?

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:42.890
So, it's a pity, but that
in fact was what happened.

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:44.550
So, whew, [inaudible] perfection.

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:47.430
What would be a perfect rendition?

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:53.010
I don't believe that there is
such a thing first of all, and B,

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:56.700
I think this is something,
you know, we've talked about,

00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:02.080 position:56%
the fidelity to the intention of the
piece rather than precise rendition

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.960
of what's there is what
we're really talking about.

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:11.130
It's something which has a surplus
of energizing potential over

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:12.910
and beyond the mere replicative.

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:15.590
There was a piece, an Italian
piece years ago by [inaudible],

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:19.430
and we don't need to
say any more about it,

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:25.130
but he called it Phil
Aleza [phonetic] [singing],

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:35.730
and he [inaudible] and you see
this incredibly contorted, sick,

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:39.880
quasi-serial, multiple
irrational values piled up on top

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:44.870
of each other, tempo changes every
two beats, and it seems like this,

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:49.670
what he was doing was very clever.

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:55.520
He had taken a recording of
an interpretation [inaudible]

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.830
and he had transcribed
it as best he could

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:01.780
into contemporary musical notation.

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:05.820
All the notes were
exactly in the place

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:12.770
where the performer
was playing them.

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:17.540
So [singing], so what is it we
interpreted in the Beethoven piece?

00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:22.170
We interpret 20 generations
of Beethoven [inaudible].

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:26.310
No reason that's not a good thing.

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:31.590
That's why tradition in
the arts is very powerful.

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:36.220
So just because you see a notation
that is very exact, it doesn't mean

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:40.310
that I'm looking for that
sort of scientific exactitude

00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:47.750
because I don't think that my mind

00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:51.490
at least works in that
particular way.

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:54.050
It works in a sort of
Gestalt [phonetic] way.

00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:57.440
You put things together
because they belong together

00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:00.960
under generalized rules no
doubt from Gestalt philosophy

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:04.640
which would allow us to examine
that, but I don't bother.

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.740
I just write the music.

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:08.490
So yeah, perfect no.

00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:14.260 position:56%
You know, the exhilaration of a
live performance is always something

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:18.160
which is totally different from the
studio recordings I'm sure you're

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:23.030
aware, and once they have
their benefits indeed,

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:28.290
I'm happy to take whatever
circumstance

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:36.050
or incidentalities apply in
a live performance anytime.

00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:38.360
&gt;&gt; David Phylar: Thank you.

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:40.660
Let's just take one last question.

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.060
&gt;&gt; My sense is that
your piece is written

00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:49.770
out exactly the way you want it,

00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:53.370
there's not chance
elements or anything in it.

00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:55.540
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Well
only so far as any music,

00:54:55.540 --> 00:55:01.820
any human activity is shock
through with chance element.

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.740
No, there were no, everything
is precisely notated.

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.940
&gt;&gt; And one other question
which as you mentioned

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:09.050
that there is some microtonal--

00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:10.350
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Yes.

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:11.950
&gt;&gt; -- elements in it, and I
was wondering what the purpose

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:16.420
of that was because some
people use that for the purpose

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:18.780
of approximating just
intonation or--

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:20.520
&gt;&gt; Brian Ferneyhough: Well, you
know, there were different sorts

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:26.970
of microtones and they make
possible different sorts

00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:31.600 position:56%
of realistically attainable results.

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.580
Quarter tones are usually pretty
good as long as you don't try

00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:38.910
to sing a small perfect fifth.

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:41.490
I mean it's just-- I had
a pupil once in a course.

00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:44.090
He came with a piece
for four singers.

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:47.870
And he had written it
in 24 tones [inaudible],

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:55.210 position:56%
and there was absolutely no way
that you were going to sing a C here

00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:57.580
and an F three-quarter
[inaudible] there.

00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:59.620
It just doesn't work
that way for our ears.

00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:01.250
We're not constructed that way.

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:03.340
So you can do a 12-tone piece,

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:05.870
but you can't do a 24-tone
piece, and that's the reason.

00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:09.100
So what you've got to do is
to decide where the limit is,

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:12.640
in other words not where
you don't use microtones,

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:19.920
but you have to decide, it's a
sort of cost effect analysis.

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.220
You have to.

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:23.460 position:56%
If you've got a 12-tone piece, which
goes ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:24.940
ding, do, do, do, do, lo, lo, do.

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:26.590
Well yes, you hear
the first five sounds,

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:29.580
but you don't hear the last seven
sounds, but they're still part

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:31.340
of the 12-tone note structure.

00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:41.970 position:56%
So whilst it seems to be an
objective method [inaudible] method,

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:46.220
our ears don't deal with
those seven notes the same way

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:47.520
as they do the five notes,

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:49.510
and that's exactly true
of microtonal writing.

00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:54.800
So it's incumbent upon the composer
in my view to provide a sort

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:58.060
of rough and ready scale

00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:02.040
of a possible appreciation
for microtonal writing.

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:05.400
And so I said, the piano here,
or the keyboard, does use third

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:07.900
and sixth terms, and these
are very natural intervals

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:10.500
in the overtone series, but
they don't sound natural

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:13.910
when you put them on a keyboard.

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:20.440
So what shall I say,
goal-directed defamiliarization.

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:24.510

&gt;&gt; David Phylar: On that note,
I'd like to thank all of you

00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:32.100
for attending this talk and
for the good questions and also

00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.510
if you could join me in thanking
Brian Ferneyhough and James Baker.

00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:39.530
