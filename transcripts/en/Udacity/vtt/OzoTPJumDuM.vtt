00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through the answers together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Perhaps the easiest to look at is good old Ralph Waldo Emerson.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Ralph is one identifier.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Emerson is one identifier. 1803 is a number.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's transcendental-tastic.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This totally matches the pattern we're looking for.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
By contrast, Henry is an identifier.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Thoreau is an identifier, but these 2 slashes begin an end of line comment,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
so we'll never see the 1817, so this one does not match.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Down here, Marie Curie 1867, this would be identifier, identifier, number,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
except that the whole thing is canceled out by this end of line comment

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that starts over here.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Then up here, her daughter, Irene, this is one identifier.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This connected by an underscore is just one more identifier.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Here's a number.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We match perfectly so far.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It looks like we'd stop matching because of this fourth number,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but since it's in a comment, we ignore it, so both of these work.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And Marie Curie is relatively well known as a Polish physicist and chemist.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
She was the first person to hold Nobel prizes,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
quite a feat, one in physics and one in chemistry,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and in fact, she named the element polonium after her home country.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Thoreau wrote "Walden," which is relatively well known,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
a book about being self-reliant and dependable

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in which he starts on the first page by borrowing an ax from his neighbor.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Marie Curie's daughter, Irene, also went on to win a Nobel prize

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
for the discovery of artificial radioactivity.
