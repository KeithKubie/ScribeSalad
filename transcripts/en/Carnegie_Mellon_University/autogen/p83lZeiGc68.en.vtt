camera is quite useful because this

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099
camera is quite useful because this
 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.540
camera is quite useful because this
thing is so heavy once you've got the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550
thing is so heavy once you've got the
 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.009
thing is so heavy once you've got the
DSLR on here and you're trying to adjust

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019
DSLR on here and you're trying to adjust
 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.479
DSLR on here and you're trying to adjust
exposure and go to different parts of

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489
exposure and go to different parts of
 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.910
exposure and go to different parts of
the scene move camera is great because

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920
the scene move camera is great because
 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.710
the scene move camera is great because
once you're in that mode you can move

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720
once you're in that mode you can move
 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.540
once you're in that mode you can move
around you can look at the scene you can

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550
around you can look at the scene you can
 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.759
around you can look at the scene you can
figure out what the exposure reads in

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769
figure out what the exposure reads in
 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.220
figure out what the exposure reads in
different positions how much the shallow

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230
different positions how much the shallow
 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.690
different positions how much the shallow
depth of field you have matters or

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700
depth of field you have matters or
 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.699
depth of field you have matters or
doesn't matter and such and then you can

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709
doesn't matter and such and then you can
 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:50.990
doesn't matter and such and then you can
cancel out of that whenever you like

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000
cancel out of that whenever you like
 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.150
cancel out of that whenever you like
so move camera is a very very useful way

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160
so move camera is a very very useful way
 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.040
so move camera is a very very useful way
to just move your camera around and get

this is essentially the amount of time
 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.869
this is essentially the amount of time
the camera the robot is going to wait

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879
the camera the robot is going to wait
 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.500
the camera the robot is going to wait
between pictures that it takes this is

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510
between pictures that it takes this is
 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.780
between pictures that it takes this is
set by default to about 3 seconds in

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790
set by default to about 3 seconds in
 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.640
set by default to about 3 seconds in
this case 2.5 seconds out of the factory

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650
this case 2.5 seconds out of the factory
 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.070
this case 2.5 seconds out of the factory
and the reason to make this long is

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080
and the reason to make this long is
 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.780
and the reason to make this long is
because for example the exposure is

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790
because for example the exposure is
 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.039
because for example the exposure is
gonna be quite long on the camera and

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049
gonna be quite long on the camera and
 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.630
gonna be quite long on the camera and
you want plenty of time to deal with the

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640
you want plenty of time to deal with the
 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.369
you want plenty of time to deal with the
exposure and deal with writing to the SD

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379
exposure and deal with writing to the SD
 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.289
exposure and deal with writing to the SD
card before you take the next picture so

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299
card before you take the next picture so
 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.449
card before you take the next picture so
here you can adjust how long the robot

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459
here you can adjust how long the robot
 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.539
here you can adjust how long the robot
takes between pictures start delay is

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549
takes between pictures start delay is
 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.750
takes between pictures start delay is
also very useful the idea here is do you

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760
also very useful the idea here is do you
 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.339
also very useful the idea here is do you
want to trigger the beginning of the

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349
want to trigger the beginning of the
 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.720
want to trigger the beginning of the
panorama with an external trigger

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730
panorama with an external trigger
 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.979
panorama with an external trigger
did you plug in on the bottom of the

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989
did you plug in on the bottom of the
 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.410
did you plug in on the bottom of the
unit so that the panoramas begin doesn't

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420
unit so that the panoramas begin doesn't
 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.240
unit so that the panoramas begin doesn't
begin to be acquired until you want it

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250
begin to be acquired until you want it
 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.699
begin to be acquired until you want it
to or do you want to introduce a delay

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709
to or do you want to introduce a delay
 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.490
to or do you want to introduce a delay
like let's say five minutes after you

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500
like let's say five minutes after you
 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.350
like let's say five minutes after you
say go you want it to begin taking the

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360
say go you want it to begin taking the
 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.520
say go you want it to begin taking the
panorama so that you can run into the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530
panorama so that you can run into the
 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.479
panorama so that you can run into the
scene or so that an event can occur so

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489
scene or so that an event can occur so
 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.729
scene or so that an event can occur so
that's a start delay multiple shutter is

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739
that's a start delay multiple shutter is
 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.740
that's a start delay multiple shutter is
where you can specify how many times you

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750
where you can specify how many times you
 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.199
where you can specify how many times you
want the trigger to go off in each

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209
want the trigger to go off in each
 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.740
want the trigger to go off in each
position of the panorama picture order

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750
position of the panorama picture order
 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.929
position of the panorama picture order
allows you to specify whether you want

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939
allows you to specify whether you want
 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.360
allows you to specify whether you want
column or row ordering of the pictures

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370
column or row ordering of the pictures
 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.920

point eight volts is great anything
 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.380
point eight volts is great anything
about seven volts I consider quite good

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390
about seven volts I consider quite good
 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.360
about seven volts I consider quite good
I'm gonna cancel out of that and in

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370
I'm gonna cancel out of that and in
 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.220
I'm gonna cancel out of that and in
factory reset of course does exactly

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230
factory reset of course does exactly

sits down in the middle of the bush and
what you want to do is go right back to

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710
what you want to do is go right back to
 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.010
what you want to do is go right back to
that position in the panorama and shoot

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020
that position in the panorama and shoot
 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.660
that position in the panorama and shoot
that particular picture again and

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670
that particular picture again and
 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.150
that particular picture again and
integrate that into the panorama that

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160
integrate that into the panorama that
 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.800
integrate that into the panorama that
you're about to stitch so panorama

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810
you're about to stitch so panorama
 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.710
you're about to stitch so panorama
memory makes it easy to do that camera

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720
memory makes it easy to do that camera
 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.230
memory makes it easy to do that camera
setup is very important what you do with

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240
setup is very important what you do with
 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.970
setup is very important what you do with
camera setup is you set the field of

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980
camera setup is you set the field of
 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.340
camera setup is you set the field of
view of your system now that field of

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350
view of your system now that field of
 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.710
view of your system now that field of
view of course determines the number of

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720
view of course determines the number of
 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.530
view of course determines the number of
degrees that the GigaPan Pro should move

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540
degrees that the GigaPan Pro should move
 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.690
degrees that the GigaPan Pro should move
between pictures so there's two things

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700
between pictures so there's two things
 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.370
between pictures so there's two things
that you're set here one thing that you

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380
that you're set here one thing that you
 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.290
that you're set here one thing that you
set is the actual native field of view

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300
set is the actual native field of view
 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.600
set is the actual native field of view
that you your camera has at the zoom

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610
that you your camera has at the zoom
 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.820
that you your camera has at the zoom
level that you've chosen to use and so

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830
level that you've chosen to use and so
 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.160
level that you've chosen to use and so
you have your camera on here and you set

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170
you have your camera on here and you set
 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.560
you have your camera on here and you set
it by physically moving the camera and

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570
it by physically moving the camera and
 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.670
it by physically moving the camera and
I'll show you how to do that once we

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680
I'll show you how to do that once we
 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.560
I'll show you how to do that once we
mount the camera the other thing that

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570
mount the camera the other thing that
 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.040
mount the camera the other thing that
you set in camera setup is you can set

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050
you set in camera setup is you can set
 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.410
you set in camera setup is you can set
the percentage of overlap that you want

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420
the percentage of overlap that you want
 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.150
the percentage of overlap that you want
so do you want thirty percent overlap

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160
so do you want thirty percent overlap
 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.010
so do you want thirty percent overlap
between pictures or forty percent or

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020
between pictures or forty percent or
 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.100
between pictures or forty percent or
twenty percent okay that is a

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110
twenty percent okay that is a
 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.020
twenty percent okay that is a

now let's pull this aside and talk about

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940
now let's pull this aside and talk about
 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.580
now let's pull this aside and talk about
a DSLR and some of the considerations

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590
a DSLR and some of the considerations
 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.800
a DSLR and some of the considerations
when you're going to be doing some

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810
when you're going to be doing some
 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.240
when you're going to be doing some
picture taking now DSLRs are fantastic

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250
picture taking now DSLRs are fantastic
 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.820
picture taking now DSLRs are fantastic
for Giga panning because the image

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830
for Giga panning because the image
 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.500
for Giga panning because the image
sensors are large you're going to get

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510
sensors are large you're going to get
 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.120
sensors are large you're going to get
very high quality images even in

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130
very high quality images even in
 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.490
very high quality images even in
relatively low light conditions and what

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500
relatively low light conditions and what
 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.870
relatively low light conditions and what
I want to do is talk about the lens a

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880
I want to do is talk about the lens a
 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.890
I want to do is talk about the lens a
little bit and then talk about the

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900
little bit and then talk about the
 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.320
little bit and then talk about the

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.290
has a 70 to 200 millimeter lens on it so
let's start with the lens there are some

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300
let's start with the lens there are some
 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.670
let's start with the lens there are some
issues that you'll have questions about

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680
issues that you'll have questions about
 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.260
issues that you'll have questions about
one of the biggest questions is all I

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270
one of the biggest questions is all I
 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.030
one of the biggest questions is all I
was about autofocus versus manual focus

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040
was about autofocus versus manual focus
 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.010
was about autofocus versus manual focus
so should I use autofocus should I use

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020
so should I use autofocus should I use
 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.260
so should I use autofocus should I use
manual focus well the answer is

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270
manual focus well the answer is
 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.500
manual focus well the answer is
depends in a situation where you can

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510
depends in a situation where you can
 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.510
depends in a situation where you can
lock the focus with manual focus and

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520
lock the focus with manual focus and
 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.370
lock the focus with manual focus and
really nail what you want that's

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380
really nail what you want that's
 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.260
really nail what you want that's
fantastic and there's one important

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270
fantastic and there's one important
 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.210
fantastic and there's one important
reason for that when you trigger these

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220
reason for that when you trigger these
 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.760
reason for that when you trigger these
cameras to take a picture if you put

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770
cameras to take a picture if you put
 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.890
cameras to take a picture if you put
them in auto focus mode and they can't

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900
them in auto focus mode and they can't
 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.870
them in auto focus mode and they can't
get any contrast and therefore can't

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880
get any contrast and therefore can't
 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.450
get any contrast and therefore can't
focus they'll often not take a picture

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460
focus they'll often not take a picture
 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.160
focus they'll often not take a picture
so you're gonna miss a shot and that's

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.170
so you're gonna miss a shot and that's
 

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.680
so you're gonna miss a shot and that's
really bad so what some of our members

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690
really bad so what some of our members
 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.660
really bad so what some of our members
will do is they'll put the camera in

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:02.670
will do is they'll put the camera in
 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.450
will do is they'll put the camera in
manual focus for the sky and they'll put

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460
manual focus for the sky and they'll put
 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.640
manual focus for the sky and they'll put
it in say row mode and for the sky

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.650
it in say row mode and for the sky
 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.680
it in say row mode and for the sky
they'll nail it at infinity and take the

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690
they'll nail it at infinity and take the
 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.600
they'll nail it at infinity and take the
pictures and then when they get to the

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.610
pictures and then when they get to the
 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.280
pictures and then when they get to the
tree line or to the grass or to the

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290
tree line or to the grass or to the
 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.800
tree line or to the grass or to the
crowd they'll go to autofocus so that

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:15.810
crowd they'll go to autofocus so that
 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.380
crowd they'll go to autofocus so that
each picture gets to an optimum focus as

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:18.390
each picture gets to an optimum focus as
 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.380
each picture gets to an optimum focus as
chosen by the lens and so that's fine

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:21.390
chosen by the lens and so that's fine
 

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.270
chosen by the lens and so that's fine
because you're simply gonna pause change

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280
because you're simply gonna pause change
 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.100
because you're simply gonna pause change
the setting of the lens and then resume

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.110
the setting of the lens and then resume
 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.140
the setting of the lens and then resume
and continue of course the important

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150
and continue of course the important
 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.250
and continue of course the important
thing is you want to make sure your

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:28.260
thing is you want to make sure your
 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.870
thing is you want to make sure your
white bellows your exposure and those

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880
white bellows your exposure and those
 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.630
white bellows your exposure and those
settings don't change in the middle of

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:32.640
settings don't change in the middle of
 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.100
settings don't change in the middle of
your panorama because otherwise when you

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.110
your panorama because otherwise when you
 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.600
your panorama because otherwise when you
stitch it together you get some poor

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:35.610
stitch it together you get some poor
 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.990
stitch it together you get some poor
image results in often stabilizers

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000
image results in often stabilizers
 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.470
image results in often stabilizers
another question typically we recommend

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:41.480
another question typically we recommend
 

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.230
another question typically we recommend
leaving the stabilizer off now this one

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240
leaving the stabilizer off now this one
 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.210
leaving the stabilizer off now this one
has two modes of stabilization mode 1

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:47.220
has two modes of stabilization mode 1
 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.430
has two modes of stabilization mode 1
and mode 2 mode 1 is for normal

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440
and mode 2 mode 1 is for normal
 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.050
and mode 2 mode 1 is for normal
vibrations and oscillations that you

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.060
vibrations and oscillations that you
 

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.600
vibrations and oscillations that you
might get from say wind and this is a

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:53.610
might get from say wind and this is a
 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.670

very heavy camera on top of a heavy

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680
very heavy camera on top of a heavy
 

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.010
very heavy camera on top of a heavy
GigaPan Pro you have to have a really

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.020
GigaPan Pro you have to have a really
 

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.140
GigaPan Pro you have to have a really
strong tripod to make this whole system

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:00.150
strong tripod to make this whole system
 

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.420
strong tripod to make this whole system
work well and if you do have wind you

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:02.430
work well and if you do have wind you
 

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.980
work well and if you do have wind you
can of course try tuning the stabilizer

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:03.990
can of course try tuning the stabilizer
 

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.260
can of course try tuning the stabilizer
on and see if that helps with the wind

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:06.270
on and see if that helps with the wind
 

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.450
on and see if that helps with the wind
situation it's worth a shot if you're

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:08.460
situation it's worth a shot if you're
 

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.500
situation it's worth a shot if you're
gonna do that you probably want to

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:09.510
gonna do that you probably want to
 

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.540
gonna do that you probably want to
change the settings in the camera so

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:11.550
change the settings in the camera so
 

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.370
change the settings in the camera so
that you're in Live View mode so that

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.380
that you're in Live View mode so that
 

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.080
that you're in Live View mode so that
the stabilizer is on continuously and

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.090
the stabilizer is on continuously and
 

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.280
the stabilizer is on continuously and
warmed up and then the camera is

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:16.290
warmed up and then the camera is
 

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.920
warmed up and then the camera is
continuously warmed up and locked on so

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:18.930
continuously warmed up and locked on so
 

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.300
continuously warmed up and locked on so
that's a consideration if you're going

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:20.310
that's a consideration if you're going
 

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.060
that's a consideration if you're going
to leave stabilization on so those are

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.070
to leave stabilization on so those are
 

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.350
to leave stabilization on so those are
the issues that I wanted you to be aware

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360
the issues that I wanted you to be aware
 

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.540
the issues that I wanted you to be aware
of on a lens of course the lens is so

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:26.550
of on a lens of course the lens is so
 

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.270
of on a lens of course the lens is so
heavy we're going to connect the GigaPan

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280
heavy we're going to connect the GigaPan
 

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.950
heavy we're going to connect the GigaPan
dongle to the lens rather than the

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960
dongle to the lens rather than the
 

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.040
dongle to the lens rather than the
camera and then if we go to the camera

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.050
camera and then if we go to the camera
 

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.900
camera and then if we go to the camera
body and just talk about some of the

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:35.910
body and just talk about some of the
 

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:37.880
body and just talk about some of the
settings in here and what matters will

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:37.890
settings in here and what matters will
 

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.910
settings in here and what matters will
typically shoot in manual mode we will

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:40.920
typically shoot in manual mode we will
 

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.340
typically shoot in manual mode we will
typically fix the white balance and so

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:43.350
typically fix the white balance and so
 

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.810
typically fix the white balance and so
however you like to fix the white

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:44.820
however you like to fix the white
 

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.220
however you like to fix the white
balance and nail it whether it's custom

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:46.230
balance and nail it whether it's custom
 

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.600
balance and nail it whether it's custom

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.240
setting or one of the preordained
settings is fine live

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:50.250
settings is fine live
 

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.130

you mode again top left button is often

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140
you mode again top left button is often
 

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.050
you mode again top left button is often
very useful because you're going to get

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:54.060
very useful because you're going to get
 

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.880
very useful because you're going to get
a picture where you're seeing the

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:55.890
a picture where you're seeing the
 

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.140
a picture where you're seeing the
sharpness of the image that you're about

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:57.150
sharpness of the image that you're about
 

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.540
sharpness of the image that you're about
to take and let's talk a little bit

00:08:59.540 --> 00:08:59.550
to take and let's talk a little bit
 

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.610
to take and let's talk a little bit
about ISO sensors are so large and they

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:01.620
about ISO sensors are so large and they
 

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.050
about ISO sensors are so large and they
have such good signal-to-noise ratios

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:03.060
have such good signal-to-noise ratios
 

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.930
have such good signal-to-noise ratios
it's typically the case that you can go

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:05.940
it's typically the case that you can go
 

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.060
it's typically the case that you can go
to rather large ISO values and still get

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:08.070
to rather large ISO values and still get
 

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.850
to rather large ISO values and still get
great pictures so don't be afraid to go

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:10.860
great pictures so don't be afraid to go
 

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.190
great pictures so don't be afraid to go
to 400 and 800 because you're on this

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200
to 400 and 800 because you're on this
 

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.110
to 400 and 800 because you're on this
large system on top of a tripod things

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120
large system on top of a tripod things
 

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.210
large system on top of a tripod things
are moving you've zoomed in to 200

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220
are moving you've zoomed in to 200
 

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.280
are moving you've zoomed in to 200
millimetres so the smallest vibration is

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:19.290
millimetres so the smallest vibration is
 

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.600
millimetres so the smallest vibration is
causing some blurring you really want

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:20.610
causing some blurring you really want
 

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.640
causing some blurring you really want
that shutter speed to be fast and so

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:22.650
that shutter speed to be fast and so
 

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.160
that shutter speed to be fast and so
it's alright to have a nice high ISO in

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:25.170
it's alright to have a nice high ISO in
 

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.270
it's alright to have a nice high ISO in
order to make the shutter speed as fast

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:26.280
order to make the shutter speed as fast
 

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.130
order to make the shutter speed as fast
as possible you don't get much noise on

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:28.140
as possible you don't get much noise on
 

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.270
as possible you don't get much noise on
these cameras until you go to really

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:29.280
these cameras until you go to really
 

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.690
these cameras until you go to really
high ISO and so that's quite alright

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:31.700
high ISO and so that's quite alright
 

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.480
high ISO and so that's quite alright
let's also talk about the aperture as

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:35.490
let's also talk about the aperture as
 

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.070
let's also talk about the aperture as
you sit here using this camera adjusting

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.080
you sit here using this camera adjusting
 

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.780
you sit here using this camera adjusting
the aperture one of the challenges

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:38.790
the aperture one of the challenges
 

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.690
the aperture one of the challenges
you'll have is should I make it release

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:41.700
you'll have is should I make it release
 

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.840
you'll have is should I make it release
really small aperture or wide open the

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:44.850
really small aperture or wide open the
 

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.370
really small aperture or wide open the
issue is typically you're concerned

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:46.380
issue is typically you're concerned
 

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.560
issue is typically you're concerned
about diffraction and so typically what

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:48.570
about diffraction and so typically what
 

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.510
about diffraction and so typically what
you're worried about is if I make the

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:50.520
you're worried about is if I make the
 

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.950
you're worried about is if I make the
aperture small I'm going to get into a

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:51.960
aperture small I'm going to get into a
 

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.930
aperture small I'm going to get into a
diffraction situation and I'm maximizing

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:53.940
diffraction situation and I'm maximizing
 

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.450
diffraction situation and I'm maximizing
my sharpness at some point well below

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:56.460
my sharpness at some point well below
 

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.060
my sharpness at some point well below
the smallest iris that's possible and

00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.070
the smallest iris that's possible and
 

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.250
the smallest iris that's possible and
that's true so that's one reason to shy

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.260
that's true so that's one reason to shy
 

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.990
that's true so that's one reason to shy
away from the smallest aperture possible

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000
away from the smallest aperture possible
 

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.390
away from the smallest aperture possible
but depth of field is a big deal and

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:05.400
but depth of field is a big deal and
 

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.550

for the GigaPan unit and then we'll

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:34.639
for the GigaPan unit and then we'll
 

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:37.119
for the GigaPan unit and then we'll
bring in the pro and we'll simply use

00:11:37.119 --> 00:11:37.129
bring in the pro and we'll simply use
 

00:11:37.129 --> 00:11:39.639
bring in the pro and we'll simply use

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:39.649
the quick release to actually mount it
 

00:11:39.649 --> 00:11:41.650
the quick release to actually mount it
in typically of course I'm doing this on

now to deal with the nodal point issues

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:55.610
now to deal with the nodal point issues
 

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.160
now to deal with the nodal point issues
what we would be doing is we would be

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:57.170
what we would be doing is we would be
 

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.860
what we would be doing is we would be
adjusting up down from these screws on

00:11:59.860 --> 00:11:59.870
adjusting up down from these screws on
 

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.199
adjusting up down from these screws on
the sides and then we would be adjusting

00:12:02.199 --> 00:12:02.209
the sides and then we would be adjusting
 

00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:05.199
the sides and then we would be adjusting
this for aft for the nodal point for aft

00:12:05.199 --> 00:12:05.209
this for aft for the nodal point for aft
 

00:12:05.209 --> 00:12:07.389
this for aft for the nodal point for aft
and of course in the for app direction

00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:07.399
and of course in the for app direction
 

00:12:07.399 --> 00:12:09.069
and of course in the for app direction
for the nodal point it depends on the

00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:09.079
for the nodal point it depends on the
 

00:12:09.079 --> 00:12:11.350
for the nodal point it depends on the
zoom so as you zoom in the little points

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360
zoom so as you zoom in the little points
 

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.360
zoom so as you zoom in the little points
going to move back and as you zoom out

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:13.370
going to move back and as you zoom out
 

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.590
going to move back and as you zoom out
the little prints gonna move forward in

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:14.600
the little prints gonna move forward in
 

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.049
the little prints gonna move forward in
the lens system so that's the key issues

00:12:17.049 --> 00:12:17.059
the lens system so that's the key issues
 

00:12:17.059 --> 00:12:19.059
the lens system so that's the key issues
you're going to deal with in this case

00:12:19.059 --> 00:12:19.069
you're going to deal with in this case
 

00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:21.730
you're going to deal with in this case
with this Canon this is the correct

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:21.740
with this Canon this is the correct
 

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.740
with this Canon this is the correct
cable that we use and I'm going to go

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:23.750
cable that we use and I'm going to go
 

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.869

what it looks like when you're actually
 

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.340
what it looks like when you're actually
using it so now we'll end by just doing

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:36.350
using it so now we'll end by just doing
 

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:37.869
using it so now we'll end by just doing
one very quick panorama in here and

00:12:37.869 --> 00:12:37.879
one very quick panorama in here and
 

00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:39.220
one very quick panorama in here and
going through all the controls setup for

00:12:47.839 --> 00:12:53.799
cap is off that's good I'm going to go
ahead and adjust my my exposure and I'm

00:12:53.799 --> 00:12:53.809
ahead and adjust my my exposure and I'm
 

00:12:53.809 --> 00:12:55.210
ahead and adjust my my exposure and I'm
gonna have a nice open aperture in this

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:55.220
gonna have a nice open aperture in this
 

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.419
gonna have a nice open aperture in this
case until I'm happy with how things

I'm gonna take a test picture

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480
 
 

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:14.050
 
when you go to manual focus in this case

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:14.060
 
 

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.370
 
good so now I'm happy that I'm getting

good so now I'm happy that I'm getting
 

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.440
good so now I'm happy that I'm getting
good pictures out of the system you

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:18.450
good pictures out of the system you
 

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.480
good pictures out of the system you
can't see it but trust me now I'm going

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:20.490
can't see it but trust me now I'm going
 

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.519
can't see it but trust me now I'm going
to go ahead and turn the GigaPan Epic

00:13:22.519 --> 00:13:22.529
to go ahead and turn the GigaPan Epic

we're not going to wait for my pictures
 

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.810
we're not going to wait for my pictures
to get taken so I'm going to pause it so

to get taken so I'm going to pause it so
 

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.220
to get taken so I'm going to pause it so
just to review the most important things

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:46.230
just to review the most important things

just to review the most important things
for you to worry about are get the nodal

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:48.300
for you to worry about are get the nodal
 

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.689
for you to worry about are get the nodal
point aligned appropriately especially

much as possible you can deal with the

00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220
much as possible you can deal with the
 

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.220
much as possible you can deal with the
trade-off between shallow depth-of-field

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:01.230
trade-off between shallow depth-of-field
 

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.439
trade-off between shallow depth-of-field
and the iris size and diffraction and

00:15:03.439 --> 00:15:03.449
and the iris size and diffraction and
 

00:15:03.449 --> 00:15:06.170
and the iris size and diffraction and
vignetting so large iris you're going to

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:06.180
vignetting so large iris you're going to
 

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.850
vignetting so large iris you're going to
have some vignetting so you want to keep

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:07.860
have some vignetting so you want to keep
 

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.290

it smaller than the largest opening for
 

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.150
it smaller than the largest opening for
that reason but small iris you're gonna

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160
that reason but small iris you're gonna
 

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.519
that reason but small iris you're gonna
have diffraction and be sure to adjust

00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:13.529
have diffraction and be sure to adjust
 

00:15:13.529 --> 00:15:15.829
have diffraction and be sure to adjust
time per picture on the epic pro and the

time per picture on the epic pro and the
 

00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:17.360
time per picture on the epic pro and the
shutter method so that you're getting

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:17.370
shutter method so that you're getting
 

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.130
shutter method so that you're getting
the best possible pictures you can in

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:19.140
the best possible pictures you can in
 

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.100
the best possible pictures you can in
the ordering that makes

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:20.110
the ordering that makes
 

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:23.579
the ordering that makes
all work well good luck
