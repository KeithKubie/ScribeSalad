regenerative medicine is exciting
 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.350
regenerative medicine is exciting
because it really represents a rather

medicine is actually cure disease rather

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580
medicine is actually cure disease rather
 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.580
medicine is actually cure disease rather
than treating symptoms and that just

than treating symptoms and that just
 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.700
than treating symptoms and that just
inherently is very exciting to people

so of course one could think about

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590
so of course one could think about
 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.950
so of course one could think about
things like organ transplant and you

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960
things like organ transplant and you
 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.770

that metastasis of cancer that causes

that metastasis of cancer that causes
 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.580
that metastasis of cancer that causes
that really wreaks havoc for cancer

patients it turns out that those cells

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650
patients it turns out that those cells
 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.450
patients it turns out that those cells
are probably stem cells and they're very

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460
are probably stem cells and they're very
 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.540
are probably stem cells and they're very
very similar to normal stem cells so

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550
very similar to normal stem cells so
 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.010
very similar to normal stem cells so
let's think about the implications of

that well first of all if it's true one
 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.320
that well first of all if it's true one
implication is that if we go about

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330
implication is that if we go about
 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.560
implication is that if we go about
trying to find drugs to treat tumors by

trying to find drugs to treat tumors by
 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.960
trying to find drugs to treat tumors by
looking for drugs which shrink tumor

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970
looking for drugs which shrink tumor
 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.080
looking for drugs which shrink tumor
masses we may miss the important drugs

because if one in a million cells is bad
and we just find a drug that gets rid of

so let's take a set of electrodes and

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560
so let's take a set of electrodes and
 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.370
so let's take a set of electrodes and
let's embed them into some kind of not

receiving signals from a camera and then
 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.300
receiving signals from a camera and then
you could ask the question if you know

if the patient was to lie their tongue

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:05.850
if the patient was to lie their tongue
 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.420
if the patient was to lie their tongue
on that device or say it was like a

on that device or say it was like a
 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.550
on that device or say it was like a
lollipop and they just put it in their

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560
lollipop and they just put it in their
 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.790
lollipop and they just put it in their
mouth would they see anything and it

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800
mouth would they see anything and it
 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.040
mouth would they see anything and it
turns out they do so the device is

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.050
turns out they do so the device is
 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.690
turns out they do so the device is
called the brain port and you can go to

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:17.700
called the brain port and you can go to
 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.900

youtube and look at this extraordinary

you and I but but what they do is they

you and I but but what they do is they
 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.460
you and I but but what they do is they
begin to be able to distinguish light

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.470
begin to be able to distinguish light
 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.040
begin to be able to distinguish light
and for instance on a computer monitor
