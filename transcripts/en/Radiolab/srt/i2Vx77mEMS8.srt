1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,573
No

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,613
[inaudible]

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,673
now. Okay.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,730
[inaudible] no, I listen to radio

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,373
[inaudible].

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,171
I'll continue with here.

7
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:23,890
Report the first large scale study
comparing the prevalence of absolute pitch

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,430
them to normal populations by means
professors. Professor Diana Deutsch.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,210
Diana Deutsch, right? Yeah. I'm going
to turn down my head from Neverland Fan.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,900
I'm a professor of psychology at the
University of California San Diego.

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,940
Can you still hear me,
Diane? Okay. Hello Diana.

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,260
Studies sound how humans perceive
sound. She's a scientist. She has a lab,

13
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:47,220
but every so often she will
also release cds, right?

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,930
These a cds of audio demonstrations that
she uses in her research and that's why

15
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:56,040
we called because it was in the production
of her second CD that she stumbled

16
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,650
onto the weirdest phenomenon. Well,

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,500
when you do post production is
as you know of of of speech,

18
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,930
you look things, look things,

19
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:09,100
look things so that you
can zero in on piece. Cool.

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,510
That sound too loud. Nita? Unpopular
ss. That sounds too sharp and so on.

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,520
So you put things on loops in order to
fine tune the way the speech sounds.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,840
So I had this particular phrase
on a loop and forgot about it.

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,890
What phrase was this?

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,160
It's a phrase that occurs at the beginning
of the CD in which I say the sounds

25
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,320
as they appear to you. I'm
not any different from those
that are really present,

26
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,240
but they sometimes behave so
strangely as to seem quite impossible,

27
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:42,250
quite impossible. Now,

28
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,220
I had some hospital so strangely looped
the sounds as they appear to you are not

29
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:50,560
only different from those
that are really present,

30
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,190
but they sometimes behave so strangely
sometimes behave so strangely.

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,940
Just those few words sometimes behave
so strangely and forgot about sometimes

32
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:05,050
behave so strangely,
sometimes behave so strange.

33
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,120
So here's what happened. Diana leaves
her studio, she closes the door,

34
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,660
it goes into the kitchen to
make some tea. All the wild.

35
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,120
This loop is wearing away in the
background and she's sipping her tea.

36
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:14,954
She thinks

37
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,860
sometimes if someone's singing
strangely who's singing?

38
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,460
I heard what sounded like song and my
background shoe. That's, wait a second,

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,860
that's not singing.

40
00:02:23,861 --> 00:02:27,910
That's me talking that
very phrase strangely,

41
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:32,560
but at this point sometimes behave so
straight here to be sung rather than

42
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,940
spoken strangely sometimes
behave so strangely.

43
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,480
This is sometimes being so strange, right?

44
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,270
You still hear the words but they're
some words rather than spoken words.

45
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,790
It's weird like it just
switches at a certain point,

46
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,040
three or four repetitions
in, right? It's going,

47
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:54,670
it's going and then pow
becomes music and then now,

48
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,290
now none of us can get it out of our head.

49
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:59,200
Like the whole office is like
sometimes VA's so strange

50
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,350
sometimes ca so strangely.

51
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,980
And you know what if you do this demo
and then you go back to the original

52
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:11,981
sentence that sounds like you know
speech to begin with and when you come to

53
00:03:12,471 --> 00:03:17,450
that very phrase as seemed to be bursting
into song the sounds as they appear to

54
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:20,660
you and not only different from
those that are really present,

55
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,790
but they sometimes behave so
strangely as to seem quite impossible.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,120
I have to say, this can
continue for months and months.

57
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:33,940
I sort of sort of like your brain gets
altered for that particular phrase and

58
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,800
it, and it continues to sound like singing

59
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,900
for a very, very long time. [inaudible]

60
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,740
all right, so here we have just one
small indication that music is crazy.

61
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,220
Well, it behaves very strangely,
right? I mean, think about this.

62
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:54,220
We started with some basic
speech, repeated it a few times.

63
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:58,510
Somewhere along the way it
leaped into song strangely.

64
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,970
How did it change like that and if that's
all it takes to turn something into

65
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:07,090
music. And what exactly is music?

66
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,260
Sometimes we, there's some
strange thing. This is Radiolab.

67
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:18,470
Today's program is about answering that
question or trying to, in any case,

68
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:22,910
I'm Jad Abumrad here with me.
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom and Z.

69
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,743
Robert Krulwich, my partner in crime.

70
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,810
It was a little hard to get out of your
head. I know. It is really cool. I know.

71
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,730
Yeah. Okay, so this
hour, what are we doing?

72
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,720
We are going to try and we will
probably fail. Yes, we will fail,

73
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,830
but we will make an earnest effort to
try to find the ingredients of music.

74
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,240
Both its basis in languages basis in
physics as basis in your brain will look

75
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,300
everywhere we can software trying to
find out what music is made of and why it

76
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:54,080
touches us so intimately
straight and touches us.

77
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:55,580
Sometimes not in a good way.

78
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,250
If you've ever had this
experience of going to a concert,

79
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,400
hearing some music and it just
made you upset for some reason,

80
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,240
like irrationally upset, right?

81
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,140
Almost like you want to hurt someone.

82
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,630
If that rings a bell,

83
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,970
there's a segment later in the
show you will not want to miss.

84
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,773
Ah,

85
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,570
this is Radiolab. Stick
around. Hey, be hey.

86
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,723
Oh

87
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,323
Eh,

88
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,000
the

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,520
I completely messed up. All right.
Shall we start? Sure. Well first,

90
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:39,070
thanks to the LaGuardia High
School Chorus and Robert Apostle,

91
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:40,480
they were the voices you just heard.

92
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,290
We hear more of them later.

93
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,790
So let's explore a little bit more closely
this connection between language and

94
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,290
music. Yes. You think of them as separate.

95
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,280
Great.

96
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,180
The thing is they're really closely
related. So as neuroscientists, mark,

97
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:57,650
Jude tremble when we speak, we sing,

98
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,200
you know how to use the pitch of your
voice to convey emotion and meaning.

99
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,060
Like, um,

100
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,650
I went to the store just
because I raised the pitch,

101
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,420
the note, if you will, you
interpret that as an interrogative,

102
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,700
a monotonic speech, you know,

103
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,940
talking at the same rate and rhythm
in the same pitch and loudness.

104
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,250
I mean that is not how humans talk,

105
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,900
but humans talking to all kinds of
different ways in different languages.

106
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:31,540
Each language has its
own musical personality.

107
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,960
German is different than French
is different than Swahili.

108
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,030
And if you look at those
differences closely,

109
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,950
there are all kinds of things we can
learn about music. Tick Diana Deutsch.

110
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,010
Okay. She's recently been
looking at tone languages,

111
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,140
just published her results and
the results are startling. Diana,

112
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:54,790
before we start, what exactly is it?
Tone language. Okay. In tone languages,

113
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,120
words take on different meanings
depending upon the tones in which they are

114
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,690
annunciated. For example,

115
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,700
Mandarin has four tones and the word mar
in Mandarin means mother in the first

116
00:07:09,581 --> 00:07:14,380
tone. Hampton, the second
CHONe horse in the third tone.

117
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,370
And a reproach in the fourth
tone. Could you say them name?

118
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,100
Would you like me to? Yeah cause you
didn't, I thought you were well up.

119
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:28,180
You know I have them on CD but I'd
rather hear you say them well. Um, okay.

120
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:31,210
So excuse my bad
pronunciation that our trial

121
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,583
means

122
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,650
Martha Ma means hemp Ma means
horse and Ma is a reproach.

123
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,193
Huh?

124
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,820
So conceivably if you screwed up the
tones you could call your Mama Horse.

125
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,340
Yes indeed. In fact,

126
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,870
there are quite a lot of jokes where
westerners who don't speak the tone is

127
00:07:55,871 --> 00:07:57,940
right, say terrible things.

128
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,310
And utilizing Hong Kong you have to be
very careful where you will shout at shit

129
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,420
half long. [inaudible]

130
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,150
see this is the basic
difference in English. We don't
really worry about pitch.

131
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:13,151
We can see our words up here or down here
or glisten it up or bended down in and

132
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,360
it's all the same. Not
so with tone languages.

133
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,660
In any case, this is
where it gets interesting.

134
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,830
One day Diana is working
with some mandarin speakers
and she notices something.

135
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,390
There were these words,

136
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,760
these words that they would say where
they would all hit precisely the same note

137
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,050
with their voices, not just close
to one another either. Exactly.

138
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,280
Precisely and consistently the same,

139
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,290
even on different days. In fact,

140
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,860
would you like me to play for you one
person reciting a list of 12 mandarin

141
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:53,250
tones on two different
days? Yeah, definitely.

142
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,500
First you have the first
words spoken on Day one,

143
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,070
followed by the same
word spoken in day two.

144
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,530
Then you have the second
word spoken on Day one,

145
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:07,650
jaw followed by the same
word spoken day two,

146
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,260
so on and that way he,

147
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,290
you can see the consistency is going
to appear as though the words are being

148
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:19,260
repeated immediately. In fact,

149
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,170
the repetitions occur in
entirely different days.

150
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,950
So each of those word pairs
came out of the mouth.

151
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,790
One person separated by like 24
hours. Oh, much more than that. Um,

152
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,170
something like a week really. And
it was a remarkable consistency.

153
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:36,631
Jean Jean will,

154
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:40,620
there'll be like a sing the word mom
always at this note right here. Mom. Mom,

155
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,990
mom. Well, I concluded that basically
this was a form of perfect page.

156
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,240
Yeah. [inaudible] pouch
on the [inaudible] junk,

157
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,840
which I've never quite understood what
perfect pitch is to be honest. You,

158
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,960
you don't know what that is. No.
Should I, and I know I should,

159
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,830
but it's whispered to me as
a musician growing up, uh,

160
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,160
perfect pitches like that. It's
like the thing, it's like the,

161
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,310
anything you wish you had that
none of us have. Basically.

162
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,270
It's like having a tuning
fork in your brain here. I'll,

163
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:19,780
I'll give you an analogy. Yeah. Okay.
You see this a Coffee Cup I'm holding?

164
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,060
Yeah. What color is it? Brown.

165
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,290
And you knew that how
few of my eyes, right?

166
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,490
You didn't need me to put this Brown
Coffee Cup next to my blue jeans. No,

167
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,970
I didn't know to see the Brown. I mean
it's absolute brown. Absolute Brown.

168
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,520
Perfect pitch. People have that
with pitch. They hear a pitch.

169
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:39,650
They knew exactly what note it is.
The rest of us have to run this

170
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,460
piano. So if the hero
thing from an elevator,

171
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:45,910
can they name the note?
Yeah, that's exactly it.

172
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,720
Anything with a pitch like a horn honk,
they could tell you that horn is enough.

173
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,860
Or those church bells, they're
alternating between B flat and B,

174
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,330
and if the faucet were dripping,

175
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,780
they could say that faucet
is dripping in a d sharp.

176
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,670
They don't even have to think about it.

177
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,170
They just know it used to be that
the note names would jump out at me.

178
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,310
Diana Deutsch is actually one of these
lucky people to the extent that it would

179
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:13,130
even be a nuisance. And
why? Why is that good?

180
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,820
Well, it's really rare.

181
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,800
It only happens like once every 10,000
people here in America. Europe. Yeah,

182
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:24,280
man. Turning your tongue into a,

183
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:28,970
you call them and have the people who
have it. Yeah. Well, let's see how many,

184
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:31,450
how should I say this? If you look
in your music history textbook,

185
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,600
so you will see that every famous
composer like the really big ones, right?

186
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,780
[inaudible] Mozart,

187
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,630
[inaudible], Beethoven,

188
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:49,460
[inaudible],

189
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:54,070
they all had it where really
Mendelson, the list goes on on. So if

190
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,470
you have perfect pitch on some level,

191
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,640
you are closer to them.

192
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,070
[inaudible]

193
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,400
he's got the gift. [inaudible]

194
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,370
[inaudible]

195
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,000
Danielle, let's get back to
Diana Deutsch. Okay. Okay.

196
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:13,680
Let's talk about your latest experiment.

197
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,680
That's the one I'm really
interested in. Okay. You see,

198
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:20,681
you compare Chinese kids to American
kids to see who has perfect pitch more.

199
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,360
So the, explain how this works. You
had a group of Chinese music students,

200
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,440
air group who have American music students
at the Eastman School of music here

201
00:12:28,441 --> 00:12:30,540
in New York. You played
them a bunch of notes,

202
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,470
I imagine in a room and ask them to
guess what those notes were right now.

203
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:35,304
How did that work exactly?

204
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,030
Well, the test consisted of piano tones,

205
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,300
which began on the c below middle c it
says note and extended up three octaves

206
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,160
or the way to the that note.
That's a big range. Yeah. 36 notes.

207
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,730
Can you demonstrate you're
sure? Yes. Here is six tones,

208
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,083
Eh,

209
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,110
such as where given in the test.

210
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,620
So you would have played those notes to
both sets of kids and asked them to name

211
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:09,800
the notes without going to the
piano. What were the notes?

212
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:11,390
Really what these notes were?

213
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,740
D E g shock, c sharp, d sharp.

214
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,740
And g. Um, what were the results? Well,

215
00:13:19,741 --> 00:13:24,741
it turns out the Chinese group far
outperformed the eastern group of those

216
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,200
students who started musical training
at ages four and five 74% of the Chinese

217
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:31,950
group show perfect pitch,

218
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,980
but 14% of the u s [inaudible] 74%,

219
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,270
the Beijing group was nine times roughly
more likely to show perfect pitch than

220
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:46,350
the American Jesus. That's a split as
American group. Daggering difference.

221
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,060
It's a staggering difference.

222
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,880
Mm.

223
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,290
And it's your hunch that the difference
is because they speak a tone language.

224
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,800
That's my hat. I mean
the, it's, it's known that

225
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,570
the first year of life say from eight,

226
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:06,910
six months up to, you know,

227
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:11,911
a little pastor the year infants learn
features of their native language.

228
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,570
This is a very, very important stage.

229
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:23,230
Let's suppose that tone and the absolute
pitch of tones is a feature which is

230
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,330
potentially available to anyone.

231
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,750
Babies who are exposed only
to an international language
such as English and not

232
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:34,530
given the opportunity to acquire tones,

233
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,590
then they're going to be
at a real disadvantage when
they come later on to learn

234
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,370
to take wizard lessons.

235
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,710
So you think that as they're
a data data, let me ask this.

236
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,370
As they're learning their language,

237
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:56,360
which includes inherently
music to some degree,

238
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,390
they are essentially learning
two languages as they learn one.

239
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,860
Is that right? It's a matter of fact.

240
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:04,850
If you take the first tone
[inaudible] it's a flat tone.

241
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:09,260
It's really sung. Yeah.
Compared with English speech,

242
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,880
it's really more like song.

243
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,720
That's what that's always been sort of
the stereotype of the Chinese languages.

244
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,980
It's very sort of sing songs.

245
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,590
Yes. One Boomi soy mean
Guido home bow share, Lambo,

246
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:24,150
Shirley bow shoe for example,
the third child in Mandarin Ma.

247
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,600
It's sort of like a j type
pattern. The second term,

248
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:31,030
which is a gentle output
glace ma the fourth toe,

249
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,210
which is a rapid downward place. Ma.

250
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,420
I mean these are all kinds of
musical relationships. Yeah.

251
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,310
Given the evidence on absolute pitch, one
could speculate further and say, well,

252
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,600
may be other features of music are also
enhanced for individuals who start off

253
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:49,350
learning tone language.

254
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,640
So, so the, here's my big question,

255
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,210
could this explain the
experience that I had?

256
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,510
And I think a lot of people have this
experience when they're taking music

257
00:15:58,511 --> 00:16:01,420
lessons and playing a little piddly

258
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,940
pieces like flares, Yamaka,

259
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:09,260
and here are these Chinese girls,
right? Her playing rough Monona

260
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,400
you know, the brilliant,
yeah. Is this why? Well, I,

261
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,990
I think it's a viable hypothesis.

262
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,750
I mean evidently it
could be something else.

263
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,510
It could be something else
going on. No, go ahead. I mean,

264
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:26,540
one could argue that instead
it might be genetic and so on,

265
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,670
but they're seen as such a,
it's such a boring theory,

266
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,090
like always a boring
theory. And furthermore,

267
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:36,130
we don't have to assume that knowing what
we do about exposure to tone language

268
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:39,350
in very early childhood as
a, as a, it's just not fair.

269
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,640
And I think we can look
at it another way around

270
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,441
here.

271
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:51,441
We have a faculty that had been thought
to be confined to a few rare individuals

272
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,700
who are just extraordinarily
gifted, right?

273
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,120
That might in fact be available to any
individual provided they're given the

274
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:06,030
right exposure, attic critical period.

275
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,650
And that raises the question of what are
the sorts of abilities could be brought

276
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:17,230
out if we only knew just what to do.

277
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,760
There may be much more human
potential than we had realized.

278
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,703
[inaudible]

279
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,330
Diana Deutsch is a professor of music
psychology at the University of San Diego,

280
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,080
music psychology, music psychology,
and as I mentioned earlier,

281
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:48,850
she's also the releaser of
two cds. Yeah. Yes. Two CDs,

282
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,090
one's called musical
illusions and paradoxes,

283
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,690
and the other one is called Phantom
words and other curiosities.

284
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,850
What would you put on a CD? Exactly.

285
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,260
She puts these little audio pieces
that she uses in her research.

286
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,710
The stuff I guess that she will play to
subjects as she tests them and she puts

287
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:06,610
these on cds because they're
kind of fun to listen to you.

288
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:11,520
This is like an ear test or sort of, we've
actually put a couple on our website.

289
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,410
Well, what do they sound like? We
just it that little sample. All right.

290
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,160
I'll get some samples though.
There is the chromatic illusion.

291
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,890
Ken has a carnival feel to it.
There's also the a Cambiado illusion.

292
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,453
Oh, the can be.

293
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,270
And of course the
phantom word experiments.

294
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,500
[inaudible] none of those pieces are
gonna make any kind of sense unless you

295
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,560
visit our website, radiolab.org
where all will be explained

296
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,280
[inaudible]

297
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,113
coming up,

298
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,360
fashionable French ladies and elegant
dresses threw things at innocent

299
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:59,900
musicians. I'm Jad, I'm from
Rodan, me, maybe not so innocent.

300
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,330
[inaudible] which, and I
will continue in a moment.

301
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,420
You're listening to radio live

302
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,230
from New York public radio. B u.

303
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:19,743
N. N. P. R. Sorry.

304
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,153
Right

305
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,720
baby [inaudible] so speeding.

306
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,990
[inaudible] some.

307
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,863
Ah,

308
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,240
hey [inaudible]

309
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,803
[inaudible]

310
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,600
hey,

311
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,080
so Steve's the south.

312
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,933
So

313
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,240
was the hey solos. [inaudible]

314
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,743
sorry.

315
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,893
[inaudible]

316
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,360
baby. Hey

317
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:11,700
[inaudible] sound [inaudible]

318
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,480
this is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad
and I'm Robert Krulwich. Ah,

319
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,420
program today is about music. What it is,

320
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:26,950
how it works and what we want
to do next. Did we want to,

321
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,290
we want to stay on the subject,

322
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,780
but we're going to explore
this a little more deeply.

323
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,250
Take a closer look at the connection
between language and music.

324
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:39,240
We're gonna add touch, touch, and
that will take us to the ear, the ear,

325
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,300
and then into the brain, the brain.
And then to the big question,

326
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:43,470
the really big question,

327
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:48,100
why does music or how does
music become a feeling? The

328
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,790
feeling, why do we get such deep
pleasure or deep pain? We will.

329
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,850
They have pain coming up to all simply
because it air pressing against your ear.

330
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,280
All right. We're first. All right,

331
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:04,060
well there is a psychology professor I
want you to meet at Stanford who directs

332
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:05,231
the Center for Infants Studies.

333
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:09,400
There in front old's is her name and
she got it into her head that there is a

334
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:13,840
kind of deep universal
music inside language.

335
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,090
She discovered it actually at a hospital.

336
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,730
The Max Planck Institute in Munich has
an obstetrics unit which is very popular

337
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:25,980
among expectant mothers.
Mothers came from the war.

338
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,450
It's if this German hospital then so
they were Turkish. They were Greek,

339
00:21:29,451 --> 00:21:30,440
they were Sicilian.

340
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:34,520
They were the so called guest workers
and the German society. Of course,

341
00:21:34,521 --> 00:21:36,680
I didn't understand a
word of what they spoke.

342
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:42,910
As soon as they put the baby down and
no longer had the physical contact,

343
00:21:43,431 --> 00:21:44,960
bodily contact with the child,

344
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:49,430
they started to sing almost
in one language after another.

345
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,960
Given the babies. I heard these,

346
00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:00,050
I heard them use these
melodies Russian now to reach,

347
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,200
to reach the child to remain in touch
with the baby Yiddish for a period.

348
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,790
So next day I brought my tape

349
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,110
quarter ham for an old,

350
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:14,010
took her tape recorder from that
hospital and traveled all over the world

351
00:22:14,011 --> 00:22:17,520
recording parents as they talk
to their very little babies.

352
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,290
And it didn't matter whether the parents
spoke a romance language or a tone

353
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:25,500
language everywhere she
went below the word,

354
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:29,870
she heard consistently the
same melodies. For example,

355
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,540
I'll start with approval. When a
parent wanted to praise a child,

356
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:38,190
we would ask the parents to
show the baby they were happy.

357
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,800
Good boy. Now you got it.
Just using their voice.

358
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:41,880
Show him you're happy with that.

359
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,640
I taught that. He got, he get that I Gardy

360
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,560
[inaudible] Portuguese

361
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,070
bungalow.

362
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:59,070
And what these things had in common was
that the melody was a kind of a of a

363
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:03,550
rise fall. Um, good girl. Hi Girl.

364
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,840
Got It. Yeah. Good girl sweetie.

365
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,970
It doesn't matter what words
the parents are saying.

366
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,730
It's always really about this melody

367
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,450
and why that particular melody.
All she knows is that it worked.

368
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:23,520
There's something about
this melody that that piece,

369
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,310
just the child doing something. There are,

370
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:31,300
she says other categories that she
discovered. Now with a prohibition.

371
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,900
In contrast, your goal is to stop
the child from doing something.

372
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:38,530
The category that says stop quite
a different melody. It's short,

373
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,970
it's sharp in musical
terms, it's the Kotto,

374
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,100
but I bet there is the category. Look, pay

375
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,330
attention to that. No, this frequently
use rising pitch. Look Sweetie,

376
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,350
they frequently use
higher pitch at Unicorn.

377
00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:00,200
So far, Anne Fernald has found four
universal melodies that praise,

378
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,880
that stop and call attention and
of course the melody that comforts

379
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,790
[inaudible] and while this may seem
obvious to you, if you think about it,

380
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,710
this is music that is understood by
infants who are just new in the world,

381
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,360
but we all know what it means.
We all know these songs.

382
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,690
We we're used to thinking of
sounds as being about something.

383
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,870
Speeches always about
something, but it feels to me

384
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,540
more like touch.

385
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,203
[inaudible]

386
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,600
touch isn't about something. If you whack
me on the arm in a sudden sharp way,

387
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,010
I'm going to be startled or a
gentle touch has a different effect.

388
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,710
And I think, you know, actually sound
is kind of touch at a, at a distance.

389
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,330
I was in for an old director of the
center for infant studies at Stanford and

390
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,840
when Anne says sound is more like touch,

391
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,630
that turns out to be literally the case.

392
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,240
This is something I learned from a
friend of mine, Jonah Lehrer. Um,

393
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,980
my name's Jonah Lehrer with this
very moment is working on a book,

394
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:15,000
an upcoming book on art and science on
the connection between art and science.

395
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,170
Do we own it? Do we have
a name for that book?

396
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,280
It's called Proust was a
neuroscientist. Okay. Ansys Jonah,

397
00:25:20,281 --> 00:25:25,230
thinking about sound as touch
more like touch, I asked him,

398
00:25:25,231 --> 00:25:28,710
how does sound get into
or, or touch your brain,

399
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,270
take us on that journey. It's
just waves of vibrating air.

400
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,800
Um, it's just your voice

401
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,280
hatch at a, at a

402
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,420
beginning. Your voicebox compresses air,
not air travel through space and time

403
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,010
into my hair.

404
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:57,150
The little ton of waves
of diffuse vibrating here
focused and channeled into my

405
00:25:57,161 --> 00:26:01,480
eardrum, which vibrates
a few very small bones

406
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,900
and the little bones transmit the
vibration into this salty seat

407
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,870
where the hairs are and the
hair cells are fascinating.

408
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:14,630
The hair cells become active when
they are literally bent by weight.

409
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:18,850
[inaudible]

410
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,030
Ben like trees and a breeze.

411
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,960
And when these hair cells are banned,

412
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,140
charged molecules,

413
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,060
blood inwards and activate the cell.

414
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:36,450
So the sound triggers the bones,
the bones disturbs the fluid,

415
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,600
the fluid rocks the hairs. Yes.

416
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,590
And then the heres set off
essentially electricity. Yes.

417
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,620
That's the language of neurons.

418
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,400
All those changes from waves
to bones to electricity.

419
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:54,120
All those things were a trip
on their way to being heard.

420
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:00,530
It's only when the electricity
finally forms a pattern in your brain.

421
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,200
Only when it's deep inside.
That's when you hear something.

422
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,080
That's okay.

423
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,080
If it feels to me more like touch
sound is kind of touch at a,

424
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,820
at a distance.

425
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:16,923
Uh,

426
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,213
[inaudible].

427
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:38,790
All right. Now that we have gotten a
sound and any sound into our heads,

428
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:42,040
let me ask you the next
really big question. Okay.

429
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,430
Why do some sound and
let's make it music. Okay.

430
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,590
Why does music make so
many of us so often feel

431
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,250
so strongly? Yeah. Like in terms
of what we were just listening to,

432
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:58,260
like how does all that electricity from
the ear going up to the brain in the

433
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,510
next millisecond become
a feeling? Yeah. Well,

434
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,410
let me introduce you to someone martyred.

435
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,490
Trey Mo actually we heard from him
earlier. He's a neuroscientist.

436
00:28:06,491 --> 00:28:11,491
I'm in the Department of Neurology at
Harvard Medical School and mark can at

437
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:15,250
least begin to answer this
question, this feeling question.

438
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,140
He's done something really interesting.

439
00:28:17,141 --> 00:28:22,141
He's able to listen to the electricity
as it pools in the ear and shoots up this

440
00:28:23,351 --> 00:28:27,700
big fat nerve to the brain. It's
um, it's kind of a, a popping sound.

441
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,590
He can actually listen to that nerve to
the electricity so faster than I'm able

442
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:34,090
to do here with my fingers.

443
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,313
[inaudible]

444
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,150
is that a, is that the sounds when
it sounds like, how did they get,

445
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:44,890
how do they get this sounds?
I actually have no idea.

446
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,050
I guess I sort of tap into the nerve.

447
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:50,470
This is the sound of sound
entering the brain. Yes.

448
00:28:50,471 --> 00:28:54,220
This is the sound of sound entering the
brain as electricity and little pulses.

449
00:28:54,221 --> 00:28:56,290
And as you can hear, the
electricity has a meter,

450
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,070
but mark is discovered is that when the
electricity entering your brain is even

451
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,630
and regular, regular. This
is the baggage should wait

452
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:09,940
[inaudible]

453
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,080
yeah, that's regular. Right.

454
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:14,080
When the meter of the electricity
is regular and rhythmic,

455
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:19,150
it will arrive in our mind and be heard
by us as a sound that we generally like,

456
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:24,750
like this nice sound that

457
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,900
in music is known as a perfect fit.
The inputs coming from a perfect fifth

458
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,180
[inaudible]

459
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,180
[inaudible] is very, very regular
like a metronome. However,

460
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:37,230
and here's where it gets interesting.
When the meter going from the year two,

461
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:42,070
the brain is irregular, jagged
a with make unpredictable. Let

462
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,860
me hear it. This is jagging
in here. Oh, Jagan which,

463
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,570
oh

464
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,331
yeah, that's true. Yeah.

465
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:56,680
And what mark has discovered is that
when electrical impulses like that travel

466
00:29:56,681 --> 00:29:58,690
from the ear to the brain,
they will become heard by us,

467
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:01,410
by our mind as a sound that
we generally don't like,

468
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,370
like that. Don't care for that
one. That's a minor second.

469
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,350
The inputs coming from a minor second

470
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,623
again

471
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,410
is very, very chaotic.

472
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,680
Okay, so let me just sum up
here what I think you're,

473
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:23,710
you're saying if a sound entering my
brain is disorderly and unexpected,

474
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,630
electrically speaking,
electrically speaking,

475
00:30:26,631 --> 00:30:30,620
then that would make me
feel uncomfortable. Yeah.

476
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,010
And if it comes in in a
familiar and orderly way,

477
00:30:34,011 --> 00:30:36,680
that will make me feel comfortable.

478
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:41,210
There does seem to be a relationship
between the kind of electricity as sound

479
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,330
producers and how we
feel about that sound.

480
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,890
Do they have like fancy names for
this? Well, that's a minor second.

481
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,353
That thing you just said,

482
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,970
but did the scientists have names
for pleasant and unpleasant?

483
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,920
A continent is pleasant. Dissonant is
unpleasant. That's not a science name.

484
00:30:57,921 --> 00:31:01,670
That's a music name. Oh, okay. And these
are fixed positions in your ear. Wow.

485
00:31:01,671 --> 00:31:04,520
Meet with me. Be Fixed for
scientists. But you know,

486
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:08,000
maybe let me just propose this to
you and what people find pleasing.

487
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:12,170
What people find painful is malleable.

488
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,490
I'll tell you why. I'm going to tell
you a story now. The true story.

489
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:19,400
It involves a musician, ego, Stravinsky,

490
00:31:19,401 --> 00:31:22,670
who is now considered to be one of the
great composers of the 20th century,

491
00:31:22,671 --> 00:31:25,130
if not the most important
composer of the 20th century.

492
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,300
That's Jonah layer again.

493
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:31,570
And Jonah tells the story of two
concerts one year apart in the same city,

494
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,480
the exact same piece of music,

495
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,690
the audience who heard it
first and then the audience,

496
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,170
or heard it later on her
totally different things.

497
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,440
So let's begin first at Jonah. How
does this, um, just set the scene?

498
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,170
This is May, 1913 to spring night. It's a,

499
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,990
it's a balmy summer
night. Black Tie costumes.

500
00:31:56,991 --> 00:32:00,410
The women have their fedoras.
This was evening clothes. Yeah.

501
00:32:00,411 --> 00:32:02,690
Well this was the Russian
ballet. This was high art.

502
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,330
And the programs had, this is
a concert about springtime,

503
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,570
but as they settled
into their seats, right?

504
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:14,280
Turns out that what Stravinsky had in
mind was not spring like honeybees. No.

505
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:19,740
The spring Stravinsky had in mind was
about change, about radical change,

506
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,710
ritual murder. Literally, that's
what the story of the play is. It's,

507
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:28,200
it's a pagan ritual where the
end, the virgin gets massacred.

508
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,453
Oh dear.

509
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,110
[inaudible]

510
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:40,070
but the music itself is fascinating.
The beginning is this very charming

511
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,710
bassoon.

512
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:45,710
It's a classic Lithuanian folk tune and
it does sound like the earth is warming

513
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,900
and that lasts for about a minute and
then we get some Tutti of flutes and it's

514
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,140
lovely. It's getting a
little more disturbing

515
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,620
and then about three minutes into it

516
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,420
[inaudible]

517
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,350
everything changes.

518
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:17,520
[inaudible]

519
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,600
there's this, there's just an
earthquake. Stravinsky plays this cord

520
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:24,450
[inaudible]

521
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,550
there's a great story
that went the Aga lab,

522
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,470
who's the head of the ballet roost
first heard this court entrance because

523
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,310
playing on the piano for
him, he asked Stravinsky,

524
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:33,600
how long will it go on like that?

525
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,420
And Stravinsky looked at him
and said to the end, my dear,

526
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,130
and it literally does that
chord structures, the music,

527
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,370
it's one of the most difficult
sounds you've ever heard. It is.

528
00:33:47,371 --> 00:33:52,260
It is just the stereotype of
desinence. It is. It hurts you, Huh?

529
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,160
Well what happened? Well, after
about three minutes they ride.

530
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,283
They ride it

531
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,110
meaning what? Like they screamed or
through, they screamed. There was blood.

532
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,020
Old Ladies were hitting
each other with Keynes.

533
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,240
One lady on lady should've gotten
hit Stravinsky with a cane.

534
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,440
But once they started screaming,

535
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,500
Stravinsky ran backstage and
by some counselors crying,

536
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,310
Nijinsky was off on the side of the stage
screaming to his dancers to keep the

537
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:28,600
beat. Dude. Wow. Quite the fiasco.

538
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,450
And the question is why?

539
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,970
Well, this is the feeling question.

540
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,590
Why so much feeling about a piece
of music that, why did they arrive?

541
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:44,420
You would think that they ride it because
they were hot because they didn't like

542
00:34:44,421 --> 00:34:45,530
those towns because they did.

543
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,590
They thought those dancers were
making strange and odd gestures.

544
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,790
Lo Jonah offers a different
theory. Let me put it this way.

545
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:56,750
This ride has been talked about
and written about for forever.

546
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,940
But to the best of our knowledge,

547
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:03,941
no one has ever tried to explain what
happened that night through the lens of,

548
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:09,110
um, brain chemistry,
brain chemistry. Yeah.

549
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,470
What music can do to a brain. You know,

550
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,740
if you try to imagine yourself or
all you've heard is [inaudible]

551
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,600
even or, and, and the great
romanticism of 19th century user,

552
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,450
um, and then all of a sudden you get debt.

553
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,153
[inaudible].

554
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,850
These are noises you've
never heard before.

555
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,160
It's all very new, but scientists
are beginning. Figure out what

556
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,510
happens in our brain when we hear
noises we've never heard before,

557
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,850
especially dissonant noises,

558
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,810
refine that chords.

559
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:52,080
Musical chords that are
typically judged to be dissonant,

560
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:57,360
elicit these wild fluctuations in
brain activities is Yon Fishman.

561
00:35:57,361 --> 00:36:02,100
He is a neuroscientist and he studies
those wild fluctuations in the brain on an

562
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:04,050
area of the brain called
the auditory cortex.

563
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,190
Let's zoom in to the auditory cortex
for a moment because this is basically

564
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:12,240
hearing central and when
you're listening to music,

565
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,810
there are all kinds of neurons
during all kinds of things.

566
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,820
One gang in particular
that yarn is interested in.

567
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,540
That's right.

568
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,440
The gang that he suspects gets very
agitated when it hears sounds like these

569
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:31,120
[inaudible].

570
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,120
These neurons might be the new noise
department because he thinks their job is

571
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:41,650
to take every new strange unordered
unpredictable noise that comes into the

572
00:36:41,651 --> 00:36:46,290
brain. Figure it out, find the pattern.

573
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,320
There are groups of neurons
whose sole job it is.

574
00:36:49,321 --> 00:36:52,740
This is how Jonah puts it to turn
that dissonant note, dissect it,

575
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,020
take it apart and try to understand it.

576
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:59,670
We are pattern searching animals
and this is how Yon Fishman puts it.

577
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,710
And so at the level of
the auditory Cortex,

578
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:06,950
the brain has this daunting task of
having to be able to disentangle this

579
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,850
complex mixture of sound.

580
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:15,290
Most of the time those neurons
in the auditory cortex succeed

581
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,773
in finding the pattern.

582
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:28,100
But every so often, and maybe
this was the case that night

583
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:37,690
[inaudible]

584
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,970
okay, so Robert, imagine
inside the brains,

585
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,260
inside the heads of the people in the
audience listening to the right of spring

586
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,140
that night where all
of these neurons, yeah,

587
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:51,640
I can hear them trying to make
sense of the new sounds in failing,

588
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,190
not just feeling once or twice, but
over and over and over and over.

589
00:37:58,191 --> 00:38:01,810
The rite of spring keeps being dissonant
all the way through so they can never

590
00:38:01,811 --> 00:38:05,320
get any rest. And when those
neurons fail repeatedly,

591
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,080
there are consequences.
Chemical consequences.

592
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,280
What happens is our neurons squirt out
a bit of dopamine and what does the

593
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:15,670
dopamine do? Well dope mean,
makes us feel a little dopamine.

594
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:19,930
Makes you feel happy. That's why sex
and drugs make you feel euphoric,

595
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,873
but a little too much.

596
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,200
And that euphoria turns into literally
a schizophrenia. Really? Yes.

597
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,680
I don't want to oversimplify a
schizophrenia in any way, shape, or form,

598
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,130
but some of our most effective
treatments for work by

599
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,250
suppressing dopamine release in the brain.
So there's some kind of relationship.

600
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:42,790
Too much dopamine has been shown
clinically to make people feel crazy. Yes.

601
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,950
Maybe that's what happened that night.
On May 29th, 1913 music erupted.

602
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,430
Neurons revolted, right?
Dopamine flooded through.

603
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:55,500
This is to their brains and
people went mad. Literally Mad.

604
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:00,010
Let's go to the second night in our
story. The piece does come back to Paris,

605
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:04,540
right? Yes. How much later after the
riot? Uh, it's from May to March.

606
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,060
Actually it was April. So
it's almost a year later. Yes.

607
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,770
And this time it doesn't
come with the ballet.

608
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,610
This time it's just being performed
as a work of music. So do,

609
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,370
does anyone buy tickets? Oh yeah.
It's, it's, it's, it's gonna sell out.

610
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,780
They do cause a few nights of violent
riots. Can you shut up the situation?

611
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:22,460
Now the audience is at a
different audience. Uh,

612
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,880
I actually don't know if
the audience is different,

613
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:27,820
but we can at least say that the audience
is coming to it with a different set

614
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:30,550
of information. Exactly.
They've, they've been warned

615
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:33,460
[inaudible]

616
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,420
so for the first time they can actually
sit back and really try to pay attention

617
00:39:37,421 --> 00:39:41,160
to the notes by being willing to listen.

618
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,390
They could hear the orders and patterns
that students get hidden in this work.

619
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,810
They were able to hear the music

620
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,560
and find the orders hidden
underneath this noise.

621
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:02,400
Was there a riot this time? The second
round? Oh No. Quite the opposite.

622
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,730
Stravinsky was a hero. They carried
them out on their shoulders.

623
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,540
Really? Literally he was,
he was literally, he was
carried on the shoulders and,

624
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:16,620
and, and the press was glowing
in one year, in one year.

625
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,460
And just one year Stravinsky
had gone from villainous monster

626
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:28,150
to hipster icon to the extent that
police had to escort him from the concert

627
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:30,570
hall to keep them safe from adoring fans.

628
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,920
And that was just the
beginning. The the third story,

629
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:38,430
if you wanted to tell a third story
would be it became children's music.

630
00:40:38,431 --> 00:40:43,290
It became Disney music in 1940 27 years
after Stravinsky caused a violent and

631
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:44,250
bloody riot.

632
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:49,410
He was negotiating with Mickey Mouse
over the rights to use his music and

633
00:40:49,411 --> 00:40:53,640
Fantasia, which fantasia just starting
a hippopotamus and a little too to know.

634
00:40:53,641 --> 00:40:55,800
Is that the one? Is it
the mushroom stone? Yeah,

635
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:58,410
I think it's the mushrooms isn't
mushrooms. Actually we looked it up later.

636
00:40:58,411 --> 00:41:01,590
It was a the part with the
dinosaurs. So how does this happen?

637
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:06,591
How do you go so quickly from being the
most outrageous thing that literally

638
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:10,710
maddens people to a
triumph to kid's music?

639
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,780
Yes. I mean the rite of spring is perfect
evidence of the brain's astonishing

640
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:18,450
plasticity. See, this is the
really cool part of it for me.

641
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,660
If you remember just one bit of science
from this whole thing, remember this a,

642
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:26,820
those neurons we met earlier, the one
that, the little voices, I liked him.

643
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,150
It turns out those neurons learn

644
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,240
and they learn fast

645
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,780
because they're actually part of a
larger network of brain cells with a very

646
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:41,270
technical name called the
Cortico fugal network.

647
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,210
And what this network does is
it's always sort of monitoring,

648
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:49,211
listening to the sounds that are coming
into the brain and tuning those neurons

649
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,200
to better hear those sounds.

650
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,420
Trying to get the station on the
radio just to getting it just right.

651
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:58,520
[inaudible]

652
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,470
so our neurons literally adjust.

653
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,470
Literally we're talking then
biochemical engineering sense.

654
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:08,590
So if on that first night you just hear
the right as pure noise all the way

655
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:11,360
through from beginning to
end. If you're listening,

656
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,420
if you're letting your cortical
fugal network do its job,

657
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:19,730
it can actually resculpt your brain and
let you hear the patterns better as a

658
00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:20,690
symphony evolves.

659
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,200
Is it fair to say that this is a sort
of tug of war that an artist comes,

660
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:32,590
create something that is
new and unpredictable and
strange and maybe noise ish

661
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:40,240
at first hearing and the
artist is thrilled to be
new in that way and then the

662
00:42:42,381 --> 00:42:46,670
brain ruins it all slowly but
surely by making it familiar.

663
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:48,740
And whether the brain a pours the new,

664
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,410
the brain constantly wants to assimilate
every experience we've ever had into

665
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,560
every other experience.

666
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:59,730
And I think Stravinsky realized it was
the purpose of the artist to challenge a

667
00:42:59,731 --> 00:43:04,670
brain, to break the brain out
of its conservative cycle.

668
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:10,190
The astonishing thing to me is here you
have an artist like Igor Stravinsky who

669
00:43:10,191 --> 00:43:14,690
comes to town intentionally trying to
get people to sit in their seats and

670
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:16,490
really listen to music.

671
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,120
And the strategy he chooses
is instead of pleasing them,

672
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:24,410
he wants to put them in a little bit
of discomfort or real pain even. Right?

673
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,740
And indeed they not only listen,
they riot, but within a year,

674
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:32,180
and this is the sad part to me,
within a year it's easier to hear.

675
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:33,470
Suddenly it's pleasant.

676
00:43:33,471 --> 00:43:38,240
Suddenly they like it and suddenly you
s driven ski is robbed of his newness.

677
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:41,000
Why is that sad for you? Well,
because it's kind of, I don't know.

678
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:45,120
I never thought of the brain as the
enemy of the artists before with Mia.

679
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,510
But I can give you a different
interpretation on this. I mean,

680
00:43:47,511 --> 00:43:51,560
here comes a guy who offers
up the most dissonant,

681
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:56,510
stabbing, percussive, painful music
to anyone had heard to that point.

682
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,010
And we learned to love him.

683
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:02,400
But because of that make you sort
of feel like pride. No, I know.

684
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,250
I mean like our brains
can decode anything.

685
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:07,880
We learned to love it only
because it's well-made. Yeah.

686
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:11,030
But just random car honks. I don't
think you could really appreciate that.

687
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:14,870
I disagree. Or you think it
would be like just having,

688
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,210
have you heard the music that
was written after Stravinsky?

689
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:20,760
Okay.

690
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,430
It's even worse than
what you just did. Yeah.

691
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,980
But my brain has never accommodated
that. But some people love that stuff.

692
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:31,170
And my only point is that if there,
if there are these like fixed poles,

693
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,160
our ear

694
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,550
between continents and dissonance, which
is how we started this whole thing,

695
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:40,830
and now we end up learning that our
brains can override that to such an

696
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:45,780
astonishing degree.
Well then culture wins.

697
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,800
Culture beats biology. But to me it's sad.

698
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,020
Sad for the artist. It's not sad for us.

699
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,173
Hmm.

700
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:00,250
It's sorta like the artists and the
brains are that kind of eternal struggle.

701
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:02,043
[inaudible]

702

and I will continue in a moment.

706
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,450
You're listening to radio

707
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,390
from New York public radio.

708
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,250
NPR.

709
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:41,773
Okay.

710
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,900
This is Radiolab. I'm Jad
Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

711
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:44,490
Today I program's about music.

712
00:46:44,491 --> 00:46:49,230
We ended our last segment with a look
back at a very famous riot in 1913 and a

713
00:46:49,231 --> 00:46:51,150
composer, Igor Stravinsky,

714
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:56,450
whose primary objective was to create
something new and dissonant and

715
00:46:57,661 --> 00:47:02,280
disturbing. Right now
we'll present the opposite,

716
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:06,950
the off the unscrew the head tie,
Stravinsky, in a way. What we mean is he,

717
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,650
we're going to introduce you to
a guy who has invented a new,

718
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:16,010
radically innovative and ingenious
way of creating something old.

719
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:22,560
His name is David Cope.

720
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:27,590
He works and teaches composition at UC
Santa Cruz in California and recently our

721
00:47:28,381 --> 00:47:32,410
producer Ellen was in the area
and it is a beautiful area. It's,

722
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:36,670
it's 22.5 miles. Well, and she
paid him to visit extraordinary.

723
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:39,010
And they're like birds. We've
got a, we've got, you know,

724
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:42,430
I have nest in each window, each
here. Sure. And this one's over here.

725
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:47,020
You can take a look again, like come
back in. It's okay. It's just me.

726
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:50,950
Come on kid back in your
nest. Um, she's usually,

727
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,520
she'll just hop right back in
when she hears me talk. You're,

728
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:57,790
aren't you going to listen to me? Oh,

729
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:01,120
this was beside the point because we'd
actually come to talk to David Cope,

730
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,620
not about nature, but actually about
something unnatural that he'd done,

731
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,630
which started about 20 years ago,

732
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,410
the 1980, I had a,

733
00:48:09,411 --> 00:48:13,190
a commission for an opera
which involved actual money,

734
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:16,310
which we had been given up
front. And which by the way,

735
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:19,330
since I had four small children,
I had already spent and uh,

736
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:22,730
for the first time in my life,
uh, I suffered a composer's block.

737
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,340
It was like somebody just shot me or your,

738
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,330
I should be at the height of my creative
power and I can't find a reason to

739
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:35,950
compose. A first note is c sharp
started no more interesting.

740
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:40,510
You'd see natural or d and notes
just didn't make any sense to me.

741
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:45,900
I was really lost. I can't
think of anything worse

742
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,480
cause it's not my profession,

743
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:50,413
it's what I am.

744
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:56,420
A short time later, David Cope Party

745
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,140
and he finds himself talking to a guy who
programs computer and he was asking me

746
00:49:00,141 --> 00:49:02,990
how things were going and I just simply
said, ah, you know, it's a nightmare.

747
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,090
And we talked through it, you know, and I,

748
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,920
I think I must've initiated it by saying,

749
00:49:06,921 --> 00:49:08,960
are there any intelligent
programs out there that could,

750
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:12,260
I could possibly use to help
me through this? And he said,

751
00:49:12,261 --> 00:49:15,620
well there aren't any intelligent
programs period. But he said,

752
00:49:15,621 --> 00:49:19,250
you don't really need one, don't you
really just need some kind of a foil.

753
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:20,383
He called it that.

754
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,030
And I, I really had an epiphany.

755
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:31,060
What I would do is build not
so much composing engine,
but an analytical engine,

756
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:36,110
a computer. It took them years to
build. And that's it. This is, this is,

757
00:49:36,111 --> 00:49:40,310
this is Amy right here. This is this
Emmy is the computer's name, spelled e.

758
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:41,420
M. I. M.

759
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:45,740
E is an acronym for experiments in musical
intelligence and what he built me to

760
00:49:45,741 --> 00:49:48,740
do is analyze things. This
is specifically notes,

761
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:53,690
treat notes like data. In other words,
he'll feed me a bunch of sheet music.

762
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,190
For example, buck, Krells,

763
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,980
any will then convert every single
note on the page into numbers. Right.

764
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:04,440
Can you describe what you
see on the screen? Well,

765
00:50:04,441 --> 00:50:05,670
there's thousands and
thousands of numbers.

766
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,940
There are five numbers for each note
numbers which represent all kinds of

767
00:50:08,941 --> 00:50:13,410
things. The on time, the pitch,
the duration corral becomes a huge,

768
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:17,250
massive information. Which Emmy then
sorts through looking for patterns.

769
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:22,680
Note four 50 always seems to be falling
by note four 56 loud and then soft.

770
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:26,760
She will find the patterns. Every composer
has them, the little things they do,

771
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:27,980
the DNA of

772
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,813
the individual

773
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,560
now finding all the patterns,

774
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:36,450
mapping the creative DNA of a
composer is in and of itself.

775
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,770
Not all that interesting. It's what
happens next, which is the spooky part.

776
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,540
Cope hits a few buttons and all
the DNA starts to recombine.

777
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,200
Ghosts stir in the machine,

778
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:52,583
any molar,

779
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:58,023
any Beethoven,

780
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:03,570
[inaudible],

781
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:04,403
Ethan Scott, chaplain

782
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,430
[inaudible],

783
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,210
and of course his favorite Bach of course.

784
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:14,690
Then I became very excited about this
prospect and immediately put in some coke

785
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:18,150
and sure enough my opera,
which had taken ion. No,

786
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:22,090
by the time I was putting in the Copa,
it was maybe five years and past. Uh,

787
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:24,650
the opera was written in about 10 days.

788
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,430
So as a demonstration,

789
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,690
I'm going to play for you the f the
opening of the corral that was composed in

790
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:37,380
1987, uh, in the style of Bach.

791
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,810
And one of the first ones that
came out of the program. Now,

792
00:51:39,811 --> 00:51:43,230
this corral was so bad, it sounded to
me when I first heard it that I, I,

793
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:47,130
I threw it away at Britain, the
trashcan. And then I said, well,

794
00:51:47,131 --> 00:51:50,150
there's something about that that I
kind of like and I pulled it out again.

795
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:51,300
I thank God I did because this is my,

796
00:51:51,301 --> 00:51:53,370
one of my favorite pieces
the program ever produced.

797
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,520
So here's what it sounds
like as a machine, but plant

798
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,750
[inaudible] just a huge
rigidity of machine,

799
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:10,170
like n****r of the meter being processed
and all the notes being processed in

800
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,020
precisely the right time with
these timbers this mornings,

801
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:19,280
which are egregious. I mean,
they're just terrible. [inaudible]

802
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:25,550
now I'm going to play for you the same
corral as performed by a group of singers

803
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:27,960
a while later.

804
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:46,740
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

805
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:50,040
same piece of music. Incredibly human,

806
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:55,580
personally musical going someplace
intriguing. I want to hear more.

807
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,850
The second one. I'm glad I turned
off the first one. One idea.

808
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:01,023
Oh,

809
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:08,303
[inaudible].

810
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,110
Yes sir. Yes. Oh, the number
of negative reactions is far,

811
00:53:13,111 --> 00:53:17,640
far outnumber the positive reactions.
Remember recall one in particular?

812
00:53:17,641 --> 00:53:22,320
One that Oh yeah, it was at a conference
in Germany in which, uh, colleague,

813
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,760
uh, he hit me in the
nose, his finger. I'm a,

814
00:53:26,761 --> 00:53:29,670
I'm pretty much a coward physically.
Yeah. You know, he was bigger than I,

815
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:33,240
so it was, it was a quite a
moment, but there have been many,

816
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:37,020
many occasions, you
know, shouting matches.

817
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,730
If you've spent a good portion
of your life being in love with,

818
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,550
you know, these dead composers.
I mean, that sounds horrible,

819
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:45,240
but you know what I mean?

820
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:50,240
And along comes some Twerp who claims
to have this little piece of software

821
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:55,920
would use, isn't in much at all that
can, can, can move you in the same way.

822
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:58,290
Suddenly you're saying to yourself, yeah,

823
00:53:58,510 --> 00:53:59,343
Whoa,

824
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:03,320
what's happened here? Certainly my, my,

825
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:06,230
my relationship to the original pieces
of music is cheapened in some way.

826
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,280
I mean,

827
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,090
what is Chopin really just nothing more
than a bunch of cliches thrown together.

828
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:15,770
[inaudible]

829
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:20,690
I hurt with them in a way
and when they hurt, um,

830
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:22,790
I feel successful

831
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:29,130
and I also feel very bad. I mean,

832
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:33,690
I'm missing with some pretty powerful
relationships here and doing so in a

833
00:54:33,691 --> 00:54:37,800
mechanical way. If I had done
it myself as a human being,

834
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:42,600
these individuals could probably live
with it because after all, they could say,

835
00:54:42,601 --> 00:54:44,430
well, you know, he's just really
good at that sort of thing.

836
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:47,700
But somehow using hell, you know,

837
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:51,870
or some version of how
is the ultimate insult.

838
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:55,620
There is nothing intelligent
about my program in this lightest.

839
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:57,750
Nothing intelligent about it.

840
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,810
I could do everything it
did if you gave me 10 years.

841
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:05,560
I just don't have that amount of
time. I'd rather spend five minutes.

842
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:06,580
Thank you very much.

843
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:09,520
[inaudible]

844
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,500
we did a concert here at Bach,

845
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:16,570
at Emmy Bach and the
Middle Moon is just a dorm.

846
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,760
I mean it's just lovely. And,

847
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:23,050
and a friend of mine was sitting in
the back of the hall next to an ancient

848
00:55:23,051 --> 00:55:23,321
lady.

849
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:27,990
She must've been in her eighties late
eighties and she couldn't read very well.

850
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,160
So she hadn't read the program.

851
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:32,880
[inaudible] she really just was at this
concert because friends told her she

852
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,530
didn't know what was all
about or anything like that.

853
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:37,750
But she knew all about music
and she loves it. Bach and,

854
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,280
and she listened to that

855
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:50,403
[inaudible]

856
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,820
and she turned to my friend and said,

857
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,293
oh,

858
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:58,930
that was just beautiful. And
my friends started to say,

859
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:02,960
but do you know that it
was? And then he said,

860
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:06,230
well, the hell with that.

861
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:09,780
[inaudible]

862
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:13,380
it was the reaction that I hope people
will have a hundred years from now. If,

863
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,440
if by some weird fluke this stuff hangs
around long enough to still be around

864
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,660
them. Um,

865
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:24,020
but I hope we can put aside all
this machine trapping the stuff

866
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,430
and, and really just deal
with the music itself.

867
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:38,400
Piece was produced by Jonathan Mitchell
and recorded by our producer Ellen Horn.

868
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:42,600
David Cope composes and teaches
at UC Santa Cruz in California.

869
00:56:42,601 --> 00:56:47,340
If you'd like to hear any
more compositions by his
computer Emmy and there are

870
00:56:47,341 --> 00:56:51,990
hundreds you can visit our
website, radiolab.org there
you will find Emmy Bach,

871
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:56,430
Amy Chapin, Emmy Scott Joplin,
even Emmy Navajo music.

872
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:02,070
And the scary part is that much of it
as quite good Emmy Navajo music. Yeah.

873
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:05,070
Um, I guess we should
sign off, right? Yes.

874
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,280
I'm just still thinking about Emmy
Navajo music acts. You know what?

875
00:57:08,281 --> 00:57:09,870
Let's let Emmy take us out.

876
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:16,830
This is actually a your favorite
composer as re animated by Emmy,

877
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:20,350
the Computer Mahler, Emmy Mahler.

878
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:29,590
Oh Damn. You know, this is, it's
very troubling. This is very chaplain
