[Background wind noise]
MALE &gt;&gt; So let's answer the question if the

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.859
environment is going to lose
out to the economy in 2009. My answer is very

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:16.680
simple. It's a clear
"yes." The environment has always lost to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.090
the economy and 2009-it's not
going to be an exception.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.120
FEMALE &gt;&gt; First of all we must recognize that
the environment is a part

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.529
of our global economy and should not be considered
as a separate entity.

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.760
MALE 2 &gt;&gt; This is a bit of a strange question
because the economy is

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.640
just the amount of trading going on. If you
look at GDP, that's the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.450
product of everything bought and sold. Lots
of trading, GDP goes up,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.280
less trading, GDP goes down. So there never
really was a clash between

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.920
the environment and the economy. It just depends
on what's being traded.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.190
Trade in environmentally friendly economic
goods, boost economic growth.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.900
Also, environmental issues will still be around
in ten years but the

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.920
recession won't be. The long term profits
are in environmental jobs and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.489
the smart business people will see that.

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.350
MALE 3 &gt;&gt; There is hope, but for that hope
we've got to correct critical

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.390
imbalance that we've got in our economies
and that we've had long before

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.940
the credit crunch. It's been getting worse
over time and now more than

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.780
ever it's so critical to correct it.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.970
MALE 4 &gt;&gt; If you're looking the problem straight
in the eye, it's not

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.080
cars or light bulbs, furnaces or air conditioners,
it's not coal miners,

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.280
oil executives or the tar sands. The main
problem is what I'm doing right

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.640
now [zoom to gasoline hose nozzle in vehicle],
freely and lawfully. I'm

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.369
using fossil fuels for energy.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.590
MALE 5 AT CHALKBOARD &gt;&gt; So there you have
it. When you take the world

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.530
economic forum and you add in healthy ecology
and you take away the flow

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.080
of oil and coal, what you're left with is
a healthy environment and a

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.659
healthy economy. And I think the answer to
this equation is what all

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.920
world economists need to include if they're
going to make sure that they

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.350
have a healthy economy and a healthy environment
in 2009.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.250
They need to include youth in their discussions
and furthermore, they

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.660
need to support hydrogen based technologies
and help us build the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.660
hydrogen economy.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.120
MALE 6 &gt;&gt; Time is obviously not on our side.
We need to wake up and

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.120
smell the methane.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.140
[Background music] MALE 7 &gt;&gt; The time to act
is now for socially

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.430
responsible investments that can create green
cities, clean industries

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.189
and sustainable agrable forest based economies.
We can plant the seeds

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.509
of hope for a sustainable future for us all.
