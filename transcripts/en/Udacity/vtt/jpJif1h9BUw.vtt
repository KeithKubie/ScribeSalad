00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Remember when one is computing the closure, you look for the red dot

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
right in front of a nonterminal light key.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Oh! We found one, this is super convenient.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
When you go back to the grammar and look for every rule that starts with "E"

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and you put a red dot right at the beginning of it,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so we're expecting "E" goes to dot this, "E" goes to dot that, and "E" goes to dot end.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And you put from the current state, state 2.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So here, "E" goes to end becomes "E" goes to dot end from 2, that looks really good.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Here's "E" times "E". Here's dot "E" times "E" from 2. That looks really good.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Dot "E" times "E" from 0, this is not correct, so put in chart state 2,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
because it has forgotten about the previous 2 characters we've seen,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and then over here, "E" goes to dot divided by "E".

00:00:43.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This looks good. The other 3 were distractors.
