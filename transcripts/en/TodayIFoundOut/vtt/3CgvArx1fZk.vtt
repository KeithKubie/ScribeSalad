00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:17.610
In 1809, Captain Robert Barclay Allardice
made a bet with one of his pedestrian rivals,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:25.200
Sir James Webster-Wedderburn, that he could
walk 1,000 miles (about 1,609 kilometers)

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.980
in 1,000 hours.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.980
The wager?

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.030
1,000 guineas.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.929
To get around the major problem of needing
to rest, Barclay figured if he walked back

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:38.649
to back miles–a mile at the end of one hour
and another at the beginning of the next–and

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.620
repeated this strategy throughout the race,
he would be able to rest in approximately

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.510
90 minute intervals throughout the near 42
day long race.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.260
It worked.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.989
He completed the walk on July 12, 1809, 42
days after it commenced.

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.239
The 1,000 miles in 1,000 hours walking feat
became widely known as the “Barclay Match”.

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.030
While any sort of race involving simply walking
at a leisurely pace may sound easy, walking

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.100
1,000 miles in 1,000 consecutive hours is
anything but.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.200
Beyond the physical toll on the body, the
lack of consistent prolonged sleep over a

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.619
six-week period and the lack of doing anything
but walk around in circles takes a major mental

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.619
toll.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.390
After Barclay, many pedestrians attempted
the same feat of feet and failed, but it wasn’t

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.710
until a female Australian attempted the Barclay
Match and failed that the opportunity unfolded

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.979
for another women to make history.

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.280
Due to the ideology of this era that women
were extremely frail, they were strongly urged

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.740
(and sometimes forced) to not partake in strenuous
activity such as sporting competitions.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.729
For instance, 17 year old Yankee minor leaguer
Jackie Mitchell once struck out Babe Ruth

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.409
and Lou Gehrig back to back on just seven
pitches, five of them of the swing and miss

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.299
variety; the next day, she was banned from
major and minor league baseball by commissioner

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.630
Kenesaw Mountain Landis who stated his reason
for doing so was because baseball was “too

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.630
strenuous” for women.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.030
(This purported frailty hadn’t stopped Lizzie
“The Queen of Baseball” Murphy from enjoying

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.400
an extremely lucrative 23 year career as a
professional baseball player, during which

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.640
she became the first person, man or woman,
to play for both the National League and American

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.070
League All Star teams.)

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.170
In any event, long before the Queen of Baseball
was making a laughingstock of the idea of

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.720
women being too “delicate” to play sports,
in 1864, Emma Sharp heard about the aforementioned

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.220
Australian woman’s failed attempt at the
Barclay Match.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.730
Mrs. Sharp, who was then in her early thirties,
subsequently declared to her husband, John,

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.480
that she thought she could do it.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.170
John was reportedly not so enthusiastic, stating
that walking 1,000 miles was hardly an appropriate

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.290
task for a woman to undertake.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.580
Undeterred and despite that she’d not actually
trained for the event at all, Emma proceeded

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.230
with her conviction and started making plans
for the event.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.360
She was fortunate enough to enlist the help
of the landlord of the Quarry Gap Hotel, at

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.810
Laisterdyke, England, who enthusiastically
offered up the grounds attached to his hotel

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.480
as the location of the course.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.830
In exchange, he would receive a percentage
of the money earned from ticket sales, and

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.880
no doubt do great business from all the spectators.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.510
While the fact that anyone would pay to see
someone walking around in circles for days

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.810
on end may seem strange to us, at the time,
competitive walking, or pedestrianism, was

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.200
one of the most popular spectator sports in
the Western world, with certain matches drawing

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.630
tens of thousands of spectators.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.270
Yes, before the internet and TV, our forebears
found watching people walk in circles for

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.470
hours on end an ideal excuse to get together
and socialize, in some respects not too dissimilar

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.680
from NASCAR, but without the occasional flaming
crashes.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.740
As for Sharp’s walk, it was likely to draw
bigger crowds than most given that she was

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.480
a woman attempting a physical feat that most
of her compatriots of the male persuasion

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.590
couldn’t do.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.850
To make the whole thing even more scandalous
in the eyes of contemporaries, Emma decided

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.250
to dress like a man for the event, a sensible
choice given the typical garb of Victorian

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.770
era women.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:07.390
And so it was that on September 17, 1864,
Emma Sharp took the first step of her 1,000

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.390
mile venture.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.980
She took the same approach as Captain Barclay
by walking a roped off course of 120 yards

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.760
for 30 minutes at a time, which was equivalent
to about two miles, before taking a 90-minute

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.760
break.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.520
She would continue this routine for six weeks
straight, walking day and night, until she

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.470
completed her last mile.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.730
As expected, since no woman had ever successfully
completed this journey, and few men, Emma’s

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.600
progress was widely reported in the newspapers
and watched closely by supporters and critics

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.440
alike, with tens of thousands of people turning
up at various times to watch her put one foot

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.920
in front of the other again and again.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.780
As was popular with all such pedestrian events,
many started making bets as to whether or

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.820
not she would actually be able to finish.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.890
With the odds heavily against her at first,
as the days wore on and it began to look like

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.670
she might actually do it, malicious attempts
to thwart her progress began.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.580
Beyond near constant jeering to break her
spirit, about a week before she was scheduled

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.720
to finish the 1,000 miles, unidentified individuals
attacked her with chloroform to rough her

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.560
up a bit, hoping this would inspire her to
quit.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.560
She didn’t.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.260
Others threw burning embers in her path, some
tried to drug her food, and still others simply

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.190
resorted to trying to trip her at random times.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.850
As things escalated, for her protection, eighteen
police officers disguised as working citizens

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.389
were assigned to her on the final days of
the race.

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.640
In addition to that, during the night, a helpful
citizen walked in front of her with a loaded

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.640
rifle.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.360
Emma also walked the final two days with a
pistol, which she had to fire in warning a

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.160
reported 27 times in total to ward off unruly
spectators.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.540
On October 29, 1864, at approximately 5:15
a.m., Emma Sharp became the first woman to

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.070
complete the Barclay Challenge.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.040
Despite the general belief that women were
too frail for such physical activity and despite

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.580
her complete lack of training, the only major
physical issue she experienced during the

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.830
walk was painfully swollen ankles in the early
going, but the problem ultimately went away

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.130
as the days went on.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.639
Over the course of the six straight weeks
she walked, it was estimated that a total

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:17.510
of over 100,000 people turned up at one point
or another, with about 25,000 being present

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.720
to watch her cross the finish line.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.380
Despite the fact that the locals celebrated
Emma’s success by organizing a band to play

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.930
on her final day and roasting an ox in her
honor, Emma’s husband reportedly hid in

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.630
the pub, embarrassed by his wife’s antics.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.360
He got over his shame pretty quickly, however,
using the substantial funds she earned from

00:06:34.360 --> 00:08:04.650
ticket sales to quit his job at the Bowling
Iron Works and open a rug making business.
