and Ian and me take a look at a number
 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.980
and Ian and me take a look at a number
of stopwatch and timer apps and gave

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990
of stopwatch and timer apps and gave
 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.420
of stopwatch and timer apps and gave
their opinions on what they liked what

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430
their opinions on what they liked what
 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.230
their opinions on what they liked what
they were looking for in their

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240
they were looking for in their
 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.850
they were looking for in their
applications and what they didn't like

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860
applications and what they didn't like
 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.860
applications and what they didn't like
so the first application we're looking

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870
so the first application we're looking
 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.080
so the first application we're looking
at here is called hybrid stopwatch in

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090
at here is called hybrid stopwatch in
 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.230

in and Rito's favorite applications they

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450
in and Rito's favorite applications they
 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.510
in and Rito's favorite applications they
enjoyed the functionality and the design

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520
enjoyed the functionality and the design
 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.070

and the big feature graphic on their

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080
and the big feature graphic on their
 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.180
and the big feature graphic on their
market page so what we've done here is

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190
market page so what we've done here is
 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.130
market page so what we've done here is
we've taken a look at it and said yeah

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140
we've taken a look at it and said yeah
 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.090
we've taken a look at it and said yeah
it's got some pretty good functionality

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100
it's got some pretty good functionality
 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.470
it's got some pretty good functionality
but there's a few ways which we would

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480
but there's a few ways which we would
 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.390
but there's a few ways which we would
like to see Android design applied to it

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400
like to see Android design applied to it
 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.520
like to see Android design applied to it
and they're taking a quick look at the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530
and they're taking a quick look at the
 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.590
and they're taking a quick look at the
screenshot here you can see the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600
screenshot here you can see the
 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.450
screenshot here you can see the
stopwatch page which lets you start the

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460
stopwatch page which lets you start the
 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.430
stopwatch page which lets you start the
stopwatch using the big red button in

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440
stopwatch using the big red button in

laps and resets and it gives you that
 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.550
laps and resets and it gives you that
time up at the top and it shows you your

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560
time up at the top and it shows you your
 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.620
time up at the top and it shows you your
latest lap time in the orange bar just

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630

recognize it you have to be aware that

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080
recognize it you have to be aware that
 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.750
recognize it you have to be aware that
when you use this kind of design it's

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760
when you use this kind of design it's
 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.550
when you use this kind of design it's
also going to bring across people and

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560
also going to bring across people and
 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.070
also going to bring across people and

you know if you have a book application

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739
you know if you have a book application
 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.920
you know if you have a book application
that looks just like a book you know a

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930
that looks just like a book you know a
 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.600
that looks just like a book you know a
real book you can't really just copy the

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610
real book you can't really just copy the
 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.910
real book you can't really just copy the
page the text or you know do a Wikipedia

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920
page the text or you know do a Wikipedia
 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.640
page the text or you know do a Wikipedia
search for a certain word so those kind

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650
search for a certain word so those kind
 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.380
search for a certain word so those kind
of features might not become obvious or

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390
of features might not become obvious or
 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.820
of features might not become obvious or
might not sit very well with a design

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830
might not sit very well with a design
 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.000
might not sit very well with a design
which is really skeuomorphic so there's

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010
which is really skeuomorphic so there's
 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.440
which is really skeuomorphic so there's
pluses and minuses to this kind of

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450
pluses and minuses to this kind of
 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.300
pluses and minuses to this kind of
school of design it's also quite

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310
school of design it's also quite
 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.980
school of design it's also quite
associated with the iOS world and

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990
 
 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.050
 
another thing we notice is there's quite

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060
another thing we notice is there's quite
 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.490
another thing we notice is there's quite
a liberal use of gradients throughout

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500
a liberal use of gradients throughout
 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.170
a liberal use of gradients throughout
the application so every kind of like

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180
the application so every kind of like
 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.940
the application so every kind of like
bar and so on has this kind of like

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950
bar and so on has this kind of like
 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.310
bar and so on has this kind of like
textured gradient fuel which is doesn't

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320
textured gradient fuel which is doesn't
 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.990
textured gradient fuel which is doesn't
quite sit at home in the Android look

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000
quite sit at home in the Android look
 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.850
quite sit at home in the Android look
and feel the holo design philosophy

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860
and feel the holo design philosophy
 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.130
and feel the holo design philosophy
really and from a technical point of

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140
really and from a technical point of
 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.240
really and from a technical point of
view we've noticed that it's not

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250
view we've noticed that it's not
 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.980
view we've noticed that it's not
targeting the latest versions of Android

of the primary means of navigation so

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240
of the primary means of navigation so
 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.220
of the primary means of navigation so
this isn't really very advised not

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230
this isn't really very advised not
 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.990
this isn't really very advised not
everyone's going to look under the menu

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000
everyone's going to look under the menu
 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.250
everyone's going to look under the menu
button from the navigation they might

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260
button from the navigation they might
 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.420
button from the navigation they might
not even realize that there are other

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430
not even realize that there are other
 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.890
not even realize that there are other
features in the applications such as the

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900
features in the applications such as the
 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.820
features in the applications such as the
timer and some advanced preferences here

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830
timer and some advanced preferences here
 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.380
timer and some advanced preferences here
so what we really like to see them doing

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390
so what we really like to see them doing
 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.030
so what we really like to see them doing
is move towards the latest api's which

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040
is move towards the latest api's which
 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.680
is move towards the latest api's which
would be using an action bar to expose

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690
would be using an action bar to expose
 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.230
would be using an action bar to expose
these kind of functionality and

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240
these kind of functionality and
 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.040
these kind of functionality and
navigation controls on the screen also

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050
navigation controls on the screen also
 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.170
navigation controls on the screen also
if they target the latest api's they'd

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180
if they target the latest api's they'd
 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.510
if they target the latest api's they'd
benefit from the latest holo themes and

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520
benefit from the latest holo themes and
 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.450
benefit from the latest holo themes and
styles so things like the updated scroll

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460
styles so things like the updated scroll
 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.820
styles so things like the updated scroll
bar styles and new text fonts and so on

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830
bar styles and new text fonts and so on
 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.440
bar styles and new text fonts and so on
they would benefit from all this modern

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450
they would benefit from all this modern
 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.470
they would benefit from all this modern
look and feel I like that Adam you have

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480
look and feel I like that Adam you have
 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.330
look and feel I like that Adam you have
any other thoughts about the look and

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340
any other thoughts about the look and
 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.950
any other thoughts about the look and
feel of this the hybrid and stopwatch

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960
feel of this the hybrid and stopwatch
 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.290
feel of this the hybrid and stopwatch
and timer app yeah yeah so to me like

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300
and timer app yeah yeah so to me like
 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.330
and timer app yeah yeah so to me like
you know the actual stopwatch itself

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340
you know the actual stopwatch itself
 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.280
you know the actual stopwatch itself
looks quite nice as you say it's the

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290
looks quite nice as you say it's the
 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.480
looks quite nice as you say it's the
it's sort of mimic trying to mimic

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490
it's sort of mimic trying to mimic
 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.510
it's sort of mimic trying to mimic
real-world object but you know when they

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520
real-world object but you know when they
 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.790
real-world object but you know when they
go and actually show the lap times and

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800
go and actually show the lap times and
 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.290
go and actually show the lap times and
then they have to reuse those gradients

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300
then they have to reuse those gradients
 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.030
then they have to reuse those gradients
to really make it sort of look the same

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040
to really make it sort of look the same
 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.470
to really make it sort of look the same
as that's not watch that's when it's

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480
as that's not watch that's when it's
 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.330
as that's not watch that's when it's
sort of the design starts to fall apart

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340
sort of the design starts to fall apart
 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.910
sort of the design starts to fall apart
if you ask me it just doesn't look quite

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920
if you ask me it just doesn't look quite
 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.260
if you ask me it just doesn't look quite
as nice it doesn't really fit with the

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270
as nice it doesn't really fit with the
 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.140
as nice it doesn't really fit with the
Android system at that point so I mean

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150
Android system at that point so I mean
 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.640
Android system at that point so I mean
it's a choice every designer and

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650
it's a choice every designer and
 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.050
it's a choice every designer and
developer needs to make when they design

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060
developer needs to make when they design
 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.240
developer needs to make when they design
their app it's it's totally a valid

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250
their app it's it's totally a valid
 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.280
their app it's it's totally a valid
choice if you think it serves your users

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290
choice if you think it serves your users
 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.880
choice if you think it serves your users
better that way then that's totally fine

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.890
better that way then that's totally fine
 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.640
better that way then that's totally fine
so that's sort of the design piece of it

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650
so that's sort of the design piece of it
 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.310
so that's sort of the design piece of it
as far as sort of the navigation or sort

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320
as far as sort of the navigation or sort
 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.320
as far as sort of the navigation or sort
of getting around the application as you

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330
of getting around the application as you
 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.970
of getting around the application as you
said they're using the old style menus

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980
said they're using the old style menus
 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.510
said they're using the old style menus
and to me that's that's not like a sort

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520
and to me that's that's not like a sort
 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.000
and to me that's that's not like a sort
of visual designer side navigation in

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010
of visual designer side navigation in
 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.250
of visual designer side navigation in
this app is sort of very difficult it's

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260
this app is sort of very difficult it's
 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.659
this app is sort of very difficult it's
one of the reasons why the menu button

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669
one of the reasons why the menu button
 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.250
one of the reasons why the menu button
has sort of been deprecated now

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260
has sort of been deprecated now
 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.500
has sort of been deprecated now
it's sort of very difficult to find

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510
it's sort of very difficult to find
 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.300
it's sort of very difficult to find
those additional features in the

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310
those additional features in the
 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.150
those additional features in the
application and I think the guys

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160
application and I think the guys
 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.530
application and I think the guys
mentioned this in the app clinic on

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540
mentioned this in the app clinic on
 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.700
mentioned this in the app clinic on
Friday but you know not all devices have

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710
Friday but you know not all devices have
 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.850
Friday but you know not all devices have
soft on-screen buttons down the bottom

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860
soft on-screen buttons down the bottom
 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.510
soft on-screen buttons down the bottom
so for example the HTC One X device will

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520
so for example the HTC One X device will
 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.550
so for example the HTC One X device will
show that menu button sort of as a

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560
show that menu button sort of as a
 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.170
show that menu button sort of as a
horizontal button take out the entire

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180
horizontal button take out the entire
 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.690
horizontal button take out the entire
bottom portion of the screen so it's a

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:47.700
bottom portion of the screen so it's a
 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.070
bottom portion of the screen so it's a
instantly make sure your application

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080
instantly make sure your application
 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.940
instantly make sure your application
look kind of you know not up-to-date not

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:52.950
look kind of you know not up-to-date not
 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.620
look kind of you know not up-to-date not
using the latest Android API versions

the use of typography so this is
something we keep on going on about but

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:20.660
something we keep on going on about but
 

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.050
something we keep on going on about but
using different weights and colors of

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:23.060
using different weights and colors of
 

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.199
using different weights and colors of
typography to give structure and

00:10:26.199 --> 00:10:26.209
typography to give structure and
 

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:29.920
typography to give structure and
emphasis to the application so I found

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:29.930
emphasis to the application so I found
 

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.570
emphasis to the application so I found
in the old application so on the on the

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:31.580
in the old application so on the on the
 

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.940
in the old application so on the on the
left hand side all that's leading zero

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:33.950
left hand side all that's leading zero
 

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:34.420
left hand side all that's leading zero
digits

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:34.430
digits
 

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.579
digits
I find add noise so I find it harder to

00:10:36.579 --> 00:10:36.589
I find add noise so I find it harder to
 

00:10:36.589 --> 00:10:39.519
I find add noise so I find it harder to
read it and quickly understand the time

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:39.529
read it and quickly understand the time
 

00:10:39.529 --> 00:10:41.800
read it and quickly understand the time
whereas in the redesign using a

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:41.810
whereas in the redesign using a
 

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.540
whereas in the redesign using a
different color or weight of the font

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:43.550
different color or weight of the font
 

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.910
different color or weight of the font
you can really make the import

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920
you can really make the import
 

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.860
you can really make the import
the information stand out yes so for me

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:50.870
the information stand out yes so for me
 

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:54.460
the information stand out yes so for me
that's some of the major benefits one

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:54.470
that's some of the major benefits one
 

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.840
that's some of the major benefits one
thing to talk about is we've obviously

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:55.850
thing to talk about is we've obviously
 

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.910
thing to talk about is we've obviously
not included the app and the effort in

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920
not included the app and the effort in
 

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.310
not included the app and the effort in
the redesign which obviously helps it

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320
the redesign which obviously helps it
 

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.379
the redesign which obviously helps it
feel a bit cleaner but thinking about

00:11:02.379 --> 00:11:02.389
feel a bit cleaner but thinking about
 

00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:03.699
feel a bit cleaner but thinking about
that I was thinking you could easily

00:11:03.699 --> 00:11:03.709
that I was thinking you could easily
 

00:11:03.709 --> 00:11:05.740
that I was thinking you could easily
just include the advert when it's in the

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:05.750
just include the advert when it's in the
 

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.329
just include the advert when it's in the
non running mode so for example when

00:11:07.329 --> 00:11:07.339
non running mode so for example when
 

00:11:07.339 --> 00:11:08.379
non running mode so for example when
there you're actually using the

00:11:08.379 --> 00:11:08.389
there you're actually using the
 

00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:09.639
there you're actually using the
stopwatch and it's running you'd be able

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:09.649
stopwatch and it's running you'd be able
 

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:12.250
stopwatch and it's running you'd be able
to kind of clear that away and have a

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:12.260
to kind of clear that away and have a
 

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.230
to kind of clear that away and have a
very clean interface and they're kind of

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240
very clean interface and they're kind of
 

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.819
very clean interface and they're kind of
like downtime when you get between

00:11:15.819 --> 00:11:15.829
like downtime when you get between
 

00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:17.199
like downtime when you get between
actually running sub watches you could

00:11:17.199 --> 00:11:17.209
actually running sub watches you could
 

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:21.180
actually running sub watches you could
pop it in so if you go into the next

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:21.190
pop it in so if you go into the next
 

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.350
pop it in so if you go into the next
page as well we've taken a quick look at

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360
page as well we've taken a quick look at
 

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:30.449
page as well we've taken a quick look at
the the lap times as well here we go so

00:11:30.449 --> 00:11:30.459
the the lap times as well here we go so
 

00:11:30.459 --> 00:11:32.740
the the lap times as well here we go so
hromas them the same redesign applied

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:32.750
hromas them the same redesign applied
 

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.090
hromas them the same redesign applied
the same treatment to the second tap

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:34.100
the same treatment to the second tap
 

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.620
the same treatment to the second tap
here so here we can see rather than

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:35.630
here so here we can see rather than
 

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.740
here so here we can see rather than
using all these different gradients and

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:37.750
using all these different gradients and
 

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.120
using all these different gradients and
we've gone for a much flatter a holo

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:40.130
we've gone for a much flatter a holo
 

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.639
we've gone for a much flatter a holo
style again and really really cut down

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:42.649
style again and really really cut down
 

00:11:42.649 --> 00:11:44.199
style again and really really cut down
on all the chrome and just let the

00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:44.209
on all the chrome and just let the
 

00:11:44.209 --> 00:11:47.019
on all the chrome and just let the
content kind of stand out so one of my

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:47.029
content kind of stand out so one of my
 

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:48.610
content kind of stand out so one of my
favorite aspects this design is the use

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:48.620
favorite aspects this design is the use
 

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.220
favorite aspects this design is the use
of color so you can see here we've

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:51.230
of color so you can see here we've
 

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.319
of color so you can see here we've
picked out using green and red and to

00:11:53.319 --> 00:11:53.329
picked out using green and red and to
 

00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:55.210
picked out using green and red and to
show the fastest and slowest lap times

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:55.220
show the fastest and slowest lap times
 

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.030
show the fastest and slowest lap times
so instantly which you break away from

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.040
so instantly which you break away from
 

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.710
so instantly which you break away from
the kind of constraints of having all

00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720
the kind of constraints of having all
 

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.139
the kind of constraints of having all
these and all this chrome will the

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:02.149
these and all this chrome will the
 

00:12:02.149 --> 00:12:04.389
these and all this chrome will the
gradients surrounding the content it

00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399
gradients surrounding the content it
 

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:05.980
gradients surrounding the content it
lets you do more interesting things with

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:05.990
lets you do more interesting things with
 

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.880
lets you do more interesting things with
the content and let it kind of shine

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:08.890
the content and let it kind of shine
 

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:12.540
the content and let it kind of shine
yeah that's a report seven yeah so um

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:12.550
yeah that's a report seven yeah so um
 

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.470
yeah that's a report seven yeah so um
two other things I wanted to quickly

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480
two other things I wanted to quickly
 

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.780
two other things I wanted to quickly
mention one I really like the share

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:16.790
mention one I really like the share
 

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.139
mention one I really like the share
action directly in the action bar there

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:19.149
action directly in the action bar there
 

00:12:19.149 --> 00:12:21.819
action directly in the action bar there
so you can quickly share out you know

00:12:21.819 --> 00:12:21.829
so you can quickly share out you know
 

00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:24.130
so you can quickly share out you know
your lap times and whatnot I believe

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:24.140
your lap times and whatnot I believe
 

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.870
your lap times and whatnot I believe
before it was in okay there was no way

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880
before it was in okay there was no way
 

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.970
before it was in okay there was no way
to actually share before I guess using

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:30.980
to actually share before I guess using
 

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.120
to actually share before I guess using
the regular menu but that's a really

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.130
the regular menu but that's a really
 

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.160
the regular menu but that's a really
nice addition and the other thing is a

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:36.170
nice addition and the other thing is a
 

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.350
nice addition and the other thing is a
lot of people ask me about sort of I

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:38.360
lot of people ask me about sort of I
 

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.449
lot of people ask me about sort of I
guess second level navigation or how can

00:12:40.449 --> 00:12:40.459
guess second level navigation or how can
 

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:43.210
guess second level navigation or how can
I add a filter to my application to sort

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:43.220
I add a filter to my application to sort
 

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.790
I add a filter to my application to sort
of a list so for example in a movie

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800
of a list so for example in a movie
 

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.290
of a list so for example in a movie
application you might have top movies

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:47.300
application you might have top movies
 

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.240
application you might have top movies
and then you want to filter by genre but

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:49.250
and then you want to filter by genre but
 

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.460
and then you want to filter by genre but
you wanna have it all on the same screen

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:50.470
you wanna have it all on the same screen
 

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.269
you wanna have it all on the same screen
so what was added here is a secondary

00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:54.279
so what was added here is a secondary
 

00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:57.020
so what was added here is a secondary
spinner or drop down under

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:57.030
spinner or drop down under
 

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.630
spinner or drop down under
the action bar where you can choose lap

00:12:59.630 --> 00:12:59.640
the action bar where you can choose lap
 

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.360
the action bar where you can choose lap
time or total time and I think this is a

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:02.370
time or total time and I think this is a
 

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.300
time or total time and I think this is a
really nice way of sort of adding an

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:05.310
really nice way of sort of adding an
 

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.730
really nice way of sort of adding an
easy way to sort of change or filter the

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740
easy way to sort of change or filter the
 

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.190
easy way to sort of change or filter the
content on that particular screen it's

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.200
content on that particular screen it's
 

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.040
content on that particular screen it's
really clear that it falls underneath

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.050
really clear that it falls underneath
 

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.440
really clear that it falls underneath
the lap times on the right side you know

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:15.450
the lap times on the right side you know
 

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.080
the lap times on the right side you know
it doesn't apply to everything and it's

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:18.090
it doesn't apply to everything and it's
 

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.260
it doesn't apply to everything and it's
just a really easy way and visually

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:20.270
just a really easy way and visually
 

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.580
just a really easy way and visually
simple way to sort of know tell you sir

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:22.590
simple way to sort of know tell you sir
 

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.430
simple way to sort of know tell you sir
there's a way to change the the visuals

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440
there's a way to change the the visuals
 

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.980
there's a way to change the the visuals
on that particular screen the other

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:27.990
on that particular screen the other
 

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.690
on that particular screen the other
option which I've seen used which is

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:29.700
option which I've seen used which is
 

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.700
option which I've seen used which is
also a decent option is to actually put

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:31.710
also a decent option is to actually put
 

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.800
also a decent option is to actually put
something in the action bar which is

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:33.810
something in the action bar which is
 

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.540
something in the action bar which is
tied to the fragment that sort of sits

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:35.550
tied to the fragment that sort of sits
 

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.210
tied to the fragment that sort of sits
on that tab it could be like a little

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.220
on that tab it could be like a little
 

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.460
on that tab it could be like a little
filter icon or something and clicking

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:40.470
filter icon or something and clicking
 

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.320
filter icon or something and clicking
that with a game pull a little drop-down

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:42.330
that with a game pull a little drop-down
 

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.420
that with a game pull a little drop-down
which you could quickly use to change

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:44.430
which you could quickly use to change
 

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:49.040
which you could quickly use to change
something on that particular screen okay

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:49.050
something on that particular screen okay
 

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.610
something on that particular screen okay
I think also just having the the laps

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620
I think also just having the the laps
 

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.860
I think also just having the the laps
and the stopwatch on the same

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:53.870
and the stopwatch on the same
 

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.910
and the stopwatch on the same
hierarchical level of each other on

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920
hierarchical level of each other on
 

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.470
hierarchical level of each other on
separate tabs is great because you can

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480
separate tabs is great because you can
 

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.610
separate tabs is great because you can
also you have this stopwatch still

00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:58.620
also you have this stopwatch still
 

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.500
also you have this stopwatch still
running and switch over to have a quick

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:00.510
running and switch over to have a quick
 

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:01.760
running and switch over to have a quick
look at the lap times you've done and

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:01.770
look at the lap times you've done and
 

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:02.660
look at the lap times you've done and
switchbacks we are still running

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:02.670
switchbacks we are still running
 

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.580
switchbacks we are still running
stopwatch and it's much much more

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:04.590
stopwatch and it's much much more
 

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.350
stopwatch and it's much much more
apparent that these are siblings in the

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360
apparent that these are siblings in the
 

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.180
apparent that these are siblings in the
kind of hierarchy when there are tabs

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:08.190
kind of hierarchy when there are tabs
 

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.040
kind of hierarchy when there are tabs
rather than the old design when you're

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.050
rather than the old design when you're
 

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.540
rather than the old design when you're
perhaps having to go in and out of

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:11.550
perhaps having to go in and out of
 

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.210
perhaps having to go in and out of
different screens and you couldn't see

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:14.220
different screens and you couldn't see
 

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.410
different screens and you couldn't see
those two elements on screen at the same

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420
those two elements on screen at the same
 

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.540
those two elements on screen at the same
time so I could see your way of you

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:17.550
time so I could see your way of you
 

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.190
time so I could see your way of you
could perhaps decorate these stopwatch

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:19.200
could perhaps decorate these stopwatch
 

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.830
could perhaps decorate these stopwatch
icon and the redesign like make it glow

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:21.840
icon and the redesign like make it glow
 

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.260
icon and the redesign like make it glow
somehow have a different highlight state

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:24.270
somehow have a different highlight state
 

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.910
somehow have a different highlight state
to show that the stopwatch is still

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920
to show that the stopwatch is still
 

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.470
to show that the stopwatch is still
running or stopped you know indicate

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480
running or stopped you know indicate
 

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.270
running or stopped you know indicate
that at the same time because it's on

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:29.280
that at the same time because it's on
 

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.820
that at the same time because it's on
screen yeah that's an excellent point

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:31.830
screen yeah that's an excellent point
 

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.560

I guess one last thing I just want to

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:33.570
I guess one last thing I just want to
 

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.050
I guess one last thing I just want to
quickly mention was I think you kind of

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:36.060
quickly mention was I think you kind of
 

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.460
quickly mention was I think you kind of
mentioned this before bed sort of the

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:37.470
mentioned this before bed sort of the
 

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:38.990
mentioned this before bed sort of the
use of typography and also the font

lap time it's it's very small how much

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:45.630
lap time it's it's very small how much
 

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:46.910

padding around it it's kind of difficult

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920
padding around it it's kind of difficult
 

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.490
padding around it it's kind of difficult
to see where's in the redesign you know

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:49.500
to see where's in the redesign you know
 

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.050
to see where's in the redesign you know
you can very easily make out the lap

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060
you can very easily make out the lap
 

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.730
you can very easily make out the lap
time there and then the same on this

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:52.740
time there and then the same on this
 

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.760

the left side on the old design taking
 

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.710
the left side on the old design taking
up just three rows yet it's sort of hard

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720
up just three rows yet it's sort of hard
 

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.660
up just three rows yet it's sort of hard
to sort of read the text there's not a

it might be a case where you want to

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:10.019
it might be a case where you want to
 

00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:11.479
it might be a case where you want to
look at the data if you have analytics

00:15:11.479 --> 00:15:11.489
look at the data if you have analytics
 

00:15:11.489 --> 00:15:13.040
look at the data if you have analytics
in your application and see how many lap

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:13.050
in your application and see how many lap
 

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.139
in your application and see how many lap
times people often record and use that

00:15:15.139 --> 00:15:15.149
times people often record and use that
 

00:15:15.149 --> 00:15:16.609
times people often record and use that
kind of sizing information to inform

00:15:16.609 --> 00:15:16.619
kind of sizing information to inform
 

00:15:16.619 --> 00:15:18.739
kind of sizing information to inform
your decision I mean here we're kind of

00:15:18.739 --> 00:15:18.749
your decision I mean here we're kind of
 

00:15:18.749 --> 00:15:20.479
your decision I mean here we're kind of
making an assumption that five or six

00:15:20.479 --> 00:15:20.489
making an assumption that five or six
 

00:15:20.489 --> 00:15:22.579
making an assumption that five or six
lap times at most is going to be shown

00:15:22.579 --> 00:15:22.589
lap times at most is going to be shown
 

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:24.499
lap times at most is going to be shown
but else you might end up running out of

00:15:24.499 --> 00:15:24.509
but else you might end up running out of
 

00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:27.789
but else you might end up running out of
room but that's true that's a good point

00:15:27.789 --> 00:15:27.799
room but that's true that's a good point
 

00:15:27.799 --> 00:15:31.280
room but that's true that's a good point
um excellence so should we move along

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:31.290
um excellence so should we move along
 

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:38.530
um excellence so should we move along
here yeah so this next application is

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:38.540
here yeah so this next application is
 

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.239
here yeah so this next application is
called impetus and it's an interval

00:15:41.239 --> 00:15:41.249
called impetus and it's an interval
 

00:15:41.249 --> 00:15:43.910
called impetus and it's an interval
timer so it's an application for people

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920
timer so it's an application for people
 

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.699
timer so it's an application for people
doing workouts pretty much where you

00:15:46.699 --> 00:15:46.709
doing workouts pretty much where you
 

00:15:46.709 --> 00:15:48.559
doing workouts pretty much where you
want to do repeated intervals of a

00:15:48.559 --> 00:15:48.569
want to do repeated intervals of a
 

00:15:48.569 --> 00:15:50.869
want to do repeated intervals of a
workout so we're going to take a look at

00:15:50.869 --> 00:15:50.879
workout so we're going to take a look at
 

00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:51.979
workout so we're going to take a look at
one particular screen in this

00:15:51.979 --> 00:15:51.989
one particular screen in this
 

00:15:51.989 --> 00:15:54.350
one particular screen in this
application which is kind of the the

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360
application which is kind of the the
 

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.749
application which is kind of the the
edit screen which lets you set up one of

00:15:56.749 --> 00:15:56.759
edit screen which lets you set up one of
 

00:15:56.759 --> 00:15:59.780
edit screen which lets you set up one of
these interval sessions so taking a look

00:15:59.780 --> 00:15:59.790
these interval sessions so taking a look
 

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:01.579
these interval sessions so taking a look
here on the screen on the left you can

00:16:01.579 --> 00:16:01.589
here on the screen on the left you can
 

00:16:01.589 --> 00:16:04.699
here on the screen on the left you can
see we're in an edit tab for editing a

00:16:04.699 --> 00:16:04.709
see we're in an edit tab for editing a
 

00:16:04.709 --> 00:16:08.119
see we're in an edit tab for editing a
particular setup and it lets you enter a

00:16:08.119 --> 00:16:08.129
particular setup and it lets you enter a
 

00:16:08.129 --> 00:16:10.910
particular setup and it lets you enter a
period of prep before your interval

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920
period of prep before your interval
 

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.530
period of prep before your interval
training session and then a number of

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.540
training session and then a number of
 

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.059
training session and then a number of
rounds over interval you're gonna go

00:16:14.059 --> 00:16:14.069
rounds over interval you're gonna go
 

00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:16.819
rounds over interval you're gonna go
through made up of work and rest periods

00:16:16.819 --> 00:16:16.829
through made up of work and rest periods
 

00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:18.230
through made up of work and rest periods
and then a cool-down at the end

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240
and then a cool-down at the end
 

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.079
and then a cool-down at the end
giving you a total and what happens to

00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:21.089
giving you a total and what happens to
 

00:16:21.089 --> 00:16:22.879
giving you a total and what happens to
edit these values each of these kind of

00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:22.889
edit these values each of these kind of
 

00:16:22.889 --> 00:16:25.759
edit these values each of these kind of
rows per se at Apple clicking on which

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:25.769
rows per se at Apple clicking on which

forth between the different sections so
taking a look at this atom do want to

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:44.670
taking a look at this atom do want to
 

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.519
taking a look at this atom do want to
give any initial initial thoughts on

00:16:46.519 --> 00:16:46.529
give any initial initial thoughts on

all they are using action bar and this

00:16:53.239 --> 00:16:53.249
all they are using action bar and this
 

00:16:53.249 --> 00:16:55.970
all they are using action bar and this
sort of they have our design tab designs

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:55.980
sort of they have our design tab designs
 

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.379
sort of they have our design tab designs
and whatnot there so that that's a

00:16:57.379 --> 00:16:57.389
and whatnot there so that that's a
 

00:16:57.389 --> 00:17:00.289
and whatnot there so that that's a
that's a great start I think the guys on

00:17:00.289 --> 00:17:00.299
that's a great start I think the guys on

goes you know going through and adding
all these things to me it seems it seems

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:10.380
all these things to me it seems it seems
 

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.549
all these things to me it seems it seems
sort of like a lot of work like a lot of

and you see a particular timer and then

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:50.030
and you see a particular timer and then
 

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:52.420
and you see a particular timer and then
you have to hit the edit tab which is

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:52.430
you have to hit the edit tab which is
 

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.940
you have to hit the edit tab which is
like going into edit mode so it's like

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:54.950
like going into edit mode so it's like
 

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.230
like going into edit mode so it's like
you know you're already a mode on top of

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240
you know you're already a mode on top of
 

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.790
you know you're already a mode on top of
the list and the timer and then every

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:57.800
the list and the timer and then every
 

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.380
the list and the timer and then every
time you hit edit there's a pop-up which

00:17:59.380 --> 00:17:59.390
time you hit edit there's a pop-up which
 

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.880
time you hit edit there's a pop-up which
comes up on top which is like a mode on

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:00.890
comes up on top which is like a mode on
 

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:02.620
comes up on top which is like a mode on
top of the mode in my mind so this is

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:02.630
top of the mode in my mind so this is
 

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.720
top of the mode in my mind so this is

me just looking at it it just feels kind

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:44.070
me just looking at it it just feels kind
 

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.010
me just looking at it it just feels kind
of unwieldy it doesn't feel very very

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020
of unwieldy it doesn't feel very very
 

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.790
of unwieldy it doesn't feel very very
regular or very even at all there's no

that is you know totaling up what's

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:54.030
that is you know totaling up what's
 

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.050
that is you know totaling up what's
going on and at first blush it might not

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:57.060
going on and at first blush it might not
 

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:01.550
going on and at first blush it might not
be obvious that rounds refers to the

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:01.560
be obvious that rounds refers to the
 

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.380
be obvious that rounds refers to the
eighth round to refer to the work and

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:03.390
eighth round to refer to the work and
 

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.630
eighth round to refer to the work and
rest periods and but not to the

cool-down or prep that they're kind of
separate to those things there's no kind

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:10.170
separate to those things there's no kind
 

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.620
separate to those things there's no kind
of grouping or anything there so for me

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:12.630
of grouping or anything there so for me
 

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:14.450
of grouping or anything there so for me
there's quite a lot going on it's not

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460
there's quite a lot going on it's not

and then we have a recommended standard

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:21.750
and then we have a recommended standard
 

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.660
and then we have a recommended standard
padding that you sort of have and use

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:23.670
padding that you sort of have and use
 

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.820

text fields are sort of up against the
the sides of the screen on both sides so

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120
the sides of the screen on both sides so
 

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.220
the sides of the screen on both sides so
some padding there would have definitely

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:34.230
some padding there would have definitely
 

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.130
some padding there would have definitely

like you know to me this is much clearer

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520
like you know to me this is much clearer
 

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.130
like you know to me this is much clearer
it's almost like when I'm viewing a

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:00.140
it's almost like when I'm viewing a
 

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.990
it's almost like when I'm viewing a
contact or editing a contact I'm viewing

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000
contact or editing a contact I'm viewing
 

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.810
contact or editing a contact I'm viewing
a timer or editing a timer so I really

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:04.820
a timer or editing a timer so I really
 

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.970
a timer or editing a timer so I really
like that and then I noticed you've got

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:06.980
like that and then I noticed you've got
 

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.770
like that and then I noticed you've got
the sort of standard system number

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:08.780
the sort of standard system number
 

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.830
the sort of standard system number
picker here as well which is which is

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840
picker here as well which is which is
 

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.360
picker here as well which is which is
sort of fits in nicely with the holo

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:13.370
sort of fits in nicely with the holo
 

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.299
sort of fits in nicely with the holo
theming yeah speaking of whole theming

00:24:16.299 --> 00:24:16.309
theming yeah speaking of whole theming
 

00:24:16.309 --> 00:24:18.960
theming yeah speaking of whole theming
we've really gone for using just

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:18.970
we've really gone for using just
 

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.090
we've really gone for using just
typography and standard controls to give

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:22.100
typography and standard controls to give
 

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.649
typography and standard controls to give
the application structure rather than

00:24:23.649 --> 00:24:23.659
the application structure rather than
 

00:24:23.659 --> 00:24:25.060
the application structure rather than
having these kind of bounding boxes

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:25.070
having these kind of bounding boxes
 

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:26.740
having these kind of bounding boxes
which you used to have around the

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:26.750
which you used to have around the
 

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:30.909
which you used to have around the
controls so you can you see we've used

00:24:30.909 --> 00:24:30.919
controls so you can you see we've used
 

00:24:30.919 --> 00:24:32.529
controls so you can you see we've used
the different colors for example like on

00:24:32.529 --> 00:24:32.539
the different colors for example like on
 

00:24:32.539 --> 00:24:34.960
the different colors for example like on
total and edits it just give the make

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:34.970
total and edits it just give the make
 

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:36.700
total and edits it just give the make
those stand out as important sections

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:36.710
those stand out as important sections
 

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:38.049
those stand out as important sections
rather than you know putting dividing

00:24:38.049 --> 00:24:38.059
rather than you know putting dividing
 

00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:40.180
rather than you know putting dividing
lines in and so on and lining things up

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:40.190
lines in and so on and lining things up
 

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:41.919
lines in and so on and lining things up
really so we've we've used the standard

00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:41.929
really so we've we've used the standard
 

00:24:41.929 --> 00:24:45.669
really so we've we've used the standard
48dp rhythm here to give the application

00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679
48dp rhythm here to give the application
 

00:24:45.679 --> 00:24:47.950
48dp rhythm here to give the application
this kind of steady rhythm which makes

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:47.960
this kind of steady rhythm which makes
 

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.200
this kind of steady rhythm which makes
it much much easier to scan and read and

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:50.210
it much much easier to scan and read and
 

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:51.279
it much much easier to scan and read and
understand what's going on very quickly

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:51.289
understand what's going on very quickly
 

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:53.230
understand what's going on very quickly
and make certain things jump out like

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.240
and make certain things jump out like
 

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.149
and make certain things jump out like
the total time we've also taken the

00:24:57.149 --> 00:24:57.159
the total time we've also taken the
 

00:24:57.159 --> 00:25:00.130
the total time we've also taken the
orange accent color which the original

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:00.140
orange accent color which the original
 

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.720
orange accent color which the original
application using the tab bar and kind

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:01.730
application using the tab bar and kind
 

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.490
application using the tab bar and kind
of run with it and really use that to

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:03.500
of run with it and really use that to
 

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.840
of run with it and really use that to
phim everything so from the standard

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:04.850
phim everything so from the standard
 

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:06.530
phim everything so from the standard
number picker to the

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:06.540
number picker to the
 

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:12.580
number picker to the
page title and the total bar for example

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:12.590
 
 

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.690
 
excellent I really like it um one

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:14.700
excellent I really like it um one
 

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.400
excellent I really like it um one
question so around the done in this card

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:16.410
question so around the done in this card
 

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:18.920
question so around the done in this card
I think we had a slide on this last week

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:18.930
I think we had a slide on this last week
 

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:21.620
I think we had a slide on this last week
as well you know why the twist to show

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:21.630
as well you know why the twist to show
 

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:24.140
as well you know why the twist to show
both both at the same time rather than

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:24.150
both both at the same time rather than
 

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:29.030
both both at the same time rather than
say push one into the overflow menu so

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:29.040
say push one into the overflow menu so
 

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.010
say push one into the overflow menu so
the option the I would say that really

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.020
the option the I would say that really
 

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.440
the option the I would say that really
comes down to the expected behavior here

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:33.450
comes down to the expected behavior here
 

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.250
comes down to the expected behavior here
so how is the user going to use this and

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:36.260
so how is the user going to use this and
 

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.480
so how is the user going to use this and
if it's the kind of thing where they're

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:38.490
if it's the kind of thing where they're
 

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:40.730
if it's the kind of thing where they're
gonna come in and then it's then want to

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:40.740
gonna come in and then it's then want to
 

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.340
gonna come in and then it's then want to
get rid of the what they've done is it's

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:43.350
get rid of the what they've done is it's
 

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:45.080
get rid of the what they've done is it's
quite likely then I think home discard

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:45.090
quite likely then I think home discard
 

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:46.880
quite likely then I think home discard
is a primary option works very very well

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:46.890
is a primary option works very very well
 

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:49.250
is a primary option works very very well
if it's something where they expect to

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:49.260
if it's something where they expect to
 

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.610
if it's something where they expect to
back out and not have it discard what

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:52.620
back out and not have it discard what
 

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.500
back out and not have it discard what
they've done but have it just cancel the

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:54.510
they've done but have it just cancel the
 

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:54.950
they've done but have it just cancel the
Edit

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960
Edit
 

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.440
Edit
so think about editing a contact for

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:57.450
so think about editing a contact for
 

00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:59.480
so think about editing a contact for
example you want to have a big done

00:25:59.480 --> 00:25:59.490
example you want to have a big done
 

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:00.800
example you want to have a big done
button at the top but you're very

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:00.810
button at the top but you're very
 

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.000
button at the top but you're very
unlikely to want to actually just

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.010
unlikely to want to actually just
 

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:06.080
unlikely to want to actually just
completely discard then then that kind

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:06.090
completely discard then then that kind
 

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:07.280
completely discard then then that kind
of justifies putting under the overflow

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:07.290
of justifies putting under the overflow
 

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:08.900
of justifies putting under the overflow
the other option as well as obviously

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:08.910
the other option as well as obviously
 

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:10.220
the other option as well as obviously
because this pattern takes up the entire

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:10.230
because this pattern takes up the entire
 

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.290
because this pattern takes up the entire
action bar at the top if you did have

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:12.300
action bar at the top if you did have
 

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.970
action bar at the top if you did have
other options other actions that you

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:13.980
other options other actions that you
 

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.440
other options other actions that you
wanted to put under the overflow button

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:15.450
wanted to put under the overflow button
 

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:17.840
wanted to put under the overflow button
for example you couldn't read and have

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:17.850
for example you couldn't read and have
 

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:19.910
for example you couldn't read and have
room for both the lodge buttons and the

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:19.920
room for both the lodge buttons and the
 

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.230
room for both the lodge buttons and the
overflow so that's a case where you

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240
overflow so that's a case where you
 

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.370
overflow so that's a case where you
might want to pick the most likely

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:22.380
might want to pick the most likely
 

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.870
might want to pick the most likely
candidate as a stand-up one like maybe

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880
candidate as a stand-up one like maybe
 

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.910
candidate as a stand-up one like maybe
just the done button and then have other

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:25.920
just the done button and then have other
 

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.700
just the done button and then have other
options under the overflow yeah that's a

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:28.710
options under the overflow yeah that's a
 

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:30.770
options under the overflow yeah that's a
good point and I guess like I don't know

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:30.780
good point and I guess like I don't know
 

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.140
good point and I guess like I don't know
this sort of way that you know users

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:33.150
this sort of way that you know users
 

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:34.850
this sort of way that you know users
would I guess you'd have to analyze how

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:34.860
would I guess you'd have to analyze how
 

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.250
would I guess you'd have to analyze how
users use this application but you know

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.260
users use this application but you know
 

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:41.330
users use this application but you know
if it was unlikely to undo you know be a

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:41.340
if it was unlikely to undo you know be a
 

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.160
if it was unlikely to undo you know be a
common action to discard what you find

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:43.170
common action to discard what you find
 

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.050
common action to discard what you find
there um I'd say push it into the

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:45.060
there um I'd say push it into the
 

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.060
there um I'd say push it into the
overflow menu I'm have done as a primary

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:47.070
overflow menu I'm have done as a primary
 

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.040
overflow menu I'm have done as a primary
action that also means that say if the

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.050
action that also means that say if the
 

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:50.960
action that also means that say if the
user hits the back button you know they

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:50.970
user hits the back button you know they
 

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.880
user hits the back button you know they
sort of they know that you know it's

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:52.890
sort of they know that you know it's
 

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:54.770
sort of they know that you know it's
we're going backwards and we're gonna

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:54.780
we're going backwards and we're gonna
 

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.450
we're going backwards and we're gonna
save whatever state was there rather

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:56.460
save whatever state was there rather
 

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.580
save whatever state was there rather
than not knowing if it's gonna be done

00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:58.590
than not knowing if it's gonna be done
 

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:01.580
than not knowing if it's gonna be done
or discard absolutely this was a isn't

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:01.590
or discard absolutely this was a isn't

or discard absolutely this was a isn't
the kind of application where you gonna

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880
the kind of application where you gonna
 

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.430
the kind of application where you gonna
install it you're gonna go in and set up

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440
install it you're gonna go in and set up
 

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.680
install it you're gonna go in and set up
a bunch of interval times you know these

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:06.690
a bunch of interval times you know these
 

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:09.170
a bunch of interval times you know these
are the workouts which I like to do so

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:09.180
are the workouts which I like to do so
 

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.190
are the workouts which I like to do so
you're gonna go in there and do a bunch

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200
you're gonna go in there and do a bunch
 

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.360
you're gonna go in there and do a bunch
of them and you're probably just going

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:11.370
of them and you're probably just going
 

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.280

I just didn't want to quickly mention is

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840
I just didn't want to quickly mention is

those of you don't know there actually
is a section up on the design site it's

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:18.150
is a section up on the design site it's
 

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:21.980
is a section up on the design site it's
under the action bar page which has some

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:21.990
under the action bar page which has some
 

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.110

if you are building drawers out there I

00:29:29.289 --> 00:29:29.299
if you are building drawers out there I
 

00:29:29.299 --> 00:29:30.789
if you are building drawers out there I
would encourage you to sort of look at

00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799
would encourage you to sort of look at
 

00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:32.799
would encourage you to sort of look at
that and try and follow those guidelines

00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:32.809
that and try and follow those guidelines
 

00:29:32.809 --> 00:29:34.810
that and try and follow those guidelines
you know before before everyone

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:34.820
you know before before everyone
 

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.490
you know before before everyone
implements this pattern and does it

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:36.500
implements this pattern and does it
 

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.110
implements this pattern and does it
differently it would be good to stand

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:38.120
differently it would be good to stand
 

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.650

samples out at the moment for the sort

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760
samples out at the moment for the sort
 

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.490

of best practice pattern but at least

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:45.500
of best practice pattern but at least
 

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.169

the design sites been updated with some

00:29:47.169 --> 00:29:47.179
the design sites been updated with some
 

00:29:47.179 --> 00:29:49.990
the design sites been updated with some
information there yeah I'd say a few the

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000
information there yeah I'd say a few the
 

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.430
information there yeah I'd say a few the
major takeaway for the draw pattern is

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440
major takeaway for the draw pattern is
 

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.930
major takeaway for the draw pattern is
look at the YouTube application is the

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:52.940
look at the YouTube application is the
 

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.700
look at the YouTube application is the
best way right now the best example we

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:54.710
best way right now the best example we
 

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:57.250
best way right now the best example we
have of its implementation so our advice

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:57.260
have of its implementation so our advice
 

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.169
have of its implementation so our advice
is that the drawer shouldn't move the

00:29:59.169 --> 00:29:59.179
is that the drawer shouldn't move the
 

00:29:59.179 --> 00:30:00.490
is that the drawer shouldn't move the
action bar because that's such an

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:00.500
action bar because that's such an
 

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.890
action bar because that's such an
important kind of anchor in your

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:02.900
important kind of anchor in your
 

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.360
important kind of anchor in your
application that you shouldn't be really

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:04.370
application that you shouldn't be really
 

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:06.279
application that you shouldn't be really
shifting that in and out of the way and

00:30:06.279 --> 00:30:06.289
shifting that in and out of the way and
 

00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:08.169
shifting that in and out of the way and
the drawer should kind of come from from

00:30:08.169 --> 00:30:08.179
the drawer should kind of come from from
 

00:30:08.179 --> 00:30:10.659
the drawer should kind of come from from
underneath that and also that the drawer

00:30:10.659 --> 00:30:10.669
underneath that and also that the drawer
 

00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:12.520
underneath that and also that the drawer
should only be available from top-level

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:12.530
should only be available from top-level
 

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:14.710
should only be available from top-level
navigation items so once you go down in

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720
navigation items so once you go down in
 

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.480
navigation items so once you go down in
your view hierarchy you shouldn't have

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:16.490
your view hierarchy you shouldn't have
 

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:18.190
your view hierarchy you shouldn't have
an instant access to it else it just

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200
an instant access to it else it just
 

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.779
an instant access to it else it just
ends up as like a bag of links rather

00:30:19.779 --> 00:30:19.789
ends up as like a bag of links rather
 

00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:21.430
ends up as like a bag of links rather
than having any kind of structure to it

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440
than having any kind of structure to it
 

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.440
than having any kind of structure to it
so those are my major takeaways and tips

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:23.450
so those are my major takeaways and tips
 

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:25.560
so those are my major takeaways and tips
