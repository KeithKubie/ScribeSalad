00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.486
A farmer has irrigation systems that work for circular fields. He wants to lay

00:00:04.486 --> 00:00:07.066
out the fields, so that he wastes as little land as possible and wastes no

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:11.146
water at all. So, the fields can't overlap and there can't be factional fields

00:00:11.146 --> 00:00:15.170
because then he will be watering somebody else's lands. He is looking at many

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.730
different pieces of land and computing how many circular fields will fit on a

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.823
rectangular piece of land. It's a bit of a pain. Let's write a program to help.
