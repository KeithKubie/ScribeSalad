- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape,
bipedal, naked, large brain, long the

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.580
master of fire, tools and language but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:30.290
Aware that death is inevitable yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:37.540
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.900
understanding of the past. Carta brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:52.070
to exchange insights on who we are and
how we got here. An exploration made

- Thank you, and thank you very
much for the invitation to join you today.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.790
As speakers of English when we hear
constructions like, "Get 'em, bring 'em,

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.730
take 'em," we analyze those as a verb and
a pronoun. Get them or get him, bring them

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.200
or bring him. This analysis is supported
by the fact that we read and write. We

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.220
rarely see the informal forms written it's
usually the formal forms and through

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.620
schooling which generally tell us to use
the formal forms and to leave the others

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.430
alone but we also know when it's
appropriate to use which style in which

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.400
context. We're now going to move to a
different context where speakers heard

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.500
those constructions but analyze them
differently. When Australia was colonized,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.160
there were about 250 languages spoken by
indigenous people. The speakers of the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.190
Australian languages and the English
speakers had to learn to communicate with

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.510
each other very quickly. Usually the
English speakers didn't learn much of the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.710
Australian languages. The earnest was on
the indigenous people to learn as much

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.450
English as they
could to get by with.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.400
So let's imagine that the English speakers
we're using the informal constructions a

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.750
lot when they were speaking. "Take 'em
over there, bring 'em back," constructions

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.730
like that that we use all the time without
thinking about it. The speakers of the

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.160
Australian languages who hadn't yet
learned English identified a pattern in

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.780
what they were hearing. When they heard
verbs like get, bring, take they

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.000
frequently heard something like, "'-im"
occurring after the verb but they didn't

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.700
hear that when the verb was something like
walk which doesn't have a direct object.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.740
So they came to analyze the "'-im" that we
would think of as a pronoun as being a

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.300
grammatical element that attaches to a
transitive verb. It's a verb with an

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.880
object but not to verbs
like walk and run.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.560
They didn't have literacy or schooling to
influence their analysis. They just made

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.210
this analysis from identifying patterns in
the language being spoken to them and what

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:23.530
they heard around them. So the transitive
"-im," or the transitive marker is a new

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.020
structure that came in to that system that
was not the same as a structure that was

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.300
already in English and it was not in the
Australian languages either but we can

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.050
see where it came from but the Australian
languages did influence that structure in

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.490
abstract ways. The form of  "-im" is
clearly from English but there are other

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.670
influences from the Australian languages.
I've just listed a few of them here. One

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.640
is for example that in those languages
when you have a transitive verb

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.980
construction it's a different
construction from an intransitive verb. So

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.580
those speakers learned to pay attention to
the transitivity of the verb in every

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.970
clause because that was required by their
grammar. So it made sense to them based on

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.173
the first languages to have a different
construction for a transitive

00:05:20.173 --> 00:05:22.368
versus an intransitive verb.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.108
In addition, there were rules for words
and the sound systems within the language

00:05:28.108 --> 00:05:32.850
that the Australian verbs didn't suit very
well and the new analysis suited them

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.740
better. So for example words in
Australian languages are often at least

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.570
two syllables long. If you have a short
verb, adding the transitive marker made it

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.940
longer and conformed more to the rules of
the first languages. So normally words in

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.990
Australian languages in that area didn't
usually end with a cluster of consonants

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.250
at the end of the word. So again, adding
that marker made the word shape conform

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.827
more to the type of verb that speakers of
those languages were used to.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.360
The "-im" structure is a good example of
some characteristics of a pidgin. The word

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.630
forms come mostly from the language that
was spoken by the socially dominant group

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:21.420
which we call the lexifier language but a
lot of the structure and word meanings

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:28.120
come from the other multiple languages
that were being spoken by the creators. In

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.800
addition, reanalysis take place such as
what we've just seen through pattern

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.900
finding processes and second language
learning processes. A pidgin is a means of

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.110
inter-group communication.
You use it to speak to people who's

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.490
language you don't know and all of those
speakers were still using their own first

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:55.780
languages when they spoke to people within
their same group. The pidgin spread

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:02.290
throughout Australia as English speakers
spread throughout Autralia and in each

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:07.756
place there were Australian languages and
those speakers were contributing features

00:07:07.756 --> 00:07:15.200
to the new system. Indigenous people where
brought together in groups and needed to

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.300
interact with speakers of many other
languages with whom traditionally they

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.900
wouldn't have interacted much or at all.
So they all needed a way to speak to each

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.950
other and this system was a good system
to build on in order to do that.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:36.170
As speakers needed to talk about more and
more topics with each other more and more

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:42.540
elements were added from English and also
from the Australian languages. Varieties

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:49.383
of northern territory Kriol were derived
from interactions of this kind.

00:07:49.383 --> 00:07:50.900
Here's an example.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.745
- [recording] Det mami-wan en
det tu pikanini bin trai stop-im im bat

00:07:56.745 --> 00:07:58.868
det debil-debil bin
gwei garra det tu dog.

00:07:58.868 --> 00:08:02.846
- And you can see there the
transitive marker on the verb, which came

00:08:02.846 --> 00:08:06.200
in via the pidgin. There's
another interesting element there

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:11.500
which is, "bin" meaning past tense. Again,
the form is from English have been, had

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.920
been but there's another reanalysis there
so it just means simple past tense. It's

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:23.266
not part of the have been or had been
construction. Reasearch

00:08:23.266 --> 00:08:27.270
suggests that there's more than one
developmental path for a Kriol language

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:33.040
but this has won a tested path. Again, the
word forms come mostly from the socially

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.990
dominant language English but much of the
structure and the word meanings come from

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.940
the other input languages. In this case,
there was an earlier pidgin that fed in to

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.930
the Kriol. Reanalysis took place through
pattern finding and second language

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:55.670
learning processes and the system
expanded and developed. There was a prior

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:59.518
pidgin that was used
for inter-group communication.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.100
A Kriol is the first language of its
speakers and is a full language. This

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.655
variety of Kriol continued to develop and
stabilize probably up until about the

00:09:10.655 --> 00:09:16.460
1940s and '50s and it
currently has several varieties.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.870
We'll turn now to another kind of contact
language in another setting in Australia.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:27.750
This is in a small Warlpiri community in
the northern territory. In this community,

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:32.660
speakers over about the age of 35 mostly
speak Warlpiri their traditional

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:39.030
language but they also code switch into
varieties of English and Kriol. Code

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:44.510
switching is switching between languages
in a single conversation and by Aboriginal

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:49.540
English there I mean English with elements
of the indigenous languages and elements

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:57.510
of Kriol in it. Younger speakers, younger
adults and children speak in a new way

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:02.000
which systematically combines elements
from those sources in which we call Light

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.718
Warlpiri. Children learn to speak this
language from when they first begin to

00:10:06.718 --> 00:10:13.077
talk now. As they grow older, they also
produce Walpiri and they code switch into

00:10:13.077 --> 00:10:20.366
the English based varieties. The Children
now learn Light Warlpiri and Walpiri from

00:10:20.366 --> 00:10:26.277
birth. We'll look at a little background
structure of the contributing languages

00:10:26.277 --> 00:10:28.833
before we look at the
structure of Light Warlpiri.

00:10:28.833 --> 00:10:36.263
- [recording] Nyina-ja-lku-lpa-lu

kurdu-ngku-ju jarntu-ju ngula ka-ngu

00:10:42.802 --> 00:10:45.677
kuuku-ngku.
- As you can see there,

00:10:45.677 --> 00:10:48.550
Warlpiri is a suffixing
language. A lot of the

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:54.680
grammatical functions are indicated
through suffixes on words. We can also see

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.800
here the difference between the transitive
and intransitive construction that I

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:05.110
mentioned earlier that the pidgin creators
paid attention to. The word there for

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:10.020
for child who's doing the chasing,
and the monster who's doing the taking

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:16.210
have a suffix on them that doesn't occur
on nouns when there's an intransitive verb

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:21.940
like walk. So it's in that way that these
constructions are quite different and in

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.140
contrast varieties of English and Kriol
indicate grammatical functions mostly

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.530
through separate words and
with fairly fixed word order.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:38.070
So how do this languages combine in this
new system, light Warlpiri?

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:42.831
- [recording] Ngalipa jalangwi-m kam

- [recording] Botul-ing i-m
panturn-um taya.

00:11:53.624 --> 00:11:55.871
- You might
notice that their

00:11:55.871 --> 00:12:02.190
English verbs there come and go. Much of
the verb system of Light Warlpiri is from

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.580
Aboriginal English and Kriol verb
structure but not entirely.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:12.590
If you look at example three, there's
actually a Warlpiri verb stem but it has

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:19.440
the Kriol transitive marker on it. So the
over all structure is derived from those

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:28.250
languages. You can see there the Warlpiri
suffixing. So we have the verbal structure

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:34.020
mostly from Aboriginal English and Kriol
but we have all of the noun structure

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:39.200
retained from Warlpiri but in the verbal
structure there are also innovations

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:44.410
which indicated in green, the "wi-m" and
the "yu-m" and they're what we most

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:50.574
interested in today. This pattern of
verbal structure from one source and noun

00:12:50.574 --> 00:12:57.120
structure from another source is fairly
unusual in the world's languages. The

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:01.260
differences between Warlpiri and Light
Warlpiri are in the verb and auxiliary

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.000
structure, which have these clearly
different forms but the underlying

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:13.530
abstract structure is more complicated. So
the "wi-m" and "yu-m" constructions which

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:20.120
are the innovations are part of an overall
system much of which already existed

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:26.046
in Kriol and Aboriginal English. You can
see there that for each word there's a

00:13:26.046 --> 00:13:31.970
pronoun element like we, you, a-rra which
is from I and then there's another element

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:38.790
which mostly means time. So where did this
wi-m and yu-m construction come from. We

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:45.420
know that it's not something that comes
from English. Well, it seems that the -im

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:52.180
came from English I'm like the form but
there's also an -im in the aboriginal

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:59.570
English in Kriol pronouns i-m and de-m.
Through this process of creating the

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:06.840
structure they were reanalyzed so that
instead of being a pronoun i-m or de-m

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:12.750
there were a new structure where they were
divided into two parts.

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:20.760
Aboriginal English and Kriol has this past
marker "bin" and that rarely occurs in

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.930
Light Warlpiri. So instead of using that
what has happened is that the speakers

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:35.590
have taken the past meaning from bin and
overlaid it on the -m element from English

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:41.710
and aboriginal English and Kriol such that
they have this new structure where the -m

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:47.010
is a separate morphing with it's own
meaning that means present or past or

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:52.350
non-future and then that is regularized
across the system and you have a new

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:57.370
paradigm.
Another example.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.944
- [recording]"Ngaju-ng na
a-rra ged-im ma kard. "

00:14:59.944 --> 00:15:01.850
- [recording] "Yu-m ged-im
nyurru first waya ngaju-janga. "

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:06.600
- There were some kids playing a card
game for me and using that structure

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:13.630
there. So what are the influences on the
new structure? Again, we see that the word

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:19.070
shape or form comes from the varieties
of English or Kriol but the structure and

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:26.550
the meaning comes from multiple sources.
In Warlpiri, the auxiliary has a structure

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:32.210
where there's a time element which is the
"ka-" there meaning present and a pronoun

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:37.140
element  and you can see that all through
the system these are affixes. They're not

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:42.550
separate words. So I think that this
underlying structure of wanting a time

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:47.500
element and a pronoun element affixed
together was part of the influence that

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:56.400
fed into the new system. In Warlpiri, the
verb and the auxiliary forms combine in

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:02.730
different kinds of contructions to give
the same kinds of semantic readings as we

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:07.760
find in Light Warlpiri.
So in the final column those three

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.910
meanings of non-future, future and
desiderative or one, two are exactly the

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:18.290
categories that we find in Light Walpiri
but they're not structural categories in

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:24.380
Warlpiri they're semantic categories and
again they've been overlaid onto the

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.868
forms in Light Warlpiri. So how did the
whole language come to be? It was through

00:16:29.868 --> 00:16:36.423
a two-step process when the adult groups
who are now about 35 years old with

00:16:36.423 --> 00:16:42.748
children I think that other adults spoke
to them in what is known as a baby talk

00:16:42.748 --> 00:16:48.971
register and in that register they code
switched a lot and they code switched in a

00:16:48.971 --> 00:16:52.797
particular pattern. So it would be
something like this where there would be a

00:16:52.797 --> 00:16:59.190
Walpiri sentence but they would insert
a Kriol pronoun and verb into that

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:05.902
sentence and that is the pattern that
the children then conventionalized by

00:17:05.902 --> 00:17:11.927
analyzing it as a single system. At the
same time, they added the innovations that

00:17:11.927 --> 00:17:17.366
we've just been talking about. That
group of children who I think did this

00:17:17.366 --> 00:17:22.322
maybe when they were three, four or five
certainly before they were teenagers. They

00:17:22.322 --> 00:17:27.424
then grew up had children of their own and
so now those children learned that

00:17:27.424 --> 00:17:31.845
language as one of their first languages
along with Warlpiri and it's their

00:17:31.845 --> 00:17:39.536
primary language. So the path to this
language is a little different. It wasn't

00:17:39.536 --> 00:17:44.490
created for inter-group communication. It
was created within one group of people in

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:49.171
one community and it's only spoken within
that group of people in that community.

00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:54.580
The speakers were multilingual there was a
lot of code switching. It was directed to

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.930
children, very young children in a
particular pattern. They then

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:03.930
conventionalized it and reanalyzed some of
the input they were hearing and then

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:08.610
regularized their analysis
to create new paradigms.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:14.470
From English and Kriol we get words and a
lot of verb structure. From Warlpiri we

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:22.580
get words, the noun structure and also
abstract verbal structure and this new

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:29.620
system is the first language of the
current generations. So what we've been

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:35.005
able to see almost in real time is a new
language developed and an innovative

00:18:35.005 --> 00:18:41.244
structure in that language through a
two-step process. Adults had fairly

00:18:41.244 --> 00:18:45.700
systematic code switching in the speech
that they were directing to children and

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.600
then the children had a very creative role
in conventionalizing that input and adding

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:56.960
the innovations. The overall structure is
unusual because it combines the noun

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:01.800
structure from one type of language with
the verb structure for another and there

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:08.110
are these innovations which are
interesting in that we can see exactly

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.711
where they've come from. We can see
exactly the reanalysis that have taken

00:19:11.711 --> 00:19:17.011
place and we can see that at the end of
that reanalysis there is a new

00:19:17.011 --> 00:19:19.555
construction.
Thank you.
