00:00:00.564 --> 00:00:03.141
- [Voiceover] What I have
here is a list of ages

00:00:03.141 --> 00:00:05.337
of the students in a class.

00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:07.308
And what I wanna explore in this video

00:00:07.308 --> 00:00:10.267
is different ways of
representing this data,

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:14.106
and then see if we can answer
questions about the data.

00:00:14.106 --> 00:00:17.907
The first way we can think about
it is as a frequency table.

00:00:18.743 --> 00:00:20.309
Frequency table.

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:23.809
Frequency table.

00:00:23.812 --> 00:00:26.047
What we're gonna do is,
we're gonna look at each ...

00:00:26.047 --> 00:00:28.636
for each age, for each possible age

00:00:28.636 --> 00:00:30.040
that we've measured here,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.365
see how many students in
the class are of that age.

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:37.866
So we could say, the age is one column,

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.679
and then the number,

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.662
the number of students of that age ...

00:00:41.662 --> 00:00:43.144
Or we could even say, the frequency.

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:45.455
Frequency.

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:48.376
When people say, "How
frequent do you do something?"

00:00:48.376 --> 00:00:49.970
They're saying, "How often does it happen?

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.845
"How often do you do that thing?"

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:53.075
Frequency.

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:53.913
Or we could also say ...

00:00:53.913 --> 00:00:55.337
Actually, I'll just write "number."

00:00:55.337 --> 00:00:57.740
I'm always a fan of the simpler.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.636
Number at age, which
we could also consider

00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:03.977
the frequency at that age.

00:01:03.977 --> 00:01:05.334
Frequency of students.

00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:09.430
All right. So what's the
lowest age that we have here?

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:11.843
Well, the lowest age is five.

00:01:11.843 --> 00:01:13.486
So I'll start with five.

00:01:13.486 --> 00:01:16.243
And how many students in
the class are age five?

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:18.610
How frequent is the number five?

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.838
Let's see, there is one, two.

00:01:21.838 --> 00:01:23.135
Let me keep scanning.

00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:25.008
Looks like there's only two fives.

00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:27.039
So I could write a two here.

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.769
There are two fives.

00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:30.545
And now let's go to six.

00:01:30.545 --> 00:01:32.277
How many sixes are there?

00:01:32.277 --> 00:01:34.944
Let's see, there is one six.

00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:37.908
There's only one
six-year-old in the class.

00:01:37.908 --> 00:01:40.200
All right. Seven-year-olds.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.010
See, there's one, two,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.144
three, four seven-year-olds.

00:01:46.144 --> 00:01:48.171
Four seven-year-olds.

00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:50.204
Now, what about eight-year-olds?

00:01:50.204 --> 00:01:52.040
Eight-year-olds, I'm gonna use a color

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.866
that I have not used yet.

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:58.438
Eight-year-olds, we
have no eight-year-olds.

00:01:58.438 --> 00:02:00.178
Zero eight-year-olds.

00:02:00.178 --> 00:02:02.377
And then we have nine-year-olds.

00:02:02.377 --> 00:02:03.544
Let's see.

00:02:03.544 --> 00:02:07.241
Nine-year-olds, we have one, two, three,

00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:09.333
four nine-year-olds.

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:11.409
Four nine-year-olds.

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.219
10-year-olds? What do we have?

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:16.667
We have one 10-year-old, right over there.

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:19.267
And then 11-year-olds.

00:02:19.267 --> 00:02:22.667
11-year-olds, there are no 11-year-olds.

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:24.835
And then, let me scroll up a little bit.

00:02:24.835 --> 00:02:26.801
And then finally, 12-year-olds.

00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:31.109
12-year-olds, there are
one, two 12-year-olds.

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.870
So what we have just constructed
is a frequency table.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.633
It's a frequency table.

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:39.672
You can see, you can see for each age,

00:02:39.672 --> 00:02:42.093
how many students are at that age?

00:02:42.093 --> 00:02:44.735
So it's giving you the same
information as we have up here.

00:02:44.744 --> 00:02:45.960
You could take this table

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.603
and construct what we have up here.

00:02:47.603 --> 00:02:49.241
You would just write down two fives,

00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:51.780
one six, four sevens, no eights,

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.575
four nines, one 10, no 11s, and two 12s,

00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:57.008
and then you would just
have this list of numbers.

00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:00.127
Now, a way to visually
look at a frequency table

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.438
is a dot plot.

00:03:02.438 --> 00:03:05.279
So let me draw a dot plot right over here.

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.681
A dot plot.

00:03:09.337 --> 00:03:10.975
And a dot plot, we essentially just take

00:03:10.975 --> 00:03:13.971
the same information, and even
think about it the same way.

00:03:13.971 --> 00:03:16.076
But we just show it visually.

00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:18.640
In a dot plot, what we would have ...

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.900
In a dot plot, what we would have ...

00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:23.805
Actually, let me just not
draw an even arrow there.

00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:25.379
We have the different age groups,

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.249
so five, six, seven,

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:33.038
eight, nine, 10,

00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:35.643
11, and 12,

00:03:35.643 --> 00:03:37.407
and we have a dot to represent,

00:03:37.407 --> 00:03:40.806
or we use a dot for each
student at that age.

00:03:40.806 --> 00:03:44.212
So there's two five-year-olds,
so I'll do two dots.

00:03:44.212 --> 00:03:46.840
One, and two.

00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:49.378
There's one six-year-old,

00:03:49.378 --> 00:03:51.300
so that's gonna be one dot,

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.939
right over here.

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.966
There's four seven-year-olds,

00:03:54.966 --> 00:03:58.475
so one, two,

00:03:58.475 --> 00:04:02.357
three, four dots.

00:04:02.357 --> 00:04:04.033
There's no eight-year-olds.

00:04:04.033 --> 00:04:06.110
There's four nine-year-olds,

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.776
so one, two,

00:04:09.776 --> 00:04:13.501
three, and four.

00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:15.245
There's one 10-year-old.

00:04:15.245 --> 00:04:16.995
So let's put a dot, one dot,

00:04:16.995 --> 00:04:18.341
right over there for that one 10-year-old.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.441
There's no 11-year-olds.

00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:21.038
I'm not gonna put any dots there.

00:04:21.038 --> 00:04:22.648
And then there's two 12-year-olds.

00:04:23.744 --> 00:04:25.678
So one 12-year-old,

00:04:25.678 --> 00:04:27.833
and another 12-year-old.

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:29.610
So there you go, we
have a frequency table,

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.637
dot plot, list of numbers.

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:33.812
These are all showing the same data,

00:04:33.812 --> 00:04:35.277
just in different ways.

00:04:35.277 --> 00:04:37.875
Once you have it represented
in any of these ways,

00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:40.302
we can start to ask questions about it.

00:04:40.302 --> 00:04:44.202
So we could say, "What is
the most frequent age?"

00:04:44.202 --> 00:04:45.640
Well, the most frequent age,

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.810
when you look at it visually,

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.943
or the easiest thing might be

00:04:48.943 --> 00:04:50.533
just to look at the dot plot
because you see visually,

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:53.401
the most frequent age are
the two highest stacks.

00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:55.062
There's actually seven and nine

00:04:55.062 --> 00:04:58.404
are tied for the most frequent age.

00:04:58.404 --> 00:04:59.666
You'd have also seen it here,

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:02.300
where seven and nine are tied at four.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.408
And if you just had this data,

00:05:03.408 --> 00:05:05.607
you would actually, you'd
have to count all of them

00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:06.833
to kind of come up with this again

00:05:06.833 --> 00:05:08.611
and say, "Okay, there's
four sevens, four nines.

00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:09.539
"That's the largest number."

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.174
So this is, if you're looking for,

00:05:11.174 --> 00:05:12.741
what's the most frequent age?

00:05:12.741 --> 00:05:14.400
When you just visually inspect here,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.771
probably pops out at you the fastest.

00:05:16.771 --> 00:05:19.112
But there's other questions
we can ask ourselves.

00:05:19.112 --> 00:05:20.240
We can ask ourselves,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.013
"What is the range?

00:05:22.013 --> 00:05:25.172
"What is the range of
ages in the classroom?"

00:05:25.172 --> 00:05:27.559
And this is once again
where maybe the dot plot

00:05:29.143 --> 00:05:30.377
jumps out at you the most,

00:05:30.377 --> 00:05:32.767
because the range is
just the maximum age ...

00:05:33.951 --> 00:05:37.312
or, the maximum data point
minus the minimum data point.

00:05:37.312 --> 00:05:39.044
So what's the maximum age here?

00:05:39.044 --> 00:05:40.244
Well, the maximum age here,

00:05:40.244 --> 00:05:43.016
we see it from the dot plot, is 12.

00:05:44.184 --> 00:05:46.771
And the minimum age
here, you see, is five.

00:05:47.938 --> 00:05:49.403
So there's a range of seven.

00:05:49.403 --> 00:05:52.401
The difference between the
maximum and the minimum is seven.

00:05:52.401 --> 00:05:53.912
But you could have also
done that over here.

00:05:53.912 --> 00:05:56.080
You could say, "The
maximum age here is 12.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.075
"Minimum age here is five.

00:05:58.075 --> 00:05:59.536
"And so let's subtract ..."

00:06:00.844 --> 00:06:04.501
You find the difference between
12 and five, which is seven.

00:06:04.501 --> 00:06:05.767
Here, you'd have done ...

00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:06.485
You still could have done it.

00:06:06.485 --> 00:06:07.660
You'd say, "Okay, what's the lowest?

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.523
"Let's see, five. Are
there any fours here?

00:06:09.523 --> 00:06:10.437
"Nope, there's no fours.

00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:11.700
"So five's the minimum age.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.886
"And what's the largest?

00:06:12.886 --> 00:06:13.901
"Is it seven? No.

00:06:13.901 --> 00:06:16.505
"Is it nine? Nine, maybe 10.

00:06:16.505 --> 00:06:17.766
"Oh, 12. 12.

00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:18.876
"Are there any 13s? No.

00:06:18.876 --> 00:06:19.805
"12 is the maximum."

00:06:19.805 --> 00:06:24.008
So you say, "12 minus five
is seven" to get the range.

00:06:24.008 --> 00:06:26.470
But then we could ask
ourselves other questions.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.507
We could say, "How many ...

00:06:29.441 --> 00:06:32.650
"How many older ...

00:06:33.733 --> 00:06:37.867
"older than nine?" is a question

00:06:37.867 --> 00:06:40.300
we could ask ourselves.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.937
And then, if we were to
look at the dot plot,

00:06:41.937 --> 00:06:43.028
we'd say, "Okay, this is nine."

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:45.477
And we'd care about how
many are older than nine.

00:06:45.477 --> 00:06:47.867
So that would be this one, two and three.

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:49.876
Or you could look over here.

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:52.266
How many are older than nine?

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:53.979
Well, it's the one person who's 10

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:55.710
and then the two who are 12.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.206
So there are three.

00:06:57.206 --> 00:06:59.300
And over here, if you said,
"How many are older than nine?"

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.734
Well, then you'd just have
to go through the list

00:07:00.734 --> 00:07:03.642
and say, "Okay, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:07:03.642 --> 00:07:05.901
"okay, here, one, two, three."

00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:07.971
And then not that person right over there.

00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:09.003
So hopefully you ...

00:07:09.003 --> 00:07:11.043
This is just an appreciation

00:07:11.043 --> 00:07:14.501
for yet another two
ways of looking at data,

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:17.170
frequency tables and dot plots.
