00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.980
- [Narrator] Does the
president's party usually gain

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.350
or lose seats at the midterm elections?

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.660
- It's a pretty strong historical trend

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.290
that the president's party
loses seats in the presidency.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.790
So that's particularly the case

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.960
in the House of Representatives.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.020
Since the Civil War,
about 93% of the time,

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.130
the president's party loses seats.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.410
Now sometimes they lose a lot of seats

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.020
and the entire control
of the House switches

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.600
from control in the president's party

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.650
to control into the other party.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.840
In the Senate it's a little less direct.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.500
About 70% of the time,
the president's party

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.790
loses seats in a midterm election.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.100
And this is often seen, and
more in more recent history,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.990
it's really seen as a kinda
thumbs up or thumbs down vote

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.950
on how the president is doing.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.950
The electorate reacting to
whether they like or dislike

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.170
what the president is doing.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.640
And in the two cases recently,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.230
where the president's
party did pick up seats

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.760
in Congress, it was in
1998 when the Republicans

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.350
were seen to have overreached
in their impeachment

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.740
of Bill Clinton, and so
voters voted for Democrats,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.830
Bill Clinton's party.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.570
And then in 2002 when
George W. Bush was seen

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.010
as successfully responding
to the 2001 attacks

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.870
on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon and America,

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.080
his party picked up seats in
the Congressional election

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.200
because it was seen as a ratification

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.833
of his presidency so far.
