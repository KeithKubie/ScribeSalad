00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.363
Hello and welcome to
YouTube Behind the Scenes.

00:00:10.363 --> 00:00:13.066
My name is Mat’as Molinas

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.957
and I am a Google Developer
Expert for YouTube APIs.

00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:18.132
In this lesson
we will see how to use

00:00:18.132 --> 00:00:20.495
the YouTube iFrame
Embedded Player

00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:23.330
on your pages
and your web applications.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.165
We will also see
how you can personalize it

00:00:26.165 --> 00:00:27.627
through parameters.

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:31.132
We will also analyze real cases

00:00:31.132 --> 00:00:34.429
where the Player is configured
the same way.

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:37.495
And we will see how to implement
one of these cases.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:39.627
Are you ready?
Let's get started.

00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:46.858
INTRODUCTION TO
IFRAME EMBEDDED PLAYER

00:00:48.297 --> 00:00:50.594
There are different options

00:00:50.594 --> 00:00:52.429
for the Embedded Player.

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.198
There's the Flash AS3, AS2
Embedded Player

00:00:56.198 --> 00:00:59.660
and also the Embedded
Player in an iFrame.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.825
The iFrame is the most
recommended option

00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:05.924
because this way
YouTube can decide

00:01:05.924 --> 00:01:08.066
which Player will be downloaded

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:11.033
in the iFrame to play videos.

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:14.231
It's worth remembering
that there are devices

00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:17.957
that can not support Flash,
such as iPad and iPhone.

00:01:17.957 --> 00:01:21.495
There are two ways to create
an iFrame Embedded Player,

00:01:21.495 --> 00:01:23.759
one is through JavaScript,

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.198
and the other by directly
declaring the iFrame.

00:01:26.198 --> 00:01:29.363
In this lesson,
to make it easier,

00:01:29.363 --> 00:01:32.924
we will directly declare
an iFrame to use URL parameters

00:01:32.924 --> 00:01:36.495
that modify its appearance
and behavior.

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:39.099
The simplest way
for obtaining code

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.792
to embed the iFrame Player

00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:45.066
is by using the code
shown in the Share option

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.495
when we watch a YouTube video.

00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:49.990
The Embedded Player

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.726
has a series,
of standard controls.

00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:54.165
such as the Play Button,
Pause Button,

00:01:54.165 --> 00:01:57.990
Volume Control,
Progress BarÉ

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.396
We can personalize these
through parameters

00:02:01.396 --> 00:02:03.825
as well as Player behavior.

00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:06.693
We do this through
URL parameters.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:10.165
We also specify through the URL
the video we want to watch.

00:02:10.165 --> 00:02:13.561
We can use, for example,
the Autoplay parameter,

00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:16.924
and this way the video
will begin automatically

00:02:16.924 --> 00:02:18.891
with no user intervention.

00:02:18.891 --> 00:02:22.792
Other than for personalizing
the Player by parameters,

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:25.792
the API allows us
to monitor its activities

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:28.825
and control it
through JavaScript.

00:02:28.825 --> 00:02:31.561
But we'll see this
in the next lesson.

00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:35.264
Now let's see
how to easily include

00:02:35.264 --> 00:02:38.165
an iFrame instead of a Player
on a web page.

00:02:38.726 --> 00:02:41.957
}STEP 1 -OBTAIN CODE
FROM AN IFRAME EMBED PLAYER

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.627
Select a video to play
on YouTube.

00:02:46.627 --> 00:02:48.528
In the options below the video

00:02:48.528 --> 00:02:51.858
select Share and Embed.

00:02:51.858 --> 00:02:54.891
Select the size
you want the video to be

00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:56.660
on your web page.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.759
Copy the code shown.

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:02.891
This code allows you to include
the video on your page

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:06.066
through an iFrame
Embedded Player.

00:03:08.528 --> 00:03:11.693
}STEP 2
TRY IT ONLINE

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:14.693
Try the code on this web page.

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:23.396
THE PARAMETERS
AND THEIR OPTIONS

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.825
Let's see how to personalize
the appearance and the behavior

00:03:27.825 --> 00:03:31.528
of the YouTube Embedded Player

00:03:31.528 --> 00:03:34.165
through URL parameters.

00:03:34.165 --> 00:03:37.297
After this section,
you will be able to personalize

00:03:37.297 --> 00:03:40.198
the YouTube Player
you use on your web pages

00:03:40.198 --> 00:03:43.297
and your web applications
with no trouble.

00:03:43.297 --> 00:03:45.990
Always remember
that your Player

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.957
should have a size of at least
200x200 pixels.

00:03:49.957 --> 00:03:53.792
Other than personalizing
the appearance and behavior

00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:55.462
of the Player
through parameters,

00:03:55.462 --> 00:03:57.594
you can do it
through JavaScript.

00:03:57.594 --> 00:04:02.198
In this case, you should include
one more URL parameter.

00:04:02.198 --> 00:04:04.462
Personalization
through JavaScript

00:04:04.462 --> 00:04:06.660
is what we will see
in the next lesson.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.792
These are the parameters
we can use:

00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:23.396
Before analyzing the parameters
in detail,

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:25.924
we should see the URL format

00:04:25.924 --> 00:04:27.792
that allows us to embed a video

00:04:27.792 --> 00:04:30.297
and specify what video
we want to see.

00:04:30.297 --> 00:04:34.165
Let's see some of these
parameters in detail.

00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:38.099
AUTOHIDE

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.264
Let's look at AutoHide.

00:04:40.264 --> 00:04:42.891
This parameter indicates
if the Player hides the Controls

00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:45.627
after the video begins to play.

00:04:45.627 --> 00:04:47.957
It can have
the following values:

00:04:47.957 --> 00:04:49.594
The first is 2,
which is by default.

00:04:49.594 --> 00:04:51.198
In this case the Progress Bar

00:04:51.198 --> 00:04:53.726
is visible during play.

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:56.495
Play and Volume Controls

00:04:56.495 --> 00:04:58.198
are also visible.

00:04:58.198 --> 00:05:02.165
The second is 1.
If we give it a 1 value,

00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:04.297
the Progress Bar
and the Controls

00:05:04.297 --> 00:05:06.297
slide away a few seconds

00:05:06.297 --> 00:05:08.660
after the video starts to play,

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.363
but they become visible again
if the user scrolls the mouse

00:05:11.363 --> 00:05:14.594
over the Player
or presses a key.

00:05:14.594 --> 00:05:16.528
If the value is set on 0,

00:05:16.528 --> 00:05:18.990
the Controls will be visible
while the video plays,

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.165
even if it's on Full Screen.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.990
AUTOPLAY

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.363
Let's look at AutoPlay.

00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:31.693
This parameter specifies

00:05:31.693 --> 00:05:34.858
if the video
starts to play automatically

00:05:34.858 --> 00:05:36.198
when the Player finishes
downloading on the page,

00:05:36.198 --> 00:05:40.033
or if the user needs
to click on Play to start it.

00:05:40.033 --> 00:05:42.858
It can have
the following values:

00:05:42.858 --> 00:05:46.561
The first is 0,
which is by default.

00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:49.165
In this case the user must click
on Play to start the video.

00:05:49.165 --> 00:05:52.759
The second is 1,
and in this case,

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.858
the video
begins to play automatically

00:05:54.858 --> 00:05:57.396
when the Player finishes
downloading on the web page.

00:06:00.924 --> 00:06:03.660
CC_LOAD_POLICY

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.759
Now let's look at the
cc_load_policy parameter.

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.198
This parameter,
with the value set on 1,

00:06:10.198 --> 00:06:13.231
makes subtitles appear

00:06:13.231 --> 00:06:15.825
even if the user
did not select any subtitles.

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:19.594
This parameter only works
with Flash Player.

00:06:19.594 --> 00:06:23.066
So, if the iFrame Player,
instead of the Flash Player,

00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:26.462
downloaded the HTML5 Player,

00:06:26.462 --> 00:06:28.561
because it's the only one
the device supports,

00:06:28.561 --> 00:06:31.231
this parameter
will have no effect.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.891
COLOR

00:06:34.891 --> 00:06:38.858
This parameter establishes
the color of the Progress Bar

00:06:38.858 --> 00:06:42.297
that shows what the user
has already seen.

00:06:42.297 --> 00:06:45.594
This parameter
can have two values:

00:06:45.594 --> 00:06:48.297
Red, which is the default value,
or White.

00:06:48.297 --> 00:06:51.198
This parameter is ignored
if we use a parameter

00:06:51.198 --> 00:06:54.462
that we will see further along,
which is ModestBranding.

00:06:56.429 --> 00:06:58.462
CONTROLS

00:06:58.462 --> 00:07:01.462
This parameter specifies

00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:04.132
if Play Controls will be shown.

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:06.462
When Flash Player is used,

00:07:06.462 --> 00:07:09.132
it also specifies if the Player

00:07:09.132 --> 00:07:11.396
will download immediately.

00:07:11.396 --> 00:07:12.924
If the value is 0,

00:07:12.924 --> 00:07:15.297
the Controls will not appear

00:07:15.297 --> 00:07:18.924
and Flash Player
will download immediately.

00:07:18.924 --> 00:07:20.363
If the value is 1,

00:07:20.363 --> 00:07:22.429
Player Controls will appear,

00:07:22.429 --> 00:07:24.132
and if it's a Flash Player,

00:07:24.132 --> 00:07:26.429
immediately start downloading.

00:07:26.429 --> 00:07:28.759
If the value is 2,

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:30.396
Player Controls
will also appear,

00:07:30.396 --> 00:07:32.165
but if it's a Flash Player,

00:07:32.165 --> 00:07:35.033
it will download
when it starts to play.

00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:39.528
LOOP

00:07:39.528 --> 00:07:41.759
Now let's look at
the Loop parameter.

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:44.660
The Loop parameter
determines if a video,

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.231
or a playlist,

00:07:46.231 --> 00:07:48.495
plays indefinitely.

00:07:48.495 --> 00:07:50.858
The default value is 0,

00:07:50.858 --> 00:07:53.759
and with this option,
the video or playlist,

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:56.561
will not play indefinitely.

00:07:56.561 --> 00:07:58.198
If the value is 1,

00:07:58.198 --> 00:08:01.726
it plays indefinitely
if it's a video,

00:08:01.726 --> 00:08:03.726
and if it's a playlist,

00:08:03.726 --> 00:08:06.726
we will see
the first to the last video,

00:08:06.726 --> 00:08:09.594
and then it will repeat
indefinitely from the first.

00:08:10.759 --> 00:08:13.495
MODESTBRANDING

00:08:13.495 --> 00:08:15.528
Parameter ModestBranding.

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:19.132
This parameter establishes
if we will see the YouTube logo

00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:20.825
on the Control Bar.

00:08:20.825 --> 00:08:22.924
If this parameter
has a value of 1,

00:08:22.924 --> 00:08:26.198
we will not see the logo,
but we will see text

00:08:26.198 --> 00:08:29.594
in the upper right-hand corner
that says "YouTube"

00:08:29.594 --> 00:08:32.231
when we scroll the mouse
over the Player

00:08:32.231 --> 00:08:34.198
or when we stop the video.

00:08:34.198 --> 00:08:36.759
The default value is 0,

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:39.363
and it indicates that
we will see the YouTube logo

00:08:39.363 --> 00:08:41.462
on the Control Bar.

00:08:43.891 --> 00:08:46.330
PLAYLIST

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.429
Parameter Playlist.

00:08:48.429 --> 00:08:50.495
This parameter is used

00:08:50.495 --> 00:08:53.990
to allow the player
to show a list of videos.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.726
We will specify the video IDs
separated by commas,

00:08:57.726 --> 00:09:00.198
and the video specified
on the video ID

00:09:00.198 --> 00:09:03.198
will be the first video
to be played.

00:09:04.726 --> 00:09:07.198
REL

00:09:07.198 --> 00:09:08.825
Parameter Rel.

00:09:08.825 --> 00:09:11.759
This parameter establishes if,
when a video is done playing,

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:14.165
recommendations
will be presented

00:09:14.165 --> 00:09:16.924
for related videos, or not.

00:09:16.924 --> 00:09:20.528
The value can be 0.
If this value is assigned,

00:09:20.528 --> 00:09:25.198
recommendations will not show
at the end of the video.

00:09:25.198 --> 00:09:27.429
If the value is 1,

00:09:27.429 --> 00:09:29.495
which is the default value,

00:09:29.495 --> 00:09:32.132
recommendations
for related videos

00:09:32.132 --> 00:09:34.561
will show
at the end of the video.

00:09:34.726 --> 00:09:37.495
SHOWINFO

00:09:37.495 --> 00:09:39.495
Parameter ShowInfo.

00:09:39.495 --> 00:09:41.528
This parameter indicates
if video information will show,

00:09:41.528 --> 00:09:43.924
such as the Title
or Uploading Account,

00:09:43.924 --> 00:09:47.660
before playing.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.825
Value 0 for this parameter

00:09:49.825 --> 00:09:53.627
makes the information invisible.

00:09:53.627 --> 00:09:56.330
The value by default is 1,
and the Information,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.099
Video Title, and Uploading
Account can be seen.

00:10:00.165 --> 00:10:02.957
START

00:10:02.957 --> 00:10:04.990
Parameter Start.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.462
This parameter
can have a positive value,

00:10:07.462 --> 00:10:10.627
which will be
the number of seconds

00:10:10.627 --> 00:10:13.132
from when the video
starts to play.

00:10:13.132 --> 00:10:15.858
If this point does not match up
with a frame,

00:10:15.858 --> 00:10:19.462
it will search for a prior one
in order to start playing.

00:10:20.891 --> 00:10:23.297
THEME

00:10:23.297 --> 00:10:25.429
Parameter Theme.

00:10:25.429 --> 00:10:27.759
This parameter determines
which Theme,

00:10:27.759 --> 00:10:30.264
or combination of colors,

00:10:30.264 --> 00:10:33.495
we will use
for the Player Control Bar.

00:10:33.495 --> 00:10:35.924
The possible values are Dark,

00:10:35.924 --> 00:10:39.726
which color combination
we will use on the Control Bar,

00:10:39.726 --> 00:10:42.759
or Light, which is another
combination of colors

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:45.528
we can use for the Control Bar.

00:10:47.627 --> 00:10:49.330
ANALYSIS OF REAL CASES

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.264
HOW TO IMPLEMENT A REAL CASE
FROM ZERO

00:10:52.264 --> 00:10:54.957
Now let's see
how we can use the parameters

00:10:54.957 --> 00:10:56.363
in real cases.

00:10:56.363 --> 00:10:57.759
BELEZA

00:10:57.759 --> 00:11:01.957
Let's look at
the real case of Beleza.

00:11:01.957 --> 00:11:04.627
At the end of the video
we can see

00:11:04.627 --> 00:11:06.066
the use of the Rel parameter,

00:11:06.066 --> 00:11:08.594
because instead of showing
YouTube recommendations,

00:11:08.594 --> 00:11:12.264
recommendations are shown
almost at the end of the video

00:11:12.264 --> 00:11:14.363
as annotations.

00:11:14.693 --> 00:11:16.165
AHHH

00:11:16.165 --> 00:11:19.264
Now let's look at the Ahhh case.

00:11:19.264 --> 00:11:21.891
In this case we can also
inspect the code

00:11:21.891 --> 00:11:26.825
and see what parameters
are being used for the URL.

00:11:27.792 --> 00:11:31.198
What is the effect of using
this combination of parameters?

00:11:31.198 --> 00:11:35.594
Was Player appearance
and behavior as expected?

00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:38.330
TU BRINDIS

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.297
Let's look at one more case,
the Tu Brindis case.

00:11:42.297 --> 00:11:43.693
As in the other examples,

00:11:43.693 --> 00:11:45.726
we can also inspect the code

00:11:45.726 --> 00:11:48.429
and see the parameters
in the URL.

00:11:48.429 --> 00:11:51.396
Let's see the effect
in the real case.

00:11:54.231 --> 00:11:56.330
I hope you enjoyed this lesson.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.726
We learned
how to use URL parameters

00:11:59.726 --> 00:12:02.693
to personalize not only
the visual appearance,

00:12:02.693 --> 00:12:05.759
but also the behavior
of the YouTube Player,

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:08.660
achieving a customized
experience.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.099
We used the iFrame Player
parameters,

00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:14.561
which is the option
that guarantees

00:12:14.561 --> 00:12:16.858
your video can be seen
on most devices.

00:12:16.858 --> 00:12:20.495
We also did it
using an iFrame tag,

00:12:20.495 --> 00:12:22.099
which is the easiest way,

00:12:22.099 --> 00:12:24.495
and, in many cases,
is more than enough.

00:12:24.495 --> 00:12:27.891
We saw how to use the parameters
in real cases;

00:12:27.891 --> 00:12:30.264
in successful cases.

00:12:30.264 --> 00:12:31.825
I invite you to watch
the next lesson,

00:12:31.825 --> 00:12:35.297
where we will see
how to use the iFrame API,

00:12:35.297 --> 00:12:38.429
and the Flash API,
and how to control the Player,

00:12:38.429 --> 00:12:40.231
but from JavaScript.

00:12:40.231 --> 00:12:43.330
In the next lesson
we will also see all this

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.924
by looking at successful
real cases.

00:12:45.924 --> 00:12:47.858
See you at the next lesson!
