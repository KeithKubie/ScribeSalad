00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:08.690
President Paul Kagame: Thank you, Provost

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:15.690
Alan Brinkley, and my good friend

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:22.749
Josh, for those kind words of introduction,
and thank you for inviting me to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.640
participate in the World Leaders Forum

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.739
this year. Distinguished ladies and

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.739
gentlemen, let me say at the outset that
it is my distinct pleasure to address this

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.250
august audience of this prestigious University.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.080
I am told that Columbia University

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.320
is the fifth oldest institution of higher
learning in the United States, and that you

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.619
are committed to preserving the quest

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.130
for knowledge as more than simply a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.470
practical pursuit.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.440
Judging from the number of leading minds

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.560
that are part of the community of

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.560
Columbia University, I am persuaded to
concur with one of your alumni who said

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.070
that "the best things of all human history

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.350
and thought are inside the rectangle of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.350
Columbia University." And so, it is indeed
a privilege for me to address you on

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.750
the them of the Millennium Development

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.320
Goals from Rwanda's perspective.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.400
Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, as
you know, five years ago the world's

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.530
leaders met and launched the Millennium

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.170
Development Goals.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.629
They made a solemn pledge to work together

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.120
to end extreme poverty and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.120
hunger, promote human dignity, to achieve
peace, democracy, and

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.319
environmental sustainability by 2015 or

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.760
earlier. This was reaffirmed at the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.760
Monterrey Conference on Financing for
Development in March 2002, and at the

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.980
Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.370
Development in September 2002.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.370
And in 2004 your very own Prof. Jeffrey
Sachs led a global team that rolled out a

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:08.559
practical plan to achieve the goals.

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:13.189
At the time of the Millennium Summit,

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:18.349
the targets for the Millennium Development

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:25.349
Goals were judged to be attainable, given
the amount of wealth and global

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.999
abundance, as well as what Prof. Sachs

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:38.109
has ably referred to as the greatest

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:45.109
technological and scientific explosion
of knowledge. And yet, despite this

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:52.489
unprecedented creation of wealth and knowledge,

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.340
there are still frightening levels

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.529
of poverty for the majority of the world's
populations, and many in the developing

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:07.760
world continue to die of deprivation,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.579
hunger, malnutrition, preventable diseases,

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.290
and endless conflicts.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.389
It is, in my view, unacceptable that today,

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:25.389
according to UN statistics, 345 million

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:34.009
Sub-Sahara Africans live in poverty. In
some Sub-Sahara African countries, as

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.370
many as 70 percent of the region's population

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:51.370
live on less than one dollar a day.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.930
228 million Sub-Sahara Africans suffer
from undernourishment and 4.7 million

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.970
children die each year of hunger and disease.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:17.970
That is an average of nearly 13,000 every

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:25.159
day or 500 children dying every hour.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:32.470
Similarly, 280 million people in Sub-Sahara
Africa have no access to clean and

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.069
safe drinking water and 167 million live

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:48.069
in slum conditions. Now, these statistics

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:57.080
 say it all. We need no further statistics
to show us that at this rate, Africa is not

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.150
exactly on track to meet the Millennium

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.879
Development Goals. In fact, in some

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:14.879
targets like poverty, GDP per capita and
undernourishment, there will be a

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.360
regression in the situation between now

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:29.360
and 2015, if left to business as usual.\

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:35.430
Some have of course argued that there

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:42.180
is no one else to blame, and I agree that

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:49.180
we Africans must take first responsibility
for this sorry state of affairs on our

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:54.810
continent. But that is not to deny the

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:00.889
fact that in this increasingly shrinking world,

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:06.990
or global village, as it has been referred
to, all nations are interdependent,

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:13.150
whether they are big or small, rich or

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.400
poor.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:20.340
And also that a world where the majority

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:38.539
live in such a sorry state, on less than

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:45.539
one dollar a day, amidst the highest recorded
global productivity and

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.860
concentration of wealth, is an unsafe

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:59.569
world. In fact, such a world is dangerously

00:07:59.569 --> 00:08:06.569
prone to manipulations by those whose
interest in violence, international

00:08:07.789 --> 00:08:14.340
terrorism, and genocide preys on the hopelessness

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.620
of the deprived.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:22.770
Equally, we must acknowledge that this

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.840
interdependence engenders shared

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:33.840
responsibilities and obligations, which
undoubtedly include the imperative for

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.860
development and attainment of the Millennium

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:43.540
Development Goals. We must

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:50.540
collectively agree that development is
liberation from want and from fear, so that

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:57.770
all peoples can live dignified lives.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:05.260
All peoples, not some. But judging from the

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:12.260
status of play in Sub-Sahara Africa, as
I have just outlined, the picture is not

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.400
promising unless we devise, together with

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.550
our development partners, and agree

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:28.550
to faithfully implement innovative and
practicable measures that can reverse the

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.000
current trends.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.750
In Rwanda we recognize the importance

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.530
of the Millennium Development Goals,

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:46.530
and we see them as prerequisites and the
roadmap for the realization of our own

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:57.940
Vision 2020, the blueprint for our socio-economic

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:05.540
development. Besides, their

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:12.540
targets are imbedded in our Poverty Reduction
Strategy, a program of economic

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.340
growth, in place since 2000, that aims

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.610
to generate wealth and increase choices

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:23.120
for the poor.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:30.120
So, clearly, we are determined to do our

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.880
bit, and although there are still

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:42.880
bottlenecks, we seem to be making significant
progress. For instance, in Goal

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:53.020
Number 2, we have introduced universal

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:59.660
primary education, and as a result, we

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:06.660
have attained over 90 percent primary
one enrollment, and net enrollment in

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:16.250
primary schools of 82 percent.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:23.250
We have striven to promote gender equality

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.000
in all sectors of Rwandan life and we

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:38.550
have attained the 50:50 enrollment of
girls and boy children in primary education,

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:50.390
contained in the Millennium Development

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:55.910
Goal Number Three. As for gender

00:11:55.910 --> 00:12:02.910
equality in decision making organs, we
now have a ratio of 49 percent women in

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:14.990
parliament and 35 percent in the Cabinet.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:23.140
We are, I think, to a great extent on

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:28.840
track in the areas of gender parity and
universal primary education.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:35.840
That said, I wish I could be as optimistic

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:44.110
for the other goals. We are doing our

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:50.830
best, but like other African countries,
there is no way we can achieve the

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.060
Millennium Development Goals without a

00:12:54.060 --> 00:13:00.600
true partnership at the local, national,

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:07.600
and between developed and developing countries,
based on our shared

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:13.940
commitment and determination to promote

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.780
economic and social advancement of

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:18.750
all peoples.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:24.850
This will necessitate on the part of our

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.920
development partners three cardinal

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:35.920
things in development financing: first,
improvement in the quality and quantity of

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:44.790
official development assistance (ODA);

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:51.790
second, fairer trade; and Third, debt

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:58.740
cancellation, which several countries
in Africa, including Rwanda, are now

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:05.530
benefiting from. The quality of official

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.800
development assistance should be

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:13.830
improved by adopting needs-based approaches,
providing more budget support,

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:18.830
supporting and harmonizing with national

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:23.060
poverty reduction programs, reducing

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:30.060
waste and overheads, and by channeling
aid to sectors that enhance productive

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.280
capacities rather than those that perpetuate

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.120
dependency.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:42.120
There should also be greater consultation,

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.320
coordination, harmonization, and

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.160
policy coherence among official development
assistance recipients and donors.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:56.140
Effective official development assistance

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:01.480
should be untied to procurement of

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:08.480
over-priced equipment and consultants
from donor countries. All these proposals

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.750
are contained in both the Monterrey Consensus

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:16.490
as well as the Paris Declaration

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:23.490
on aid effectiveness, which must be implemented.
Distinguished audience, the

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.560
global commitment to achieve the Millennium

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.950
Development Goals in the next ten

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:44.950
years requires massive mobilization of
financial resources and their immediate

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:51.190
deployment for immediate employment.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:57.270
We welcome the decision by some developed

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:01.720
countries to substantially increase

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:08.720
their volume of official development assistance
over the last few years. We also

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:14.590
congratulate those states that have reached

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.470
or exceeded the internationally

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:22.510
agreed 0.7 percent of GNI for official
development assistance target and

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:28.230
welcome the decision by those states that

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.390
have set timetables to achieve or

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:36.600
exceed that target by the year of 2015.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:41.490
These commitments should significantly

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:45.610
improve the prospects of many

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:52.610
developing countries to attain the Millennium
Development Goals. But for these

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.770
resources to be effective in the attainment

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.850
of the Millennium Development Goals,

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:06.850
 their disbursement should be accelerated,
flexible, and predictably available for

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:15.030
implementation. Fairer trade will entail

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.329
recommitting ourselves, both in principle

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:25.329
and practice, to an open, rule-based,
non-discriminatory, and equitable

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:28.800
multilateral trading system.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.890
Any progress that developing countries

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:36.710
like Rwanda might achieve in attaining

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:43.710
the Millennium Development Goals will
not be sustainable unless measures are

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:49.810
taken, at the same time, to provide a

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:55.060
greater opportunity to access the richer

00:17:55.060 --> 00:18:02.060
markets of the developed world and, thereby,
increase household and national

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:10.390
incomes. In this regard, we welcome and

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:16.170
support the proposal for duty-free and

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:23.170
quota-free market access for all exports
from Least Developed Countries to the

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.640
markets of developed countries, as well

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:33.590
as the proposal to ease supply side

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:39.320
constraints and commodity price shocks
in Least Developed Countries to enable

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.230
them take the fullest possible advantage

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:46.550
of increased market access.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:53.550
All our eyes are set on the successful

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.620
completion of the WTO Doha round of

00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:03.620
multilateral trade negotiations in 2006
and implementation of the Doha

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.510
Development Agenda, paying due regard

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.490
to agricultural trade issues,

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:16.030
liberalization of trade in services, and
the promotion of export competitiveness.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:22.280
The recent decision to cancel the debt

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:27.120
of 18 highly indebted least developed

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:33.940
African countries is a very commendable
manifestation of the commitment by

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:39.140
those countries to the development of

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.720
least developed countries.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:47.690
Rwanda is one of the 18 countries that

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:54.640
qualified for debt cancellation. Our debt

00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:01.640
once stood at US dollars 1.2 billion whose
annual servicing at the time was 523

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:16.730
percent of exports earnings. Cancellation

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.480
of our debt means that the

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:27.480
Government can now channel nearly 40 million
US dollars, which it previously

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:37.620
spent annually on debt servicing, towards

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.870
improving or expanding social service

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.370
delivery around the country.\

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:50.370
The challenge now is to access sufficient

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.600
grant-based development financing that

00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:01.600
will prevent the reversal of our debt
sustainability while providing the needed

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:07.280
investment for economic growth and poverty

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:13.660
reduction. Ladies and gentlemen, it

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:20.660
is clear to us that attainment of the
Millennium Development Goals is also

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:31.220
contingent on good political and economic

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:36.540
governance. In Rwanda, we have

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.440
implemented several political and economic
reforms over the last decade,

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:47.440
including democratization and decentralization

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.420
of the central and local

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.380
governments.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:56.870
We have put in place institutions that

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.110
promote accountability and transparency,

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:07.110
and we have introduced measures that combat
corruption and abuse of public

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:14.540
office. We have also implemented a series

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:19.180
of measures to ensure fiscal

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:26.180
discipline, to eliminate waste in the
public sector, while also boosting trade and

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:33.350
inward investment. We will continue to

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:37.510
do what it takes in this process,

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:43.390
particularly in the area of good political,
economic, and corporate governance.\

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:50.390
May I add that while we view improvements

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:55.630
in governance as a continuum and a

00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:02.630
dynamic process rather than a static end
goal, we believe that we have made

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:08.020
significant progress, which gives us reason

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.890
to be optimistic that with enhanced

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:18.600
support of our development partners, we
could attain the Millennium

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:25.600
Development Goal targets by 2015. Distinguished

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:31.220
ladies and gentlemen, let me

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:37.470
conclude by reiterating that the socio-economic
development of our countries

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:41.230
and the emancipation of our people is

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.330
primarily our responsibility.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:48.630
But the Millennium Development Goals are

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:54.360
a compact between rich and poor,

00:23:54.360 --> 00:24:01.360
and rich countries must honor their commitments
and fulfill the obligations that

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:10.190
accompany these commitments. I am pleased

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:14.320
to assure you that for Rwanda,

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:21.320
the will and enthusiasm for achieving
the MDGs is there. What remains to be

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.150
seen is the same commitment on the part

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:27.860
of our development partners.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:34.140
We believe that we cannot afford to miss

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:39.480
this opportunity that has the potential to

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:46.480
change the welfare of so many in the world.
But while we dither and prevaricate,

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:56.740
children continue to die of starvation

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:06.010
and preventable diseases. Others go to bed

00:25:06.429 --> 00:25:13.429
and fail to sleep because they are hungry.
This is not the kind of world we want

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:23.070
to bequeath to generations to come in

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:29.340
this new Millennium. I wish to say thank

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:36.340
you for your kind attention and I will
appreciate your questions and comments.
