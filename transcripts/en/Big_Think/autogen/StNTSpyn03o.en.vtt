this is what I really care about that we

this is what I really care about that we
 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.890
this is what I really care about that we
actually get it out there and so the

actually get it out there and so the
 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.319
actually get it out there and so the

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329
language we look for to make this
 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.890

relevant has to come forward certainly

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900
relevant has to come forward certainly
 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.330
relevant has to come forward certainly
from the scientific community so you're

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340
from the scientific community so you're
 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.000
from the scientific community so you're
not making things up as you go and then

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010
not making things up as you go and then
 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.160
not making things up as you go and then
you have to have integrity but you have

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170
you have to have integrity but you have
 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.020
you have to have integrity but you have
to have brought understandings very very

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030
to have brought understandings very very
 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.910
to have brought understandings very very
difficult very difficult to make that

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920
difficult very difficult to make that
 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.699
difficult very difficult to make that
bridge but i think that farmers should

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709
bridge but i think that farmers should
 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.300
bridge but i think that farmers should
just start that's my current message

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310
just start that's my current message
 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.370
just start that's my current message
just get something and start growing it

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380
just get something and start growing it
 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.009
just get something and start growing it
because that's what farmers do they grow

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019
because that's what farmers do they grow
 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.410
because that's what farmers do they grow
things and i think that they don't think

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420
things and i think that they don't think
 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.930
things and i think that they don't think
it's their responsibility because we

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940
it's their responsibility because we
 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.840
it's their responsibility because we
have the USDA we have simit we did it
