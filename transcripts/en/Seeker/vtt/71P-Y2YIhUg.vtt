00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.840
If I stare like this, do you
find you more persuasive?

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.720
How about like this?

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.570
Anthony here for D News.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.070
And we've often been
told that eye contact is

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.570
the key to being
powerful or persuasive.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.680
Whole books are devoted to
the power of eye contact

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.930
and how it's going to improve
everything from your job

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.900
to your romantic
life, except no.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.710
See, some new findings
were just published

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.980
in Psychological Science that
say direct eye contact actually

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.720
makes people less likely to be
persuaded by you, especially

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.586
if they were skeptical about
you or your ideas before.

00:00:37.586 --> 00:00:38.710
How'd they figure that out?

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.700
Well look me directly in the
eye, and I will tell you.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.490
Two experiments--
experiment one,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.820
using eye tracking
software, researchers

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.020
measured the amount of
eye contact subjects

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.770
made with the
speaker in a video.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.670
The more they focused
on the speaker's eyes

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.940
while they gave their
opinion on an issue,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.580
the less their attitudes
shifted to match.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.530
Experiment two--
people were asked

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.497
to either look in a speakers
eyes or at a speaker's mouth

00:01:01.497 --> 00:01:02.960
during a conversation.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.810
And people who
looked into the mouth

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.190
were more receptive to
the speaker's opinion.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.450
The reason we're told
to use eye contact

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.540
is that it exudes
confidence, but this study

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.420
seems to show that
it's a confidence that

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.490
comes from a place of trying
to assert dominance or use

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.139
intimidation.

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:18.930
That's why animals
aren't into eye contact.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.346
It's confrontational.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.720
If someone doesn't
agree with you

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.480
and you look them
in the eye, there

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.120
might be a whole set of
subconscious psychological

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.210
reactions that put
them on the defensive.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.920
Of course, it's situational.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.906
In a closer
relationship, eye contact

00:01:31.906 --> 00:01:33.030
is a sign of connectedness.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.290
It's also cultural.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.514
Here in the US and a lot
of European countries,

00:01:36.514 --> 00:01:37.930
a certain amount
of eye contact is

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.610
required to show that you're
paying attention to someone.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.250
In some Latin American,
Asian, and African cultures,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.150
it can be considered
aggressive or disrespectful.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.010
There's also a school
of thought that says,

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.224
even though too much eye
contact seems inappropriate now,

00:01:51.224 --> 00:01:52.390
that wasn't always the case.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.160
A study shows that
adults in the US

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.940
make eye contact for about
30% to 60% of a conversation,

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.800
and that used to be
around 60% to 70%.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.570
So why do they think it changed?

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.450
Mobile phones.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.810
See, people check their
phone about 150 times a day

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.370
on average.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.000
And we've just gotten used
to there not being eye

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.840
contact during a conversation.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.150
So we get uncomfortable
with it faster.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.390
So how much eye contact
is the right amount?

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.940
Now, assuming you are in a
country that feel similarly

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.390
to the US, a social
consultant pegged it

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.630
at seven to 10 seconds
at a time for one

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.392
on one conversations and
three to five seconds

00:02:26.392 --> 00:02:27.600
at a time in a group setting.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.760
And a study in Applied
Neuropsychology

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.970
showed that if you need
information from someone,

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.040
more than 10 seconds
of eye contact

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.230
will actually affect
their short term memory

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.160
and make it harder for
them to answer questions.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.170
My eyes dart around
too much, I think.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.899
And I am definitely bad
about looking at my phone

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:44.440
all the time.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.926
How are your eye contact skills?

00:02:45.926 --> 00:02:47.300
