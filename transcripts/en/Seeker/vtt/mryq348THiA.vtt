00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.069
The quantum realm seems to lend itself to
extremes: extremely small, cold, fast, and

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:07.779
extremely accurate.

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.540
As technology evolves and our ability to see
the universe on a quantum scale increases

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.530
what will we do with this new visibility?

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.429
The scale at which quantum effects are often
studied is on the order of nanometers or less.

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:20.849
How small is a nanometer?

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.310
Well, there are 25.4 million nanometres in
one inch and about 100,000 nanometres in the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.550
width of a piece of paper.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.890
So, really, really, extremely small.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.050
A system *that* tiny is also delicate and
difficult to study because it is so susceptible

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.050
to disruption.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.460
The famous physicist Richard Feynman was one
of the pioneers of quantum physics and even

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.590
he is on record as saying “nobody really
understands quantum mechanics”.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.370
That’s partially because, particles behave
very differently and counterintuitively on

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.730
the quantum scale,and also because it’s
difficult for scientists to understand effects

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.280
that they cannot observe.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.800
Quantum effects are everywhere, even in biological
systems.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.119
Since Feynman’s day, technology has advanced
and researchers have designed clever ways

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.159
to observe quantum interactions.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.939
One research group in Japan aligned an array
of quantum sensors called ‘nitrogen vacancy

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.399
centres’, and this is first step towards
measuring the behavior of protons within a

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:17.619
protein sample
6.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.929
When measuring effects that are really tiny
and subtle, a common trick scientists use

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:23.110
is indirect observation.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.320
They don’t measure exactly what’s going
on, they measure the effect *that* behaviour

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.649
has on something else that is easier to record.

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.711
In the case, of a protein sample the behavior
of the protons in the protein would have a

00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:38.929
measurable effect on the nitrogen vacancy
centres that form the quantum sensor.

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.799
The nitrogen vacancy centers basically act
as the canary in the coal mine -- indicating

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.399
to the scientists what is happening at the
quantum scale that they CAN’T observe in

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.149
a way that they CAN observe.

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.249
NV centers occur as impurities in the crystal
structure of diamond.

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:57.229
These impurities happen at specific locations
throughout the crystal structure and each

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.850
provides a single-photon signal that can be
detected by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.389
Quantum interactions with the sample, would
perturb the NV centers in a predictable way,

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:10.050
and researchers would be able to measure these
changes.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.890
But our measurement abilities are limited
and it takes a lot of these NV centers perfectly

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.570
aligned to create a readable signal.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.190
Until now, such alignment was not possible,
but thanks to a processing technique engineered

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.630
by the group in Japan, we may soon be able
to make real-time measurements of quantum

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.740
processes within biological systems.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.000
Tools like this could tell us about the quantum
mechanical relationships that drive behavior

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.230
of molecules and could even help us detect
individual proteins inside a cell.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.530
Until this point, scientists and engineers
have relied on classical computer models and

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.060
supercomputer simulations of quantum mechanical
interactions to predict complicated biological

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.060
effects on a sub-atomic scale, but we are
moving inextricably closer to the day when

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.950
we might get just close enough to image quantum
behavior in a living organism.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.980
Which would be BANANAS!

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.280
As a molecular neuroscientist, I’m excited
about what this could mean for cellular biology

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.590
and drug discovery.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.250
Better understanding of the entire process
when a drug binds its target protein, could

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.680
make experiments performed during the research
and development phase more targeted, speeding

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.660
up the discovery process and reducing the
large failure rate of candidate drugs.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.710
On a more basic level, the ability to measure
and observe quantum interactions will contribute

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.570
to our fundamental understanding of the universe
and maybe one day soon, we can prove Feynman

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.570
wrong.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.870
If you love all things quantum, you should
check out this video I did a few years back

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.000
on just how quantum computing could change
the world!

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.970
And while we’re on the subject, Nitrogen
Vacancy Centres in diamonds could also be

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.620
important for engineering quantum computers.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.140
Thanks for watching Seeker.
