shafted by somebody then trying to jump
ahead in that line but just throwing up

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239
ahead in that line but just throwing up
 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.300
ahead in that line but just throwing up
something right before but I still

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310
something right before but I still
 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.759
something right before but I still
believe that there is a place for the

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769
believe that there is a place for the
 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.009
believe that there is a place for the
longer more in-depth insightful pieces

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019
longer more in-depth insightful pieces
 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.020
longer more in-depth insightful pieces
and then you can have the short-form

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030
and then you can have the short-form
 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.910
and then you can have the short-form
analysis and you can have the response

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920
analysis and you can have the response
 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.130
analysis and you can have the response
and you could have the explanation and

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140
and you could have the explanation and
 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.130
and you could have the explanation and
you can have the feedback on that but I

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140
you can have the feedback on that but I
 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.420
you can have the feedback on that but I
still believe that it's important to

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430
still believe that it's important to
 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.920
still believe that it's important to
give time in the truth is they're made

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930
give time in the truth is they're made
 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.390
give time in the truth is they're made
or in short form that can also be very

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400
or in short form that can also be very
 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.789
or in short form that can also be very
substantive I believe it can come in all

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799
substantive I believe it can come in all
 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.890
substantive I believe it can come in all
forms a soundbite may be very effective

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900
forms a soundbite may be very effective
 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.660
forms a soundbite may be very effective
because it may be very insightful into

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670
because it may be very insightful into
 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.670
because it may be very insightful into
someone's feelings about something it

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680
someone's feelings about something it
 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.860
someone's feelings about something it
could be it could tell a real story in

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870
could be it could tell a real story in
 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.420
could be it could tell a real story in
itself so I don't think it's one or the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430
itself so I don't think it's one or the
 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.920
itself so I don't think it's one or the
other I just think there needs to be

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930
other I just think there needs to be
 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.720
other I just think there needs to be
more of a responsibility about both

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730
more of a responsibility about both
 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.960
more of a responsibility about both
