I don't really have a choice.

You keep showing up
wherever I am

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:11.744 align:start position:0%
and talking to me
about how you're mad.

Lady Gaga,

"No, you text me."

She texted me.
She did.

The infatuation with this guy
is unreasonable.

Nobody is that interesting.

I'm gonna say something.

You don't have the social clout
to face him.

Jake!
- I see how it works.

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:32.965
We all work side by side
for years,

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:34.700
then some fraud
in a loser mask shows up,

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:35.935
and suddenly
he's everyone's best friend.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:39.772
Greg, I'd expect this from you.
But Fred, Laura?

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:41.874
I thought our friendship
meant something.

any of their names.

you're just a rip-off artist,

00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:48.214
and you probably wear that mask
'cause you have an ugly face.

- Actually, Jake,
I wear the mask,

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:55.254
because when I was 22,

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:57.990
a child molester pushed my face
into a campfire.

00:00:58.023 --> 00:01:02.328

Come on, Grace,
