00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:37.959 align:start position:0%
reason why there is no reason to do that
 

00:08:37.959 --> 00:08:39.569 align:start position:0%
reason why there is no reason to do that
except<00:08:38.260><c> we</c><00:08:38.440><c> have</c><00:08:38.560><c> a</c><00:08:38.589><c> formula</c><00:08:38.950><c> let's</c><00:08:39.310><c> do</c><00:08:39.459><c> it</c>

00:08:39.569 --> 00:08:39.579 align:start position:0%
except we have a formula let's do it
 

00:08:39.579 --> 00:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
except we have a formula let's do it
again<00:08:39.849><c> but</c><00:08:40.690><c> nobody</c><00:08:41.380><c> wanted</c><00:08:41.560><c> to</c><00:08:41.620><c> see</c><00:08:41.709><c> then</c>

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:41.950 align:start position:0%
again but nobody wanted to see then
 

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:42.990 align:start position:0%
again but nobody wanted to see then
that's<00:08:42.130><c> why</c><00:08:42.250><c> people</c><00:08:42.520><c> are</c><00:08:42.579><c> always</c><00:08:42.610><c> I</c><00:08:42.849><c> almost</c>

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
that's why people are always I almost
 

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.970 align:start position:0%
that's why people are always I almost
sequels<00:08:43.419><c> are</c><00:08:43.510><c> never</c><00:08:43.570><c> as</c><00:08:43.990><c> good</c><00:08:44.380><c> because</c><00:08:44.709><c> they</c>

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:44.980 align:start position:0%
sequels are never as good because they
 

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
