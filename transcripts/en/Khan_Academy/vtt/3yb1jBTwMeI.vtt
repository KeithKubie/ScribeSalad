00:00:00.804 --> 00:00:03.082
- [Instructor] The western
or northwestern coast

00:00:03.082 --> 00:00:05.839
of South America has
been an interesting place

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.798
for ancient civilizations.

00:00:07.798 --> 00:00:10.372
We believe it to be one of the places

00:00:10.372 --> 00:00:12.992
that agriculture developed independently,

00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:14.378
and as we'll see in this
video, and we've talked

00:00:14.378 --> 00:00:16.002
about in other videos, it's a place where

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.306
we have many significant cultures

00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:21.408
and civilizations and empires developing.

00:00:21.408 --> 00:00:22.841
Now what's interesting about it,

00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:26.077
it is not your classic
river valley civilization

00:00:26.077 --> 00:00:30.164
like we have in Mesopotamia
or in ancient Egypt

00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:32.887
or along the Yellow River in China

00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:35.835
or the Indus River in India and Pakistan.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.199
Instead, this area is really defined

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.672
by the Humboldt Current.

00:00:40.672 --> 00:00:43.413
The Humboldt Current is
a current that comes up

00:00:43.413 --> 00:00:45.486
from the south and off the coast

00:00:45.486 --> 00:00:48.466
of what is modern-day
Peru for the most part,

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:51.378
it brings all these nutrients
from the bottom of the ocean.

00:00:51.378 --> 00:00:54.427
And what it does is it makes
it a very powerful fishery,

00:00:54.427 --> 00:00:56.019
so there's a lot of fish in the ocean

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.279
in this part of the world.

00:00:58.279 --> 00:01:03.081
And it also has interesting
effects on the climate on land.

00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:06.358
So in this region, you
can see even on this map,

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:09.242
there's this thin strip of
desert, and then you get

00:01:09.242 --> 00:01:11.896
into the Andes Mountains,
and on the other side

00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:13.850
of the Andes Mountains, you start to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.460
have the tropical rainforest.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.117
So if you go to Peru,
especially on the western part

00:01:19.117 --> 00:01:21.551
of Peru, the ocean will look like this.

00:01:21.551 --> 00:01:22.677
This is actually a picture I took

00:01:22.677 --> 00:01:25.472
from a recent family trip to Peru.

00:01:25.472 --> 00:01:27.459
Then, as you get right onto the coast,

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:30.884
it will be pretty arid
desert, and then when

00:01:30.884 --> 00:01:33.814
you get up into the mountains,
they're fairly high altitude,

00:01:33.814 --> 00:01:37.232
you'll have these mountain valleys,

00:01:37.232 --> 00:01:40.105
some of them are at
7,000, 8,000, 9,000 feet.

00:01:40.105 --> 00:01:41.398
This is actually another
picture that I took

00:01:41.398 --> 00:01:45.966
from my recent vacation
in Peru a few months ago.

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:46.876
And what's interesting

00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:48.521
about the ancient civilizations there is

00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:51.310
some of them might have
settled on the coast

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.894
to take advantage of the
fishing that was available.

00:01:54.894 --> 00:01:57.747
There were some rivers, or there
continue to be some rivers,

00:01:57.747 --> 00:02:00.559
that go from the mountains
through the desert,

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:03.680
so some early agriculture
developed around that.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.632
But there's also
civilizations that developed

00:02:05.632 --> 00:02:08.584
around these high altitude valleys.

00:02:08.584 --> 00:02:10.962
And what's really interesting
about these civilizations

00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:14.788
is because of the terrain,
they weren't as unified

00:02:14.788 --> 00:02:17.790
as things we might see in Mesoamerica.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.673
So one of the first
civilizations in the all Americas

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.068
that we have archeological evidence

00:02:22.068 --> 00:02:25.433
of is the Caral or Norte
Chico civilization.

00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:26.691
And one thing to keep in mind,

00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:28.392
as I give the names of
these civilizations,

00:02:28.392 --> 00:02:30.237
this is not what they called themselves.

00:02:30.237 --> 00:02:32.068
The civilizations tend to be named

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:34.527
after the most significant archeological

00:02:34.527 --> 00:02:36.345
locations that people have found.

00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:40.345
And now as we get into
the first millennium BCE,

00:02:41.542 --> 00:02:44.674
we have what's called
the Chavin civilization.

00:02:44.674 --> 00:02:46.538
Once again, it wasn't their name.

00:02:46.538 --> 00:02:49.187
This was about 3,000 years ago.

00:02:49.187 --> 00:02:50.708
And to be clear, this
is when we just start

00:02:50.708 --> 00:02:54.368
to see that civilization
getting quite advanced.

00:02:54.368 --> 00:02:56.326
There's evidence that
people had been settled

00:02:56.326 --> 00:03:00.725
in this area around
modern-day Peru and Bolivia

00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:04.416
and northern Chile and
Ecuador for potentially

00:03:04.416 --> 00:03:07.377
thousands of years before that.

00:03:07.377 --> 00:03:11.219
But just to get a sense of
the Chavin civilization,

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.831
here are some archeological
artifacts discovered.

00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:17.736
And they were discovered
at Chavin de Huantar,

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:20.569
thus the name Chavin civilization,

00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:24.322
sometimes called Chavin culture.

00:03:24.322 --> 00:03:27.188
And what's interesting is
we have these artifacts,

00:03:27.188 --> 00:03:30.409
it looks like it was a
religious cultural center.

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.664
Some people refer to
it as a religious cult

00:03:32.664 --> 00:03:34.553
that really took off in this area,

00:03:34.553 --> 00:03:38.182
but we don't believe that
it was a formal empire.

00:03:38.182 --> 00:03:40.474
We don't know for certain,
because we don't have

00:03:40.474 --> 00:03:42.930
written records, so we're
just trying to figure out

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.945
what we can from the
archeological evidence.

00:03:46.945 --> 00:03:50.134
Now, near the time that the Chavin culture

00:03:50.134 --> 00:03:52.342
started to decline,
and what's interesting,

00:03:52.342 --> 00:03:54.553
we believe that a lot of
these cultures declined

00:03:54.553 --> 00:03:57.747
either from warfare between themselves

00:03:57.747 --> 00:04:01.635
or some type of climate change,
whether it was the El NiÃ±o

00:04:01.635 --> 00:04:04.383
or some type of drought or
famine and maybe that could

00:04:04.383 --> 00:04:06.148
actually cause a lot of the conflict

00:04:06.148 --> 00:04:08.445
within a society as well, but
those are some of the leading

00:04:08.445 --> 00:04:12.612
theories as to why the Chavin
culture ended around 200 BCE.

00:04:14.813 --> 00:04:16.258
Now around that time, we start to see

00:04:16.258 --> 00:04:18.648
the emergence of several other cultures.

00:04:18.648 --> 00:04:21.764
You have the famous Nazca culture emerge

00:04:21.764 --> 00:04:24.597
right over here in southwest Peru.

00:04:25.505 --> 00:04:28.819
And they're most famous,
perhaps, for the Nazca Lines,

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.580
these huge, I guess you say drawings,

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.325
or patterns, that are made in the land.

00:04:34.325 --> 00:04:37.534
Some of them are 300 meters,
a third of a kilometer,

00:04:37.534 --> 00:04:40.003
and you really can't even
appreciate what they represent

00:04:40.003 --> 00:04:42.736
unless you're looking at it
from a significant altitude.

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:45.669
Some people have theorized that
this is some type of message

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.745
they're trying to send to the sky gods.

00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:50.118
Some people have even thought,
hey, maybe this has something

00:04:50.118 --> 00:04:52.408
to do with trying to
communicate with aliens.

00:04:52.408 --> 00:04:54.182
This is famously called the Space Man.

00:04:54.182 --> 00:04:58.306
Who knows, it's interesting
to theorize about that Nazca

00:04:58.306 --> 00:05:01.693
civilization, which started
to emerge around 200 BCE.

00:05:01.693 --> 00:05:03.045
Once again, we don't have written record,

00:05:03.045 --> 00:05:06.151
so we can just look at their architecture,

00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:08.228
these patterns that they created.

00:05:08.228 --> 00:05:11.518
Now a little bit later, we
start to see the emergence

00:05:11.518 --> 00:05:15.732
of the Moche civilization or
the Moche culture in this area

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:18.978
in light blue over here,
sometimes called Mochica.

00:05:18.978 --> 00:05:21.734
And this is one of the
significant structures they built,

00:05:21.734 --> 00:05:25.085
Hauca del Sol, known as
the Temple of the Sun,

00:05:25.085 --> 00:05:28.541
and it's been damaged a
lot, oftentimes by people

00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:30.547
who are trying to loot it or excavate it

00:05:30.547 --> 00:05:33.381
in irresponsible ways, but
it was the largest structure

00:05:33.381 --> 00:05:35.988
we have found from pre-Colombian America.

00:05:35.988 --> 00:05:37.306
When we say pre-Colombian America,

00:05:37.306 --> 00:05:40.906
we're saying before Christopher
Columbus got to America.

00:05:40.906 --> 00:05:42.365
The Moche are really interesting.

00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:44.256
Even though they didn't have writing,

00:05:44.256 --> 00:05:46.255
we can learn a lot from their art

00:05:46.255 --> 00:05:48.069
and this is some examples of it and

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.868
frankly this is some of the
less graphic examples of it.

00:05:50.868 --> 00:05:54.595
Now, as we get into the first millennium,

00:05:54.595 --> 00:05:57.017
especially the middle part
of the first millennium,

00:05:57.017 --> 00:05:58.733
we start to see some other significant

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:02.292
cultures and civilizations emerge.

00:06:02.292 --> 00:06:06.459
So, for example, around 500
CE, so roughly 1500 years ago,

00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:10.864
you see the Wari civilization emerge,

00:06:10.864 --> 00:06:12.058
and that's here in red.

00:06:12.058 --> 00:06:13.491
And there's some debates and you'll see

00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:15.993
these debates a lot as
we study ancient history.

00:06:15.993 --> 00:06:17.905
Was it an empire or was it just

00:06:17.905 --> 00:06:20.317
a culture that had a lot of influence?

00:06:20.317 --> 00:06:22.152
Some of the arguments for empire are

00:06:22.152 --> 00:06:26.705
it seemed like there was
wealth, it seemed like

00:06:26.705 --> 00:06:29.912
they were able to build
large infrastructure works,

00:06:29.912 --> 00:06:32.745
there was consistency across
different settlements.

00:06:32.745 --> 00:06:35.018
Now there's also the Tiwanaku,

00:06:35.018 --> 00:06:36.832
and we believe it was truly an empire,

00:06:36.832 --> 00:06:39.102
but we can say the Tiwanaku civilization,

00:06:39.102 --> 00:06:42.252
right over here in yellow, really centered

00:06:42.252 --> 00:06:44.760
at off the coast of Lake Titicaca,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.392
which is right in that
area right over here.

00:06:47.392 --> 00:06:49.091
But the big take away here is this is

00:06:49.091 --> 00:06:51.661
just a sample of some of the civilizations

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:53.892
that you had in this part of the world.

00:06:53.892 --> 00:06:56.391
Now what's really interesting
is, as I mentioned,

00:06:56.391 --> 00:06:58.528
a lot of them weren't able
to form formal empires,

00:06:58.528 --> 00:07:01.548
people think because of
the valley, the mountains,

00:07:01.548 --> 00:07:05.341
the terrain, that were keeping
people from maybe trading or

00:07:05.341 --> 00:07:07.812
being able to control each other
a little bit more strongly.

00:07:07.812 --> 00:07:09.749
But eventually we do have the emergence

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:13.008
of fairly strong empires,
as we see in the Incas,

00:07:13.008 --> 00:07:17.158
which emerges in the 15th
century, around 1438.

00:07:17.158 --> 00:07:18.609
And then the Inca empire ends

00:07:18.609 --> 00:07:22.637
with the European
colonization of the Americas.

00:07:22.637 --> 00:07:24.244
And we also believe that the Tiwanaku

00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:26.143
were a significant empire,

00:07:26.143 --> 00:07:29.560
despite some of the geographical hurdles.
