&gt;&gt;Female commentator: Hi, everyone. And Authors
at Google team would like, is happy to have

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.880
Matt Moseley come and speak with us today.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.930
And Matt is a communications strategist in
Boulder, Colorado. He has served as a Deputy

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.090
Press Secretary under White House Communications
Director, Mike McCurry for the Denver Summit

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.480
of Eight and he was a communications director
for Hunter S. Thompson's funeral and ash-blast,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.750
which is good. And he's currently working
with Rolling Stone magazine to cover Burning

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.750
man.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.149
Matt's here today to talk with us about his
first book, Dear Dr. Thompson: Felony Murder,

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.749
Hunter S. Thompson and the Last Gonzo Campaign.
I'll let Matt tell you a little more about

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:52.039
that story, but I wanted to share with you
what I think would be the best LinkedIn recommendation

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:59.170
of all time and it's a quote from Sam Kashner
from Vanity Fair about Matt's book. And he

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.080
says: "If I'm ever busted for something I
never did, I want Matt Moseley's phone number

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.810
sewn into my underwear." [laughs] Which has
to, that's fantastic.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.960
So please welcome Matt Moseley.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:18.510
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: Thank you so much Tracey for
having me here. Can, is this okay everybody

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.370
can hear?

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.470
I-I do wanna say about Sam's quote in Vanity
Fair that if you're actually are busted for

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.550
something you never did, call your lawyer
first.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.550
[laughter]

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.140
And then they will call me. So --

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.080
Today I'm gonna tell you a little story about
how a single letter changed a girl's life.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.770
[pause]

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.951
To do that, first I wanna talk about, the
book is called Dear Dr. Thompson and it's

00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:51.490
about a letter that a woman wrote to Hunter
S. Thompson; who if some of you know who Hunter

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.030
S. Thompson was.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.090
Hunter was an outlaw journalist and he was
significant not because of I think what he

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.520
wrote and some of the pieces and specific
pieces of art that he wrote, but that he was

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.730
significant because he changed the face of
journalism.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.760
He was really one of the first reporters to
ever insert themselves into a story. And by

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.000
doing that he paved the way for other great
writers like David Halberstam and Tom Wolfe

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.590
and Norman Mailer to also become Gonzo journalists
and participatory journalism where people

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.030
and journalists were not unbiased observers,
they were participants in the story.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.400
And that's why this book is really no different
and it-it's a great testament to the success

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.420
of Gonzo journalism.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.530
[pause]

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.730
So to understand how Hunter Thompson got involved
in this case, you have to understand the woman

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.730
of Lisl Auman

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.840
[pause]

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.090
There's Hunter in his kitchen when we were
workin' together. Now Lisl Auman was a naive

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.880
young girl who grew up in the suburbs of Littleton,
Colorado.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.190
She would, she was a peaceful, loving woman.
Had a, had a lot of nice friends; did okay

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.510
in school, but then kind of fell in with the
bad group of people. Eventually ended up dropping

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.590
out of Arapahoe Community College and she
went up into the hills above Denver and to

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.060
Evergreen and Buffalo Creek looking for a
better and simpler life. But she moved in

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.290
within a nefarious character named Shawn Cheever.
Now Shawn was not very nice to her. They lived

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.430
together about three months and it was already
kind of se-sending some bad signals and was

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.020
 - she had to get out of there.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.099
So she goes to her friend Demi Soriano's house
in Denver and she says, "Demi, can you help

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.319
me move out?" And Demi says, "Yeah. I know
a couple a guys who can help you move out."

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:54.069
So she calls over her friends who happen to
be skinheads and-and this is Matthaeus Jaehnig

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:01.700
shows up the very next day about noon in a
fire engine-arrest-me-red Trans Am he called

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.090
the Thunder Chicken. And he'd just stolen
if from south of Colorado Springs.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.020
So against every instinct in her soul Lisl
Auman climbs into the Thunder Chicken and

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.709
they go up to Buffalo Creek to get her stuff.
But while that's happening they get her stuff,

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.350
the skinheads also start taking some of Cheever's
belongings: a snowboard, some CD's, some pretty

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.440
low level things. But the neighbors see this
and they call the cops.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.750
So a high speed chase happens down into Denver,
90 miles an hour in the Thunder Chicken, police

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.710
behind. Matthaeus leans out of the car and
starts firing at police and he says, "Grab

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:47.580
the wheel!" So Lisl grabs the wheel. They
make it down into Denver; they go into the

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:55.949
Monaco Place Apartments where they started.
Matthaeus runs into an alcove; Lisl runs to

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.750
police. "Help, help!" They throw her down
into the snow, put-put a knee in her back.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.010
"Where did he go? Where did he go?"

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.449
Well the last time that she saw him was the
last time that they saw him. So she had no

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.470
idea where he went. "I don't know. I don't
know," she says.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:20.130
Meanwhile, Officer Bruce VanderJagt is slowly
creeping along the alcove wall and he-he's

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:27.430
creeping along and all of a sudden he poked
his head around a corner and "Bam!" She shoots

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.000
his head; Matthaeus Jaehnig shots his head
off.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.540
Lisl is driven away from the scene, she's
in police handcuffs already, and Matthaeus

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.380
Jaehnig then shoots himself.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.940
So a high profile trial happens in Denver.
There's really only one person to left to

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.630
blame for the death of Officer Bruce VanderJagt,
and that's Lisl Auman.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:06:00.919
So she is sentenced to life without parole
for felony murder because she was sort of

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.540
classified as an accomplice. They said that
she steered the getaway car; that she was

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.770
the skinhead's girlfriend; that, although
they'd only know each other 12 hours.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.199
And this was all orchestrated by the prosecutor,
the lead prosecutor and the Denver District

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:21.800
Attorney who was Bill Ritter. And Bill Ritter,
if you know, is the current Governor of Colorado

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.370
now.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:30.560
So they sentence her to life without parole
in a very, very acrimonious trial where there

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.800
was really only one answer and that was Lisl
Auman goes to jail for life.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:44.389
So the years start rolling by like a broken
down dam for Lisl in prison; a scared, naive,

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:48.900
young girl who never, she thought she would
be home that night. She never thought it was

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.400
going to be an instance where she'd spend
the rest of her days in jail.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:00.020
And so she ruminates on a book that she had
read three years prior. She-she's sitting

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.410
in jail; she doesn't have much to do. And
this book had really made an impression on

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.690
her. It was called Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.250
She ruminated about the zany author and she
said, "You know I'm gonna write this crazy,

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:20.050
old bastard a letter." And she does. She writes
him a letter and she says, all she says is,

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.770
"Your books aren't available in the prison
library." She doesn't ask him for anything.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.980
She doesn't say, "Can you, can you get me
outa jail."

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:35.970
But Hunter reads the letter one night and
he cocks her Cheshire cat grin and he says,

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.530
"I think maybe I can help."

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:43.910
So he pulls out a piece of his elegant stationary
with his name embossed in blue across the

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:49.970
top and he writes her a letter back. And he
says, "I think I can do more than help."

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:57.530
So then he writes about her in an ESPN column
and as fate would have it, Hunter Thompson

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:03.479
had an annual Super Bowl party every year.
And just that weekend the National Association

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:07.430
of Criminal Defense Lawyers was in Aspen holding
their annual criminal law seminar.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.530
So he says, "Come on over to my place for
the Super Bowl. We'll blow somethin' up and

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.050
we'll have a good time."

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.940
They're over there but at half-time instead
of talking about football, Hunter hands out

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:23.830
dossiers on the Lisl Auman case. And so all
these criminal defense attorneys are like,

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:29.000
"What-what is going on here? We came over
to-to watch the Super Bowl."

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.409
But Hunter plies them with the story of Lisl
and says, "This is the test case for felony

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:40.270
murder. We have an opportunity here to overturn
this law, maybe through this case. Can you

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.849
help me out? Will you do it?"

00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:47.490
And sure enough at the end of that football
game, Gerald Lefcourt who was the President

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:52.540
of the National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers pushes his winnings back towards Hunter

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.750
and says, "We're in."

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:59.320
And it was that night that the Free Lisl,
the National Committee to Free Lisl Auman

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.320
was born.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.490
[pause]

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.290
So Hunter wrote about it in his ESPN column;
sparked 30,000 hits to her Website that went

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.070
from like 300 overnight.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:16.690
And I read an article about Hunter being involved
in this case and I-I thought, "How-how crazy

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:22.410
was not just the fact pattern of the case,
but now you had this Gonzo element out here

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.050
trying to call for a young woman's release.
I mean this was the author of Fear and Loathing

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:30.040
in Las Vegas. I, this was a different side
of Hunter.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.320
So I thought about this a lot and I went back
to my office in Denver the next morning and

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:41.959
I sketched out a little memo. This, here's
what you could do to launch a public information

00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:48.160
campaign. Here's how maybe we could tell a
different story than what had already been

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.160
told.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.540
So I faxed him that memo that afternoon and
I was telling Tracey as we were having lunch

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:58.580
today about that day. Because I was sitting
in the City Grille right across from the Colorado

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:03.160
State Capitol and I see an unknown phone number
pop up on my, on my Blackberry and I answer

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:09.640
it and he said, "Oh yeah, yeah is this Matt
Moseley?" And I knew it had to be him. It's

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.470
maybe the call you've been waiting for your
whole life.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.680
[pause]

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.209
I jumped up, I go to the little table, and
I take out my little notebook, and for about

00:10:18.209 --> 00:10:22.910
45 minutes we talked and he said, "Come on
up, son. Next time you're in Aspen give me

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:27.000
a call and we'll blow somethin' up. It-it'll
be fun. We won't just work."

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.610
And so about a couple weeks later I did go
up to Owl Farm and we launched the campaign

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:39.010
and I was gonna be the strategist and tactician
of putting the nuts and bolts on this campaign

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:45.019
and keepin' it running while Hunter would
be our titular head and would, and would act

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:47.260
as the drawing mechanism.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:52.010
But one of the things I really thought about
as we prepared for this rally that we were

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:57.620
going to have on the west steps of the Colorado
State Capitol was how to use the Gonzo element.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:02.361
Okay we we're gonna have Warren Zevon come
and play "Lawyers, Guns and Money" on the

00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:09.830
west steps of the Capitol. But I also didn't
want it to be Hunter calling the cops some

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:14.800
bad name and then the next thing you know
we're putting the nail on a coffin of a life

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.110
sentence without parole.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.529
And I remember at the rally this is on the
west steps of the Capitol and Hunter looks

00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:25.690
down at his notepad and he writes, "Today's
pig is tomorrow's bacon." And there are cops

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:30.260
all around the perimeter of the rally, right?
I-I said, "Hunter you can't say that." He

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:34.149
goes, "Don't tell me what to say." And I said,
"You know you're right, you can't really --" He

00:11:34.149 --> 00:11:38.110
was one of the few principals I've worked
for, you just couldn't hand him talking points.

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:42.779
[laughs] He just wasn't that kinda guy.

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:47.990
We held a rally on the west steps of the Capitol.
Warren Zevon played "Lawyers, Guns and Money"

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:55.330
to call for the release of Lisl. And what
we did that day was change the narrative.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.270
Bill Ritter said that she had steered the
getaway car, was the skinhead's girlfriend,

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:03.870
and was the mastermind behind a plot to murder
this officer.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:09.829
And we told the story, a much different story
about a girl who climbed in a car and had

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:16.990
no more control over that car ride than you
or I. And because of that, because of that

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:23.750
the felony murder law is wrong, because it
allows people to be held liable for crimes

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:27.620
that they had no intention or no desire to
commit.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:32.420
And that I posit to you is part of the call
to action to this book that I've written here

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:37.630
today. It's a call for the abolishment of
the felony murder law. There are thousands

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:43.250
of people right now in prisons for crimes,
serving sentences for crimes they obviously

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:44.250
didn't do.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:50.610
Lisl was the first person ever to be convicted
of a crime while in police custody in handcuffs

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:55.260
in a car. How could she be responsible for
that?

00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:01.649
So what we did was we changed the narrative
that day on the west steps, five years later

00:13:01.649 --> 00:13:06.360
after Lisl had been imprisoned. And I remember
us walking through the State Capitol this

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.850
is right in front of the Governor's office
and Hunter looking around and he said, "Watch

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:11.850
out for the assassins." [laughs]

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:17.350
Of course I did, knew there wouldn't be an
assassins but you can see I looked anyway

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.350
thinkin' that maybe there were.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.290
[pause]

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:27.630
But yet while we changed the story, while
we had a different narrative going, the Court

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:34.660
of Appeals still rejected Lisl's appeal case.
So for several years it laid dormant and we

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:40.410
just, we tried to gin up public support. But
then a little ray of light and sunshine broke

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:45.811
through because the Colorado Supreme Court
granted the case a writ of certiorari which

00:13:45.811 --> 00:13:52.000
is just they grant, they allow to hear the
case on the very simple technical matter:

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.639
who was actually fleeing from the crime? Was
it Lisl or was it Matthaeus Jaehnig for completely

00:13:57.639 --> 00:14:00.290
independent reasons?

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:06.519
So it goes to the Supreme Court. Hunter in
the meantime writes an article for Vanity

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:12.570
Fair co-authored with Mark Seal and that was
a 30,000 piece bombshell that called the Denver

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:18.470
cops "brutes" and called them "liars" and
really took them to task for the case.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:23.420
That article, by the way, was just optioned
into a movie 10 days before the release of

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.880
the book.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.880
[pause]

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:30.720
We're at the Supreme Court, it's the first
time they've ever held two oral arguments,

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.850
it's been lasting for a year now, okay, we're
al, we've been involved in this case now for

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:43.019
five or six years. They hold two oral arguments
and in that time Hunter kills himself.

00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:44.930
[pause]

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:48.450
And then it was two weeks later that they
overturned the decision and they remanded

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:52.630
it back to the Denver District Court for a
retrial.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:59.040
And Hunter had a lot on his plate and I will
read to you I think a little bit, a passage

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:06.560
from the book about what Hunter I think brought
to this case and what he brought to journalism.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.310
[sound of pages turning]

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:16.670
"Hunter's curiosity led him to everywhere:
to the historical def-events that defined

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:23.580
his era. He was covered the Kentucky Derby,
the Super Bowl, and the America's Cup. He

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:29.100
reported in Latin America, in Cambodia, and
in Africa for the Rumble in the Jungle. He

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:36.029
drank beers with Ga, on the beach with Gary
Hart and he urinated with George McGovern.

00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:42.230
"He narrowly lost his campaign in Picken County
on the Freak Power Ticket.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:47.579
"Hunter showed up at some of the most critical
junctures of the second half of the 20th century

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:51.810
and it ended with Lisl Auman."

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:57.511
So I took away a couple of lessons from working
with Hunter through the years. And I write,

00:15:57.511 --> 00:16:03.670
"that Hunter taught me to be your own person
and to write your own story." Not in the literal

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:08.430
sense but that we're in the driver's seat
of our own destinies. He taught me that each

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:13.980
one of us must ride the crest of a high and
beautiful wave of our own.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:20.839
"Ski the mountain. Swim the river. Sing the
song. Dance the dance. Write the book. Buy

00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:23.820
the ticket and take the ride," he said.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:29.120
So I couldn't help but think that looking
back with the right kind of eyes that when

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:34.880
Lisl wrote her letter to Hunter and he miraculously
wrote back that it was the high water mark

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:41.860
in her long journey. It was the place where
her wave finally broke and rolled back.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:46.139
So when you read this book, and I hope that
you will, there are three lessons to take

00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:48.640
away from it.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:55.110
The first is that don't let your daughter
climb in the car with a skinhead. And I-I

00:16:55.110 --> 00:17:00.790
say that facetiously but I'm not joking because
any one of us, I-I don't remember I-I recalled

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:06.990
to Tracey about 20 years ago I came and saw
the Grateful Dead at Shoreline. And after

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:11.851
a concert any one of us can climb in a car,
"I need a right home." Or you climb in a car

00:17:11.851 --> 00:17:16.319
with friend and they go in and rob a 7-11
and you have no intention. You can still be

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:18.559
held liable for that crime.

00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:22.640
And that's the second call to action and the
second lesson of the book. Is let's abolish

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:29.450
the felony murder rule. We're one of the only
countries left in the world, democratic societies,

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.559
that still has a felony murder law.

00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:38.789
It was a remnant of English common law from
the 16th century and England has banned it.

00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:42.470
Most European nations have banned it and we're
the only ones left. So I think we need to

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.960
abolish that law.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.789
But the-the last thing, really the heart of
the book and why it's called Dear Dr. Thompson,

00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:55.859
is that I think all of us should write our
own letters. Write a letter that changes somebody's

00:17:55.859 --> 00:18:02.899
life. Develop a software, write a book, write
a memo, do something that changes our world.

00:18:02.899 --> 00:18:08.629
And I think that is what Hunter would have
wanted from all of us.

00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:17.159
And that to me is the Gonzo ethic. And it
isn't about a-a lifestyle of guns or drugs;

00:18:17.159 --> 00:18:20.759
it's about changing the world and changing
his life. And that, I think that's what Hunter

00:18:20.759 --> 00:18:27.009
did through his writing and I hope that this
book is at least a little bit in part a legacy

00:18:27.009 --> 00:18:32.169
to him and a testament to what the great work
that he did in his life.

00:18:32.169 --> 00:18:37.990
So I'll leave you with the last part of the
book where Lisl is going home.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:45.490
These are some of the photos from Hunter's
funeral. That's him running for sheriff. And

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:51.120
this is our cocktail napkin at his funeral
about one of the other lessons: never call

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.120
9-1-1, never. This means you.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.120
[pause]

00:18:53.120 --> 00:19:03.639
"Leaving the Hudson Hotel in Buffalo Creek
turned into a much harder chore than Lisl

00:19:03.639 --> 00:19:09.979
could have ever imagined. Moving took almost
a decade to complete. She had lost nearly

00:19:09.979 --> 00:19:13.639
everything in the process and two people had
died.

00:19:13.639 --> 00:19:18.159
"She went to the Hudson Hotel looking for
a better, simpler, life in the forest above

00:19:18.159 --> 00:19:23.440
Denver, but she went out of the frying pan
and into the fire by moving in with Shawn

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:29.309
Cheever, and against every instinct in her
soul climbing into the Thunder Chicken.

00:19:29.309 --> 00:19:33.279
"Even though she had been had at Hudson Hotel
for only a few months it had taken her eight

00:19:33.279 --> 00:19:37.740
years to be finally free from its maw.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.799
"The woman who appeared to Lisl in her dream
just days before this calumny happened was

00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:49.299
spot on prophetic. Lisl was having a picnic
on the, with her family on the edge of a lake

00:19:49.299 --> 00:19:55.179
and the woman pointed to a big, ominous cloud
off in the distance and she told Lisl that

00:19:55.179 --> 00:20:02.059
this was the beginning of a very long and
dark storm. Fortuna had been right. A Category

00:20:02.059 --> 00:20:09.110
five storm had moved through bringing with
it hurricane force winds and torrential flood

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:14.059
of tears and wrought devastation to the lives
of the VanderJagt's, the Jaehnig's, and the

00:20:14.059 --> 00:20:15.330
Auman's.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:21.470
"But the storm was finally passing. The sun
was shining once again leaving the landscape

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:28.009
of Lisl's life verdant and fertile; a field
of dreams where she was now free to cultivate

00:20:28.009 --> 00:20:32.009
the life about which she had only dreamed.

00:20:32.009 --> 00:20:38.080
"The storm for all of its heartache and terror
had washed away the ugliness from her life.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:44.029
So instead of being broken and sullied as
many do be-become behind bars, Lisl emerged

00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:49.349
from prison fresh and clean and ready to prove
herself.

00:20:49.349 --> 00:20:55.929
"On the evening of April 26, 2005, Colleen
Auerbach, Lisl's mother, picked Lisl up from

00:20:55.929 --> 00:21:03.229
Tully Hall. Lisl had with her one small bag.
It was the only thing left after eight years

00:21:03.229 --> 00:21:09.690
in prison. Her move from the Hudson Hotel
was finally complete. It was the best car

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:14.059
ride of her life. She was finally going home."

00:21:14.059 --> 00:21:17.820
Thank you everybody for your time today. And
thank you Google for the Author's at Google

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.320
series and for Tracey for putting this together.
I really appreciate it. Thank you all.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.159
[applause]

00:21:23.159 --> 00:21:24.999
[pause]

00:21:24.999 --> 00:21:29.919
I'd love to entertain a few questions or --

00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:33.679
[pause]

00:21:33.679 --> 00:21:34.679
whatnot.

00:21:34.679 --> 00:21:36.139
[pause]

00:21:36.139 --> 00:21:46.269
&gt;&gt;Tracey: Yeah, if any, if anyone has any
questions just come on up to the microphone.

00:21:46.269 --> 00:21:47.269
[pause]

00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:48.269
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: Howdy.

00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:50.860
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Hi. So I saw your, the
picture of the fireworks --

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.860
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: Yeah.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:52.860
&gt;&gt;male in audience: and the ash-launch?

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:53.860
&gt;&gt;Matt Mosley: Uh-huh.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:54.860
&gt;&gt;male in audience: can you just tell the
story of-of Hunter's funeral and --

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.409
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: [laughs]

00:21:57.409 --> 00:22:05.090
&gt;&gt;male in audience: your part in that?

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.502
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: Sure. You bet.

00:22:07.502 --> 00:22:08.502
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Thanks.

00:22:08.502 --> 00:22:13.179
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: You can see here, so when
Hunter died he had left a-a little video clip

00:22:13.179 --> 00:22:18.850
from a 19, I think early '70s BBC documentary
crew film-filmed him walkin ' around L.A.

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:24.749
with Ralph Steadman and he, they went into
a mortuary and they filmed Hunter described

00:22:24.749 --> 00:22:33.830
he wanted for his funeral. He wanted a 153
foot tall Gonzo fist to be shot, to be constructed

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:38.099
at his home at Owl Farm and they would shoot
his ashes out of that.

00:22:38.099 --> 00:22:45.019
So he died and Johnny Depp said, "Oh yeah.
Is that what you want 'cause that's what you're

00:22:45.019 --> 00:22:47.509
gonna get. The joke's finally on you, man."

00:22:47.509 --> 00:22:53.149
So Johnny Depp built this at incredible personal
expense and hired me to be the communications

00:22:53.149 --> 00:23:01.830
director and kind of Owl Farm family spokesperson.
And it was one of the most wildest, craziest

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:06.600
nights I could ever imagine. For a funeral
even. [laughs]

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:12.649
You can see we've got the, we've got the red
shark here parked at the base. So just that

00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:16.600
gives you an-an indication of just how tall
and how big it really was. And then Ralph

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.899
Steadman did this little drawing of here's
Hunter floating out into the ether. [laughs]

00:23:21.899 --> 00:23:22.899
[laughter]

00:23:22.899 --> 00:23:29.539
Yeah. So thanks for your question. It was,
it was a really great -- and it was, it was

00:23:29.539 --> 00:23:33.059
then too that I really started to-to struggle
with what did Hunter mean? What was his legacy?

00:23:33.059 --> 00:23:38.789
And I tried to say, "Go beyond his savage
behavior and look at him as an artist. Look

00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:44.830
at him as a revolutionary journalist and what
his contributions were." And that's what I

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:55.320
tried to frame it as in the media too. So
thanks.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.320
[pause]

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.679
You 'all got any questions?

00:23:57.679 --> 00:23:58.679
[pause]

00:23:58.679 --> 00:23:59.679
I was joking.

00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:00.679
[pause]

00:24:00.679 --> 00:24:05.450
&gt;&gt;male in audience 2: So I see that your mom
wrote a very positive review --

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:06.450
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: [laughs]

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:07.450
&gt;&gt;male in audience 2: of your book --

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:08.450
[laughter]

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.230
&gt;&gt;male in audience 2: on Amazon which I think
is great. I wrote a book too and my Mom has

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:11.489
not reviewed it, but --

00:24:11.489 --> 00:24:12.740
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: Maybe-maybe, oh --

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:17.989
&gt;&gt;male in audience 2: Well, so the question
is did she tell you this was coming?

00:24:17.989 --> 00:24:26.249
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: [laughs] The review? No, she
didn't. And-and [laughs] it was very funny.

00:24:26.249 --> 00:24:32.619
I had a book signing at my home where I grew
up in Lafayette, Louisiana and I got a call

00:24:32.619 --> 00:24:41.200
from a newspaper who said, "I've just spoken
with your mother." [laughs] And I said, I

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:46.599
said, "Okay, now it's like PR/Mother, PR Agent/Mother.
And I said, "Mom I think I'll handle that

00:24:46.599 --> 00:25:32.179
side of it and you can handle the mothering."
Maybe they're one in the same. I don't know.

00:25:32.179 --> 00:25:57.649
Thanks for that astute observation.

00:25:57.649 --> 00:26:02.749
[pause]

00:26:02.749 --> 00:26:48.609
That's funny. I'll have to tell her about
that.

00:26:48.609 --> 00:26:53.700
Hi.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:27:25.339
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Hi. So one question
I have is I would assume that a lot of people

00:27:25.339 --> 00:27:42.440
who are convicted for murder would kind of
I guess say that they were innocent like all

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:58.769
along. So how did Lisl like make her point
so compelling and like actually get someone

00:27:58.769 --> 00:28:29.119
to listen and advocate for her? 'Cause I would
assume that a lot of people would just like

00:28:29.119 --> 00:29:02.550
say they were innocent. Which in her case
she was.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:09.119
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: That is a great question because
she tried to get traction and her family was

00:29:09.119 --> 00:29:17.359
yelling in a megaphone, but nobody would listen.
And they wrote to Alan Dershowitz, they wrote

00:29:17.359 --> 00:29:26.669
to all the great Johnny Cochran's and all
the great attorneys. And nobody would take

00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:27.669
up the cause.

00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:28.879
So at the end of the book I talk about Hunter's
sad irony of involvement. People were saying,

00:29:28.879 --> 00:29:30.779
"Wasn't it great that Hunter got involved
and got her out of jail? Wasn't this so cool?

00:29:30.779 --> 00:29:36.360
Are you gonna guys have a big party with an
open bar and bunting?" We'd say, "No."

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:41.499
The sad irony is that people shouldn't need
a celebrity to get out of jail. The justice

00:29:41.499 --> 00:29:44.029
system should work on its own. And people
shouldn't need people sending out press releases

00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:45.029
and they shouldn't need Warren Zevon playing
"Lawyers, Guns and Money" on the west steps

00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:46.029
of the Capitol.

00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:47.029
The justice system should function normally.
Nobody should need celebrities. In fact what

00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:48.029
about all the people that are in here right
now that don't have anybody championing their

00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:49.029
cause? And there are people.

00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:50.029
There was this series done in I encourage
everyone to watch it. It's called the Front

00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:51.029
Line - 5. It was a Front Line PBS series of
people serving sentences remarkably similar

00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:52.029
to Lisl's. Somebody made, their cousin made
'em get in the car and drive like they were

00:29:52.029 --> 00:29:53.029
gonna go pick up something to eat for dinner
and never came home again. Things like that.

00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:54.029
There's a lot of opportunity out there to
correct some of these injustices, but who's

00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:55.029
gonna listen to them?

00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:56.029
Thanks. Good question.

00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:57.029
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Thank you.

00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:58.029
[pause]

00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:59.029
&gt;&gt;female in audience 2: Hi there.

00:29:59.029 --> 00:30:00.029
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: Hi.

00:30:00.029 --> 00:30:01.029
&gt;&gt;female in audience 2: So the minute you
mentioned that Hunter took his own life my

00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:02.029
brain said, "Huh-uh." So how are we sure that
he took his own life?

00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:03.029
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: [laughs]

00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:04.029
&gt;&gt;female in audience 2: Because you shared
that right after you talked about this horrific

00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:05.029
article he wrote in Vanity Fair.

00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:06.029
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: Yeah. It was, I had talked
to him actually the night before. I was in

00:30:06.029 --> 00:30:07.029
Grand Junction. I was doing a political campaign
tour and he said, "You gotta come over. We're

00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:08.029
gonna get a decision soon." He thought.

00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:09.029
&gt;&gt;female in audience 2: Um.

00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:10.029
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: He felt that there would be
a decision soon.

00:30:10.029 --> 00:30:11.029
And I had to go back home and the next night
he, I learned he killed himself. It was the

00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:12.029
next day, so I don't think it had anything
to do with me, obviously. But he had polo

00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:13.029
is my life. He had projects stacked up on
his desk. He had the Lisl case that he felt

00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:14.029
was gonna, he felt, he had some hope for.
So it was very puzzling to all of a sudden

00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:15.029
he did take his life.

00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:16.029
The forensics, there was an investigation
done in Aspen which basically turns out it

00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:17.029
happened just the way they said it did. He
shot himself. His grandson, Will and Juan

00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:18.029
were staying in the guest cabin next door.
So that was a little tragic that they had

00:30:18.029 --> 00:30:19.029
to go through that.

00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:20.029
But he was in a lot of pain too. He had a
cast on his leg where he had apparently taken

00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:21.029
a wrong turn at the mini bar in Hawaii and
he also had hip problems that he was refusing

00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:22.029
to kinda get fixed. So he was in a lot of
physical pain but it's still very puzzling

00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:23.029
to a lot of people why he took his life.

00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:24.029
&gt;&gt;female in audience 2: Um.

00:30:24.029 --> 00:30:25.029
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: Was he was warrior or was
he a wimp? Was he coward or was he courageous

00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:26.029
in that? I don't know.

00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:27.029
Thank you.

00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:28.029
&gt;&gt;female in audience 2: You're welcome. I
have another question.

00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:29.029
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: Uh-huh.

00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:30.029
&gt;&gt;female in audience 2: Could you tell us
a little bit more about what you do beyond

00:30:30.029 --> 00:30:31.029
being an author? I know Tracey mentioned a
little bit, but maybe a quick little bio on

00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:32.029
all the other interesting things you're a
part of.

00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:33.029
&gt;&gt;Matt Mosley: Good. Thank you.

00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:34.029
I, oh I'm sorry.

00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:35.029
Yeah, I-I work in for a company called Intermountain
Corporate Affairs in Denver and we do strategic

00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:36.029
communications and government relations. But
this is the kind of stuff I would love to

00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:37.029
do. And it's being a-a spokesperson, it's
fighting for a cause, it's being out there

00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:38.029
advocating. And I would love to write another
book, but I don't necessarily aspire to be

00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:39.029
a full-time writer. I wanna have, I wanna
go do things and live it and then write about

00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:40.029
it. And not necessarily just be the writer,
but be-be an activist too.

00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:41.029
And that's why it was important I think to
end it on that note about writing. Each one

00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:42.029
of us should write a little letter all the
time. Do something that changes the world.

00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:43.029
[pause]

00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:44.029
So, great.

00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:45.029
[pause]

00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:46.029
&gt;&gt;male in audience 3: Just curious if the
Governor had comments after the verdict got

00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:47.029
reversed.

00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:48.029
&gt;&gt;Matt Moseley: Yes, very good question because
I spent three years writing this book and

00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:49.029
I'd already been her family spokesperson so
I had three boxes of research before I even

00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:50.029
put one perd-word to paper.

00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:51.029
I went to talk to Bill Ritter, I went to talk
to the Police Chief, Jerry Whitman. I tried

00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:52.029
talking to the current DA and none of them
would talk to me. Once she walked outta jail,

00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:53.029
none of 'em said a single mo-nother word about
Lisl.

00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:54.029
She was the most important case for five years
and they demonized her every chance they could

00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:55.029
and yet when she got out there was not a single
word more spoken. And this is important, I

00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:58.749
tried to get the research from the Denver
District Attorney's Office. I sent a written

00:30:58.749 --> 00:31:05.749
request in. It took dozens of phone calls
and a year later before I finally got a response

00:31:05.749 --> 00:31:10.849
and they said, "Sure, we'll let you look at
all the 12 boxes, but you're gonna have to

00:31:10.849 --> 00:31:18.239
pay $150.00 per box. You're gonna have to
pay a $50 per hour attorney redaction fee

00:31:18.239 --> 00:31:22.779
for us to go through the boxes first and then
you're gonna have to pay another $50 for an

00:31:22.779 --> 00:31:25.190
attorney to sit there when you go through
them."

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:29.869
That was a ridiculous exercise because I already
had all the research and all the stuff was

00:31:29.869 --> 00:31:35.859
already available in the Denver District,
the Denver County Records Department.

00:31:35.859 --> 00:31:42.369
So the fact that they stonewalled it, they
obfuscated, it says to me, speaks volumes

00:31:42.369 --> 00:31:47.269
about what they feel their own culpability
in the situation was. And that if they really

00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:50.690
felt, if they really felt that they were on
solid ground, they would have cooperated and

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:55.789
they'd have said, "Yeah, we were right because
of x, y, and x and we still stand by it."

00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:58.369
Nobody said a word.

00:31:58.369 --> 00:32:00.499
So, but thank you for the question.

00:32:00.499 --> 00:32:01.539
[pause]

00:32:01.539 --> 00:32:03.620
Go ahead.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:09.965
&gt;&gt;Tracey: Any other questions? Okay. Well
thank you, Matt. Thanks for joining us.

00:32:09.965 --> 00:32:12.659
&gt;&gt;Matt Mosley: Thank you, Tracey and thanks
everybody. It's been really fun. Appreciate

00:32:12.659 --> 00:32:13.659
it. Thank you Google!

00:32:13.659 --> 00:32:13.660
