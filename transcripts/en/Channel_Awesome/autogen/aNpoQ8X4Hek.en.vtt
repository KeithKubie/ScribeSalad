um<00:05:13.160><c> the</c><00:05:14.160><c> reason</c><00:05:14.400><c> I</c><00:05:14.730><c> think</c><00:05:15.120><c> so</c><00:05:15.570><c> far</c><00:05:15.930><c> I</c><00:05:16.260><c> think</c><00:05:16.740><c> it</c>

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
um the reason I think so far I think it
 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.630 align:start position:0%
um the reason I think so far I think it
works<00:05:17.130><c> is</c><00:05:17.460><c> because</c><00:05:18.180><c> a</c><00:05:19.040><c> when</c><00:05:20.040><c> she</c><00:05:20.280><c> makes</c><00:05:20.490><c> a</c>

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
works is because a when she makes a
 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
works is because a when she makes a
mistake<00:05:20.790><c> she</c><00:05:21.150><c> comes</c><00:05:21.390><c> around</c><00:05:21.690><c> to</c><00:05:21.810><c> it</c><00:05:21.930><c> very</c>

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 align:start position:0%
mistake she comes around to it very
 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
mistake she comes around to it very
quickly<00:05:22.440><c> and</c><00:05:22.800><c> that's</c><00:05:23.550><c> good</c><00:05:24.320><c> so</c><00:05:25.320><c> because</c><00:05:25.890><c> there</c>

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 align:start position:0%
quickly and that's good so because there
 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.770 align:start position:0%
quickly and that's good so because there
were<00:05:26.100><c> points</c><00:05:26.370><c> here</c><00:05:26.640><c> I'm</c><00:05:26.790><c> just</c><00:05:27.030><c> like</c><00:05:27.240><c> oh</c><00:05:27.390><c> come</c>

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 align:start position:0%

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 align:start position:0%
way that sort of makes sense like I said
 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.730 align:start position:0%
way that sort of makes sense like I said
using<00:05:34.770><c> the</c><00:05:35.010><c> moves</c><00:05:35.340><c> and</c><00:05:35.610><c> seeing</c><00:05:35.820><c> that</c><00:05:36.000><c> it</c><00:05:36.150><c> works</c>

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 align:start position:0%
using the moves and seeing that it works
 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.170 align:start position:0%
using the moves and seeing that it works
that<00:05:37.740><c> was</c><00:05:37.920><c> very</c><00:05:38.070><c> effective</c><00:05:38.220><c> that</c><00:05:38.700><c> that</c><00:05:38.880><c> does</c><00:05:39.060><c> a</c>

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
that was very effective that that does a
 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.470 align:start position:0%
that was very effective that that does a

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
very smart way of doing it um but here's
 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.390 align:start position:0%
very smart way of doing it um but here's
the<00:05:42.600><c> other</c><00:05:42.750><c> thing</c><00:05:42.870><c> I'm</c><00:05:43.410><c> so</c><00:05:43.830><c> realizing</c>

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
the other thing I'm so realizing
 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.130 align:start position:0%
the other thing I'm so realizing
especially<00:05:45.240><c> in</c><00:05:45.360><c> this</c><00:05:45.480><c> one</c><00:05:45.690><c> where</c><00:05:45.900><c> she's</c>

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
especially in this one where she's
 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.950 align:start position:0%
especially in this one where she's
having<00:05:46.410><c> a</c><00:05:46.740><c> real</c><00:05:47.070><c> hard</c><00:05:47.130><c> time</c><00:05:47.310><c> getting</c>

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
having a real hard time getting
 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.870 align:start position:0%
having a real hard time getting
airbending<00:05:48.960><c> and</c><00:05:49.080><c> I</c><00:05:49.440><c> like</c><00:05:50.040><c> that</c><00:05:50.310><c> airbending</c>

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
airbending and I like that airbending
 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.850 align:start position:0%
airbending and I like that airbending
and<00:05:51.000><c> not</c><00:05:51.180><c> firebending</c><00:05:51.990><c> because</c><00:05:52.560><c> that</c><00:05:52.710><c> would</c>

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
and not firebending because that would
 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
and not firebending because that would
be<00:05:52.980><c> the</c><00:05:53.100><c> easy</c><00:05:53.250><c> route</c><00:05:53.460><c> to</c><00:05:53.640><c> go</c><00:05:53.760><c> again</c><00:05:54.060><c> they</c><00:05:54.180><c> would</c>

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 align:start position:0%
be the easy route to go again they would
 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.360 align:start position:0%
be the easy route to go again they would
have<00:05:54.420><c> had</c><00:05:54.600><c> the</c><00:05:54.930><c> opposites</c><00:05:55.530><c> because</c><00:05:55.800><c> that</c><00:05:56.010><c> was</c>

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 align:start position:0%
have had the opposites because that was
 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
have had the opposites because that was
the<00:05:56.460><c> hardest</c><00:05:56.670><c> with</c><00:05:56.820><c> Aang</c><00:05:57.060><c> was</c><00:05:57.270><c> like</c><00:05:57.420><c> Earth</c>

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 align:start position:0%
the hardest with Aang was like Earth
 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
the hardest with Aang was like Earth
well<00:05:58.140><c> that's</c><00:05:58.380><c> the</c><00:05:58.500><c> opposite</c><00:05:58.830><c> of</c><00:05:58.890><c> air</c><00:05:59.100><c> well</c><00:05:59.610><c> now</c>

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 align:start position:0%
well that's the opposite of air well now
 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
well that's the opposite of air well now
you<00:05:59.790><c> have</c><00:05:59.880><c> water</c><00:06:00.240><c> opposite</c><00:06:01.080><c> of</c><00:06:01.140><c> that</c><00:06:01.260><c> would</c><00:06:01.380><c> be</c>

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 align:start position:0%
you have water opposite of that would be
 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.190 align:start position:0%
you have water opposite of that would be
fire<00:06:01.770><c> and</c><00:06:02.100><c> they</c><00:06:02.580><c> do</c><00:06:02.640><c> air</c><00:06:03.120><c> I</c><00:06:03.390><c> like</c><00:06:03.840><c> that</c><00:06:04.080><c> because</c>

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
fire and they do air I like that because
 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.700 align:start position:0%
fire and they do air I like that because

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
her she's a little different because you
 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
her she's a little different because you
have<00:06:15.720><c> a</c><00:06:15.870><c> blowhard</c><00:06:16.320><c> and</c><00:06:16.560><c> she</c><00:06:16.770><c> the</c><00:06:16.980><c> fall</c><00:06:17.160><c> of</c>

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 align:start position:0%
have a blowhard and she the fall of
 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.910 align:start position:0%
have a blowhard and she the fall of

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 align:start position:0%
philosophies are what is not gelling
 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
philosophies are what is not gelling
here<00:06:23.310><c> and</c><00:06:23.490><c> why</c><00:06:23.670><c> it's</c><00:06:23.850><c> so</c><00:06:23.940><c> difficult</c><00:06:24.150><c> for</c><00:06:24.390><c> her</c>

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 align:start position:0%
here and why it's so difficult for her
 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.540 align:start position:0%
here and why it's so difficult for her
so<00:06:24.780><c> I</c><00:06:24.810><c> I</c><00:06:25.140><c> think</c><00:06:25.410><c> that's</c><00:06:25.740><c> cool</c><00:06:25.890><c> I</c><00:06:25.950><c> like</c><00:06:26.220><c> they</c>

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 align:start position:0%
so I I think that's cool I like they
 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.800 align:start position:0%

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 align:start position:0%
this character and why I think this is a

this character and why I think this is a

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 align:start position:0%
good route to take with the character is
 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.740 align:start position:0%
good route to take with the character is
