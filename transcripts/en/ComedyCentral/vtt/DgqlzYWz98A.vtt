00:00:03.168 --> 00:00:04.704 align:start size:66% position:34%
Good day to you, sir.

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:06.372 align:start size:59% position:41%
How may I help you?

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:09.809 align:start position:0%
The Barber said I have
"Delirium of the Bowels,"

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:12.345 align:start position:0%
but the bloodletting's
just made it worse.

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:15.181 align:start size:75% position:25%
Well, you've come
to the right place, sir.

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:18.418 align:start size:91% position:9%
No need for any more barbaric
or outdated procedures.

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.253 align:start size:63% position:38%
Our chief of surgery
and his team,

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:22.555 align:start size:53% position:47%
they are the best
in the nation.

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:24.290 size:84% position:42%
If you come right this way.

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:31.230 align:start size:72% position:28%
Dr. Thackery, I have
your next patient here.

00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:33.199
(chair squeaks)

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:37.237 align:start position:0%
Then the game is on.

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:40.874
(kids' voices)
Junior!

00:00:45.377 --> 00:00:48.381
The patient is
a 38-year-old man

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:51.217
with an acute infection
in his lower bowel.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.387
Untreated, his condition
will quickly deteriorate.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.424
I'll make an incision thusly.

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:00.927
(sniffs)

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.895
Ahh.

00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:05.798
And then operate using
a revolutionary method

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.467
of my own design.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.436
Nurse Elkins, scalpel.

00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:15.275
(squishing sounds)

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.946 align:start size:53% position:47% line:85%
Pulse increasing.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.946 size:84% position:58%
Scissors.

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:30.456 align:start size:78% position:22% line:85%
Pulse stability dropping!

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:30.456 size:84% position:42%
We're losing him, Thackery.

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:33.426
Let's hope to God this works.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:34.661 align:start size:66% position:34%
(Kid Chickering)
We've lost his pulse!

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:37.563 align:start position:0%
(Kid Gallinger)
Thackery, it's over.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:38.664
No!

00:01:38.697 --> 00:01:40.066
He just needs more glue!

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.801 align:start size:47% position:53%
We've lost him.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.207 size:81% position:41%
Damn it!

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.275
(grunts)

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:57.350 align:start size:84% position:16%
You're not supposed to have
those before dinner.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
Shut up!
I want more Pixy Stix!

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:01.554 align:start size:91% position:9%
(screaming)

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:04.957 align:start size:81% position:19%
Oh, dear.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.492 align:start position:0%
Right this way.

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:10.062 align:start size:72% position:28%
Dr. Thackery, in light
of today's... events...

00:02:10.095 --> 00:02:12.465
the Board of Directors saw fit

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:14.901 align:start size:66% position:34%
to hire an additional
chief of surgery.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:18.037 align:start position:0%
Like hell!
The Knick is mine!

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.305 align:start size:66% position:34%
Dr. Thackery, please.

00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:20.373 align:start position:0%
Mine!

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.574 align:start size:47% position:53%
No, it is mine.

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:23.309 align:start position:0% line:92%
Mine!

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:23.309 align:start size:16% position:84%
Mine!

00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:25.878
Doctors, doctors, doctors!
In this hospital, we share.

00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:28.247
We share.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.518 align:start position:0%
(woman)
Is this a bad time?

00:02:33.018 --> 00:02:34.587
Hello, John.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.155 align:start position:0%
Amy?

00:02:36.188 --> 00:02:37.290 align:start position:0%
(sniffles)

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:44.363 size:75% position:38%
(grunts)

00:02:44.396 --> 00:02:45.898 align:start position:0%
Who got your nose?

00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:48.334 align:start size:66% position:34%
After we parted ways,

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:51.437 align:start size:81% position:19%
it was ravaged by cooties.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.973 align:start position:0%
We can sew your face
to your arm.

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:58.010 align:start size:69% position:31%
Sew my face to my arm?

00:02:58.043 --> 00:02:59.278 align:start size:50% position:50%
That's the cure?

00:02:59.311 --> 00:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
Yeah.

00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:04.184 size:84% position:58%
Are you looking at my nose?

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:06.986 align:start size:31% position:69%
(sobbing)

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.020 align:start position:0%
(Herman Barrow)
Right this way, Amy,

00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:09.055 align:start position:0%
already looking good.

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:10.723 align:start size:50% position:50% line:85%
Awesome.

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:10.723 align:start size:50% position:50%
That is so cool.

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:12.325 align:start position:0% line:92%
Cool.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.060 align:start size:97% position:3%
(Kid Algernon)
How did you do that? Great job.

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.397 align:start position:0%
So that's-- that's it?

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.535
I just... stay like this with
my face attached to my arm?

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:24.003
(agreeing enthusiastically)

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
You guys are here 'cause you're,
you're walking me out or...

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:28.174 line:85%
Yup.

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:28.174 align:start size:78% position:22%
Yup.

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:31.344 align:start size:56% position:44%
Oh, and don't pull
your... arm out.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.845 align:start size:75% position:25%
It'll, like, rip it off.

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:36.849 align:start position:0%
Any sort of home care,
I should... worry about or...

00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:38.050 align:start size:16% position:84% line:92%
Nope.

00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:38.050
Just go.

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:39.352 align:start position:0% line:85%
All right.

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:39.352 align:start size:47% position:53%
All right, bye.

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:40.386 align:start position:0%
We're gonna keep in touch,
all right, or...

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.321 align:start size:47% position:53% line:85%
Yeah.

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.321 align:start size:16% position:84%
Okay.

00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:43.990
(Amy)
Oh, you guys,
it does not look weird?

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:45.424
(all)
No, no, no.

00:03:45.457 --> 00:03:47.093
'Cause it feels weird,

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:48.427
I mean, it honestly--

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.595
Ow!

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:51.664 line:92%
Ooh...

00:03:51.697 --> 00:03:53.866
(screaming)

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:55.868 align:start size:41% position:59%
Ooh.

00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:55.935 align:start position:0% line:92%
Be careful!

00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:56.901 align:start size:13% position:88%
Bye!
