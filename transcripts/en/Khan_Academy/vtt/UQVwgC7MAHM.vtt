00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:03.288
- [Instructor] Now in these bottom four,

00:00:03.288 --> 00:00:04.422
let's think about the situation

00:00:04.422 --> 00:00:07.455
where both of the curves might move,

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:09.568
so let's first imagine a scenario

00:00:09.568 --> 00:00:11.235
where supply goes up

00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:15.066
and demand goes down,

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:18.990
so once again, maybe a major producer

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.366
is entering into the market,

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.497
supply goes up and that study comes out

00:00:22.497 --> 00:00:24.540
that ice cream is less
healthy than suspected,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.892
so demand goes down.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:26.778
What is going to happen

00:00:26.778 --> 00:00:28.958
to your equilibrium price and quantity?

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.904
Pause this video and try to figure it out.

00:00:31.904 --> 00:00:34.295
Well, if the supply goes up,

00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:36.123
the supply curve is going to shift

00:00:36.123 --> 00:00:39.290
to the right just like we saw up here,

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:44.589
so our supply curve is
going to shift like this,

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.496
so this would be S2, it's
going to shift to the right

00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:49.641
and down and so, our demand,

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:52.565
if it goes down for a given price,

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:53.840
people would demand less quantity,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.234
so we're shifting to the left and down,

00:00:57.234 --> 00:00:59.711
this is D2 right over here,

00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:01.236
shifted to the left and down

00:01:01.236 --> 00:01:03.199
and so, what is our new equilibrium point,

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.413
at least how we've drawn
it right over here?

00:01:05.413 --> 00:01:07.657
So, our new equilibrium
point looks like this.

00:01:07.657 --> 00:01:10.533
It's clear that our price went down,

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:13.166
so price has gone down

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.121
but what about quantity?

00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:17.246
Well, this is actually
an interesting thing.

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:18.580
Depending on how I draw it,

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.210
if we don't know the exact numbers here,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.337
I could have drawn it so that the quantity

00:01:22.337 --> 00:01:23.592
might have stayed the same,

00:01:23.592 --> 00:01:24.815
I could have drawn it here,

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:26.409
it looks like the quantity
went up a little bit

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.603
but if I drew my new
demand curve like this,

00:01:29.603 --> 00:01:31.860
my quantity would have
gone down a little bit,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.169
so actually in this situation,

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:37.667
price for sure is going to go down,

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:40.304
you have more competition
amongst the suppliers

00:01:40.304 --> 00:01:41.905
and there's less demand

00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:44.389
but it's unclear what happens to quantity,

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:46.096
so quantity in this situation

00:01:46.096 --> 00:01:48.596
is indeterminate we could say.

00:01:49.646 --> 00:01:52.111
Now let's go the other way around.

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.028
Let's assume that supply goes down,

00:01:55.923 --> 00:01:58.923
supply goes down and demand goes up.

00:02:01.584 --> 00:02:02.785
So, what would happen in that case?

00:02:02.785 --> 00:02:04.937
Pause the video and try to figure it out.

00:02:04.937 --> 00:02:05.969
Or if supply goes down,

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.256
our supply curve is going
to shift to the left and up.

00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:12.190
At a given price we will supply less

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.190
and so, this would be S2 right over here.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.732
We're gonna shift to the left and up

00:02:18.732 --> 00:02:21.533
and our demand has gone up.

00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:23.803
At a given price we would demand more

00:02:23.803 --> 00:02:26.270
or at a given quantity we
would be willing to pay more,

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.753
so we would shift our
demand curve now, D2,

00:02:29.753 --> 00:02:31.852
we would shift to the right and up

00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:33.291
and our new equilibrium point,

00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:34.658
the way that I've drawn it

00:02:34.658 --> 00:02:36.158
is right over here

00:02:37.217 --> 00:02:39.134
and so, here we have P2

00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:42.708
and then here, at least
the way I've drawn it,

00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:45.883
I have Q2, my graph is
getting a little bit messy

00:02:45.883 --> 00:02:46.860
but what happened?

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.353
Well, the price unambiguously goes up.

00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:51.186
It makes sense.

00:02:51.186 --> 00:02:52.587
Our supply has gone down

00:02:52.587 --> 00:02:55.432
and more people wanna buy the ice cream

00:02:55.432 --> 00:02:56.735
but what about quantity?

00:02:56.735 --> 00:02:59.306
Well, once again, depending
on how you draw it,

00:02:59.306 --> 00:03:01.001
I could make the quantity
go up a little bit,

00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:02.202
I could make it stay neutral,

00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:03.053
I could make it go down,

00:03:03.053 --> 00:03:05.751
so you would actually
have to know the specifics

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:07.905
of those curves exactly their shapes

00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:10.814
in order to figure out
what happens to quantity.

00:03:10.814 --> 00:03:11.669
You can't make a judgment

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.787
just based on these general upward

00:03:13.787 --> 00:03:16.242
and downward sloping curves.

00:03:16.242 --> 00:03:19.398
Now let's go and make
both of them increase.

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:22.924
So, let's say that both supply goes up

00:03:22.924 --> 00:03:24.507
and demand goes up.

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.572
So, supply going up,

00:03:28.572 --> 00:03:31.094
the curve would shift to the right

00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:34.023
and down, so that's supply two

00:03:34.023 --> 00:03:36.924
and then demand going up,

00:03:36.924 --> 00:03:38.613
demand at a given quantity,

00:03:38.613 --> 00:03:41.302
people would be willing
to pay a higher price

00:03:41.302 --> 00:03:43.167
or at a given price,

00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:45.033
people would be willing to take on

00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:46.926
a higher quantity,

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:49.681
so demand has gone over here,

00:03:49.681 --> 00:03:51.805
so we've shifted to the right and up

00:03:51.805 --> 00:03:55.548
and our new equilibrium point
looks like right over there,

00:03:55.548 --> 00:03:57.210
so it's clear, it's unambiguous

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.027
that our new equilibrium
quantity Q2 has gone up.

00:04:01.027 --> 00:04:03.327
Q, quantity has gone up

00:04:03.327 --> 00:04:04.962
but price now is ambiguous.

00:04:04.962 --> 00:04:07.369
Depending on how I drew these curves,

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:09.720
I could make it look like
the price is the same,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.114
I could make it look like it's gone up

00:04:11.114 --> 00:04:13.483
or I could make it look
like it's gone down

00:04:13.483 --> 00:04:16.397
and so, the price here is ambiguous.

00:04:16.397 --> 00:04:18.016
And last but not least,

00:04:18.016 --> 00:04:19.346
let's imagine a situation

00:04:19.346 --> 00:04:21.112
where they both go down,

00:04:21.112 --> 00:04:22.503
where supply goes down

00:04:22.503 --> 00:04:24.253
and demand goes down.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.200
So, supply going down will
shift to the left and up.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.071
Once again, one way to think about it

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:36.027
at a given price you would
be willing to supply less,

00:04:36.027 --> 00:04:39.048
so that's S2 right over here

00:04:39.048 --> 00:04:42.961
and demand, I'll do demand
in a different color,

00:04:42.961 --> 00:04:44.313
it's nice to do it in a different color,

00:04:44.313 --> 00:04:47.128
if my demand has gone down,

00:04:47.128 --> 00:04:48.819
if my demand goes down,

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:50.236
at a given price,

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:53.007
people will demand less,

00:04:53.007 --> 00:04:54.772
so my demand has gone down,

00:04:54.772 --> 00:04:58.012
something like that or at a given quantity

00:04:58.012 --> 00:04:59.519
people would be willing to pay less

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:02.053
and so, my equilibrium
point right over here,

00:05:02.053 --> 00:05:04.220
my equilibrium quantity Q2

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.854
has clearly gone down.

00:05:06.854 --> 00:05:08.315
That makes sense, they're supplying less

00:05:08.315 --> 00:05:09.643
and people want it less,

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:11.482
so quantity clearly went down,

00:05:11.482 --> 00:05:13.206
quantity goes down

00:05:13.206 --> 00:05:16.002
but price once again is ambiguous

00:05:16.002 --> 00:05:17.499
depending on how I draw it.

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:19.476
I could make it look
like it stays the same,

00:05:19.476 --> 00:05:21.315
I could make it go up,
I can make it go down,

00:05:21.315 --> 00:05:23.189
it would depend on the particulars

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.950
of those curves to actually determine

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.589
what would happen to
price in that situation

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:31.955
and of course, let's not forget
to label our curves here.

00:05:31.955 --> 00:05:34.524
That was D2 in the previous example

00:05:34.524 --> 00:05:37.851
and this is D2 in that last example.

00:05:37.851 --> 00:05:39.143
The only reason why I'm
making sure we do that

00:05:39.143 --> 00:05:40.696
is one, it makes it clearer

00:05:40.696 --> 00:05:42.131
and also, when you need to do this

00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:43.876
on something like an AP exam,

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:46.040
it's really important that
you label all of the things,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.100
the title of your chart,
your equilibrium prices

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.103
and quantities, you label the curves,

00:05:52.103 --> 00:05:53.808
you say the vertical axis is P,

00:05:53.808 --> 00:05:55.371
the horizontal axis is Q

00:05:55.371 --> 00:05:58.608
and that when you have a
shift that you show that shift

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:01.608
and actually here I forgot
to draw that shift as well,

00:06:01.608 --> 00:06:05.402
so that you have arrows that
show your shift in supply

00:06:05.402 --> 00:06:07.524
or demand, so all of these components,

00:06:07.524 --> 00:06:09.072
make sure that you're able to draw it

00:06:09.072 --> 00:06:11.905
when you see it on say an AP exam.
