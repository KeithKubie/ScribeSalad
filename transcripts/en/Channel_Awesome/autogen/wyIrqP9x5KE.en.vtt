other cool things about it is that it
 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.820
other cool things about it is that it
can pair up wirelessly with a controller

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:42.830
can pair up wirelessly with a controller
 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.430
can pair up wirelessly with a controller
so then if you do have mobility in one

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440
so then if you do have mobility in one
 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.589
so then if you do have mobility in one
hand you can use a regular controller in

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599
hand you can use a regular controller in
 

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:50.170
hand you can use a regular controller in
one hand and then the adapt the adaptive

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:50.180
one hand and then the adapt the adaptive
 

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.290
one hand and then the adapt the adaptive
controller in the other hand or another

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:53.300
controller in the other hand or another
 

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.330
controller in the other hand or another
cool thing is that you can also co-op

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:55.340
cool thing is that you can also co-op
 

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.879
cool thing is that you can also co-op
with that together so like if you wanted

00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:57.889

to game with someone else of a different
ability level like you could take

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:01.190
ability level like you could take
 

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.500
ability level like you could take
control the joysticks and then they

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:02.510
control the joysticks and then they
 

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.850
control the joysticks and then they
could control the buttons and you can

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:03.860
could control the buttons and you can
 

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.830
could control the buttons and you can
work together to get through the levels

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840
