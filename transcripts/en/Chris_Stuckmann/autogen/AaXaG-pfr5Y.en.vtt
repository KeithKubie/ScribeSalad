00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140
him come out about Catherine G Johnson
 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.320
him come out about Catherine G Johnson
because I did a report on her and in

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330

that much about her or the other
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.599
that much about her or the other
characters in this movie so it was kind

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609
characters in this movie so it was kind
 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.009
characters in this movie so it was kind
of cool to learn some stuff about them

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
of cool to learn some stuff about them
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.440
of cool to learn some stuff about them
yeah it was a little more condensed

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450
yeah it was a little more condensed
 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.299
yeah it was a little more condensed
obviously at least condense some

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309
obviously at least condense some
 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.729
obviously at least condense some
different time pieces together into one

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739
different time pieces together into one
 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.650
different time pieces together into one
movie what is really accurate the most

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
movie what is really accurate the most
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.900
movie what is really accurate the most
part on I loved every minute of it

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910
part on I loved every minute of it
 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.369
part on I loved every minute of it
though I enjoy historical science movies

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379
though I enjoy historical science movies
 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.930
though I enjoy historical science movies
because that's what I was really into

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940
because that's what I was really into
 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.810
because that's what I was really into
growing up I loved science and history

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820
growing up I loved science and history
 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.450
growing up I loved science and history
and math that was my field house if you

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460
and math that was my field house if you
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.279
and math that was my field house if you
will yeah I mean I've always had

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
will yeah I mean I've always had
 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.110
will yeah I mean I've always had
interest in space and astronomy

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120
interest in space and astronomy
 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.569
interest in space and astronomy
so space movies no matter what the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579
so space movies no matter what the
 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.830
so space movies no matter what the
subject I've always interested me

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
subject I've always interested me
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.470
subject I've always interested me
whether it's science fiction or it's you

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480
whether it's science fiction or it's you
 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.690
whether it's science fiction or it's you
know retelling true events and if you

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700
know retelling true events and if you
 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.039
know retelling true events and if you
don't know essentially what this movie

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049
don't know essentially what this movie
 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.080
don't know essentially what this movie
is about is mainly three women who work

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090
is about is mainly three women who work
 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.730
is about is mainly three women who work
at NASA and who are dealing with quite a

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740
at NASA and who are dealing with quite a
 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.500
at NASA and who are dealing with quite a
bit of racial prejudice due to their

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510
bit of racial prejudice due to their
 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.210
bit of racial prejudice due to their
skin color which is something that was

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220
skin color which is something that was
 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.490
skin color which is something that was
extremely common at the time but they

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
extremely common at the time but they
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.560
extremely common at the time but they
have the rare circumstance of being in

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570
have the rare circumstance of being in
 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.510
have the rare circumstance of being in
this incredible field and they're really

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
this incredible field and they're really
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.249
this incredible field and they're really
pioneers and what they're trying to do

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
pioneers and what they're trying to do
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.050
pioneers and what they're trying to do
but at the same time they're dealing

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
but at the same time they're dealing
 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.270
but at the same time they're dealing
with a ton of people who aren't allowing

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280
with a ton of people who aren't allowing
 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.070
with a ton of people who aren't allowing
them to do what they need to do because

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
them to do what they need to do because
 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.660
them to do what they need to do because
they don't have access to certain file

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
they don't have access to certain file
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.640
they don't have access to certain file
there's certain areas or one of the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
there's certain areas or one of the
 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.289
there's certain areas or one of the
characters in particular has to run very

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299
characters in particular has to run very
 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.630
characters in particular has to run very
far to use the restroom because they

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
far to use the restroom because they
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.789
far to use the restroom because they
have specific restrooms for them and so

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
have specific restrooms for them and so
 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.140
have specific restrooms for them and so
it makes everything difficult and it's

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150
it makes everything difficult and it's
 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.210
it makes everything difficult and it's
really about how these characters

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220
really about how these characters
 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.819
really about how these characters
navigate NASA while also creating

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829
navigate NASA while also creating
 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.800
navigate NASA while also creating
different math formulas and things that

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
different math formulas and things that
 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.510
different math formulas and things that
just didn't exist at the time to help

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
just didn't exist at the time to help
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.069
just didn't exist at the time to help
people get into space Kathryn was

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079
people get into space Kathryn was
 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.620
people get into space Kathryn was
basically creating an entire new field

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630
basically creating an entire new field
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.230
basically creating an entire new field
of science with her group for aerospace

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240
of science with her group for aerospace
 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.600
of science with her group for aerospace
engineering it's not something to have

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610
engineering it's not something to have
 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.789
engineering it's not something to have
it's been really done at that point so

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
it's been really done at that point so
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.889
it's been really done at that point so
they were trying to create a new formula

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
they were trying to create a new formula
 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:01.969
they were trying to create a new formula
but they realized they didn't really

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979
but they realized they didn't really
 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.440
but they realized they didn't really
need to create a new formula they needed

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
need to create a new formula they needed
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.030
need to create a new formula they needed
to use an old formula to balance out the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040
to use an old formula to balance out the
 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.920
to use an old formula to balance out the
new stuff that they were doing which

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
new stuff that they were doing which
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.900
new stuff that they were doing which
makes a lot of sense because math is

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
makes a lot of sense because math is
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.690
makes a lot of sense because math is
always math you can't really change

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
always math you can't really change
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.710
always math you can't really change
numbers

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.140
numbers

right so I appreciate that because I
 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.790
right so I appreciate that because I
love science and math I was watching on

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800
love science and math I was watching on
 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.980
love science and math I was watching on
for those on the board go by and like I

don't know those me I appreciate it as I
was following along like oh so much math

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310
was following along like oh so much math
 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.610
was following along like oh so much math

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:26.069
they haven't been together and it's just
 

00:09:26.069 --> 00:09:27.799
they haven't been together and it's just
kind of like so quickly through the film

00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:27.809
kind of like so quickly through the film
 

00:09:27.809 --> 00:09:31.819
kind of like so quickly through the film
that it doesn't pay as much attention to

00:09:31.819 --> 00:09:31.829
that it doesn't pay as much attention to
 

00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:34.759
that it doesn't pay as much attention to
 to her kids her mother and her

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:34.769
 to her kids her mother and her
 

00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:36.949
 to her kids her mother and her
husband I could maybe like five four

00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959
husband I could maybe like five four
 

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:38.869
husband I could maybe like five four
minutes in the movie of just some more

00:09:38.869 --> 00:09:38.879
minutes in the movie of just some more
 

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:40.850
minutes in the movie of just some more
interval scenes with her family and less

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:40.860
interval scenes with her family and less
 

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.470
interval scenes with her family and less
like every time you see her kids you're

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480
like every time you see her kids you're
 

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.299
like every time you see her kids you're
at a party yeah it did kind of feel like

00:09:44.299 --> 00:09:44.309
at a party yeah it did kind of feel like
 

00:09:44.309 --> 00:09:46.100
at a party yeah it did kind of feel like
they were like we have to have these in

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.110
they were like we have to have these in
 

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.749
they were like we have to have these in
the movie because it's part of her life

00:09:47.749 --> 00:09:47.759
the movie because it's part of her life
 

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:49.819
the movie because it's part of her life
but they wanted to just get back to the

00:09:49.819 --> 00:09:49.829
but they wanted to just get back to the
 

00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:52.610
but they wanted to just get back to the
more dramatic stuff at NASA so they kind

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:52.620
more dramatic stuff at NASA so they kind
 

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.619
more dramatic stuff at NASA so they kind
of showed it like this happens let's

00:09:54.619 --> 00:09:54.629
of showed it like this happens let's
 

00:09:54.629 --> 00:09:56.720
of showed it like this happens let's
make this good let's act well in these

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:56.730
make this good let's act well in these
 

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.639
make this good let's act well in these
scenes but let's forget mecha net

00:09:58.639 --> 00:09:58.649
scenes but let's forget mecha net
 

00:09:58.649 --> 00:10:00.259
scenes but let's forget mecha net
so I think that was really my only issue

00:10:00.259 --> 00:10:00.269
so I think that was really my only issue
 

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:02.179
so I think that was really my only issue
with the entire film that was probably

00:10:02.179 --> 00:10:02.189
with the entire film that was probably
 

00:10:02.189 --> 00:10:03.949
with the entire film that was probably
my only complaint is that there's maybe

00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959
my only complaint is that there's maybe
 

00:10:03.959 --> 00:10:06.499
my only complaint is that there's maybe
not enough of her kids and her husband

00:10:06.499 --> 00:10:06.509
not enough of her kids and her husband
 

00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:09.290
not enough of her kids and her husband
which I guess isn't too big of it from

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:09.300
which I guess isn't too big of it from
 

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.579
which I guess isn't too big of it from
but it's still one of those things where

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:10.589
but it's still one of those things where
 

00:10:10.589 --> 00:10:12.230
but it's still one of those things where
it's like and it's a little bit more

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240
it's like and it's a little bit more
 

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.090
it's like and it's a little bit more

would have been good yeah five four
 

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.309
would have been good yeah five four
minutes that's all really what it needed

00:10:16.309 --> 00:10:16.319

00:10:16.319 --> 00:10:18.290
minutes that's all really what it needed
