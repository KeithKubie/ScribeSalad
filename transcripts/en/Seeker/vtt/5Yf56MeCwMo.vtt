00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.310
Modern day fighter jets can travel faster
than the speed of sound without breaking a

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.280
sweat, but until, 70 years ago on October
14 of 1947; no human had ever traveled that

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.590
fast.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.320
Those who came close saw their aircraft become
uncontrollable, or shake themselves to pieces,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.380
leading some to believe that manned flight
faster, than the speed of sound, was impossible.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.740
There seemed to be a “sound barrier.”

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.300
And we wanted to break it.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.670
You may be wondering why the speed of sound
is important in aviation at all, and to understand

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.420
that you have to remember what sound is in
the first place.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.200
Watching a wave travel down a slinky is a good visualization.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.600
In a gas, sound travels as a longitudinal
wave, meaning that it propagates when air

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.700
molecules bunch together and then space out
again.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.700
Watching a wave travel down a slinky is a
good visualization.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.700
[pause]

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.219
As planes fly through the air, they create
sound waves.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.729
But if the planes go fast enough, they start
to catch up with their own sound waves.

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.699
Air molecules get rammed into each other faster
than they can get out of the way, and the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.150
waves pile up to form a powerful shock wave
-- that famous sonic boom observers hear when

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.740
a supersonic jet goes by.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.320
But, the sudden and extreme air pressure is
just the start.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.800
As the air behind the shock wave breaks up
in a turbulent wake, it can swirl and violently

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.850
slap at different parts of the plane, causing
buffeting and increased drag.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.710
For the airplanes of old, this was bad news.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.730
First, there was the problem of the propulsion
system.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.970
As a propeller spins, the tips of the blades
can actually break the sound barrier.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.840
When that happens, the air starts swirling
and increasing drag, and the prop’s efficiency

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.840
drops.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.001
Maybe these problems could be overcome with
a radically different propeller design, but

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:42.610
by the end of WWII, rockets had advanced and
the jet engine had been invented, so there

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.810
wasn’t much point trying to force the poor
propeller to do a job it wasn’t suited for.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.590
Even with the jet engine replacing old propellers,
there was another problem to overcome at speeds

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.770
close to the speed of sound: the wings.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.550
Wings on old aircraft were straight as a 2x4
and when we were puttering around at subsonic

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.210
speeds, they worked just fine.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.840
But when airplanes are right around that magical
sound barrier, at what’s known as transonic

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.659
speeds, the airflow over straight wings does
something you might not expect.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:13.459
Namely, it actually goes faster than the speed
of sound.

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.689
This makes sense when you consider how a wing
fundamentally works.

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.400
They’ve got that curved shape on top to
make the air on that side travel faster.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.209
But if the air on top of the wing goes faster
than the speed of sound it’ll form, you

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.150
guessed it, a shock wave.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.459
And just like before, the air behind that
shock wave gets all turbulent as it expands,

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.349
increasing drag dramatically and maybe even
separating airflow from the wing’s surface

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.459
altogether.

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.730
Which is bad.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.709
So, the solution was as simple as it was genius:
sweep the wings back.

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.599
By placing the wings at an angle, some of
the air travels down the wingspan, and the

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.790
rest accelerates across the wing more slowly,
so the aircraft can fly faster before running

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.470
into the problems of a shock wave on the wing.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.269
That means the fighter jet doesn’t have
to work as hard to break through the sound

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.389
barrier completely, and when it does shock
waves that form on top of the wing travel

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.090
to the trailing edge where they cause less
drag.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.529
With powerful jet engines and swept wings,
the sound barrier that once seemed so solid

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:11.620
is now routinely smashed.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.090
It makes you wonder what other things that
seem impossible today will be routine in the

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.090
future.
