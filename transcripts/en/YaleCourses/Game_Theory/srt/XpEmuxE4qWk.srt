1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,820
So today I want to look at two kinds of
games and then more change topic of beds

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,440
and the game. Don't want to look at uh,

3
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:12,990
about ultimatums and bargaining.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,740
I will start with ultimatums and we'll
move smoothly through and we'll see why

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,890
that's an easy transition in a while.
All right,

6
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:24,120
so the game we're gonna play
involves two players. Um,

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,270
let's do players,
whoops,

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,300
one and two.

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,780
And the game is this
player one is going to make

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,290
a take it or leave it offer,

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,500
take it or leave it

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,400
to play it too.

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,180
And this offer is going to concern a pie
and it's made the pie worth $1 for now.

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,100
All right, we'll put, we'll, we'll
probably play this for real in a bit.

15
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,360
We'll play it for $1. All
right, so it's a split of a pie.

16
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:08,361
We can think of the split as offering s
to play a one and one minus ass to play

17
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:10,870
out too.
Alright.

18
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,940
Asked to play a woman and one minus
asked to play two and play a two has two

19
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:21,600
choices.
Two can accept this offer.

20
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,213
Okay.

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,650
And there's two accepts the offer.
Then the shares are then the,

22
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,740
then they get exactly the offer play a
one gets asked and player two gets one

23
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:36,320
minus ass. All right? Alternatively,

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,150
play it to all play.
A two can reject.

25
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,830
And if play a two rejects the offer,

26
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,080
then both players get zero.
Both players get nothing.

27
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,920
All right? It's a very simple game.
There's a dollar on the table.

28
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:59,570
I'll take it out in the minutes
as dollar on the table. All right?

29
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,260
And our two players are
going to bargain for this,

30
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:05,140
but it isn't much of a
bargain plate player ones.

31
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,970
Basically you're gonna announce
what the division is going to be.

32
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,680
Two can either accept that division
or no one gets out of thing. Alright,

33
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,030
everyone understand the game.

34
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,100
So I thought we'd start off by playing
this game for real a couple of times. Um,

35
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,320
so when they come down and do that,

36
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,780
all
right,

37
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,960
so why don't we play with
them people in this role?

38
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:30,500
I've been playing with
that row all the time.

39
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,430
So a alley's going to help me find
somebody. You found somebody, okay.

40
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,260
So, uh, the person behind you
and your name is a Clia, Clia,

41
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,030
a shout out to build this. This, this
doesn't make a noise. Shack. Yeah.

42
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,450
[inaudible] Acquia. Thank
you. Acquia. And uh,

43
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:50,710
so you'll be player one and player two,
uh,

44
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,130
will be this gentleman here whose name
is, shout out Noah. Noah. Okay. So Queer.

45
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,730
Now do you know each other?
That's okay. Okay. So, uh, uh,

46
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,390
a queer can make any offer she wants.
We'll buy this for real money, right?

47
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,490
So there's a real dollar at stake.
You can make any offer you want.

48
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,320
It can be in fractions
of pennies if you like,

49
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,610
of the amount of dollar that
you're going to offer. Two. No, no.

50
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,890
The Noaa and the amount
you're going to keep yourself.

51
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,683
There you go.

52
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,440
Just shout it out so everyone can hear.
But he started standups enough.

53
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,360
So this is your moment in the rights.
The right.

54
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,680
Can you stand up as well?
Here we go.

55
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,200
You can offer him a penny and no. Are
you going to take a penny? No, no.

56
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:37,980
It's not going to take a penny. So I
didn't lose the money on that to no one.

57
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,830
No one made any money. I didn't lose
any money. That seems pretty good.

58
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,170
Let's try a different couple.
Let's move a movements mover.

59
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,970
Move around the room a little bit.
So, uh, why don't you, um, ally,

60
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,620
when you take the guy behind here whose
name is, shout out Gary. Gary. All right.

61
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:52,921
So Gary,

62
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:57,870
why don't you stand up and
we'll let Gary play with, uh,

63
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,920
the gentleman in here. What's the, what's
your name in here and niche. All right,

64
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:05,250
stand up and do you know each other?
All right. So what do we make?

65
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:07,890
What are we let a niche be player one
this time you understand the rules of the

66
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:08,724
game.

67
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,400
So make your offer 30 cents,

68
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,490
which is that you'll be like, oh, look
for him. I'll bring him 30 cents. No,

69
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:21,350
that's okay. He's saying he's saying
no as well. Okay. Okay. So, alright,

70
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,960
let's raise the stakes of it. Let's,
let's, let's make it $10. All right,

71
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,350
so I'm not getting much acceptance here.
Let me try a third capital. All right,

72
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:32,680
working my way back. So how about
you? What's your name? So when,

73
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,550
when you stand up as well.
Well at court and be player one.

74
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,720
And actually what I do want
to sit down so I can, I can,

75
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:40,620
I can do it from here and you and
you are Danny. Danny. All right.

76
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,860
The court is going to be player
one and Dan is going to be planted.

77
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,780
He's weren't on dating
couples from earlier. Right.
We're safe from that. Okay,

78
00:04:45,781 --> 00:04:47,880
good. All right, so, so Courtney,
what are you going to offer?

79
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,630
$5 which is half of the $10

80
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:52,963
uh,

81
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,910
except all right. Except all
right. All right. All right.

82
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,290
So it turned out in this game that's
a lot of people are rejecting offers.

83
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,090
Let's have a look at it on the border.
Second,

84
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,850
think about it in a second and
we'll come back. We're not done.

85
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,980
We're not done with this couple.
I don't know any of your couples.

86
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:09,860
We're going to come back to
you. All right? So in this,

87
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,060
in this game it has a pretty,

88
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,850
it's pretty simple to analyze this
game by backward induction, right?

89
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:20,750
By backward induction. We're going to
start with the receiver of the offer.

90
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,710
And the receiver of the
offer is choosing between,

91
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,660
okay.

92
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,890
The offer means to them, which was,
which is an annotation is one minus ass.

93
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,940
And our three examples,
that was the penny than it was 30 cents.

94
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,930
And then it was half of it to quote at
50 cents to to be consistent. All right.

95
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,930
And we actually saw two
of those offers rejected,

96
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,880
but according to backward induction,

97
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,410
assuming that people are trying to
maximize their dollar payoffs here,

98
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,450
what should we see? The, what
should we see the receiver do?

99
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,140
Okay?

100
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,010
They should accept,
right?

101
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:57,150
They should accept even the somewhat
insulting offer of a penny that was made,

102
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:02,000
even that someone insulting offer
should be accepted, uh, by, uh, by Noah.

103
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:02,781
Right? So, no,

104
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:06,470
it didn't accept the offer of a penny
and it's come back over this and no,

105
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:10,740
he didn't accept the offer of a penny.
And, uh, uh, I forget who it was with,

106
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,100
but our second play,
I didn't accept an offer of 30 cents,

107
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,350
but we've just argued they
should have been accepted.

108
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,790
They should've been accepted.
In fact,

109
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,630
when Acquia made the offer
of of one penny to Noah,

110
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,150
I think she assumed that Noah
would accept it as this. Right.

111
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,460
Why do you think do and accepted?
Shout out?

112
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,000
Because I felt it'd be better
off with a penny done. Nothing.

113
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,590
It would be better for the penny
than nothing. All right. All right.

114
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,560
And then we saw an offer, the offer
came up about who was my second offer,

115
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,680
my second offer and what you offer a
bit more. What do you offer more? Um,

116
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,850
it felt dirty. Pretty Fair. Shares
a lot better than nothing. Right?

117
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,610
Thirties in front of enough thing
or they're not necessarily fair,

118
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,950
but it's still better than nothing at all.
Right.

119
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:49,580
And where was my rejector of the second
author who rejected the second offer?

120
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,210
Why did you reject 30 cents? It's just
a pride thing. It's a pride thing.

121
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:57,560
It's a pride thing. Alright. And pretty
soon we converged onto, or the 50 cents,

122
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,820
which notice is no where near backward
induction. It's nowhere near vaccination.

123
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,570
So the third offer, which is Courtney,
that right. Why do you offer, what was it?

124
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:09,200
Half of it? Because half is
better for me than half had been.

125
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:11,990
You've nothing and you've figured he's
gonna, he's gonna reject otherwise.

126
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,710
And in fact he didn't reject what didn't
you reject? Five is better than nothing.

127
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,020
Probably better than nothing but that.
But the five is better than nothing.

128
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,350
Argument would've argued against
making any rejection in this game.

129
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,380
Is that right? Right. So
here's the game went backward.

130
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:26,810
Induction is giving a
very clear prediction.

131
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,420
The clear prediction is first of all,

132
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:33,200
the second player will except
whatever's given to them,

133
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,580
and second,

134
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,200
given that the first player should
offer them essentially nothing,

135
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,190
offer them just a penny, right?
So backward induction predicts,

136
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,070
backward induction predicts that
the offer will be essentially,

137
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:54,071
I'd say 99 cents and 1 cents or even
or even knew virtually a dollar and

138
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,900
nothing. All right, but
in fact we don't get that.

139
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:03,740
We get a lot of rejection of these low
offers and often we get offers made much,

140
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:07,700
much higher in the visceral dizzy of half.
All right.

141
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,560
Now why? Why are we seeing a failure
of backward induction in this game?

142
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,600
I think this is a,
this is not as you guys,

143
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:18,860
it's a very reliable results in
experimental data. All right? So why,

144
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,040
why do we see so many people
in this ultimatum game?

145
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,990
Both offer more and more importantly,
reject last them a small amounts.

146
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,000
All right, let's talk about it. So,
so one person said it's a pride thing.

147
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,410
It's a prior thing. Uh, where was I?
This let's try the other airline here.

148
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,980
So, uh, what's the, what's the
smallest offer you would have accepted?

149
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,570
What's your name? Festival. Um, um,

150
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,420
listen the same too.
Right?

151
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:50,810
So there are some backward induction
players in the room. All right? All right.

152
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,610
Who, who would, who would
ever rejected a scent,

153
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,130
who would have projected 10 cents should
be going on when we could be going down

154
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:01,200
at least who did rejected 30th sentence?

155
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,370
Few people dropped from 37
not money actually. Alright.

156
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,180
How many of you would have
rejected 50 states? One person,

157
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,860
even with a projected 50
sentence, right? But, but
essentially know what, okay. Okay.

158
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,280
So what's,
what's happening here?

159
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,360
Why do people think people are rejecting
what is essentially money from my

160
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:20,820
pocket? Right? There's nothing going
on here. I'm just giving you money.

161
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,340
Why are they rejecting being given money?

162
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,220
Um,
like over all the stakes are really low.

163
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:30,830
So if you have any value on it's or like
pride when people said, you know, it's,

164
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,730
it's not worth a penny or

165
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,040
alright. Sense. All right, so
it may be pride going on here.

166
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,960
So certainly one thing is about pride.

167
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,840
It turns out that people do this
even in quite high stakes games.

168
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:43,960
But you're right, certainly that trade
off is going to start to bites. All right,

169
00:09:43,961 --> 00:09:46,390
what else is going on? So I agree.
Pride is part of what's going on.

170
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,050
What else is going on here?
Let's try and get some conversation going.

171
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:51,160
It was somebody in here,

172
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,270
I can get the mic and shout out your name
and really shout Peter Gordon. Change.

173
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,740
It's cumbersome. Changes come and
smoke. You didn't want to change. Okay,

174
00:09:59,741 --> 00:10:03,790
fair enough. Fair enough.
But if the stakes go up, that
would get rid of that. Yeah.

175
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,350
Um,

176
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,520
maybe people are tying their own outcomes
to the other players outcomes as well.

177
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,060
Right? So maybe people have
different pay offs. To me,

178
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,670
people that people are comparing that
pay off to the other person's pay off.

179
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,220
That certainly seems like a
plausible thing to be going on here.

180
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:23,230
You might feel less happy about getting
20 cents knowing the other person's

181
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:24,610
getting 80 cents for example.

182
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,390
You want to be trying to teach them a
lesson to get them to offer more, right?

183
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:31,210
You might be trying to send a sort
of moral standard here. All right,

184
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,780
so there's some notions of indignation
or even teaching people that they really

185
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:38,170
should offer people in the war. All
right. What else could be going on here?

186
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,983
Yeah.

187
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,490
If people know I'm not going
to accept less than 50 cents,

188
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:49,140
then they should give me 50 cents
by backward induction. Right? So,

189
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:52,720
so part of what's going on here, actually
this game was a one shot game, right?

190
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,390
We just play it once and we
could've played it. In fact,

191
00:10:55,391 --> 00:10:57,610
they often do to play this,
this, this way in the lab.

192
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,090
You could have played it without anybody
knowing who the other player was.

193
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,020
All right,

194
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,840
but particularly in this setting where
everyone can see everyone else and even

195
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:08,200
in the lab where people
actually come see people,

196
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,540
but they might imagine that
the game is really repeated.

197
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:14,260
You could imagine people trying to
establish a reputation. Is that right?

198
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,260
So there's lots of these reasons are
sort of moral indignation reasons or

199
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,540
teaching a lesson reasons,
pride reasons.

200
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,380
There's also this basic reason that
people might be thinking this game is I

201
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:27,490
should play this game as I would a similar
situation in life where I might want

202
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:29,350
to be establishing reputation.
All right?

203
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:31,690
So there's a certain amount of
confusion going on in the game,

204
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,180
but there's also a certain amount of,
of a lot of things make sense.

205
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:39,450
And I noticed that once we've established
that people are going to reject small

206
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:40,810
offers in this game,

207
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,240
once we've established people that
are going to reject small offers,

208
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,620
it makes perfectly good sense to
offer a lot more than than nothing.

209
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,970
All right?

210
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,180
It's not that surprising that once we've
established the idea that people are

211
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:53,590
going to reject small offers,

212
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,950
you're going to see people making
offers that are reasonably large,

213
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,080
although not usually larger than 50 cents.

214
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:04,200
Why is 50 cents so focal
yet as 50 cents so focal?

215
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,010
No trick question. I'm just asking me
why do people think 50 cents or so focal?

216
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,710
What? I think it's typical that people
end up offering around 50 cents. Why?

217
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,630
It sounds fair, right? It seems fair.
There's some notion of fairness.

218
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,830
It's not clear, by the way, what ethical
principle is involved here, right?

219
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:28,210
It's not clear that if you're walking
along the streets and you happened to find

220
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:29,770
a dollar at your feeds,

221
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,160
that you should pick it up and anyone
else you happen to see at that moment you

222
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:36,080
should get 50 cents too, right? That's
essentially what the situation is.

223
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:39,190
Then you just chose Depaul.
This dollar that I just gave you,

224
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,250
it isn't clear that there's
any particularly great
moral claim to give it to

225
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:45,910
someone else, but I think people read
this as a situation about splitting,

226
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,510
splitting a cake cake in an environment
of of distributional justice.

227
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,970
They view it as a larger picture.
Is that right?

228
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,790
So it turns out that the
large literature on this,

229
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,840
there's a large experimental literature
on the ultimatum game and there's an

230
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,130
even larger literature on an even simpler
game in which I give people a dollar.

231
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:03,411
I say,

232
00:13:03,411 --> 00:13:06,700
you can give whatever share you wanted
to the other person and they don't even

233
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:09,910
get a chance to accept or reject,
right? That's called the dictator game.

234
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,370
The dictator game,
literally,

235
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:14,820
you'll just simply given a dollar and
you can get whatever show you wanted.

236
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,070
The other person,
it turns out even in the dictator game,

237
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,880
people give quite a lot of money or
that suggest that there really is some

238
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:26,260
notion of fairness or some notion of
of distributional justice going on in

239
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:29,290
people's heads. Yet rightly
or wrongly. All right,

240
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,400
so one thing that should tell us
is even an extremely simple games,

241
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,960
extremely simple games.

242
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,160
We should be a little bit careful about
reading backward induction into what's

243
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:42,310
going to happen in the real world.
Part of this is because as I mentioned,

244
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:43,870
the very first day of the class,

245
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,130
people care about other things than just
the obvious payoffs and part of it is

246
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:52,910
about more complicated things like
reputation and solid. All right.

247
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,580
Having said that, let's nevertheless for
the, for the purpose of uptodate, uh,

248
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,060
act as if we are going to do backward
induction and let's embed this into a

249
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:03,290
slightly more complicated gate.
All right?

250
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,470
It's on the more complicated
game is as follows.

251
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,123
Okay.

252
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,510
All right, so we're going to have
a two period bargaining game,

253
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,270
two period bargaining

254
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,460
and this two pair of bargaining game at
the beginning of the game is exactly the

255
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:30,910
same as a dollar on the
table and play a one

256
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,150
makes an offer

257
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,140
to two. I might, once again,

258
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:42,850
we can call this off our ass and one
minus ass just the same as before and

259
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:45,360
justice before play a two

260
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,540
can accept the offer.

261
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,680
And if they the offer then
this is indeed what they get.

262
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,660
All right.
But now if two rejects,

263
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,650
which is twos other alternative,
if play a two rejects the offer,

264
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,570
then we flip the roles.
We play the game again,

265
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,500
but we flipped the roles. So
we go to stage two. All right.

266
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,840
This is everything we've said
happen up here is stage one.

267
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,120
Okay.

268
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,800
And down here we go to stage two.

269
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,740
I need to stage to play it
to gets to make an offer.

270
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,770
Yeah.

271
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,660
To one player two gets to make it
off at a one. And once again we can.

272
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,270
Cool. Last one, uh, we've been a
bit, but to be careful, let's put,

273
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,010
let's put one's hair just to indicate
where in the first round and uh,

274
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,760
to see how to indicate where
in the second. All right,

275
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:54,530
so you make it offers s two and one
minus s two s two s as to is the,

276
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:57,700
is the, is that that goes to play
a one and one minus s two is that,

277
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,800
is that that goes to play,
uh, uh, to, to, to guests.

278
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:05,120
We can offer an a player one and
now one can accept or reject.

279
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,270
If she accepts,
then she gets her share from here.

280
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,720
Offers accepted.
And if she rejects,

281
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,690
let me get nothing.
All right?

282
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:25,890
So this game is exactly the same
as playing the previous game,

283
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,300
except we flip roles,
but we're going to add one catch.

284
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,360
The catch is this in the first round,

285
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,520
the money on the table is a dollar.
All right?

286
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,030
But if we end up going into
the second round, I was,

287
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,810
the first offer is not accepted
and we go into the second round,

288
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,570
then part of the money is lost.

289
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,510
And in particular we'll
assume that the doe,

290
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,050
the money on the table is delta.
All right?

291
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:59,670
What you could think of Delta as
being just some number less than one.

292
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,480
All right, so you want a concrete
example. Think of this as being 90 cents.

293
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:10,200
All right? So the idea here is if you get
into the second round, time is passed,

294
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:13,620
it's costly and to money
in the second round, uh,

295
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,940
is I think that money in the
second round is being worth less,

296
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,610
or can I actually think of this cake
being eaten up? Some of it's thrown away.

297
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,970
So much wasted. All right, everyone
understand the game? All right?

298
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,850
This is very similar to the previous game,

299
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:32,090
but we've got this second stage
coming in and we've got discounting.

300
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,220
So this is the idea
of discounting.

301
00:17:38,221 --> 00:17:42,630
How many of you have heard the
term discounting before? All right,

302
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,890
so you're probably a storied
enough finance cost or a
macro class where we think

303
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:50,130
about the being of value
of money as value of time.

304
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,220
That money today is worth
more than money tomorrow,

305
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,530
partly because you could put the money
today into the bank and it could earn

306
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,373
interest,

307
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,140
partly because you're simply impatient
to get that money and go and have lunch,

308
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:05,280
particularly on the day in which
the clocks changed. All right? Okay.

309
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,850
So let's try this game again and let's
just, let's just play it for real.

310
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,900
So let's come down again. Hi,
everyone. Missed out down the game.

311
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,650
Basically the same rules that with this
flipping around and with the possibility

312
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:19,590
that the cake may shrink.
Let's see what people have learned.

313
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:24,360
So who are our first pet? Our first
power Acquia. And who was that quiz?

314
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,940
And Noah. All right, so a, a Quia what? W
what are you going to offer your player?

315
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,940
One here. All right. But if
your offers rejected, no,

316
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:33,840
is going to get to make an offer to you.
All right,

317
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:37,860
so what are you going to offer this time?
45 99 uh,

318
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,840
so 45 cents. Yeah.
[inaudible] 46 46. Okay,

319
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:46,620
so he, he gets 46 if you
accepts the offer, is that
right? Yeah, 40 46 missteps.

320
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,980
The offer all makes sense that he's
accepted that. Okay. That was easy.

321
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:53,180
That was easy. So that, that
was so, so uh, queer got uh,

322
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,230
got 54 cents and a Noah got a 46 cents.
All right,

323
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:03,120
who was our second path? Go second pass.
So that was a, I've forgotten a niche.

324
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:06,720
Right. And uh, Gary and
Gary. All right, so a niche.

325
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:09,840
What are you going to have
this done? I'll lock it. 43 43.

326
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:13,150
You're going to push the envelope
a little bit. All right. All right.

327
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:15,030
Then we're gonna accept it
as well. Okay. So people are,

328
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,340
people are converging here. All right.
And what about our third off? Uh,

329
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,400
offer receiver was Courtney and
Danny and Danny is a Courtney 30,

330
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,610
30,
30 for him.

331
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,543
Uh,

332
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,020
I like sad. Oh, a three acceptances. All
right, let's find out something here.

333
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,120
So I was hoping to get into the
second round, so supposing Ah, okay,

334
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:42,520
so you accepted, that's fine. That's
fine. All right. We will, no, no, no,

335
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:46,570
no chicken sounds around the
room. All right. All right.
So, uh, is down here, right?

336
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,530
Yeah. So Daddy, have you rejected or
you accepted? But how do you accepted,

337
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,300
what would you have offered
in the second round?

338
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,283
Uh,

339
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,670
45. 45. All right.

340
00:19:57,671 --> 00:20:00,420
45 and would you have accepted that
in the second round if you're 30,

341
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,280
30 to minutes after? Yes. Yeah.
So, okay, so you might've,

342
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,470
you might've been better at
turns out. All right. All right,

343
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,960
let's go back through the se,
the other rejection. So the,

344
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,400
is it the other acceptances who up
my second capital, you offered 43,

345
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:15,640
is that right? Right. And you
said yes to 43 is that right?

346
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,700
Have you rejected 43 what would
you have offered back in return?

347
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,410
43 43 the same thing back would,

348
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,380
would you were you accepted it and he
gets 47 he would've got 47 in that case.

349
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,280
You're just being accepted
that, okay. Okay. And uh,

350
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:34,240
queer went first and she
offered 45 to, no, I know I had,

351
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,950
in fact you rejected what
would you've offered back?

352
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,890
I would have also done 45 same thing
back and we would you would you have

353
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:40,660
accepted it? Yeah. Okay. So,

354
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,610
so we can see here that the decision to
accept or reject partly depends on what

355
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,520
you think the other side is going to
do in the second round. Is that right?

356
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,150
So here you are, you're making, if
you're even in the middle of this game,

357
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:55,750
if you're a player too,
you've received an offer right now,

358
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,160
these offers sounded crazy.

359
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,830
I mean 30 cents was the lowest
where I'm another sign crazy.

360
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,250
And you're trying to decide whether
you should accept or reject this offer.

361
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,490
And one you have in mind is what would
I offer if I reject and will that offer

362
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:13,300
the, I then offer in the next round be
accepted or rejected. Is that right?

363
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,850
All right.
And so if we just work backwards,

364
00:21:15,851 --> 00:21:19,090
we can see what you should
offer in the first round.

365
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,510
Should be just enough to
make sure it's accepted.

366
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,850
Knowing that the person who's who's
receiving the offer and the first round is

367
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:30,160
going to think about the offer they're
going to make in the second round.

368
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:32,410
I'm going to think about whether you're
going to accept or reject in the second

369
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:36,580
round. Is that right? Right. So
that sound like a bit of a mouthful,

370
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,150
but that mouthful of reasoning is
exactly backward induction, right?

371
00:21:41,151 --> 00:21:45,160
It's exactly backward induction as saying
to figure out what I should do in the

372
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:48,790
first round. I need to figure what
I should offer in the first round.

373
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,030
I needed to figure out where the player
two is going to accept or reject and to

374
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:54,420
figure out whether he or she
is going to accept rejects.

375
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,240
And I have to put myself in his or her
shoes and figure out what he or she would

376
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:02,320
offer if she did reject and what he
or she thinks I would do if I got that

377
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,020
second Matt, offer that right. Alright,

378
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,700
so let's try and analyze
this as if backward induction
was going to work here as

379
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:14,020
if we didn't have to worry about
things like pride here. All right,

380
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,770
so this is the game we're actually
playing. Let's keep that one

381
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,630
and actually analyze it on the board.

382
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,200
I want to walk us from a rotary mundane
game of take it or leave it offers to a

383
00:22:34,391 --> 00:22:38,380
more complicated game in which there
can be several rounds of offers,

384
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,540
but we're going to go slow on.
We'll start this with two rent.

385
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:45,450
All right?
All right,

386
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,200
so first of all,
let's just look at the stage one game,

387
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:59,140
the stage one game and it's keeping
track what the offer is and what the

388
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:02,440
receiver. This is the opera
and this is the receiver.

389
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,583
All right?

390
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,360
Hello. In the one with stage
game, the game only has one stage.

391
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,200
Then we know from backward induction
what the results should be.

392
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:18,140
It isn't what we find in the in the lab.
It isn't what we find in the classroom,

393
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:18,651
but we don't,

394
00:23:18,651 --> 00:23:23,651
we should get the offer should offer to
keep everything essentially or maybe 99

395
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,990
cents but it's called it
one and the receiver gets
nothing. All right? So again,

396
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,800
I'm approximating it a little bit
cause it could be 99 cents and a penny.

397
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,550
But who cares? This is call it a dollar
and nothing if it's a one stage game.

398
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,380
All right, so now let's consider
a two stage game. All right?

399
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:40,850
And the two stage game,

400
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:46,750
the person who's making the offer in
the first stage needs to look forward.

401
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:50,690
Anticipate what would happen if the off,
if,

402
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,490
if her offer was rejected by player too
and play a two went forward into the

403
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:56,324
second stage.

404
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:01,460
Is that right from the two stage game and
the first stage of the two stage game,

405
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:07,390
the person making the offer
wants to anticipate what
the receiver would offer in

406
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:12,290
the second round where the
receiver to reject our offer.

407
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,413
Okay.

408
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,160
But we can,
we can do that by backward induction.

409
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,460
We know that in the second round
if the receiver rejects the offer,

410
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,980
then the second round of the two
stage game is what? It's a one stage.

411
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,370
Okay. All right. And we've just argued
as this, this, we printed these,

412
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:35,730
these we believe in backward induction.
In that case play a two who has done,

413
00:24:35,731 --> 00:24:40,731
the author will offer a dollar and
play a one who is now the receiver.

414
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,443
What accepted and yet,

415
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,330
okay.
All right,

416
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,460
so play a one in the first
round of the two stage game.

417
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,680
Wants to make an offer that
just enough to get player to,

418
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,380
to accept it. Now. All right.

419
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,030
So let's think about
this check if play a one

420
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,870
offers to something more than what?

421
00:25:07,871 --> 00:25:11,380
More than what? Tomorrow play a
two can get a dollar. All right?

422
00:25:11,381 --> 00:25:13,240
But that's a dollar tomorrow.
All right,

423
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:17,410
so a dollar tomorrow is worth how much
today if we're discounting it just worth

424
00:25:17,411 --> 00:25:18,850
Delsa, right? It's just worth Delta.

425
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:24,060
So if player one offers play a
two more than Delta time is one,

426
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,100
which is what player too can get
tomorrow then too. We're like steps

427
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,920
and if play a woman offers to
less than Delta Times a dollar,

428
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:41,790
cause you can get a dollar tomorrow,
but that's only worth delta. Uh,

429
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,810
that dollar tomorrow is
worth just Delta today,

430
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,650
then two will reject.
All right?

431
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,830
So the offer has to be exactly
enough to get accepted,

432
00:25:52,831 --> 00:25:56,820
which is exactly Delta dollars. All
right? Delta dollars. All right?

433
00:25:56,821 --> 00:26:01,821
So play a two knows that she can get
it in pink player to know she can get a

434
00:26:03,091 --> 00:26:04,410
dollar tomorrow.

435
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:09,710
So you need to offer her at least
Delsa today to make it as good for her.

436
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,710
I was getting a dollar tomorrow.
All right. Do we know the receiver?

437
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:21,990
Must be offered at least Delta tomorrow,
which means the offer.

438
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,273
Okay.

439
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,180
It's going to keep one minus delta.
All right,

440
00:26:28,181 --> 00:26:31,750
so this in the stay in the first
round of the two stage game

441
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,670
play a one should offer,

442
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:41,430
one might add one minus Delta took
for herself and Delta for player too,

443
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,610
and play a two shoot.

444
00:26:42,611 --> 00:26:47,611
Except that because Delta
dollars today is as good as $1

445
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,770
tomorrow.
All right.

446
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,420
Or another way to see that isn't a
picture. Let's just draw a picture.

447
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,493
Okay.

448
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,051
All right.

449
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:05,051
Let's put the pay off of player one
here and the payoff of player to on this

450
00:27:05,571 --> 00:27:07,370
access. All right, and
these are good. We'll get,

451
00:27:07,371 --> 00:27:09,950
we're going to assume that it's going to
maximize dollars where there's no pride

452
00:27:09,951 --> 00:27:13,250
in here and if we just
look at the one stage game,

453
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,610
we're simply looking at this line.

454
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,930
Yeah.

455
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,950
All right.
The offers and the one stage game,

456
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:25,810
it could be that player
one gets everything herself
and gives nothing to play a

457
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,880
two. It could be that player
to keeps everything fresh.

458
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,810
Again ended up getting everything and
play a one gets nothing and it could be

459
00:27:31,811 --> 00:27:36,280
any combination in between. Right?
And we argued by backward induction,

460
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,700
although not in reality, in
backward induction in the real, uh,

461
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:44,460
in back conduction in the one
stage game play on one, uh,

462
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:47,080
makes an offer to play a two,
which is kind of an insulting Golfer.

463
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,220
Play one says I get everything
and you get a petty,

464
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,990
I don't know if this
is the one stage gate,

465
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,653
okay?

466
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,080
In the two stage game,
instead of it's in the Tuesdays gaming,

467
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,540
if things are settled in the first stage,

468
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:10,020
this line represents the
possible divisions between
player one and player two.

469
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,140
But if we end up going into the
second stage, the pious shrunk.

470
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,160
The pious shrunk instead of
being so going from one to one,

471
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:23,660
it goes from Delta One, two, Delta,
one off. It's like if Delta's 0.9,

472
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:28,010
it goes from 0.9 2.9. So let's draw
that line in. That's what we get into.

473
00:28:28,011 --> 00:28:30,650
The second stage will end up being here.

474
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:33,440
All right?

475
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,440
How this goes from Delta
dollars here to Delta dollars.

476
00:28:38,511 --> 00:28:41,380
There were these dollars,
those dollars are being evaluated at time.

477
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,480
At at time one hunter,
the pious shrunk.

478
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,820
If we get into the second stage,

479
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,840
then by backward induction play a two nos.

480
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,240
Pay a two isn't an ultimatum game.
Pay a two.

481
00:28:53,241 --> 00:28:56,870
We'll be making the offer and play
a souk stays. Whatever cake is left,

482
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,230
I'm going to take all of it and
you're just going to get a pen.

483
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,430
So if we get into the second stage,

484
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,000
then play two will make this offer

485
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,453
to play a one.

486
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,200
I have to, we'll say I'm going to
keep, I'm going to keep all of that.

487
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,770
The whole of the pie, which in time,
time was in the in first period,

488
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,790
dollars is worth Delta.
So I'm going to get,

489
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,640
I'm going to end up with a payoff of
Delta and you're going to end up with a

490
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:26,020
powerful essentially nothing.
Alright, play a two nos.

491
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:31,050
Play a two knows that they can therefore
get at least Delta dollars or Delta

492
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,400
Delta and in current day dollars worth
from state, from rejecting your offer,

493
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:41,470
since they can get at least Delane
these Delta current day offers from your

494
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:43,990
offer,
the lowest offer you can make to them

495
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,550
isn't offer that gives
them at least delta.

496
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,580
So the offer you're going
to make is this offer.

497
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,130
This is the two stage offer.
It happens in the first stage,

498
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,990
play a one gives it,

499
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,560
makes an offer that gives player to
what play a two could get in the second

500
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:08,700
round of gives play a to Delta and
keeps one minus Delta for herself.

501
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,380
All right,
everyone was on the picture.

502
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:15,010
So this picture is just
corresponding to this table, right?

503
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,460
The thing people tend to get confused
about here I think is they get confused

504
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:22,720
between current dollars and uh,
and discounted dollars.

505
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:26,430
So we're going to do all the
analysis here in terms of uh,

506
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,940
the first period dollars dollars
tomorrow are going to be worth goals.

507
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,060
There's a hand up. Can I, can I
get a shout shouting out? Yeah.

508
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:39,010
Yes, yes. Sorry. Let me to
put those labels bigger. Yes.

509
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,640
So this is the outcome.
If it was a one stage game

510
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:47,620
and this is the outcome,
if it was a

511
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,790
a two stage game, right? The offer
is made and accepted. All right,

512
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,200
let's roll it forward.
Let's look at a three stage game.

513
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,210
Let's keep this picture handy
and think about a three stage game.

514
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:08,770
So the first beginning of the
game is the same. All right?

515
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:10,480
We're going to get three stage bargaining.

516
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,913
Okay.

517
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,090
And the rules in three states bargaining,

518
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,870
I pretty much the same as in two stage
bargaining but now there's two possible

519
00:31:19,871 --> 00:31:23,290
flips in three stage bargaining.

520
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,083
Okay.

521
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:32,050
And three stage pocketing in the first
period and period one one makes the offer

522
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,680
and if it's accepted the game's over.
Alright,

523
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,860
in period two.
So if we rejects,

524
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,740
if project,

525
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,270
then we go to period to
when to makes the Alpha

526
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,490
and if it's rejected now
the signed by player one,

527
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,120
then we go to Paris three.
Well once again,

528
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,960
one makes the Alpha so you
can see where we're heading.

529
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:09,650
We're heading towards an alternate,
an alternate offer bargaining model.

530
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,010
I'm going to make an offer, Jake
Scott, either accept or reject that I,

531
00:32:13,011 --> 00:32:15,920
he'll make an offer and we'll flip
to and fro. There's a question.

532
00:32:15,921 --> 00:32:17,900
Let me try and get a
mic out to the question.

533
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:26,230
Yeah, yeah. Question about
the two player game. If

534
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:30,620
that's a shout out to be looking at here
is if Delta is the best that player to

535
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,560
can get tomorrow,

536
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:36,860
then why wouldn't you want one offer
player to Delta discounted by Delta today?

537
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:43,340
Right. So good. So I think I was confusing
about it. Somebody behind me clear.

538
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:48,050
So tomorrow play a two can get everything.
Everything that there is.

539
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,670
All right, so whenever whatever Pi is left
tomorrow, play a two can get all of it.

540
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,390
All right,

541
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:58,390
so call that pie tomorrow
one and evaluated in current
in in period $1 as being

542
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:05,060
worth delta. All right. All right.
Does that make sense? Okay. So I,

543
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:08,270
I think I misspoke on that. So let
me say it again. All right. So,

544
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,990
so every period there's this
pie. All right. And every period,

545
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:13,790
if it was the last period of the game,

546
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,720
the person making the offer is going
to get the whole pie. All right?

547
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,590
But if I view that pie
tomorrow from today, right?

548
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:25,580
A Pie of $1 tomorrow is only
worth Delta dials today.

549
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:31,060
A Pi of $1 the day after tomorrow is only
worth Delta dollars tomorrow and Delta

550
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:35,030
squared dollars today. And so
all right, so that, that, that's,

551
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,580
that's the way which we're going
to do discounting here. Good.

552
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,820
All right. All right, so this
game, if one makes an offer,

553
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,390
if it's accepted, it's
over, it's accepted,

554
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,830
then we're done. And if there's
offers accepted, then we're done.

555
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,920
And if this office,
except in the Madonna and the third round,

556
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:00,410
if it's rejected,
then both players get nothing.

557
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,010
All right? And once again,
we're going to assume,

558
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:07,430
we're going to assume that the players
are discounting. So what does it mean?

559
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,960
What does it mean to say that discounting?

560
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:12,890
It means that the dollars in
period one are worth dollars.

561
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Dollars in period two RJ are discounted
by del Sur and dollars in period three

562
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:24,240
are discounted by Delta Times.
Delta or if you like by this question.

563
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:25,600
Yeah.

564
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,830
All right, and just to put this into
real, into real notions of money.

565
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:33,860
If you think of Delta as being 90% then
a dollar in period one is worth a dollar

566
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:39,260
a dollar in period two viewed from period
one is worth 90 cents and a dollar in

567
00:34:39,301 --> 00:34:43,140
period three viewed from
period one is worth 81 cents.

568
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,893
All right?

569
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:49,830
Okay, so what do we think's going
to happen here? Wow. Once again,

570
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:51,000
we can do backward induction.

571
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,310
Here we are in our picture.

572
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,750
Let's look at the three stage game
and once again, when we analyze,

573
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:12,320
as always when we analyze these
games using backward induction,

574
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,070
we want to start at the end.
If we start at the end,

575
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,260
we know that the last stage that to
the third stage of the three stage game

576
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,630
looks like what it looks like,

577
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:28,050
the one stage game and in the one
stage game we know the offeror.

578
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,340
We'll get everything. All right, so again,

579
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,640
so the last stage of the three stage game,

580
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,710
we know the person who makes the offer,

581
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:41,750
who this time we'll be player one will
get everything however that everything is

582
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:47,841
only worth Delta in two n's in period
$2 and it's only worth Delta squared in

583
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:53,670
period one off impaired $1 all right,

584
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,560
so in period in period one it's
right in the first part of this game.

585
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,480
We know that if the offer is rejected,
we know what's going to happen.

586
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:06,600
Is that again, in the first
period of this three stage game,

587
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:11,160
if the offer is rejected,
then we'll go into a two stage game.

588
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:12,421
All right?

589
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:15,720
We'll go to a two stage game and we
already know what happens on a two stage

590
00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:17,070
game and a two stage game.

591
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:21,450
The person who gets to make an offer
gets one minus Delta and the person who

592
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:23,520
receives the offer gets delta.

593
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,523
All right?

594
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:30,380
So we know in the first stage of the game
that the person who receives the offer

595
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,690
always has the outside option of saying,
no,

596
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:38,691
I reject and we know that that person
tomorrow we'll get one minus delta,

597
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:45,150
but one minus Delta tomorrow
is worth how much today?

598
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,593
Yeah,

599
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,070
it's Dell. So one minus it
tomorrow they're going to
get one minus Delta dollars.

600
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:56,120
So today that's worth Delta

601
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,530
one minus Delta donors.
All right,

602
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:05,330
so the offer I have to make in the
first round to make sure that the other

603
00:37:05,331 --> 00:37:10,331
person except it has to be just better
in discounted dollars than what they're

604
00:37:10,971 --> 00:37:13,820
going to get tomorrow. They're going
to get one minus Delta tomorrow,

605
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:17,360
so I have to give them Delta y
minus Delta today. All right.

606
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:21,710
Which means I keep for
myself one minus Delta,

607
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,150
one minus Delta,
and if you don't like the Algebra,

608
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,210
let's look at the picture and the
picture in the one stage game.

609
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,940
This is the offer in the two stage game.

610
00:37:31,941 --> 00:37:35,930
We know if we get into the second
round play a two gets everything right.

611
00:37:35,931 --> 00:37:39,680
We have to give him that much today.
And if we get into the third round,

612
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,723
now we're looking at

613
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:46,660
Delta squared here and Delta squared here.

614
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,980
I'll just go ahead and Dallas. Glad we
know that if we get into the third round,

615
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,280
the person who makes the offer and the
third round we'll get to to get, uh,

616
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:01,810
get everything so we can actually
walk away a lot of it. All right,

617
00:38:01,811 --> 00:38:04,870
so in the third round, the
person who makes the third
offer, we'll get everything.

618
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,290
So in the second round,
you'd have to give them that much.

619
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:13,390
So I ended up first round, you'd have
to give plan to that much. All right.

620
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,224
Say that again.

621
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,520
In Paris three the person making
the offer can get, get everything.

622
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:26,430
All right? So in period two, they
must be getting a Delta Times that.

623
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,850
So in period one you have to give them
at least this much higher than this.

624
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:31,200
Here is

625
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,170
the offer you'd make
in the three stage guy.

626
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,493
All right,

627
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,840
so on the picture, it's just going and
doing a little zigzag on the, uh, on the,

628
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:48,920
on the, uh, chart. We're also
always working across the diagonal.

629
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,930
All right, so we've done the, we've done
the one stage game, the one stage game,

630
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,680
the person making the offer get to
everything in the two stage game.

631
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,990
The person making the
offer off as just too much,

632
00:38:59,991 --> 00:39:03,260
just enough to get the offer accepted,
which is Delta because that's what,

633
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,710
that's what the dollar's worth
tomorrow in the three stage game,

634
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,740
the person making the offer makes
just enough to get the offer accepted,

635
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,550
which is del Sur times what the
receiver would get tomorrow.

636
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,530
What they get tomorrow is one minus Delta,

637
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,930
so they get Delta woman is Delta today.
All right. How about the forestage game?

638
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:23,690
It's, see we can do that. So we
go to the fourth stage game now

639
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,960
and the forestage game,

640
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,180
if the person receiving the
offer rejects the offer,

641
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:36,950
then tomorrow they can get one minus Dell,
so one minus delta.

642
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,280
So I need to offer them enough now
in current dollars so that, so they,

643
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:47,460
so they will prefer that to getting one
minus Delta one minus Delta tomorrow.

644
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,980
So how much we'll start off of them.

645
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,590
I have to offer them at
least Delta Times that much.

646
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:00,860
So I have to offer them Delsa times one
minus Delta Times one minus downside

647
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,480
like this. All right? And
again, I have to keep the rest.

648
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:10,130
I'll keep the rest of myself,
so I'll get one minus DELSA,

649
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,970
one minus delta,

650
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,550
one minus downside.
All right?

651
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:23,950
Actually the principal is always give
people just enough today so they'll accept

652
00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:29,640
the offer and just enough today is
whatever they'd get tomorrow discounted by

653
00:40:29,641 --> 00:40:30,474
Delta.

654
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,593
Right?

655
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,160
So actually this backward
induction isn't so bad. All right?

656
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:43,230
What makes it a little bit
easier is you don't actually,

657
00:40:43,231 --> 00:40:45,080
what do when you go through
an extra stage of this,

658
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,240
you don't actually have to go
all the way to the beginning.

659
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,290
You can actually start where you were
last time and just discount once more by

660
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:52,124
Delta.

661
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,743
All right,

662
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,930
let's see. We can see it.
Any kind of pattern emerging
in this Algebra. All right,

663
00:40:59,931 --> 00:41:04,400
so let's just multiply out these
brackets in the F in the forestage game.

664
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,100
This thing is actually equal
soon as multiplying through.

665
00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:12,101
It's one minus Delta Plus Delta squared,

666
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,540
uh,
minus Delta cubed.

667
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,030
I hope it is. Anyway. That's what this is.

668
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,460
And this thing is equal to delta.

669
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:34,160
Delta minus squares

670
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:40,340
a plus Delta.
Cute.

671
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:44,510
Alright. Just multiplying
out the brackets. All right.

672
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,100
Does anyone see a pattern
emerging here and these offers?

673
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:52,490
We had offers of one and
then one minus delta.

674
00:41:52,491 --> 00:41:54,770
So we can also multiply out this one.
It might be helpful to do so.

675
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:58,820
This is actually one minus Delta plus uh,

676
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:02,480
this is one minus Delta
Plus Delta squared.

677
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,363
All right?

678
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,680
They want to see a pattern.
What these offers look like.

679
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,420
They kind of alternate,
right? So let's, let's uh,

680
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,100
that's how I look.
What the,

681
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,430
rather than do every stage,

682
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,190
try it.
One more stages.

683
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,930
Here we can see a pattern emerging and
I just jumped straight to 10 stages and

684
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:38,610
see what happens. Go straight to
10. Then you'll say, let's do one.

685
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,850
Let's do one.
Just jumps into 10 to imagine.

686
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,270
But this game actually had 10 rounds.

687
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,570
This is the 10 stage game.

688
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,730
Let's just take this as,
continue our chart down here.

689
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:56,580
So here's a little bit more space.
Yeah,

690
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,860
right.
Tanner stages

691
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,650
10 stage game.
I'm going to continue my chart.

692
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:10,100
My chart says in the 10 stage game,

693
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,320
what am I going to get to the offer?

694
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,270
The offer is going to be easy.
The same pattern,

695
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:22,420
one minus DELSA plus Delta
squared minus Delta Cubes.

696
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:30,230
Don't Dr a plus Delta to the
eight minus Delta the night.

697
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,370
I want to see that what I'm
doing is I'm speaking, uh,

698
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,790
continuing the pattern from above.
All right, so I have 10 stages.

699
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,260
I always start with a one.

700
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:47,620
The positive and negative terms just
alternates and I have as many terms as one

701
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:50,390
minus the stage.
I entering the four stage game.

702
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,600
I ended up at Delta cubed
during the 10 stage game.

703
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:58,280
I'll end up at Delta to the line.
All right, now we're happy with that.

704
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,110
All right, so the fourth stage
offer is this slightly ugly thing,

705
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,770
one minus Delta Plus Delta
squared minus Delta cubed.

706
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:12,020
Dr. All right, so plus down
to the four minus up to the
five, et Cetera, et Cetera,

707
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:17,000
plus Delta eight minus Delta nine.
Right? That's a pretty ugly thing.

708
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:21,350
But fortunately some point in high
school you learned how to sum that thing.

709
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,290
Do you know what this is? What do you
call objects like this in high school?

710
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:32,290
I don't remember. And I remember
objects like one Delta, Delta Square,

711
00:44:32,291 --> 00:44:34,920
Delta, Cube Dunk, the
Florida, what are they called?

712
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:40,140
They called geometric series right there
called geometric series and I remember

713
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:40,983
had a sum them,

714
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:45,900
we know that x is equal to this.

715
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:53,730
All right? This is what the
offer is. If there's 10 rounds,

716
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:56,400
we know the offers accepted.
All right? The way,

717
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:59,780
the way that remember how to stomach
it is to the trick for something.

718
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:04,781
It is to multiply both sides of this
equation by by the Cuban ratio to multiply

719
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,040
both sides by Delta.

720
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,713
Okay?

721
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,350
So if I multiply this side by Delta,

722
00:45:11,351 --> 00:45:15,750
I got them off on the other side by
Delta on this one will become a delta.

723
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:21,270
This Delson,
this Delsa will become a delta squared.

724
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,890
This delta squared.

725
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,613
Okay,

726
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,060
we'll become a delta cubed.

727
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:31,300
This Delta cubed will become the delta.

728
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:33,330
The fourth don't, don't, don't.

729
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,810
There'll be a minus delta to the
age coming from the seventh time.

730
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:42,830
There'll be a plus Delta to the nine and
with the delta aids term and there'll

731
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,860
be a minus.

732
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:44,990
Okay.

733
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:47,950
Delta to the temp, right?
Everyone okay with that?

734
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,220
I just multiplied everything through
Phi Delta. I just shifted it along.

735
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,530
One for convenience. What
do I do now? Do you remember

736
00:45:56,870 --> 00:46:00,420
I the two lines together. Let's add
the two lions together. All right,

737
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:02,820
so I something on this side,

738
00:46:02,821 --> 00:46:06,300
I get one plus Delsa

739
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,440
that's 10

740
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:15,510
right on the other side. What's kind
of convenient is everything cancels.

741
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:20,040
The one comes through. I get a
one, but these two terms council,

742
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:24,390
these two terms council and these two
turn councils and so on and so on.

743
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:29,460
All the way out to the end.
Or I get minus Dal of the 10.

744
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:32,443
Okay.

745
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:36,890
We're okay. Well, the other types of
cancel out. All right, so now just uh,

746
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,170
sorting out my Algebra Brett,
I'm going to take on another side.

747
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,600
I'm going to have that.
They offer you make off.

748
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:45,800
This is what you're gonna get to
keep. So they might, they might not.

749
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:49,500
They might claim I should
keep in the first round is

750
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,750
one minus Delta to the 10

751
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,210
over
one plus downside.

752
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,470
I have a little bit careful up notation
here because maybe it'll a bit confusing.

753
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,590
The 10 here doesn't
mean to the 10th power,

754
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,690
it's just the offer in the 10th round.

755
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,270
Where's the tent here really
does mean in the 10th power.

756
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:15,683
Okay.

757
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,690
All right,
so if you play this game for 10 rounds,

758
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:24,870
the offer you'd make would be one minus
Delta to the 10 over one plus Delta,

759
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,150
which means that the amount of
your offering to the other side,

760
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:33,600
which is one ass would
be Delta Plus Delta,

761
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:36,064
the tenant

762
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:43,400
over one bus Dells.
All right,

763
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,760
so let's just summarize where we are.

764
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,440
We started off by considering
a very simple game,

765
00:47:48,441 --> 00:47:50,380
a one stage take it or leave it offer.

766
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,270
We know that in that take it or leave
it offer player one is going to claim

767
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,620
everything for herself and
offer nothing to play at two.

768
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:05,850
Then we can see a two stage game which
was the same as the one stage game except

769
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:11,080
that if player to rejects the
offer he is go back to he.

770
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,280
He gets to make an offer to play
out one in the second period.

771
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,350
We know that in the second period
of that two stage game play,

772
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,170
it too can keep everything for himself.

773
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:28,890
Everything for himself tomorrow is worth
Delta today so you have to offer him at

774
00:48:29,891 --> 00:48:33,640
least Delta today and keep
one minus Delta for yourself.

775
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:38,080
Then we noted a three stage
game in this three stage game.

776
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,260
If player two rejects
from the first round play,

777
00:48:41,261 --> 00:48:44,410
a two can make you an offer on the second
round but now if your player one and

778
00:48:44,411 --> 00:48:47,530
you reject on the second round you get
to make an offer to play or two in the

779
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:52,390
third round. We argued that in
the second round of this game,

780
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,010
the person if play a two rejects you in
the first round and makes an offer in

781
00:48:57,011 --> 00:48:57,844
the second round,

782
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:02,710
it'll be at a two stage game and they'll
be able to keep one minus delta of the

783
00:49:02,711 --> 00:49:04,660
Pie for themselves.

784
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:09,870
So you have to offer them at least Delta
Times one minus Delta today for them to

785
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:12,220
accept the offer,
keeping the rest of the ourself.

786
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:16,090
Then we look to the forestage
game in the fourth stage game.

787
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:19,270
If you play a two rejects your offer,
he can make you an offer,

788
00:49:19,271 --> 00:49:21,340
but if you can recollect now
and you can make him an offer,

789
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,140
but if he rejects it off,
he can make you an offer.

790
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:27,760
And once again we asked how much do I
have to offer play a two now for him to

791
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:31,900
accept the offer.
Now he knows that if he rejects the offer,

792
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:37,080
he can get this amount one minus
Delta Times one minus Delsa tomorrow.

793
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:43,930
So I have to offer him del Sur Times
that today I want to get lucky.

794
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:44,830
I just saved myself.

795
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,640
All right.
That's just a summary of what we did.

796
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:49,440
And then what we did was we cheated.

797
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:53,400
We jumped to the 10th stage just noticing
that the pattern that emerged and we

798
00:49:53,401 --> 00:49:54,930
found that the 10th stage,

799
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,980
this is the offer you'd make just
according to the same pattern,

800
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,630
and it was this horrible thing.

801
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,710
And then we used a little bit of high
school math to simplify this thing and it

802
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:09,000
turns out this is the amount you'll keep
yourself and this is the offer you'll

803
00:50:09,001 --> 00:50:09,550
make to play it.

804
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:12,700
Let's see. All right. Each case, they'll
be accepted. I make a math mistake.

805
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,540
Thank you guys. Let's make, let's
put a Steven Strip to here. Good.

806
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,453
All right,

807
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,300
so what do,
what do we observe here?

808
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:26,900
So the first thing to observe
is in the one stage game, if we,

809
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:29,060
if we believe backward induction,

810
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:32,930
you certainly want to be the person
making me off in the one stage,

811
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:37,370
gave him the ultimatum game.
There's no huge first mover advantage.

812
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:39,020
Yeah.

813
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:42,110
In the two stage game, it's not
clear if you want to make the offer.

814
00:50:42,111 --> 00:50:43,730
It depends on how large Delta is.

815
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:48,880
But if delta has a big number like 0.9
you'd rather be the person receiving the

816
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:49,844
offer

817
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:56,200
in the three stage game it looks like
it looks like you'd probably rather make

818
00:50:57,591 --> 00:50:59,450
the offer,
but it's not so clear.

819
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,040
So where does it go to as we go down
the path as it goes down towards the 10

820
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:04,874
stage game,

821
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,450
it looks like in the 10 stage
game he was like a 10 stage game.

822
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:11,880
You probably still prefer
to make the offer the note,

823
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,120
but they're certainly much closer
together than they were before.

824
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:18,800
Some of that initial bargaining power
has been washed out by the fact that 10

825
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,020
stages.
All right,

826
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:26,090
so let's try and push this just
a little bit harder. What is,

827
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,580
instead of looking at the 10 stage offer,

828
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:32,080
what have we look at the infant
stage office? So what is the,

829
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,080
what is it in principle,
in principle,

830
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,970
we look at the infant stage of this game.
All right?

831
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,350
So I can make you an offer.

832
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:45,710
You can say no and make me an offer and
then I can reject to make you an offer.

833
00:51:45,711 --> 00:51:48,920
And then you can object to make me an
offer and so on and so forth. All right,

834
00:51:48,921 --> 00:51:51,950
so we look at this term.
If there's an in principle,

835
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,190
you could make an infinite
number of office. All right,

836
00:51:55,191 --> 00:51:57,980
so what's this tone I'm going to look
like if I can make an infinite number of

837
00:51:57,981 --> 00:51:58,814
office.

838
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:03,850
So I claim it's going to look like this
one minus Delta to the infancy over one

839
00:52:05,841 --> 00:52:10,480
plus delta. And over here is this
it converge towards less than me.

840
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:15,600
Picked up more formal and over here we'll
have delta plus Delta to the infancy

841
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,400
over
one plus thousand

842
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:22,230
yeah.

843
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:24,600
However, now I can get, now
I get a little bit simpler.

844
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,780
What is Delta to the
infinity? It's zero, right?

845
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:35,020
2.9 times 0.9 10 point 909 has what?
9.9 0.99 a pound.

846
00:52:35,021 --> 00:52:39,930
Mine is zero.
So this last term disappears.

847
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:45,090
Past does this one and we just
get one over one plus Delta

848
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,313
and

849
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:56,730
Delta over one plus Delta.
So if we,

850
00:52:56,731 --> 00:53:00,740
like if we make alternating
offer bargaining bargaining game,

851
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:03,230
when each round I make you an offer,

852
00:53:03,231 --> 00:53:07,970
you can accept it or you can reject and
make me an offer and we imagined this no

853
00:53:07,971 --> 00:53:11,120
bound to this game.
It just goes on arbitrarily long.

854
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,810
Then our prediction is that player one,

855
00:53:14,811 --> 00:53:16,670
the person who makes the first offer,

856
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:21,940
we'll get one over one plus Delta
of the initial Pi and play a two.

857
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:25,160
We'll get delta over one
plus Delta of the initial Pi.

858
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:30,070
Let's try and get a handle about
what those numbers are. All right,

859
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:34,300
so if you imagine these offers
can be made fairly rapidly.

860
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:36,810
For example,
I could make an offer today.

861
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,910
You can make an offer back to me and half
an hour's time and then I can make an

862
00:53:39,911 --> 00:53:41,670
offer back to you in half an hour's time.

863
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,950
Then it's reasonable to assume that the
pie is not shrinking very fast, right?

864
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:50,650
The discount factor is not
a big deal here. All right,

865
00:53:50,651 --> 00:53:52,810
so he's offers to be
made in rapid succession.

866
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:56,920
Then we might think that Delta
itself is approximately one.

867
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:01,610
The Pie isn't drinking very fast.
If Dell does approximately one right?

868
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,190
If we take Delta to one here,

869
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,370
that'd be the time.

870
00:54:07,371 --> 00:54:11,090
Isn't that valuable given how rapidly
we can make offers to and fro.

871
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,160
Then what does this make this equal

872
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,610
and the case went delta is equal to one.
What did we get?

873
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:25,210
We got a health
which means this will also be

874
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,820
so we learned something from this
which is kind of surprising if you do

875
00:54:32,821 --> 00:54:37,200
alternating offers this, that standard,
very natural game of bargaining,

876
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:41,520
sort of the kind of bargaining you might
do in the business and a market or the

877
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:45,450
kind of bargaining you might imagine
going on in negotiations between baseball

878
00:54:45,451 --> 00:54:49,850
players or their agents and teams. All
general managers of teams. All right,

879
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:54,270
which offers just go to and fro and
they go to and fro fairly rapidly and in

880
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:58,340
principle they could make lots and lots
of office in principle what we should,

881
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:03,400
what this model tells us is in principle
we're going to end up with each people

882
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:06,540
with each side splitting whatever.
The Pie was

883
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,103
equally

884
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:10,121
very,

885
00:55:10,121 --> 00:55:14,110
very different from the ultimatum game
where all the bargaining power was on the

886
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:15,340
person who made the first offer.

887
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:19,710
All right. All right, so
what are the lessons here?

888
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,670
What can we conclude from this?

889
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,750
We've looked at alternating

890
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:41,970
offer
bargaining

891
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:49,610
and we've concluded under under special
conditions we've concluded that you get

892
00:55:49,611 --> 00:55:50,570
an even split.

893
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:52,300
Okay,

894
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:57,300
why didn't you get an even share and even
split 50 50 splits if three things are

895
00:55:58,841 --> 00:56:01,390
true,
the first thing is there,

896
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,840
there's potentially infinite many offers,
potentially

897
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,810
potentially 10 bargain forever

898
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,100
if discounting is not a big deal.

899
00:56:21,101 --> 00:56:23,110
What does discounting really
not being a big deal means?

900
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,260
Means there's offers can be made
in rapid succession. All right,

901
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:27,490
so no discounting.

902
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:30,003
Yeah.

903
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:36,210
Is there just kind of take it
or if you like rapid offers,

904
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,460
if you don't have to wait
a year between every offer,

905
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:40,230
that discount factor would be a big deal,

906
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:46,970
but I actually made a third assumption
and I made it without telling you what

907
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:48,630
was the third assumption I made.

908
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,720
I snuck a third assumption past you
without telling you what was that third

909
00:56:53,731 --> 00:56:57,190
assumption?
Can we get that?

910
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:03,340
The mic? Can I claim I
snuck a third assumption?

911
00:57:03,341 --> 00:57:05,980
There's somebody, let me start over
here. What was the third or something?

912
00:57:05,981 --> 00:57:08,950
I don't know if this was really poor,
but they know how big the pie is.

913
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,370
They know how big the pie. That's true.
That's a big deal actually. It's true.

914
00:57:12,371 --> 00:57:16,030
But there's something else going on
here. What else is going on here? Uh,

915
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:19,840
we assume that both players are rational.
We assume that that's true,

916
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:21,750
but we missed. That's, we've kind
of been assuming that throughout.

917
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,660
Back in induction.
You're right.

918
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,690
None of this packet induction would
apply so cleanly if we didn't just see in

919
00:57:26,691 --> 00:57:31,570
that. What else do I say? It's hidden.

920
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:34,720
Actually I snuck it in.
A discount factor is a constant.

921
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,800
We are still just go have just a constant.
That's true, but not just constant,

922
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:42,220
but something else. You're on the
right lines. They're the same, right?

923
00:57:42,221 --> 00:57:47,221
I've assumed here implicitly I've
assumed that both people are equally in

924
00:57:49,441 --> 00:57:51,520
patient.
They have the same discount factor,

925
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:58,080
the same discount factor.

926
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:03,950
Delta one equals Delta suit.
All right.

927
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:07,860
Why does that matter? What does that
think about it intuitively a second.

928
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,570
Suppose that one of these players is very,
very impatient.

929
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,200
They need the money. Now. If
it's cake, they need the cake.

930
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:21,201
Now that very impatient and the
other person is very patient,

931
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:26,080
right? They can wait forever to get
this bug and to come across. All right.

932
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,850
Who Do you think's going to do better?
The patient plan or the inpatient player,

933
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,630
the patient is going to do better.
I had the patient placement to do better.

934
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:39,140
The way we ended up way we did all
this analysis is we assumed that those

935
00:58:39,151 --> 00:58:40,560
discount factors were the same.

936
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:45,180
We assumed that each person was
discounting time at the same rate,

937
00:58:45,181 --> 00:58:48,360
perhaps because they were facing the
same bank with the same interest rate,

938
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:50,220
but in practice,

939
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:54,630
often one side is going to be in a
hurry to get the dispute resolved on the

940
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:58,170
other side can sit around
forever, right? And in that world,

941
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:02,940
the side you can sit around forever
is going to do much better. Alright,

942
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,510
now we're going to look at relaxing
this assumption and this assumption in

943
00:59:06,511 --> 00:59:08,310
particular,
we're going to relax it

944
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,350
on a homework exercise.
All right,

945
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:20,030
so I knew a homework exercise.
You're going to try redoing
part of this analysis.

946
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,200
Good practice anyway,

947
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:25,430
but doing it in a setting where the
where the discount factors are different.

948
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:28,683
All right,

949
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:33,810
so one thing we learned here was yes,
you get an even split, but it depends.

950
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,750
It depends on these three assumptions.
All right,

951
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:40,020
and it's kind of important because when
you, when you think about bargaining,

952
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:43,460
I think a lot of people simply
assume intuitively that will,

953
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:46,650
whenever the bargain is about,
people will eventually split on the metal.

954
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,380
When you're bargaining about a house
and what price you're going to pay for a

955
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:50,490
house,
all these things,

956
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,640
you kind of implicitly have
this assumption they're
going to end up splitting

957
00:59:53,641 --> 00:59:54,474
the difference.

958
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,450
What I'm arguing here is you will
split the difference and this natural

959
00:59:57,451 --> 00:59:58,284
bargaining game,

960
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:02,550
but only under very special assumptions
and in particular the assumption of

961
01:00:02,551 --> 01:00:03,110
patients

962
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:04,960
for sure.
All right?

963
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:09,800
All right.

964
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,220
There's another remarkable thing
here though. It's also hidden.

965
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,560
So not only did we end
up with an even splits,

966
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,440
but something else remarkable
happened in this bargaining game.

967
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:21,350
What was the other thing?
Somewhat amazingly,

968
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:25,340
very unrealistic thing that occurred
in this bargaining game. Let's see.

969
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:26,203
We can spot it.

970
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:29,960
So one thing was an assumption I made
and the other is actually a prediction.

971
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:35,050
Yeah. So the first offer will be the
offer that's accepted. Good, good.

972
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,460
Everyone see that?
So in this bargaining game,

973
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:39,530
I set it up as alternating
offer bargaining.

974
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:43,310
So the image you had in
your mind was of haggling.

975
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,440
I made an offer. You guys thought about
this offer, shall I take this off? Oh man,

976
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,560
maybe I won't take this off and you make
me an offer back to me and we kind of

977
01:00:51,561 --> 01:00:56,510
handles to and fro. But actually
in the equilibrium of the game,

978
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,750
none of that happened.
That will happen in our mind.

979
01:00:59,751 --> 01:01:03,380
We thought about what offer we would
make and we thought about what offer you

980
01:01:03,381 --> 01:01:06,650
would make back to me if I made you this
offer and you were drafted it and so on.

981
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:10,010
We did this backward induction exercise,
but it was all in our heads,

982
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:13,940
right in this, in this game.
The actual prediction is

983
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:18,320
the very first offer

984
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:27,780
is accepted. Very first offer is
accepted. There's no haggling,

985
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:28,920
there's no bargaining.

986
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:31,410
All right?

987
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,300
But that doesn't seem very realistic.

988
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:35,800
All right?
There's no haggling.

989
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:48,370
Backward induction suggests that
we should never see bargaining,

990
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:51,940
but let me see what the
actual process of pocketing.

991
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:55,270
Well we should see is an offer
is made and it's accepted.

992
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:01,530
Now what is it about the real world
that allows for haggling to take place?

993
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:02,941
If this was the,

994
01:02:02,941 --> 01:02:05,970
if there was a model of the real world
and we will leave it backward, induction,

995
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,970
then we're done.
So why is it in fact,

996
01:02:08,971 --> 01:02:12,570
in the real world we seek will
see people make offers to and fro.

997
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,170
What's different about the
real world than this model?

998
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,130
All right, let's talk about it. A bet.

999
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,150
How many of you have a,

1000
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:24,900
you must have all bargain for something
in the real world and none of you

1001
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:27,390
probably bargained for a house yet,
but you want a bargain for cars,

1002
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:32,220
I think right in the, in the real world
you make offers go to and fro, right?

1003
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:35,460
What's going on? Why are we getting
off frigging offers in the real world?

1004
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:39,740
Whereas we don't in this game, what
are we missing? Yeah, that's good.

1005
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:41,663
Let's trap it.

1006
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:43,103
Okay.

1007
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:45,020
Uh,
in the real world,

1008
01:02:45,021 --> 01:02:47,780
you don't actually know what the other
person discount factor is there for.

1009
01:02:47,781 --> 01:02:52,570
You have uncertainty as to what your
highest possible offer can be. Good. Good.

1010
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:56,240
So in the real world,
unlike the model on the board,

1011
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,760
not only are those
discount factors different,

1012
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:03,290
but you probably don't know how patient
or in patient, the other side is.

1013
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:06,000
You can get some ideas about
how patients are patient.

1014
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:09,710
The other side is by looking at
other characteristics. For example,

1015
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:13,340
for as long as you know that the person
you're bargaining with over their car,

1016
01:03:13,341 --> 01:03:16,490
you're trying to buy that car and they're
a graduate student who's just got a

1017
01:03:16,491 --> 01:03:18,040
job in a Adam,

1018
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,600
it was Pakistan or something and they
ain't gonna take him to the car with them

1019
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,870
and they're leaving next week, you know,
you know they're in a hurry. All right?

1020
01:03:23,871 --> 01:03:26,270
So there's times when you're gonna
know something about what other people

1021
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,070
discount factor is how patient they are,

1022
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,400
but lots of times you're not
going to know. All right?

1023
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:35,330
So one thing is you just don't know
what the discount factor is. By the way,

1024
01:03:35,331 --> 01:03:39,740
what else might you not know about the
other side? What else might you not know?

1025
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,160
Yeah, how big the surpluses
that you're splitting.

1026
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:49,280
Good. You might not know this good that
you're selling. You might not know.

1027
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:51,550
We've been talking
about the being one pie,

1028
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,880
which you're carving up and everyone
knows the size of the Pie, right?

1029
01:03:54,881 --> 01:03:58,720
But in the real world, I might
not know that this, this, this,

1030
01:03:58,721 --> 01:04:00,100
this object that's being sold.

1031
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:04,850
I might not know how much this object
is worth to the other side and he or she

1032
01:04:04,851 --> 01:04:08,290
may not know how much it's
worth to me. Alright, so that,

1033
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,330
that lack of information,

1034
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:14,860
lack of information is going to change
the game considerably. In particular,

1035
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:19,920
I might want to turn down some offers
in this game in order to appear like a

1036
01:04:21,371 --> 01:04:22,970
patient person.
Well,

1037
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,110
I might want to turn down some offers
in the game in order to appear like

1038
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:30,220
somebody who doesn't really value
this all very much. All right.

1039
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,300
And in so doing,

1040
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:35,650
I'm going to try and get you to make
me a better offer all answering what's

1041
01:04:35,651 --> 01:04:39,040
going on in handling and boggling
bargaining according to this model.

1042
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:43,030
What's missing in this model is the idea
that you don't know who it is you're

1043
01:04:43,031 --> 01:04:46,120
bargaining with. You don't know how much
they value the objects and question.

1044
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:50,740
You don't know how impatient they are
to get away with the cash. All right?

1045
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:55,540
So it's a big assumption here. Very big
assumption is that everything is known,

1046
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,960
right? So both the Dick
both disc, both patients,

1047
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:00,690
yeah.

1048
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:05,220
Things, uh, both the size of the
pie. What is the value of the pie?

1049
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:07,873
Okay.

1050
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:10,900
The value of the pie

1051
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,840
and the value of time

1052
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,560
is assumed to be known,

1053
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:24,263
okay.

1054
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:25,780
But in the real world,

1055
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:28,750
you typically don't know the value
of the pie of the other side.

1056
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:33,400
And you typically don't know how
much they value your time. All right?

1057
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,500
So that produces a whole
literature on bargaining,

1058
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,420
none of which we really have
time to do in this class.

1059
01:05:37,421 --> 01:05:40,240
It's a pity because boggling,
ton of important. So instead,

1060
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,230
I want to spend the last five
minutes just introducing, uh,

1061
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:47,740
why is it really worth interesting in your
topic in the last five minutes? Um, no,

1062
01:05:47,741 --> 01:05:48,370
I don't think it is.

1063
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:50,530
Let me talk a little bit more
about marketing rather than that.

1064
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:52,063
Okay?

1065
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:55,600
All right. So what does
this suggest? All right,

1066
01:05:55,601 --> 01:05:58,580
what does this suggest if we're going
out in the real world? All right.

1067
01:05:58,581 --> 01:06:01,160
I'll actually take Mr. Taking
this to reality, right?

1068
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:05,440
So one thing it suggests is
people for whom it's noon,

1069
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:07,000
that they're going to be impatient.

1070
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:11,920
People for whom it's known that they
desperately need this deal to go through

1071
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:16,600
are going to do less well in bargains.
Right.

1072
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:18,940
We already knew people made it less
one bonding cause cause they're less

1073
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:22,450
sophisticated players. But here he
doesn't put that as sophisticated.

1074
01:06:22,451 --> 01:06:25,720
They can be sophisticated you like, but
they're just going to be in a, in a hurry.

1075
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,630
All right. We already talked about the
greatest student who's meeting for us,

1076
01:06:28,631 --> 01:06:33,490
Pakistan, right? But who else typically
in bargaining is going to need,

1077
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:34,600
need cash now,

1078
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:39,070
who else is going to be a weaker position
when that bargaining socially and in,

1079
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:39,913
in our society,

1080
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:48,920
I'm trying to get this questions out
here. Yeah. And Labor management, uh,

1081
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:51,610
disputes labor. So that's a good
question. Right? It's a good question.

1082
01:06:51,611 --> 01:06:54,250
In Labor management dispute, there's
one going on right now in Hollywood.

1083
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,370
It's not clear that right.
Could be. It could be the,

1084
01:06:57,371 --> 01:07:01,900
it could be the management side who's
in a hurry because they just need right

1085
01:07:01,901 --> 01:07:04,240
now to get a in, um, David Alman,

1086
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:07,150
David David Edmunds stripped
written or that would,

1087
01:07:07,151 --> 01:07:09,880
that would tend to favor labor,
but it could be the labor side.

1088
01:07:09,881 --> 01:07:12,450
Why might it be the Labor
side? So it never know this,
there's this, there's this,

1089
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:15,250
there's a writer's strike going on
in Hollywood right now. All right?

1090
01:07:15,251 --> 01:07:18,610
So the people on the management side
who are in the weakest position or the

1091
01:07:18,611 --> 01:07:20,770
people who are in the most
hardy to get this result,

1092
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,280
and those are guys with the fewest scripts
in the pipeline and that tends to be

1093
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:25,300
late night TV shows.

1094
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:28,570
So those guys really want this
thing settled fast there in a week.

1095
01:07:28,571 --> 01:07:30,730
Bargaining position.
On the other hand,

1096
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:33,190
the maybe a reason why Labor's
in a week bargaining position.

1097
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:36,910
Why might labor being a week bargaining
position relative to management

1098
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:41,570
rents to pay,
right?

1099
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:45,640
They have rents to pay that they have
immediate demands on that cash right to

1100
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:49,930
the typical worker is typically poorer
than your typical manager. Not always,

1101
01:07:49,931 --> 01:07:52,870
but typically. All right. Are they just
have to, they have to pay the rent.

1102
01:07:52,871 --> 01:07:55,750
They have to feed. They have to
feed that children. All right,

1103
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:59,590
so there's a more general idea
that more generally in bargaining,

1104
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:03,470
the people who are poorer,
typically we'll have this,

1105
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:04,600
isn't this poor in terms of income,

1106
01:08:04,601 --> 01:08:07,150
it's poor in terms of
wealth are going to have,

1107
01:08:07,151 --> 01:08:10,810
I've got to be more impatient to get
things resolved and that's going to put

1108
01:08:10,811 --> 01:08:13,740
them in a weaker bargaining position.
I got a second one.

1109
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,550
So in bilateral bargaining,
right,

1110
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:20,930
having low wealth and being known to
have low wealth puts you in a weaker

1111
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:24,680
position and that means that
typically people who are poorer,

1112
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:27,800
I'm going to do less. Well though the
late night TV show, maybe an exception.

1113
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:30,310
All right.
All right.

1114
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,740
What makes you think a
little bit about weather?

1115
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:36,040
Just setting up a bargaining position
makes things equal for everybody.

1116
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:39,160
All right. Any other thoughts
about who has strengthened,

1117
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:40,450
who has weakness and body?
What are the,

1118
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:43,360
what are the kinds of stumps do
we see people do in bargaining?

1119
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:47,190
What else? He's got a missing
here that we need to think about,

1120
01:08:47,191 --> 01:08:48,960
particularly if we want
to do in this class.

1121
01:08:48,961 --> 01:08:50,970
It's developed these ideas and
take them to the real world.

1122
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:54,540
So one of the real world, real world
things here are kind of missing.

1123
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:57,343
Yeah.

1124
01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:01,630
Usually people make their first offer
a lot higher than what they're actually

1125
01:09:01,631 --> 01:09:04,750
willing to accept, right? So
typically, typically you're right,

1126
01:09:04,751 --> 01:09:05,584
typically people come,

1127
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:09,250
the typically bargaining isn't
just a series of random numbers.

1128
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:13,440
Typically people start out high and
then they can see towards the middle.

1129
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:16,330
Is that right? So if,
if I, if I'm the buyer,

1130
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:19,120
I start out with a low price and come up.
And if you're the seller,

1131
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:22,600
you start off with a high price
and come down. All right. So again,

1132
01:09:22,601 --> 01:09:27,280
that seems to be about
establishing reputation and
trying to indicate how much I

1133
01:09:27,281 --> 01:09:31,420
want this. Good. All right. There's,
uh, something worth staying here,

1134
01:09:31,421 --> 01:09:34,090
which we haven't got time to doing this
class and I hope you'll have time to

1135
01:09:34,091 --> 01:09:38,470
take you to take the foot off plus one 56.
We can actually show formally,

1136
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:42,940
but in a setting in which buyers and
sellers are bargaining and buyers and

1137
01:09:42,941 --> 01:09:47,740
sellers do not know how much the good is
worth to the buyer or how much it cost

1138
01:09:47,741 --> 01:09:51,310
to the silo. Typically you can
not expect to get efficiency.

1139
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,350
Let me say that again.
All right?

1140
01:09:53,351 --> 01:09:55,440
So it's kind of an important
economic facts that were,

1141
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:58,630
that's missing from one 15 and
unfortunately missing from this class.

1142
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:02,800
But if we go to a more real world setting
in which people's values and not known,

1143
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:05,320
not only are the offers
not accepted immediately,

1144
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:08,410
and not only is there something near
Quincy in that the port and that be more

1145
01:10:08,411 --> 01:10:10,960
impatient than that dude as well.
But also you get,

1146
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:15,730
you get bad inefficiency and
the inefficiency is occurs
essentially because the

1147
01:10:15,731 --> 01:10:18,310
sellers want to seem
like that hard and the,

1148
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,420
and the buyers want to seem like
that hard and you get a failure,

1149
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:25,270
you get a failed effort for
deals to be made. All right?

1150
01:10:25,271 --> 01:10:28,660
So some deals are actually going to
be lost or take a long time in coming.

1151
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:32,470
You're gonna get some strikes before the
deals occur. And that's all inefficient.

1152
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:35,140
Alright,
so bargaining not in this model,

1153
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:39,160
but in the real world tends to
lead to inefficiency. Alright,

1154
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:40,361
so I'll leave it there.

1155
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:43,150
We'll have an earliest lumps were all
starving because the top change anyway.
