00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's start with a bird's eye view on the finite-element method--FEM.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
These days it's the workhorse of almost all mechanical engineers.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
FEM can answer, for instance, what happens when you put a huge truck on a bridge.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
To compute this deformation is application of FEM to the static case,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but FEM can also be applied in a dynamic setting,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
for instance, to simulate the effect of a crash on a car body.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Here it's important to look at the process of buckling.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Whereas in the static case we're not really interested in how the truck was placed on the bridge.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It just has to be there.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I want to outline three fundamental ideas of the finite element method.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The first is discretization.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The continuous structures are approximated with the help of--guess what--finite elements--

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
elements of finite size, not infinitesimal size.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
When we do so the first question is which geometry these finite elements should have.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Should they be tetrahedra?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Should they be cubes?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Or should they even be curvilinear?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The second fundamental idea is that of interpolation.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Given the finite elements, how do I compute a value at an arbitrary location?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
For the static case, a really fundamental idea is that of minimization

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
of the potential energy.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Think about a ball that rolls on a terrain of mountains and valleys.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Eventually, it's going to come to rest in a valley.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
In the static case, potential energy is minimized.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Let's have a closer look at that valley.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
In the Gedankenexperiment, it splices this object a little further to the left

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
or a little further to the right.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Then the energy stays almost the same because we're at the bottom of the valley,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
which means that to displace this object in this way require no work.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
This is the concept of virtual work.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
For all infinitesimal displacements that are allowed--

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
we can't go down and we can't go up, obviously--

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
the virtual work equals 0.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
In mathematics, this way of posing the problem with the help of virtual work

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
is called a weak form.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The strong form would be to ask for all forces to compensate.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The weak form asks for the virtual work to be equal to 0 for all allowed virtual displacements.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
This weak form results in a finite number of equations that we can solve on the computer.

00:02:39.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This finite number, however, may range in the hundred thousands or even millions.
