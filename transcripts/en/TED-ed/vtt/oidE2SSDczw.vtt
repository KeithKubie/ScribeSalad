00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:09.490
Many elements of traditional Japanese culture,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.490
such as cuisine

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.550
and martial arts,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.586
are well-known throughout the world.

00:00:13.586 --> 00:00:16.412
Kabuki, a form of classical theater performance,

00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:18.796
may not be as well understood in the West

00:00:18.796 --> 00:00:20.753
but has evolved over 400 years

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:24.737
to still maintain influence and popularity to this day.

00:00:24.737 --> 00:00:26.186
The word Kabuki is derived

00:00:26.186 --> 00:00:28.357
from the Japanese verb kabuku,

00:00:28.357 --> 00:00:30.958
meaning out of the ordinary or bizarre.

00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:34.339
Its history began in early 17th century Kyoto,

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:37.235
where a shrine maiden named Izumo no Okuni

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:40.537
would use the city's dry Kamo Riverbed as a stage

00:00:40.537 --> 00:00:43.468
to perform unusual dances for passerby,

00:00:43.468 --> 00:00:45.870
who found her daring parodies of Buddhist prayers

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.412
both entertaining and mesmerizing.

00:00:48.412 --> 00:00:50.217
Soon other troops began performing

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:51.545
in the same style,

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:53.086
and Kabuki made history

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.549
as Japan's first dramatic performance form

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:57.498
catering to the common people.

00:00:57.498 --> 00:00:59.832
By relying on makeup, or keshou,

00:00:59.832 --> 00:01:02.296
and facial expressions instead of masks

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:04.380
and focusing on historical events

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.739
and everyday life rather than folk tales,

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:08.213
Kabuki set itself apart

00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:10.270
from the upper-class dance theater form

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.552
known as Noh

00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:14.131
and provided a unique commentary on society

00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:16.113
during the Edo period.

00:01:16.113 --> 00:01:18.964
At first, the dance was practiced only by females

00:01:18.964 --> 00:01:22.022
and commonly referred to as Onna-Kabuki.

00:01:22.022 --> 00:01:24.627
It soon evolved to an ensemble performance

00:01:24.627 --> 00:01:27.049
and became a regular attraction at tea houses,

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.735
drawing audiences from all social classes.

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:32.831
At this point, Onna-Kabuki was often risque

00:01:32.831 --> 00:01:35.293
as geishas performed not only to show off

00:01:35.293 --> 00:01:36.955
their singing and dancing abilities

00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:40.384
but also to advertise their bodies to potential clients.

00:01:40.384 --> 00:01:43.462
A ban by the conservative Tokugawa shogunate

00:01:43.462 --> 00:01:44.885
in 1629

00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:47.660
led to the emergence of Wakashu-Kabuki

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.665
with young boys as actors.

00:01:49.665 --> 00:01:52.532
But when this was also banned for similar reasons,

00:01:52.532 --> 00:01:55.121
there was a transition to Yaro-Kabuki,

00:01:55.121 --> 00:01:56.129
performed by men,

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:58.577
necessitating elaborate costumes and makeup

00:01:58.577 --> 00:02:00.548
for those playing female roles,

00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:01.836
or onnagata.

00:02:01.836 --> 00:02:03.885
Attempts by the government to control Kabuki

00:02:03.885 --> 00:02:05.754
didn't end with bans on the gender

00:02:05.754 --> 00:02:07.599
or age of performers.

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:09.384
The Tokugawa military group,

00:02:09.384 --> 00:02:10.595
or Bakufu,

00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:12.553
was fueled by Confucian ideals

00:02:12.553 --> 00:02:14.100
and often enacted sanctions

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.440
on costume fabrics,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.517
stage weaponry,

00:02:16.517 --> 00:02:18.605
and the subject matter of the plot.

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:19.552
At the same time,

00:02:19.552 --> 00:02:21.517
Kabuki became closely associated with

00:02:21.517 --> 00:02:23.546
and influenced by Bunraku,

00:02:23.546 --> 00:02:26.170
an elaborate form of puppet theater.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.712
Due to these influences,

00:02:27.712 --> 00:02:29.964
the once spontaneous, one-act dance

00:02:29.964 --> 00:02:33.121
evolved into a structured, five-act play

00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:36.912
often based on the tenets of Confucian philosophy.

00:02:36.912 --> 00:02:40.652
Before 1868, when the Tokugawa shogunate fell

00:02:40.652 --> 00:02:42.801
and Emperor Meiji was restored to power,

00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:45.670
Japan had practiced isolation from other countries,

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.915
or Sakoku.

00:02:46.915 --> 00:02:48.513
And thus, the development of Kabuki

00:02:48.513 --> 00:02:51.497
had mostly been shaped by domestic influences.

00:02:51.497 --> 00:02:53.164
But even before this period,

00:02:53.164 --> 00:02:55.721
European artists, such as Claude Monet,

00:02:55.721 --> 00:02:57.149
had become interested in

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:58.827
and inspired by Japanese art,

00:02:58.827 --> 00:03:00.642
such as woodblock prints,

00:03:00.642 --> 00:03:02.376
as well as live performance.

00:03:02.376 --> 00:03:05.497
After 1868, others such as Vincent van Gogh

00:03:05.497 --> 00:03:07.571
and composer Claude Debussy

00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:10.509
began to incorporate Kabuki influences in their work,

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:12.051
while Kabuki itself underwent

00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:13.940
much change and experimentation

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.163
to adapt to the new modern era.

00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:17.892
Like other traditional art forms,

00:03:17.892 --> 00:03:19.618
Kabuki suffered in popularity

00:03:19.618 --> 00:03:21.411
in the wake of World War II.

00:03:21.411 --> 00:03:22.823
But innovation by artists

00:03:22.823 --> 00:03:25.075
such as director Tetsuji Takechi

00:03:25.075 --> 00:03:27.867
led to a resurgence shortly after.

00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:29.761
Indeed, Kabuki was even considered

00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:31.332
a popular form of entertainment

00:03:31.332 --> 00:03:33.731
amongst American troops stationed in Japan

00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:35.767
despite initial U.S. censorship

00:03:35.767 --> 00:03:37.555
of Japanese traditions.

00:03:37.555 --> 00:03:39.076
Today, Kabuki still lives on

00:03:39.076 --> 00:03:42.334
as an integral part of Japan's rich cultural heritage,

00:03:42.334 --> 00:03:44.495
extending its influence beyond the stage

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:45.320
to television,

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.877
film,

00:03:45.877 --> 00:03:46.957
and anime.

00:03:46.957 --> 00:03:49.133
The art form pioneered by Okuni

00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:50.841
continues to delight audiences

00:03:50.841 --> 00:03:52.590
with the actors' elaborate makeup,

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.596
extravagant and delicately embroidered costumes,

00:03:55.596 --> 00:03:57.860
and the unmistakable melodrama

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.311
of the stories told on stage.
