it's important to rank these sectors by
 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.129
it's important to rank these sectors by
order of magnitude of stimulus and

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139
order of magnitude of stimulus and
 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.879

the US dollar to be destabilized they
want to continue to buy

rate so on balance I would say it's a

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160
rate so on balance I would say it's a
 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.980
rate so on balance I would say it's a
wonderful question because it provokes a

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.990
wonderful question because it provokes a
 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.790
wonderful question because it provokes a
very important debate but one needs to

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800
very important debate but one needs to
 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.140
very important debate but one needs to
disaggregate and deconstruct this

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150
disaggregate and deconstruct this
 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.150
disaggregate and deconstruct this
question in order to have a higher

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160
question in order to have a higher
 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.000
question in order to have a higher
degree of specificity about what sectors

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.010
degree of specificity about what sectors
 

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.420
degree of specificity about what sectors
are simulated by Chinese economic growth

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.430
are simulated by Chinese economic growth
 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.520
are simulated by Chinese economic growth
and also look at the competitive matrix

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.530
and also look at the competitive matrix
 

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.270
and also look at the competitive matrix
of each sector globally and see what

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280
of each sector globally and see what
 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.660
of each sector globally and see what
percentage China contributes to imports

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:35.670
percentage China contributes to imports
 

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.450
percentage China contributes to imports
and exports in each sector and to that

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460
and exports in each sector and to that
 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.200
and exports in each sector and to that
extent good luck in that research a lot

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.210
extent good luck in that research a lot
 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.610
extent good luck in that research a lot
of that research has already been done

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620
of that research has already been done
 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.280
of that research has already been done

latin american economic bilateral
 

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.060
latin american economic bilateral
relationship and i think that is a good

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:56.070
relationship and i think that is a good
 

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.380
relationship and i think that is a good
starting point is to look at large

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:00.390
starting point is to look at large
 

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:04.040
starting point is to look at large
capital flows between china and the

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.050
capital flows between china and the
 

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.400
capital flows between china and the
world and look at sector specific import

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:07.410
world and look at sector specific import
 

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:11.500
world and look at sector specific import
exports and try to make some deductions

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:11.510
exports and try to make some deductions
 

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.570
exports and try to make some deductions
so good luck in that research and again

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:14.580
so good luck in that research and again
 

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.030
so good luck in that research and again
