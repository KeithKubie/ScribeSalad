00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:02.106
- [Voiceover] We're told that
the quadratic expressions

00:00:02.106 --> 00:00:05.530
m squared minus 4m minus 45, and

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.607
6m squared minus 150,

00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:11.620
share a common binomial factor.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.291
What binomial factor do they share?

00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:16.067
And like always pause the video and

00:00:16.067 --> 00:00:17.956
see if you can work through this.

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:19.792
All right, now let's work
through this together and

00:00:19.792 --> 00:00:21.036
the way I am going to do this is

00:00:21.036 --> 00:00:23.264
I'm just going to try and
factor both of them into the

00:00:23.264 --> 00:00:25.511
product of binomials and
maybe some other things and

00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:28.142
see if we have any
common binomial factors.

00:00:28.142 --> 00:00:30.518
So first let's focus on

00:00:30.518 --> 00:00:33.659
m squared minus 4m minus 45.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.217
So let me write it over here,

00:00:35.217 --> 00:00:39.471
m squared minus 4m minus 45.

00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:43.531
So when you're factoring a
quadratic expression like this,

00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:46.255
where the coefficient
on the, in this case,

00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:49.054
m squared term, on the
second degree term is one,

00:00:49.054 --> 00:00:52.189
we could factor it as being equal to

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:56.950
m plus a, times m plus b,

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.316
where a plus b is going to be equal

00:00:59.316 --> 00:01:01.522
to this coefficient right over here,

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:03.959
and a times b is going to be equal

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:06.531
to this coefficient right over here.

00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:09.155
So let's be clear, so, a,

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:11.110
let me see another color,

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.833
so a plus b needs to
be equal to negative 4,

00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:18.633
a plus b needs to be equal to negative 4,

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:22.660
and then a times b needs
to be equal to negative 45.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.660
A times b is equal to negative 45.

00:01:27.727 --> 00:01:30.303
Now I like to focus on the
a times b and think about,

00:01:30.303 --> 00:01:34.853
well, what could a and b
be to get to negative 45?

00:01:34.853 --> 00:01:36.461
Well if I'm taking the
product of two things and

00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:38.156
if the product is negative that means that

00:01:38.156 --> 00:01:40.374
they are going to have different signs and

00:01:40.374 --> 00:01:44.100
if when we add them we get a
negative number that means that

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.093
the negative one

00:01:47.093 --> 00:01:50.890
has a larger magnitude.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.591
So let's think about this a little bit.

00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:54.900
So a times b is equal to negative 45.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.843
So this could be, let's
try some values out.

00:01:58.843 --> 00:02:02.966
So, 1 and 45, those are too far apart.

00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:03.856
Let's see.

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:08.856
3 and 15, those still
seem pretty far apart.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.873
Let's see, it looks like
5 and 9 seem interesting.

00:02:13.873 --> 00:02:15.377
So if we say,

00:02:15.377 --> 00:02:18.159
if we say 5 times,

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.971
if we were to say, 5 times negative 9,

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:26.265
that indeed is equal to negative 45,

00:02:26.265 --> 00:02:30.247
and 5 plus negative 9

00:02:30.247 --> 00:02:33.087
is indeed equal to negative 4.

00:02:33.087 --> 00:02:35.387
So a could be equal to 5 and

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:38.062
b could be equal to negative 9.

00:02:38.062 --> 00:02:41.062
And so if we were to factor
this, this is going to be

00:02:41.062 --> 00:02:43.483
m plus 5,

00:02:43.483 --> 00:02:46.132
times m, I could say m plus negative 9,

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:48.837
but I'll just write m minus 9.

00:02:48.837 --> 00:02:52.387
So just like that I've
been able to factor this

00:02:52.387 --> 00:02:54.129
first quadratic expression right

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.904
over there as a product of two binomials.

00:02:56.904 --> 00:02:59.911
So now let's try to factor the
other quadratic expression.

00:02:59.911 --> 00:03:04.911
Let's try to factor 6m squared minus 150.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.441
And let's see, the first
thing I might want to do is,

00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:12.405
both 6m squared and 150,

00:03:12.405 --> 00:03:14.807
they're both divisible by 6.

00:03:14.807 --> 00:03:16.737
So let me write it this
way, I could write it as,

00:03:16.737 --> 00:03:21.318
6m squared minus 6 times,

00:03:21.318 --> 00:03:26.005
let's see, 6 goes into 150, 25 times.

00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:27.593
So all I did is I rewrote this

00:03:27.593 --> 00:03:30.890
and really I just wrote 150 as 6 times 25.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.372
And now you can clearly see
that we can factor out a 6.

00:03:34.372 --> 00:03:36.717
You can view this as undistributing the 6.

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:38.777
So this is the same thing as

00:03:38.777 --> 00:03:43.205
6 times m squared minus 25,

00:03:43.205 --> 00:03:45.691
which we recognize this is
a difference of squares.

00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:47.915
So it's all going to be 6 times,

00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:52.915
m plus 5, times m minus 5.

00:03:53.542 --> 00:03:56.615
And so we've factored this out
as a product of binomials and

00:03:56.615 --> 00:04:00.253
a constant factor here, 6,

00:04:00.253 --> 00:04:03.721
and so, what is their shared, common

00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:06.578
or what is their common
binomial factor that they share?

00:04:06.578 --> 00:04:11.309
Well you see when we factored
it out, they both have

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:13.979
an m plus 5.

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.457
So m plus 5

00:04:16.457 --> 00:04:21.107
is the binomial factor that they share.
