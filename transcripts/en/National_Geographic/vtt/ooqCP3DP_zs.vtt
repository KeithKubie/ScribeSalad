( drumroll )

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:10.010
( music plays )

00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:12.845
<i> Travelers of the Year</i>
gives us a chance

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.816
to meet boundary-breaking,
change-making individuals

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.118
who remind us
that we all have the power

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.754
to reach beyond the bubble
of our daily lives,

00:00:21.787 --> 00:00:24.691
to learn from locals
and far-off places

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:29.062
and to create new opportunities
through travel.

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:31.197
These are the people
we're celebrating.

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:35.235
( clapping )

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.671 line:0%
My name is George Stone,
I'm an Editor-at-Large

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:42.374 line:0%
of<i> National Geographic
 Traveler</i> . I'm based in
South-East Asia.

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:44.777
It's a real honor
to be here tonight

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.913
to introduce you to a few
of our<i> Travelers of the Year</i> .

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:51.617
These are people on a quest,
striving to make a difference.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.287
So, first I would like
to invite Shannon O'Donnell

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:58.457
to the stage, our first
<i> Traveler of the Year</i> tonight.

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:01.027
( clapping )

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:03.396
-Hello.
-Hi.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.267
Shannon is a blogger,
a voluntourist extraordinaire.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.704
And you can follow her
on alittleadrift.com.

00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:16.175
But her blog alone is not
what makes Shannon a
<i> Traveler of the Year.</i>

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.243
While she was
traveling and blogging,

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:21.180
she studied ethical ways
for other travelers

00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:23.916
to give back
to the places they visit.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.451
She collected these discoveries

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:27.020
and she published them
in a book called

00:01:27.053 --> 00:01:29.555
<i> The Volunteer Traveler's
 Handbook.</i>

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:32.091
She launched something
called Grassroots Volunteering,

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:34.594
which is a digital platform
and a database

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:37.863
of free and low-cost
volunteering opportunities.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:40.165
So, how did you evolve
from a traveler

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:41.768
to a voluntourist?

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:43.770 line:0%
It started when I decided

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:45.905 line:0%
to leave on my one-year
round-the-world trip.

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:48.641 line:0%
I had already
integrated service into my life.

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:53.012 line:0%
I had volunteered as a teenager
and in my home town

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.214
and when I moved.

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:57.483
It was part of what I was
doing back in the U.S.

00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:59.452
When I decided
to leave for a year, I thought,

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:01.654
"Why not keep
that same mindset?"

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:03.289
“Why not try
to find opportunities

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:04.490
not just to volunteer,

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:07.961
but to be mindful of the places
that I was working in?”

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.062
So, I volunteered
with some monks.

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:12.464
That was one of the first things
that I did on my trip.

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:13.766
There was a monastery in Nepal

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.735
and I taught them
English for a month.

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:19.138
I was amazed that,
when I arrived in these towns,

00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:20.973
there were connections
that I could make

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:23.042
and ways to be useful
and helpful.

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:26.712
So that informed the next
five years of my travels.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:29.848
What were some of the cool ways
to volunteer you discovered?

00:02:29.882 --> 00:02:33.052
I tend to teach English
or volunteer in ways

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:34.186
that my skill base does.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.822
I don't construct homes
or things that perhaps aren't

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.391
within my wheelhouse.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:42.461
There's conservation work.
Heaps of opportunities.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.497
There's also social enterprises,

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.665
which is if you don't have
the skills to volunteer,

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.069
the time to commit
a month, three months
a year to a project,

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:51.070
you can actually--

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:53.339
this is what I love
to talk to people about--

00:02:53.372 --> 00:02:54.774
if you have that desire,

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.842
but you don't really
want to volunteer,

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:59.145
you can support
these social enterprises,

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:03.082
businesses that are addressing
a social issue,

00:03:03.115 --> 00:03:04.383
in their own community.

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:06.518
And, perhaps it's a coffee shop.

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:10.022
And you go drink coffee.
Not so hard, right?

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:15.061
And they are using those tourism
dollars to then fund a project.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:16.228
And it's as easy as that

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:18.331
to be able to support
the local community.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.366
When we first spoke
a long time ago,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.435
you told me that one problem
with volunteering

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.872
is it's not always delightful.

00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:28.708
Sometimes it's hard,
sometimes boring,

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:31.610
sometimes you don't feel
you're making an impact.

00:03:31.643 --> 00:03:34.113
So how is a traveler
to address that?

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:37.883
A traveler who might only
have a week in a country?

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:39.752
I think
it's a perspective shift.

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:42.922
You're not going to go
and in a week--

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:45.091
really see
noticeable change in any way.

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:46.792
But if you're there
to be of service,

00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:48.927
instead of saying
"I'm there to teach."

00:03:48.961 --> 00:03:52.131
or "to specifically work
with this animal

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:55.368
and if that doesn't happen
it'll let down my expectations”"

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:57.937
If you go and you say,
"I want to be of service,"

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.872
you may show up--
and it's happened to me--

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:02.441
where I show up and
say, “Great, this could
be really intriguing,”

00:04:02.474 --> 00:04:04.043
and they say,
"You know what we really need?

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:06.078
We need you
to file some paperwork."

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:07.213
( chuckles )

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:08.881
-And you go, "Oh."
-Yeah.

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:11.183
"Okay." Because I'm there
to be helpful.

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:13.686
Yeah,
so what are your next steps?

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.787
Where are you headed now?

00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:17.089
-So--
-I know the answer.

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:19.892
-I'm excited for you.
-Thank you!

00:04:19.925 --> 00:04:21.193
I'm excited
and a little nervous.

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:22.828
Actually,
I've never been to Africa.

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:25.464
So, in two weeks, I'll head
on a solo overland journey

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:28.767
for four months
up the east coast of Africa.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.404
And the plan is--
Grassroots Volunteering,

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.772
the site that you mentioned--
is to find social enterprises

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:36.743
and independent
volunteer opportunities

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.744
to add them to the database,
and other travelers,

00:04:38.777 --> 00:04:40.847
who perhaps have
just a week or two,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.115
can use the database
to find a project

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:45.785
that looks intriguing
as a starting point

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:47.986
to find cool things
in that area.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.355
Well, thank you so much
for sharing your story with us.

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:51.657
Thank you so much for having me.

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:54.393
( clapping )

00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:58.831
It's an honor now
to welcome Alison Wright.

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:00.700
A veteran photojournalist

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:03.235
who's spent her career
capturing the human spirit

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:04.237
through her lens.

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:09.141
Alison has traveled everywhere,
snapping people and places.

00:05:09.174 --> 00:05:11.344
And, though there have been
many sunny days in her life,

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:14.514
or you could say
great exposure,

00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:18.751
there have been
some unthinkable storms too.

00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:20.019
While traveling in Laos,

00:05:20.052 --> 00:05:23.222
Alison nearly lost her life
in a horrific bus accident

00:05:23.255 --> 00:05:24.790
on a remote jungle road.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:27.226
It was every traveler's
worst nightmare.

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.128
But she survived,
thanks to the villagers

00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:30.963
who never left her side.

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:34.600
Her brush with mortality
changed the way she worked.

00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:36.435
She wanted to do more
than quote,

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.471
"make pictures," as she told me.

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:41.441
So, three years
after her near-death experience,

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:43.242
she returned to the village
that saved her life

00:05:43.275 --> 00:05:45.645
and she brought along
a team of five doctors

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:48.581
and $10,000
worth of medical supplies.

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:50.749
That was her first foray

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:53.652
as founder of
the Faces of Hope Fund.

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:56.989
She now runs a global
non-profit that helps
support women and children

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.957
in crisis areas
throughout the world.

00:05:58.991 --> 00:06:00.326
So, thank you for being here.

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:01.527
Thank you very much.

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:03.629
( clapping )

00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:07.432
How did
the horrific accident change you

00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:08.968
as a traveler and as a person?

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:13.873 line:0%
I was doing a lot of,
besides travel stories,

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:18.411 line:0%
non-profit aid,
humanitarian work.

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:21.280
So, in that regard
I'm doing the same kind of work,

00:06:21.313 --> 00:06:24.182
but now it's brought
a whole new empathy to the work.

00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:26.352
You hope
that making a photo

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:28.988
will create awareness
and make a difference.

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:31.857
And that's what I do
with this Faces of Hope Fund.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.694
As I go around,
I speak about these people

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:36.962
that are in need,
like this child,

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:39.331
a Burmese refugee in Thailand,

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:42.034
that I wanted to give people
a place to go to.

00:06:42.067 --> 00:06:44.503
That they could donate,
that they could help.

00:06:44.537 --> 00:06:46.672
And then,
with financial resources,

00:06:46.705 --> 00:06:49.342
I could give money
back to the communities

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:52.444
that I was photographing
to directly help them.

00:06:52.477 --> 00:06:55.747
When we spoke a while ago,
you talked about Faces of Hope

00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:58.150
and how they could be
both the people who are helping

00:06:58.183 --> 00:07:00.619
but also-- The people
who are being helped,

00:07:00.652 --> 00:07:02.154
but also those
who are helping.

00:07:02.187 --> 00:07:06.992
Yes. It's people like my friend,
one of my heroes, Olga Murray,

00:07:07.025 --> 00:07:10.029
that almost singlehandedly
stamped out girls

00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:12.064
being sold into bonded labor
in Nepal

00:07:12.097 --> 00:07:15.568
by giving piglets to families,
so that they'd sell the piglet

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:18.437
instead of the girl child
at the end of the year,

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.240
which is a sad statement about
what a girl's worth in Nepal.

00:07:21.273 --> 00:07:24.043
I'm very struck by people

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:25.811
that are out there
making a difference.

00:07:25.844 --> 00:07:29.148
And these are the people
and small organizations,

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:31.984
grassroots organizations,
that I'm supporting.

00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:35.120
Recently, I was on a National
Geographic assignment

00:07:35.153 --> 00:07:38.057
when I discovered
these Burmese refugees

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.127
that were working
as basically indentured servants

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.899
near our hotel, and so I stayed
to photograph that.

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:50.336
Now I'm helping them
get a mobile medical unit.

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:54.573
So, it's just wanting
to give back even more

00:07:54.606 --> 00:07:57.943
and helping support the people
that are making a difference.

00:07:57.976 --> 00:08:00.346
They're the ones
that are creating change.

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:03.115
When you said
that you're alive today

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.084
because of the kindness
of strangers,

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:06.519
it really moved me.

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:08.955
Tell me about that.

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:12.925
This accident that I was in

00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.861
was on a very remote
jungle road in Laos.

00:08:15.894 --> 00:08:19.798
And these villagers cared enough
to bring me into their village

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:22.468
and sew my arm back
with a needle and thread.

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:26.238
An upholstery needle.
No sutures, no painkillers.

00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:29.174
I had broken my back,
my pelvis, all my ribs.

00:08:29.207 --> 00:08:33.145
I had so many broken bones,
major internal injuries.

00:08:33.178 --> 00:08:34.881
I was to the point
where I realized

00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:37.316
I was not going to get out
of the situation alive.

00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:40.052
I wrote a note to my family
and I told them how I died

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:41.553
and where I died.

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:43.922
I wanted them to know
that I didn't die alone

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:45.491
and in fear.

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:48.227
And that--
You don't get closer than that.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.530
Like dipping my toe
into feeling my own mortality

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:55.835
has been a touchstone for me,
for the rest of my life now.

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:58.671
You know,
and just thinking what--

00:08:59.905 --> 00:09:01.440
Not only they changed my life,

00:09:01.473 --> 00:09:04.543
but then a British aid
worker who happened
to come by found me,

00:09:04.576 --> 00:09:07.146
drove me eight hours
in the back of his pickup truck,

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:08.848
all the way to Thailand.

00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:11.684
So, he was instrumental
in saving my life as well,

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.986
as was the one doctor
in this border hospital.

00:09:14.019 --> 00:09:15.354
So every day I think,

00:09:15.387 --> 00:09:18.357
"What kindness
would you do for a stranger?"

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.560
"What kindness would I do
for a stranger?" You know?

00:09:21.593 --> 00:09:24.496
And how can people
help Faces of Hope Fund?

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.232
They can go
to facesofhope.org

00:09:27.265 --> 00:09:30.169
and look at some of the projects
that I have photographed.

00:09:30.202 --> 00:09:32.471
And a little bit
is a trust for me

00:09:32.504 --> 00:09:33.839
because, as I go
around the world,

00:09:33.872 --> 00:09:35.541
I don't know
what I'm going to find.

00:09:35.574 --> 00:09:39.145
But I feel the need to give back
directly to these communities.

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:42.148
My next project is really
going around the world

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:46.918
focusing on women and issues
of the global empowerment

00:09:46.952 --> 00:09:49.554
-of women at work.
-Can't wait to see
those pictures.

00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:50.956
-Thank you.
-Well, thank you

00:09:50.989 --> 00:09:53.392
-for being with us tonight.
-Okay.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:57.697
( clapping )

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.767
Now, I'd like to
welcome a travel
educator, Tracey Friley.

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:04.169
( clapping )

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:07.306
So, just about a third of
Americans have a passport.

00:10:07.339 --> 00:10:08.707
And this is a problem,

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.979
not least because in Canada
70% of the people have one,

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:17.149
but it's a problem
because it limits our horizons.

00:10:17.182 --> 00:10:19.418
Tracey has a big vision.

00:10:19.451 --> 00:10:22.788
She wants to put passports
in the hands of almost everyone.

00:10:22.821 --> 00:10:24.723
And she's starting local.

00:10:24.756 --> 00:10:26.558
She's based
in Oakland, California,

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:29.561
and she realized the challenge
to passport ownership

00:10:29.595 --> 00:10:33.231
isn't merely monetary,
but it's also about world view,

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:35.067
how to travel, where to travel.

00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:37.302
How to get going.

00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:41.072
These problems are even more
pronounced in poor urban areas.

00:10:41.106 --> 00:10:44.943
Tracey's solution was to launch
the Passport Party project.

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:47.846
This is a grassroots initiative
to provide underserved girls

00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:51.750
the tools they need
to obtain their first passports.

00:10:51.783 --> 00:10:53.885
When the program's first phase
wrapped up last summer,

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:56.222
100 girls
had their first passports

00:10:56.255 --> 00:11:00.559
and six young girls
made their first
international journey,

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:01.227
to Belize...

00:11:02.127 --> 00:11:04.796
which had to be
a lot of work for you.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.065
( chuckles )

00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:09.768
And now, Tracey is busy
plotting the next phase

00:11:09.801 --> 00:11:13.005
of the Passport Party project.
Thank you for being here.

00:11:13.038 --> 00:11:14.773
Thanks for having me.

00:11:14.807 --> 00:11:16.341
So how did you get this idea?

00:11:17.475 --> 00:11:22.848 line:0%
I was taking a group of girls
to the U.S. Virgin Islands

00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:25.918 line:0%
and, while you don't need
a passport to get there,

00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:31.290 line:0%
I found that only one of them
had a passport.

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:34.259
That piqued my interest
and about six months later,

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:37.897
I just took a group of kids
in my neighborhood

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.899
and we had
a travel awareness day.

00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:43.903
And then, I was able
to give them the money,

00:11:43.936 --> 00:11:45.204
out of my purse,

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:47.306
to get
their very first passports.

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:51.177
And how do you see travel
changing these young people?

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.279
It turned
into a rite of passage.

00:11:53.312 --> 00:11:58.417
There's this shift that occurs
when these girls get a passport.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.754
And it's not necessarily
about getting on a plane,

00:12:01.787 --> 00:12:05.324
a train or a bus,
but it's the idea that they can,

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:08.159
and that the world
is now available to them.

00:12:08.193 --> 00:12:11.463
I find that the kids,
surprisingly enough,

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:13.198
when you line them up
and ask them all

00:12:13.231 --> 00:12:15.534
where they want to go,
they're shouting out.

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.936
"I want to go to Paris,
I want to go to Hong Kong.”

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.204
They know where they want to go.

00:12:19.237 --> 00:12:21.440
It's just a matter
of fostering their dreams.

00:12:21.473 --> 00:12:23.242
They're learning
geography in school?

00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:25.143
They are learning
geography in school.

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:30.983
I think what this program does
is giving them a reason

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:34.253
to want to be
in geography class,

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:35.621
or in history class.

00:12:36.621 --> 00:12:39.858
And that little blue book
has a lot of power.

00:12:39.891 --> 00:12:42.828
Yeah. Is there
any particular story

00:12:42.861 --> 00:12:47.700
that you find really summarizes
the possibility and potential

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:51.303
of any individual traveler
who--

00:12:52.337 --> 00:12:56.274
who's just surpassing joy
of being someplace?

00:12:56.308 --> 00:13:00.412
Well, these are the six girls
that I took to Belize.

00:13:00.445 --> 00:13:03.348
Every one of them is special
for a very different reason.

00:13:03.381 --> 00:13:05.117
The young lady in the front,
Jasmine,

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.153
actually I'm personally funding
a trip for her to go to Paris.

00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:09.788
She's a budding photographer.

00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:12.291
She was
in the NatGeo photo with me.

00:13:12.324 --> 00:13:15.460
And she got to assist
the NatGeo photographer

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:19.932
which was huge for her,
and it's keeping her motivated.

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:21.667
Her mom just
told me the other day

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.237
that the one thing--
You know how teenagers are,

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.705
they're interested in this,
in this, in this, in this--

00:13:27.739 --> 00:13:29.408
But the one thing she notices

00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:31.677
is that she hasn't
put her camera down

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.512
since that day.

00:13:33.545 --> 00:13:38.183
So, I think that the impact
isn't always immediate.

00:13:38.217 --> 00:13:40.852
It's something
that you see over time.

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:44.623
So when I'm able to follow up
with them, I'll be back.

00:13:44.656 --> 00:13:47.826
Sounds like you will be back.
Congratulations.

00:13:47.859 --> 00:13:49.928
And I'm excited
for your next steps.

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:53.865
Thanks. I'm working
on Phase II right now.

00:13:53.898 --> 00:13:57.436
I was awarded $2,000
by American Express

00:13:57.469 --> 00:13:59.138
-and their PassionProject.
-Very good.

00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:02.274
And that's going to fund
the first ten passports

00:14:02.307 --> 00:14:04.143
-for Phase II.
-That's cool.

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:05.610
-Yes.
-See you around the world.

00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:06.945
Thank you, George.

00:14:06.978 --> 00:14:08.613
( laughs )

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:10.649
( clapping )

00:14:11.717 --> 00:14:14.186
Now, I'd like to welcome
two<i> Travelers of the Year,</i>

00:14:14.219 --> 00:14:16.521
who work together
on one project,

00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:18.723
Molly Burke and Muyambi Muyambi.

00:14:18.757 --> 00:14:22.160
( clapping )

00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:24.663
They met
while they were undergraduates

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:27.065
at Bucknell University
in Pennsylvania.

00:14:27.099 --> 00:14:31.136
Muyambi is from southern Uganda,
Molly is from New York.

00:14:31.169 --> 00:14:32.838
They discovered
that they loved to travel,

00:14:32.871 --> 00:14:36.475
they loved nooks and crannies
and they also loved bicycles.

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:38.643
They saw an opportunity
to merge their passions,

00:14:38.676 --> 00:14:40.212
interests, and worlds,

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:44.115
when in a dorm room
they launched an organization

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:46.151
called Bicycles Against Poverty.

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:49.988
This organization uses
a microfinance model

00:14:50.021 --> 00:14:52.624
to distribute bikes
in rural Uganda.

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:56.394
So far, the non-profit
has distributed about 830 bikes

00:14:56.427 --> 00:14:58.330
to low-income entrepreneurs,

00:14:58.363 --> 00:15:00.632
who make monthly
payments of $3

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:02.768
to cover the price of a bike.

00:15:02.801 --> 00:15:05.170
How do bikes
help alleviate poverty?

00:15:05.203 --> 00:15:07.939 line:0%
A bike in Uganda
is a lifesaving tool

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:10.208 line:0%
because we work
in these remote areas,

00:15:10.241 --> 00:15:12.878 line:0%
where they're hours
from the nearest health clinic,

00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:15.514 line:0%
they're hours from markets
to make a living,

00:15:15.547 --> 00:15:17.449
from clean water,
from education.

00:15:18.716 --> 00:15:22.187
There's a man
in a village that we work in

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:26.925
and his name is Ornak.
And he has a four-year-old son.

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:31.830
He started coughing one day--
His four-year-old son.

00:15:31.863 --> 00:15:34.967
And his cough persisted.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.640
When you live in a remote area
where healthcare is hours away,

00:15:41.673 --> 00:15:45.510
you don't take a child
to the hospital for a cough.

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:47.813
His son
is growing thinner and thinner.

00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:50.815
And then, he starts
coughing up blood.

00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:52.751
But Ornak didn't have a bicycle.

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:55.320
So, in the morning, he picks up
his three-year-old son

00:15:55.353 --> 00:15:58.323
and he carries him
for six hours.

00:15:58.356 --> 00:16:00.458
So, we provide bikes,

00:16:00.492 --> 00:16:02.127
because bikes
are alleviating poverty

00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:04.963
by giving people
access to medical care.

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:07.699
With farmers who have
100 pounds of crops

00:16:07.733 --> 00:16:11.002
thrown on a carrier, it's--
It's absolutely life-changing

00:16:11.035 --> 00:16:14.573
for people who are
cut off from resources.

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:16.508
You shared with us
a really cool video

00:16:16.541 --> 00:16:19.477
that puts
into context your work.

00:16:19.511 --> 00:16:21.013
So, I'd like to show that now.

00:16:22.348 --> 00:16:24.683
( music plays )

00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:32.291
There are villages
deep in rural Africa.

00:16:35.627 --> 00:16:39.531
Their way of life
remains difficult.

00:16:42.734 --> 00:16:45.637
But our lives
have tremendous potential.

00:16:59.818 --> 00:17:02.888
It's not the lack of money
that holds us back...

00:17:06.725 --> 00:17:08.794
but the distance
from where we live

00:17:08.827 --> 00:17:10.996
to where we can find
opportunities.

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:15.167
Like work...

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:17.803
and education.

00:17:20.905 --> 00:17:24.209
This story is about an answer.

00:17:26.778 --> 00:17:29.748
About taking responsibility
for our future.

00:17:33.251 --> 00:17:37.089
About taking responsibility
for ourselves.

00:17:44.896 --> 00:17:48.300
This story is of bicycles.

00:17:56.741 --> 00:18:01.380
This is the story
of Bicycles Against Poverty.

00:18:06.918 --> 00:18:09.821
That was a really cool video,
and it shows so much.

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:13.458
So, tell me about yourself,
your background,

00:18:13.491 --> 00:18:15.760
and how you came up
with this idea.

00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:18.429 line:0%
The story Molly
just shared right now

00:18:18.463 --> 00:18:22.000 line:0%
is not particular to one family
that she talked about.

00:18:22.033 --> 00:18:24.936 line:0%
It was the same case
with my family,

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.906 line:0%
and all families
around the area I lived in.

00:18:27.939 --> 00:18:30.375
I grew up in southern Uganda.
As you mentioned,

00:18:30.408 --> 00:18:33.245
in particular, my mom
couldn't get to the hospital

00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:34.946
easily when she was sick.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.383
So, we needed to get a bicycle
every time she was sick.

00:18:38.416 --> 00:18:39.717
And, you know,
when sickness hits,

00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:42.154
it doesn't tell you
when it's going to come.

00:18:42.187 --> 00:18:44.990
She would get sick in the night
and you'd have to deal with it

00:18:45.023 --> 00:18:46.558
right there and then.

00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:52.030
So going through that,
I think gave me--

00:18:52.063 --> 00:18:53.432
put something in my mind.

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:58.070
And, when I had the opportunity
to come to this great country,

00:18:58.103 --> 00:19:00.239
the land of opportunities,

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:05.610
I figured I had to do something.
And beyond that,

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:08.546
other people believed
in what we were trying to do.

00:19:08.579 --> 00:19:11.883
They believed in the power
of the bicycle to change lives.

00:19:11.916 --> 00:19:16.354
One of those
organizations is the
Clinton Global Initiative,

00:19:16.387 --> 00:19:18.490
where we got
our first seed money.

00:19:18.523 --> 00:19:21.259
From there onto now,
we've never stopped.

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:24.863
And people like Molly
make it what it is.

00:19:24.896 --> 00:19:27.232
And we hope to keep growing.

00:19:27.265 --> 00:19:29.934
One thing that you told me
that I found really interesting

00:19:29.968 --> 00:19:31.736
is, of course
you're a world traveler,

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.039
but this project
has also compelled you

00:19:34.072 --> 00:19:37.275
to travel within Uganda,
within your home country.

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:40.879
And often when we think
about traveling,

00:19:40.912 --> 00:19:42.246
we think about going
someplace far away.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.582
But sometimes
it doesn't have to be so far

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:46.084
to feel very far.

00:19:46.117 --> 00:19:49.087
Yeah. Exactly.
I don't think you have to.

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:52.056
When I was getting started
on thinking about the area

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.694
we work in right now,
northern Uganda,

00:19:55.727 --> 00:19:59.464
part of the country where,
I don't know if you've heard,

00:19:59.497 --> 00:20:05.003
but this area went through war
for 20 years, since 1986.

00:20:05.036 --> 00:20:07.205
Right now it's okay.
You can visit.

00:20:07.205 --> 00:20:10.475
So-- Exactly. Please go.

00:20:10.541 --> 00:20:14.312
So, I had read the news.

00:20:14.346 --> 00:20:17.348
I had seen the news articles,
like you probably see things

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:19.484
about Iraq or any other country.

00:20:19.517 --> 00:20:23.321
But I'd never been there,
so I decided, “Why not?”

00:20:23.354 --> 00:20:26.791
But everywhere I went,
the common thing I saw

00:20:26.824 --> 00:20:29.027
was bicycles everywhere.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.062
Somehow, they seem
to always find their way

00:20:31.095 --> 00:20:33.365
into every region in Uganda.

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:38.370
So again, I think that
kind of stayed in my mind.

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:41.639
Molly, where's Bicycles
Against Poverty headed next?

00:20:41.673 --> 00:20:43.241
We're definitely very focused

00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:47.178
on expanding our organization
within Gulu,

00:20:47.211 --> 00:20:49.413
which is in Uganda.
That's where we're
based right now,

00:20:49.447 --> 00:20:53.685
but we want to look out.
So, Kenya, Tanzania,

00:20:53.719 --> 00:20:56.755
across the globe.
Ultimately, that's the scale

00:20:56.788 --> 00:20:58.623
of the organization.

00:20:58.657 --> 00:21:00.124
No brakes for you.

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:01.460
( laughing )

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:04.295
Thank you both,
Molly and Muyambi.

00:21:04.329 --> 00:21:05.730
Thank you, George.

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:09.635
( clapping )

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:13.070
United Airlines
and National Geographic

00:21:13.104 --> 00:21:15.473
teamed up to create
the Sustainable Travel

00:21:15.507 --> 00:21:17.108
Leadership Award.

00:21:17.142 --> 00:21:19.845 line:0%
We're very excited
about this new partnership.

00:21:19.878 --> 00:21:23.381 line:0%
( cheering and clapping )

00:21:23.415 --> 00:21:26.118 line:0%
So, here's a story,
and it's pretty amazing.

00:21:27.252 --> 00:21:29.054
John is a lifelong traveler.

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:32.591
In 1989, he bought 2,000 acres
of coastal forest

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:36.227
to protect four miles
of turtle-nesting area.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.397
He established
The Pacuare Nature Reserve

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:43.368
at a time when nearly every nest
was pilfered by poachers.

00:21:43.401 --> 00:21:47.539
Today, beach patrols have
reduced poaching losses to 2%,

00:21:47.572 --> 00:21:49.107
thanks to you.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.277
And their once depleted
coconut farm

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:57.282
is now home to 30 species
of mammal and 230 bird species.

00:21:57.315 --> 00:22:00.585
But poaching remains a problem
all over the world.

00:22:00.618 --> 00:22:03.187
And the Denhams travel
from London to Pacuare,

00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:05.757
to work with volunteers
and field biologists

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.460
to protect hatchlings
and to push for policies

00:22:08.493 --> 00:22:10.595
that protect
their coastal ecosystem.

00:22:10.628 --> 00:22:13.131
So, thank you for being with us,
and congratulations.

00:22:13.164 --> 00:22:14.265
Thank you.

00:22:14.299 --> 00:22:16.168
( clapping )

00:22:16.201 --> 00:22:20.638
Tell me, how did travel
help you hatch your plan?

00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:23.575
( laughing )

00:22:25.677 --> 00:22:30.882 line:0%
Well, in the mid-eighties,
a friend I met in Mexico said,

00:22:30.915 --> 00:22:32.817 line:0%
"You've never been
to Costa Rica."

00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:35.553 line:0%
"It's worth it,
just for the turtles."

00:22:35.586 --> 00:22:38.723
So I went to Costa Rica,
just for the turtles,

00:22:38.756 --> 00:22:42.260
and I must say
I was quite smitten.

00:22:42.294 --> 00:22:45.630
There's something very moving
about seeing a turtle

00:22:45.663 --> 00:22:49.734
coming up a beach,
slowly digging its nest

00:22:49.767 --> 00:22:52.537
and laying its eggs there.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:55.506
And then,
this magic is shattered,

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.210
when you see the poachers
are just ready to take it.

00:22:59.244 --> 00:23:04.882
And that was happening all over.
Completely uncontrolled.

00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:07.786
And there was nobody
doing anything about it.

00:23:07.819 --> 00:23:13.758
And then, I found by pure chance
this wonderful area

00:23:13.791 --> 00:23:16.361
of forest--
Well it had been forest.

00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:17.929
It was a wreck.

00:23:17.962 --> 00:23:23.301
Four miles of the very prime
leatherback turtle beach.

00:23:23.334 --> 00:23:27.438
So, I bought it. It seemed
the logical thing to do.

00:23:27.472 --> 00:23:29.974
And that's the way it started.

00:23:30.007 --> 00:23:32.711
What have you achieved
over these years?

00:23:33.778 --> 00:23:35.012
I think--

00:23:35.046 --> 00:23:42.254
The turtle poaching
was the obvious problem.

00:23:42.287 --> 00:23:43.622
The biggest problem.

00:23:43.655 --> 00:23:48.559
For the first years,
I didn't make much progress.

00:23:48.593 --> 00:23:51.662
In 1995, I think,
we really turned the corner.

00:23:51.696 --> 00:23:56.701
And we got on top of it.
And after that, we got really--

00:23:56.734 --> 00:23:59.637
The poachers
were sort of on the run.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:04.109
And for the last 15-18 years,
we've had our own guards.

00:24:04.142 --> 00:24:06.444
We have to employ
our own guards.

00:24:06.477 --> 00:24:07.612
That's not armed guards.

00:24:07.645 --> 00:24:12.784
They're just armed
with a very powerful flashlight.

00:24:12.817 --> 00:24:14.552
They could throw it.

00:24:14.585 --> 00:24:16.221
It frightens them off.

00:24:17.355 --> 00:24:22.293
And that's the only thing
that keeps that beach free.

00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:27.331
We have to employ six guards
for seven months of the year.

00:24:27.365 --> 00:24:29.967
And they're patrolling
night and day.

00:24:30.001 --> 00:24:33.638
That's the only way to reduce--

00:24:34.538 --> 00:24:38.576
to keep
the poaching rate down to 2%.

00:24:38.609 --> 00:24:41.479
So, that's
the very obvious improvement.

00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:43.714
The other,
of course, is the forest.

00:24:43.748 --> 00:24:46.984
It's amazing what nature does.

00:24:47.017 --> 00:24:49.454
It's now a secondary forest,

00:24:49.487 --> 00:24:52.089
except for a little bit
of primary in the north,

00:24:52.123 --> 00:24:54.859
but it's full
of animals and birds.

00:24:54.892 --> 00:24:59.063
It's a really high density
of animals.

00:24:59.096 --> 00:25:02.968
We've even had a jaguar
we photographed at night.

00:25:04.502 --> 00:25:07.038
We had a crocodile nesting--

00:25:07.072 --> 00:25:09.006
( laughing )

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.645
There are all sorts of animals,
some of them quite rare.

00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:18.616
They've populated the place.
It's a sort of oasis there.

00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:20.184
That's very gratifying.

00:25:20.218 --> 00:25:22.486
Hilda,
could you tell us a little bit

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.555
about the local impact
you're making?

00:25:24.589 --> 00:25:29.193
Your education and preservation
programs you're working on.

00:25:29.227 --> 00:25:31.829 line:0%
It's a very exciting project
that we have now.

00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:35.834 line:0%
We've always had
students coming from the UK

00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:37.235 line:0%
or from the US.

00:25:37.268 --> 00:25:38.836 line:0%
They would come
for four days,

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:42.874 line:0%
and they're a very important
part of the reserve.

00:25:42.907 --> 00:25:46.477
But that was kind of teaching
to the converted,

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.179
because we had
all these wonderful people

00:25:48.212 --> 00:25:50.081
coming, and they
just wanted to help.

00:25:50.114 --> 00:25:55.386
But we realized that we needed
to change people's mentality.

00:25:55.419 --> 00:25:57.355
We need to change
what has been a tradition

00:25:57.388 --> 00:25:58.522
for many years.

00:25:58.556 --> 00:26:00.925
So, we needed
to work with children.

00:26:00.958 --> 00:26:04.995
So, we have now a project
that we get the young ones,

00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:07.431
primary school,
and they come for a day.

00:26:07.465 --> 00:26:10.334
And that is
where really traveling starts.

00:26:10.368 --> 00:26:14.605
Many of them live about
30 to 40 minutes from the beach,

00:26:14.638 --> 00:26:16.507
but they have
never seen the sea.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.609
They have never ever
been on a boat.

00:26:18.643 --> 00:26:22.147
But then they arrive,
and for them it's marvelous.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.883
They just go
down the Tortuguero Canal,

00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:28.787
see all these different animals.
Then they come to the reserve,

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:32.556
and we take them
around the forest.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:36.461
It's fantastic
to see how they learn,

00:26:36.494 --> 00:26:38.096
the questions they ask,

00:26:38.129 --> 00:26:40.532
how they pinpoint
at the different animals.

00:26:40.565 --> 00:26:44.435
Then, we show them
the importance of the turtles,

00:26:44.469 --> 00:26:46.170
of the life cycle,

00:26:46.203 --> 00:26:51.242
and the importance
of not eating turtle eggs

00:26:51.275 --> 00:26:54.345
because it will be
one little turtle less.

00:26:54.379 --> 00:26:56.647
And we also have
another bit of the program,

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.216
where we get
the secondary schools.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.987
It's different because they come
and they stay the night.

00:27:03.021 --> 00:27:04.922
They spend two nights with us.

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:07.658
So they go, they do
a bit of reforestation

00:27:07.691 --> 00:27:11.929
and learn
about the various tree species,

00:27:11.963 --> 00:27:15.233
how to make a hole.
They use a machete and--

00:27:15.266 --> 00:27:17.468
They really have
a wonderful time.

00:27:17.501 --> 00:27:20.805
And then, the biologists
as well teach them

00:27:20.838 --> 00:27:23.908
about the life cycle,
about what we're doing.

00:27:23.942 --> 00:27:27.078
And then they go out,
and they patrol.

00:27:27.111 --> 00:27:31.716
So, many of them get to see
these amazing animals.

00:27:31.749 --> 00:27:34.519
Animals that haven't changed
in 65 million years.

00:27:34.552 --> 00:27:39.557
They're from the Jurassic.
And they just cannot believe it.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:43.127
It does have
a fantastic impact on them.

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:44.929
And that's what we are doing.

00:27:44.962 --> 00:27:49.133
And we're also trying to bring
the people from the communities

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:53.137
as well, to help us,
to see what we are doing.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:56.708
And to love what we are doing.
And do it themselves as well.

00:27:56.741 --> 00:28:01.279
Thanks to your work
we're getting closer to
that every day.

00:28:01.312 --> 00:28:02.313
So, congratulations.

00:28:02.346 --> 00:28:03.648
We're moving
in the right direction.

00:28:03.681 --> 00:28:06.317
Yes, thank you very much.

00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:09.921
( clapping )

00:28:09.954 --> 00:28:13.858
( music plays )

00:28:29.106 --> 00:28:30.742
( drumroll )
