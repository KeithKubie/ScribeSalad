the question as to whether or not we are

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560
the question as to whether or not we are
 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.560
the question as to whether or not we are
hard-wired for religion and spirituality

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570
hard-wired for religion and spirituality
 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.760
hard-wired for religion and spirituality
I think is is a very important one when

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770
I think is is a very important one when
 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.589
I think is is a very important one when
we look at how the brain works

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599
we look at how the brain works
 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.070
we look at how the brain works
it looks like the brain is able to very

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080
it looks like the brain is able to very
 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.499
it looks like the brain is able to very
easily engage in religious and spiritual

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509
easily engage in religious and spiritual
 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.769
easily engage in religious and spiritual
practices ideas and experiences all the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779
practices ideas and experiences all the
 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.990
practices ideas and experiences all the
brain scan studies that we've done show

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000
brain scan studies that we've done show
 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.400
brain scan studies that we've done show
that there are multiple parts of the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410
that there are multiple parts of the
 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.800
that there are multiple parts of the
brain that seem to get involved so it

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810
brain that seem to get involved so it
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.929
brain that seem to get involved so it
really does look like the brain is so

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939
really does look like the brain is so
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.429
really does look like the brain is so
easily capable of having these

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439
easily capable of having these
 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.990
easily capable of having these
experiences now exactly how that ability

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000
experiences now exactly how that ability
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.180
experiences now exactly how that ability
got into the brain is of course a much

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190
got into the brain is of course a much
 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.270
got into the brain is of course a much
more complex and both philosophical and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
more complex and both philosophical and
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.250
more complex and both philosophical and
scientific question the scientists would

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
scientific question the scientists would
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.410
scientific question the scientists would
say well maybe it was through millions

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420
say well maybe it was through millions
 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.069
say well maybe it was through millions
of years of evolution that because being

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
of years of evolution that because being
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.990
of years of evolution that because being
religious or spiritual was an adaptive

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000
religious or spiritual was an adaptive
 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.360
religious or spiritual was an adaptive
process it got incorporated into the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
process it got incorporated into the
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.310
process it got incorporated into the
biological mechanisms of the brain and

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320
biological mechanisms of the brain and
 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.569
biological mechanisms of the brain and
there's certainly a lot of reasons to

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579
there's certainly a lot of reasons to
 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.340
there's certainly a lot of reasons to
support that and of course if you're a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350
support that and of course if you're a
 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.990
support that and of course if you're a
religious individual it also makes sense

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
religious individual it also makes sense
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.209
religious individual it also makes sense
that if there's a god up there and we're

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219
that if there's a god up there and we're
 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.040
that if there's a god up there and we're
down here that we would have a brain

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
down here that we would have a brain
 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.840
down here that we would have a brain
that's capable of communicating to God

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
that's capable of communicating to God
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.579
that's capable of communicating to God
praying to God doing the things that God

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
praying to God doing the things that God
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.350
praying to God doing the things that God
needs us to do otherwise there would be

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360
needs us to do otherwise there would be
 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.030
needs us to do otherwise there would be
this kind of fundamentally silly

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
this kind of fundamentally silly
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.590
this kind of fundamentally silly
disconnect we wouldn't we wouldn't be

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600
disconnect we wouldn't we wouldn't be
 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.880
disconnect we wouldn't we wouldn't be
able to have any kind of interaction

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890
able to have any kind of interaction
 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.000
able to have any kind of interaction
with God so it does look like the brain

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
with God so it does look like the brain
 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.340
with God so it does look like the brain
no matter how it got there does have

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350
no matter how it got there does have
 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.109
no matter how it got there does have
this profound ability to engage in

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119
this profound ability to engage in
 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.999
this profound ability to engage in
religious and spiritual experiences and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009
religious and spiritual experiences and
 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.789
religious and spiritual experiences and
and that's part of why we've seen

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799
and that's part of why we've seen
 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.080
and that's part of why we've seen
religion and spirituality be a part of

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090
religion and spirituality be a part of
 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.670
religion and spirituality be a part of
human history since the very dawn of

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680
human history since the very dawn of
 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.530
human history since the very dawn of
civilization one of the things that we

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
civilization one of the things that we
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.499
civilization one of the things that we
find to be such an important element of

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509
find to be such an important element of
 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.539
find to be such an important element of
many of the rituals and practices that

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549
many of the rituals and practices that
 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.190
many of the rituals and practices that
people do as part of their religious

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
people do as part of their religious
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.980
people do as part of their religious
traditions is the repetition of it the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
traditions is the repetition of it the
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.660
traditions is the repetition of it the
more that you come back to a particular

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670
more that you come back to a particular
 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.429
more that you come back to a particular
idea the more you focus on it the more

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
idea the more you focus on it the more
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.160
idea the more you focus on it the more
you say a phrase or a prayer those are

you say a phrase or a prayer those are
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.050
you say a phrase or a prayer those are
the ideas and beliefs that become

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
the ideas and beliefs that become
 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.999
the ideas and beliefs that become
written into the neural connections of

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009
written into the neural connections of
 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.889
written into the neural connections of
the brain there's a cute saying the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
the brain there's a cute saying the
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.719
the brain there's a cute saying the
neurons that fire together wire together

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
neurons that fire together wire together
 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.020
neurons that fire together wire together
the idea is is that when you are doing a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
the idea is is that when you are doing a
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.300
the idea is is that when you are doing a
particular practice whatever it is

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
particular practice whatever it is
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.850
particular practice whatever it is
religious or otherwise the more you do

religious or otherwise the more you do
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.249
religious or otherwise the more you do
it the more you are writing that

information into the neural connections

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
information into the neural connections
 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.539
information into the neural connections
of the brain the neurons that support

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549
of the brain the neurons that support
 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.940
of the brain the neurons that support
that idea or support that practice fire

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950
that idea or support that practice fire
 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.710
that idea or support that practice fire
together they strengthen their

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720
together they strengthen their
 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.510
together they strengthen their
connections and it makes it easier for

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
connections and it makes it easier for
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.040
connections and it makes it easier for
you to come back to that particular

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050
you to come back to that particular
 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.760
you to come back to that particular
practice

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
practice
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.590
practice
and it also strengthens the beliefs that

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600
and it also strengthens the beliefs that
 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.750
and it also strengthens the beliefs that
are around that particular practice now

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760
are around that particular practice now
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.600
are around that particular practice now
that's also why we think that a practice

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610
that's also why we think that a practice
 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.940
that's also why we think that a practice
like meditation even taken into a more

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950
like meditation even taken into a more
 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.430
like meditation even taken into a more
secular kind of context can be a very

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440
secular kind of context can be a very
 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.710
secular kind of context can be a very
powerful tool for helping to improve the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720
powerful tool for helping to improve the
 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.290
powerful tool for helping to improve the
way a person's brain works the analogy

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300
way a person's brain works the analogy
 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.960
way a person's brain works the analogy
here I think is if you were to wanting

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970
here I think is if you were to wanting
 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.880
here I think is if you were to wanting
to become a better tennis player for

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890
to become a better tennis player for
 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.520
to become a better tennis player for
example well you could do one of two

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530
example well you could do one of two
 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.290
example well you could do one of two
things one is you've got to play tennis

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300
things one is you've got to play tennis
 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.270
things one is you've got to play tennis
you got to keep practicing the tennis

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280
you got to keep practicing the tennis
 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.940
you got to keep practicing the tennis
itself the other is that you could go to

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950
itself the other is that you could go to
 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.410
itself the other is that you could go to
the weight room and lift weights or you

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420
the weight room and lift weights or you
 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.630
the weight room and lift weights or you
could run which is more general

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640
could run which is more general
 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.420
could run which is more general
strengthening and conditioning now if

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430
strengthening and conditioning now if
 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.680
strengthening and conditioning now if
you wanted to become a good basketball

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690
you wanted to become a good basketball
 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.810
you wanted to become a good basketball
player you wouldn't play tennis you'd

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820
player you wouldn't play tennis you'd
 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.210
player you wouldn't play tennis you'd
shoot baskets but the weight training

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
shoot baskets but the weight training
 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.040
shoot baskets but the weight training
and the aerobic training can be good for

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050
and the aerobic training can be good for
 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.500
and the aerobic training can be good for
both so meditation may fall into that

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510
both so meditation may fall into that
 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.990
both so meditation may fall into that
area where you know maybe you want to be

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000
area where you know maybe you want to be
 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.640
area where you know maybe you want to be
really good at doing crossword puzzles

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650
really good at doing crossword puzzles
 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.050
really good at doing crossword puzzles
you want to do a lot of crossword

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060
you want to do a lot of crossword
 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.580
you want to do a lot of crossword
puzzles but if you get really good at

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590
puzzles but if you get really good at
 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.840
puzzles but if you get really good at
crossword puzzles it doesn't make you a

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850
crossword puzzles it doesn't make you a
 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.700
crossword puzzles it doesn't make you a
good chess player but if you do

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710
good chess player but if you do
 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.040
good chess player but if you do
meditation practices it might make you

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050
meditation practices it might make you
 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.200
meditation practices it might make you
better either in doing crossword puzzles

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210
better either in doing crossword puzzles
 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.630
better either in doing crossword puzzles
or being a good chess player or maybe

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640
or being a good chess player or maybe
 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.270
or being a good chess player or maybe
