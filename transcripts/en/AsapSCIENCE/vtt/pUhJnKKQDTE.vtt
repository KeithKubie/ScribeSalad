00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.100
as marijuana becomes legalized throughout

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.560
North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.508
Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.539
Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.880
Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.010
which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.189
imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.329
Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three]

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.389
Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.939
150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.759
ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.120
so the activated Thc

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:02.399
must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.509
drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.990
Compared to smoking marijuana

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.390
[this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.659
also becomes 11 o h thC which

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.180
Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.829
You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.989
And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more?

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.259
psychotropic types of

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:45.269
Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.750
like Carbon monoxide

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.079
Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.859
so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.019
High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.250
modulating the effects or

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.759
Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.110
- but unlike those who consume too much alcohol

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.159
Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.829
Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the munchies?
