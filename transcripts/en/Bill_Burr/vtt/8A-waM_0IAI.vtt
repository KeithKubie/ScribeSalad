00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.440
Do hey,

00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:08.040
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.083
And

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.490
just checking in on you.
Um,

I am back.

5
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.320
The United States of America will,
you can get a gun.

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.720
You can marry a man.
And where,
uh,

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.690
I don't know.
You can,
you can go get a big goal.

8
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.050
You can do whatever the fuck you want here man.
This is mark.

9
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.910
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.743
<v 0>Laying the frame.</v>

11
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.600
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.500
<v 0>Well the
land of the slurpee.
Um,</v>

13
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.910
yes.
Got back yesterday.
Uh,
pretty easy flight.
You know,

14
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.330
I thought it was going to be a hoe.
I was going to be a rough one.
Okay.
Um,

15
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.310
got on with my life and my lovely daughter.

16
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.580
And of course my daughter started screaming bloody murder right in the beginning

17
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.240
cause you know,
poor thing,
it's tough for him.
Right.

18
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.170
And this fucking guy in front of us,
right?
We're flying business class.

19
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:10.470
Everybody's got a little bit of the hey,
you know,
we almost made it,
didn't we?

20
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.980
Didn't we almost have it all?

21
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.263
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.800
<v 0>20 rows away from first class.
Um,</v>

23
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.660
and my daughter did some high pitch scream and the guy just fucking put his hand

24
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:25.381
straight up in the year,

25
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:29.130
like really the started and then he started turning around looking at us.

26
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.160
So I fucking pop my head up like a goddamn something to meet his eyes.

27
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:39.240
Like,
dude,
really it's a fucking baby.
You used to be a baby,

28
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:41.970
you were on a plane and you were screaming,
you fucking asshole.

29
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.720
People like to have problems with babies crying.
Like,
you know,

30
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.340
as much of a cunt that I am,
I,
I have not had a problem with that.

31
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.400
It actually,
you know,
babies start crying on a plane.
It makes me,

32
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.420
so I set this before,

33
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.720
it makes me laugh because they're expressing literally what I'm thinking.

34
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.570
I'm ready to start crying.
I don't want to fucking do this,
you know,

35
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.930
how far is it
[inaudible] he can we,

36
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.790
can we gauge the boiling point I guess?
Right.
And nobody listens to them.

37
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.330
They're all standing up this Chavon jackets and the overhead compartments,

38
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:19.380
you know,
they're acting like a bunch of babies.
So anyways,

39
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:22.400
but later on the flight,
I ran into the guy up front,
uh,

40
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.750
when he was pouring himself a drink and I went up,
then I got to drink.
I said,

41
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:28.260
hey,
sorry about the baby crying.
And he's like,
oh,
no problem.
It's a baby boom.
Oh,

42
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:30.710
now you're a good guy.
No,
you're good.
And then for the rest of the flight,
he was,

43
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.350
he was cool.
He was making faces at her and shit.
You know,
I get it.

44
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.320
[inaudible] paid for business class,

45
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.050
you're about ready to take a 10 hour flight and some kids screaming bloody

46
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:43.260
murder,
you know,
really kind of ruins it.
But you know,

47
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.520
that's what they made earplugs for.

48
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.120
There was like three babies in our section and uh,

49
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.580
they were all putting on their own show.
But,
um,

50
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.620
after a while my daughter settled down,

51
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:55.980
but she scared the daylights out of a lot of people.
Um,

52
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.980
there's a lot of people that are just fucking selfish assholes.

53
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.050
Like they were born adults,
you know,
the looks that they,

54
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.480
they've,
they fucking give you or that we even worse,
they'll give you a kid.

55
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.160
It's just like,
wow,
it makes me feel better about myself,
man.
I mean,
I,

56
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:15.350
I know I'm an asshole,
but Jesus,
you know,
I,
I,

57
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.390
I stopped short of mean Muggin of fucking toddler.

58
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.230
Ah,
no,
I've probably done that.
Not a toddler,

59
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:31.231
but when I see a fucking spoiled Brat in a store and his parents have no control

60
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:36.160
over him or her and she wants something or he wants something,
they don't get in,

61
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:39.790
they start fucking crying.
Oh Man.
If they make eye contact with me,
I'll,
I'll,

62
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:43.480
I'll,
I'll shoot him a look.
I admit it,
I'll do it.

63
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.620
You know,
I love it when the parent doesn't give,

64
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:51.980
it doesn't give the kid the fucking toy or the piece of thought,

65
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.770
the candy bar or whatever the fuck the kid wants.

66
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:55.660
I don't know what it is about me about it,

67
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.070
but it just gives me so much joy when the kid doesn't get what he wants,

68
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.250
you know?
And when the fucking kid gets what he wants,
I just,

69
00:04:04.251 --> 00:04:07.790
I always think you fucking pussy.
I always think that,
I don't know,

70
00:04:07.791 --> 00:04:11.830
it has to do with my childhood has nothing to do with children or,

71
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.880
or my beliefs in what we're trying to do with acis.

72
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.000
All right.
I'm just being honest with you fuckers.
Sorry.

73
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.670
I'm punishing these people with my French.

74
00:04:22.671 --> 00:04:25.940
I'm trying to get my American American back together.

75
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.350
We speak American over here.
This is America.
We speak English.

76
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.660
Um,
anyways,
uh,

77
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.120
sought guns and roses for the first time in my life Monday night and uh,

78
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.980
got ridiculously hooked up.

79
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.710
<v 2>Okay,</v>

80
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.920
<v 0>well I'm not going to name any names and be a Douche here,</v>

81
00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:51.390
but I just want to thank everybody who fucking was a part of hooking me up and

82
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.970
it was insane.
We basically sat on the side of the stage.

83
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.460
They gave us these inner ear monitors.

84
00:04:56.461 --> 00:05:01.461
So we heard the band mix and you could hear axle making jokes in between songs

85
00:05:02.611 --> 00:05:05.490
and stuff.
You know,
if he saw something of just making a random comment,

86
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.700
it was fucking amazing.
It was amazing.

87
00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:11.730
It was like being in bill Belichick's headset and I have to tell you something.

88
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.540
That fucking show might've been the best concert I've ever been to.

89
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.163
<v 2>And</v>

90
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.920
<v 0>I don't even,
I don't even know where to begin.
First of all,</v>

91
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.330
we're in a fucking giant field right outside of Paris.

92
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.770
The Sun was going down.
There was all these beautiful clouds.

93
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.730
And my view is basically,
I see the backs of all the musicians,

94
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.930
which with the son fucking going down,
I got some killer.
I mean,
granted,

95
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.960
there's cell phone pics and everything,
but like,
first of all,

96
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:49.150
they didn't tune down any song.

97
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.710
They played every song in the exact same key that axle sang them in 30 fucking

98
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:57.710
years ago.
And he crushed it.
I cannot,

99
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.940
I can't overstate how well that guy's voice,
how well he sung I,

100
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.840
how great his,
we sounded like the fucking record.
And they did a three hour show,

101
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.600
three hour show.
I'm an old man.
Okay.
Fucking hour and a half.

102
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.400
I'm,
I'm usually ready to be done with it.
But this three fucking hours in,

103
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:21.260
I was actually sad when it was over.

104
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:23.813
<v 3>MMM.</v>

105
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.950
<v 0>I,
I don't even know where to be.
It was fucking unbelievable.</v>

106
00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:31.240
Slash took this amazing solo axles.
Uh,

107
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.020
voice sounded incredible.
Duff's sang a song and then they had,

108
00:06:35.021 --> 00:06:36.880
they threw some covers in there too.
You know,

109
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.080
I don't want to ruin the show for people who want to go see,

110
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.250
but every covered they did,
um,

111
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.790
was by some other B singer that sang really up in the higher register and a axle

112
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:51.100
crushed all of it.
And,
um,

113
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.470
it's the best of band is sound sounded since way back in the day.
I feel,
uh,

114
00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.310
back when that classic one that they aired on MTV that I watched a thousand

115
00:07:00.311 --> 00:07:03.190
fucking times,
that one where they think they were at the Roxy,

116
00:07:03.191 --> 00:07:07.900
was that what it was in New York?
And um,
I remember that was on,

117
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.470
I had taped it on VH VHS tape on the feces.
Yeah.

118
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.750
And there was,
who's that fucking VJ with the long blonde hair?

119
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.880
And he used to wear the leather jacket.

120
00:07:18.881 --> 00:07:22.780
He was from Europe or something and he was going,
uh,

121
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.790
this band is supposed to be the next big thing if they live long enough.
Right.

122
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.120
What's amazing is 30 years later,
they were all alive.
Uh,

123
00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:34.720
but that was the big thing.
Um,
but anyways,
I,
I,

124
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.800
it was fucking unbelievable.
That's all I'm going to say.

125
00:07:38.801 --> 00:07:43.180
So if you get a chance to see them on this tour,
definitely go see them.

126
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.510
Like I said,
I,
I can't remember the last time they sounded this good a,

127
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.910
this might be the best day ever.
Sounded so,
and um,
and that's it.

128
00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:56.890
And Neil was going fucking nuts during the show.
She actually,

129
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.830
she actually got a reaction from duff and slash sorry and a axle,

130
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.110
duff big smile,

131
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.130
laugh in watching how crazy Neil was going and then actual actually imitated the

132
00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:12.460
dance that Nia was doing.
So needless to say,

133
00:08:12.461 --> 00:08:17.230
she had a great fucking time and,
uh,
I'm smiling now thinking about it.

134
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.010
There was,
it was the perfect fucking way to end that trip.

135
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:27.100
Um,
so there you go.
Um,
and now I am back and I,
oh,

136
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:31.690
Paleo.
Oh,
freckles is jet lagged.
I did my best.
I stayed up until eight o'clock.

137
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:34.563
<v 3>MMM.</v>

138
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.840
<v 0>You know,
last night.
But then the old Kiddo got up at three in the morning,</v>

139
00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:43.280
so I've been up since three in,
that's been a mess.
Um,
I,
uh,
oh,
by the way,

140
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:48.281
I finally broke into that fucking bottle of that chocolate salted vodka lik core

141
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.960
and what it was something I don't even,
what the fuck it was.
Holy Shit.

142
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.290
Was that a hangover?
I didn't even have that much.
I was just drinking vodka.

143
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:00.030
I was just pouring it into kind of like,
you know,

144
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:04.020
spruce it up and it tasted like ass.
But uh,
you know,

145
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.170
it was given to me by relatives.
So it's like I got it,

146
00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:08.460
I got out of respect for them.
I got to drink some of this shit.

147
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.530
And the next day I woke up and I was like,
oh my God.

148
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.940
It wasn't even a hangover.
It was like a body pain.
And I felt like I was,

149
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.790
I was gonna Puke.
Like I just need to get something to eat.

150
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.730
So I'd go down the S,
I go down the hall,
the hall,

151
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.340
let's say sound rule.
Oh.

152
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.390
However the fuck they talk over there and I'm looking for a boulangerie that is

153
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:37.790
open.
And I find one night I just got a couple of quick thoughts,

154
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.160
a couple of pounds to shock a lot.
That for me,

155
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.970
I was getting it for everybody and uh,
but I,
I was,

156
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:49.971
I was fucked up until I got on the plane and I basically had to start drinking

157
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:54.570
again.
It was one of those sort of hangovers and uh,
oh my God,

158
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.600
I got so mad at my wife where they had us with a 6:20 AM pickup and my wife

159
00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:08.520
goes,
man that sounds kind of early.
You know,
we not taken off til 10 20.

160
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.080
Right.
And she pushed the pickup back by 40 minutes,
you know,

161
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:18.770
and I love how she doesn't live in Paris and made this judgment,

162
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.500
see themselves early.
So for an extra 40 minutes asleep.

163
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:28.380
And um,
I'm one of those people,
if they tell you to get there two hours before,

164
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:33.360
I get that two hours before,
you know,
not a care in the fucking world.

165
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.620
Cause I know I don't do well with that kind of stress.
All right.

166
00:10:37.621 --> 00:10:40.980
You want to stick me in a bar with a bunch of animals fucking throwing shit at

167
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.720
this stage.
I can handle that.

168
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.960
I don't know why cause I grew up with a bunch of animals but like when it comes

169
00:10:45.961 --> 00:10:49.050
to that type of shit.
All right.
Were you looking at,

170
00:10:49.051 --> 00:10:53.310
you know you got your wife and your kid and you're looking at a 10 hour flight.

171
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.170
If the fucking people who live there and know where the airport is,

172
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.330
say it's a t to get picked up at six 20 to get picked up at six 20

173
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:05.450
<v 4>yeah.</v>

174
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.980
<v 0>She pushed it til seven</v>

175
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.870
and everything was going great until we got there.
Those Air France,
grumpy,

176
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:17.220
grumpy fucking people working there.
We asked this lady is like no help.

177
00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:19.410
Where the fuck did we stand in line?
Where do we check in?

178
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.580
They tell us this one line.

179
00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:24.900
We stand in it and then we get elevated to the front and this fucking asshole

180
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.070
is,
they knew him as you.
You can do it.
I'm like [inaudible] Blah Blah Blah,

181
00:11:29.071 --> 00:11:30.210
blah blah.
It's like fuck it.

182
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.380
Some are wearing the exact same shirt as you told us this was the right line.

183
00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:34.921
And he was just like,

184
00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:39.240
it was one of those guys who just takes joy in fucking ruining your day.

185
00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:42.390
So then you,
then you had to go over and you had to basically check yourself in,

186
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.690
put the tags on your bags,
weigh your bags through the whole thing.

187
00:11:45.691 --> 00:11:47.280
I was at fucking,
I was working at the airport.

188
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.200
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

189
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.170
<v 0>I'll tell you,
I'm just giving yourself a tip at the end of it.
Okay.
Um,</v>

190
00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:57.070
it was ridiculous.
And then we finally get through,
um,

191
00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.770
in all another and then she had to go,
you know,
go,

192
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.820
go in exchange or whatever the fuck you do there with getting your tax money

193
00:12:05.821 --> 00:12:07.500
back.
She had to go fucking do that.

194
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.790
We stood in the wrong line and time's ticking.
Time's ticking.
Time's ticking.

195
00:12:11.791 --> 00:12:14.400
And we got picked up 40 minutes later.
Then they said we should have.

196
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.473
And next thing you know,

197
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.000
we finally get through fucking security and I'm just going like,

198
00:12:18.001 --> 00:12:22.490
this is so fucking stupid.
We get through security and we have to,

199
00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.750
before we even go,
not security,
you get through customs,
we get through that.

200
00:12:26.751 --> 00:12:27.584
Then we have to up,

201
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.340
we discover at that point we got to walk over half a terminal,

202
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:35.680
get on a fucking train before we get into this shit show security line.

203
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.190
And uh,
yeah,
we were going through the line.

204
00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:42.430
They were already boarding the plane and I,
oh my God,
was I fucking mad?

205
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.450
I was just like,
it wasn't,
suppose it didn't have to be this way.

206
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.030
So my wife does what she always does when she's wrong is,

207
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.910
and she knows she's wrong.
She just immediately apologizes,
you know?

208
00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.250
So then now what am I supposed to do?
So now.
Okay.
Oh well she said she was sorry.

209
00:13:00.251 --> 00:13:03.550
She said,
you're right.
I messed up.
I'm sorry.
But yeah,

210
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:07.910
but now we're still in this situation.
I don't know.

211
00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.910
My wife would do that in war,
you know,

212
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.820
if I was up on a fucking roof and she gave away our position and then all of a

213
00:13:13.821 --> 00:13:17.030
sudden we're taking on fire and she just be like,
you're right.
I'm sorry.

214
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:21.890
I shouldn't have shuffled my feet like that.
What?

215
00:13:21.891 --> 00:13:26.710
I said I was sorry.
You know they do that shit.
What?

216
00:13:26.711 --> 00:13:29.410
I thought it was,
sorry,
I didn't know.

217
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.210
You know what you just like being mad,
you know,

218
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.610
and that they just turned the whole fucking thing around on you.

219
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.710
So I'm sitting there going,

220
00:13:38.711 --> 00:13:42.430
they're bored in the fucking plane right now and all these fucking animals are

221
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:46.300
going to be taken our overhead compartment space and I'm just catastrophizing.

222
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.550
I'm fucking,
I'm like that dude and platoon,
look,

223
00:13:48.551 --> 00:13:53.530
I got a bad feeling about this man.
And she is acting like,

224
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:58.730
uh,
what's his face and Kelly's heroes.
Um,
uh,
what's his,
it's a,

225
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.120
it's a beautiful bridge baby.
It's going to be there,
right?

226
00:14:01.121 --> 00:14:02.770
She's all fucking real Donald Sutherland,

227
00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:05.530
she's all fucking relaxed and I'm flipping the fuck out.

228
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.980
And of course we get on the plane,
you know,
we get there,

229
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.250
they're still boarding the plane.
We get on,
everything's fine.

230
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.100
The overhead compartment above our seats close.
And I'm like,

231
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.080
there's going to be fucking pack was shit.
And I opened up,

232
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:21.850
it was completely empty.
Everything was great.
And,
uh,
you know,

233
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.890
then she tries to turn it around like,
you see,
he's saying,
look,

234
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.700
the planes even leaving late,
like,
what's the problem?
I said,
oh,
that's,
yeah,

235
00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:31.440
great ideas.

236
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.550
The next time we go to another country or we're not really familiar with it,

237
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.290
let's leave 40 minutes later and let's just count on the fact that the plane is

238
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:43.260
going to be late.
You know,
look,
I thought it was,

239
00:14:43.261 --> 00:14:47.940
sorry,
I don't know what more you want from me.
What do you say to that?

240
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.490
It's like,
I don't want you to apologize now.
Okay.

241
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.070
I got to get the anger up first.
Then you apologize.
Okay.

242
00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:00.620
What?
I said it was sorry.
And then it all fucking goes away.
Jesus Christ,

243
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.210
you know,
God forbid I do something fucking bring it up for nine years,
right?

244
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:10.110
One I said it was sorry.
Yes,
but that doesn't Blab,
blab.

245
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.940
Um,
anyways,
so I'm back here in the states.
I,
uh,

246
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.210
been up since three in the morning.
I got caught up on some of my,
um,

247
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.150
some of my shit that I had on the,
uh,

248
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.970
I still call it the Dvr or whatever the fuck you call them,

249
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.730
digital goddamn thing.
Now.
I watched the,

250
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:28.460
a moto GP race from Spain.

251
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:34.120
I watched Jorge Lorenzo absolutely dominate,
um,

252
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.760
I guess he's won two races in a row for Ducati.
Right.

253
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:43.100
Davitt CEO's so crashed out for the second time in a,
in two races,

254
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.440
three races I guess.
Um,

255
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.440
so I guess that's causing them a weird situation over there.

256
00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:52.070
I don't know much about it,
but um,
I can tell you that,
uh,

257
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:57.080
I'm hoping sensitivity also seems like he's rapidly going to be out of this,

258
00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:02.210
that uh,
Lorenzo keeps winning races because I would love to see him and mark has

259
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.010
basically go neck and neck for it the whole way,
uh,
to the end.

260
00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:11.660
You know,
I hate when like the guy basically has it wrapped up in September.

261
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:15.560
You know,
Valentino Rossi made his third fucking podium in a row.

262
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:16.460
It was great cal crutch.

263
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.760
She'll finally get around that can took him like fucking 20 labs,
but he did it.

264
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:24.200
Um,
I enjoyed it.
You know what?
I was very tempted to try and go to that race,

265
00:16:24.201 --> 00:16:27.470
but I just couldn't leave my daughter,
you know what I mean?

266
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.950
We had a relative over there helping us out and,
uh,
I wasn't gonna leave them,

267
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:31.460
you know,

268
00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.840
it just felt weird leaving account country that isn't my country and leaving my

269
00:16:35.841 --> 00:16:38.710
daughter.
So I said,
fuck it.
I was getting a little bit too caught up in the A,

270
00:16:38.711 --> 00:16:43.190
I'm turning 50,
you only turn 50 once.
Hey,
you only turn 51 once or 49 months,

271
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:47.570
asshole,
you're a dad.
So I was like,
all right.
You know,
um,

272
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:51.470
I got hammered on the plane though.
My wife got,
she was fucking pissed at me,

273
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.320
um,
had a little bit,
you know,

274
00:16:54.321 --> 00:16:55.910
I was thinking I was already going to be on the wagon,

275
00:16:55.911 --> 00:17:00.020
but that's just that long as flight.
And,
um,

276
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.000
I watched that.
Oh,
I watched that fucking movie.
Dunkirk nine.

277
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.480
All you guys saw it in Imax.
I fucking blew it.
I was too busy and I missed it.

278
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.780
I watched it on the little airplane,
um,
TV,

279
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.640
but oh my God.
Was that movie unfucking believable?

280
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:18.870
And I knew it was going to be unbelievable because this,

281
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.570
this thing out here in Hollywood where when people

282
00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:31.050
cannot handle that,
somebody is that much more talented than them.
They actually,

283
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:35.870
they say the same thing.
I had a buddy of mine saw that movie goes,

284
00:17:35.871 --> 00:17:38.860
did you see Dunkirk yet?
And I was like,
no,
I didn't.
I've got to see it.

285
00:17:38.861 --> 00:17:41.840
I heard it's unbelievable.
He goes,
yeah.
He goes,
I left him.
He was like,

286
00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:45.650
I don't even know what I just watched.
Like I don't even know what I just want.

287
00:17:45.651 --> 00:17:48.830
I think we've donated the fuck.
It's a fucking war movie.
You asshole.

288
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.770
Jesus Christ.
Brush up on the history channel.
World War II,

289
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.040
Hitler is driving the allied forces into the ocean.

290
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.190
Made a huge fucking blender because he made a left turn.

291
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:00.300
He couldn't resist Paris.

292
00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:03.720
He went down to Paris to go down to get a Boulogne jury to get a,
you know,

293
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.371
a shock,

294
00:18:04.371 --> 00:18:08.730
a lot to ponder and get a little fucking frosting and is fucking Charlie Chaplin

295
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.720
Mustache.
He fucked up.

296
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.870
What he should've done was a nihilist us on that goddamn beaches.

297
00:18:12.871 --> 00:18:14.070
What the fuck he should've done.

298
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.860
It's one of the great military blunders even I know that,

299
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:22.010
I know that cause Joe Barton,
Dick taught me that,
right?
Joe Partner gets a,
is a,

300
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.080
uh,
he knows all about fucking World War II.
Um,

301
00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.970
and then I watched the movie and it was just basically a about these people,

302
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:37.110
you know,
in,
in the,
was it,
was it the French army?

303
00:18:37.111 --> 00:18:38.600
The English are mainly English army.

304
00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.130
There was some French people there to trying to get the fuck out of there.

305
00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:42.090
So they didn't die.

306
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.670
I mean it was pretty basic what was going on there.

307
00:18:46.671 --> 00:18:48.560
But the way it was shot was incredible.

308
00:18:48.561 --> 00:18:52.340
And I've just noticed out here in Hollywood was when somebody is like,

309
00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:57.290
like when you see a fucking movie at that Goddamn level,
I mean,
I don't,

310
00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.710
how would you even write that script?

311
00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:03.560
It was just so much action going on with no dialogue.
And it was,

312
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.240
it was breathtaking moving.
It was incredible.
And like,
you know,

313
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.450
one of the great things about knowing that you're a fucking moron as you can

314
00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:15.980
enjoy somebody else's genius.
I was just sitting there going,

315
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.470
I could never fucking do this.
This is incredible.

316
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.800
And I loved it and it is buddy of mine was just going,
yeah.

317
00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.690
I don't even know why it says watched
WWE.

318
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:28.390
I mean,
yeah,

319
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.160
I can see if you fucking watched you to one of those stat films and somebody do

320
00:19:31.161 --> 00:19:33.920
shit on somebody shout.
I don't what the fuck I just saw,
but I have,

321
00:19:33.921 --> 00:19:36.110
I'm trying to forget it.
Um,

322
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:41.170
I remember that when that Batman movie came out with that actor who played the

323
00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:42.540
joker and won the Oscar.

324
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.983
<v 3>MMM.</v>

325
00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:49.630
<v 0>I'm so bad with the names and like his performance is,
the joker is,</v>

326
00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.680
is right up there with anything I've ever seen any actor do.

327
00:19:53.681 --> 00:19:57.550
And I remember seeing this other big actor after he watched that movie saying

328
00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:01.840
the exact same fucking thing.
Like,
I don't even know what I just want.
I mean,

329
00:20:01.841 --> 00:20:04.840
maybe I'm not smart enough.
I don't know what that movie was supposed to meet.

330
00:20:04.841 --> 00:20:09.130
I mean,
it's just,
I don't know.
I just want,
maybe you don't,
you just watch,

331
00:20:09.131 --> 00:20:12.220
you just watch for look great acting performances of all time and it's making

332
00:20:12.221 --> 00:20:15.580
you feel a little fucking certain way about yourself.

333
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:17.890
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

334
00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.960
<v 0>Give it up.
You asshole.
What's the matter?
Huh?
What do you play?</v>

335
00:20:19.961 --> 00:20:22.240
The green lantern and all of a sudden you fucking can't.
In a way,

336
00:20:22.241 --> 00:20:26.290
this guy played the joker.
Um,
I don't even know what I just watched.

337
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:31.240
So anyways,
so I watched that movie and,
uh,
I had a script to read.

338
00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.150
I'm a Hollywood guy who had business class.
I'm reading scripts,
right?

339
00:20:34.151 --> 00:20:38.200
That's what I do.
Okay.
To see which copy am I going to play in this movie?

340
00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:45.190
So anyways,
I,
uh,
I started,
you know,

341
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:48.200
I went up to the front,
you know,

342
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.290
I was walking my daughter up and down the aisles and then I see this,

343
00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:56.330
they got a bottle of Glenn
and I was just like,
Oh shit,

344
00:20:56.331 --> 00:20:59.690
there we go.
All this stupid wine and cheese in this fucking thing.

345
00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.320
And I just poured myself a glass of wine.

346
00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:08.300
And when I saw,
when I saw that,
why couldn't it done that?
I wouldn't have,

347
00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.190
I couldn't have done that for my kid.
I don't know.
A lot of the flights are blur.

348
00:21:11.191 --> 00:21:14.210
Right.
So I brought my kid back and then that's right.
I had the glass of wine

349
00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.760
and then I saw the Glen Levitt and I was like,
oh,
that's what I want now.

350
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:24.400
What the fuck do I do with this?
So I just sucked it down

351
00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:26.911
and yeah.

352
00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:30.240
Then I started drinking that stuff in the second I break out like any sort of

353
00:21:30.241 --> 00:21:33.420
fucking brown stuff,
like Nia eyes are on me.

354
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:35.950
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

355
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:40.210
<v 0>And uh,
you know,
I had the glass of wine,
I had some shitty American food.</v>

356
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.730
Then I had like three of those Glen Levitz and I got a fourth one.
Right.

357
00:21:42.731 --> 00:21:45.730
It's a 10 hour flight.
I was pacing it,
I was keeping myself,

358
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:50.110
I was doing the Keith Richards thing.
He did nice.
Your key,
you get,
you get nice,

359
00:21:50.111 --> 00:21:51.880
right?
And then you just kind of lead,
keep it there.

360
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.990
You don't get fucking messy or whatever.
But uh,
I got the fourth one,

361
00:21:55.991 --> 00:21:58.090
she gave me the eyeball.
So I just set it down right.

362
00:21:58.091 --> 00:22:00.700
And then I fucking took a nap for not more than 20 minutes.

363
00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:04.750
And when I woke up it was gone
and I was looking at,

364
00:22:04.751 --> 00:22:07.960
she fucking told that lady to take the Goddamn thinks and I had to just sit

365
00:22:07.961 --> 00:22:09.310
there,
you know,

366
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:14.330
beginning my initial descent and to just sitting there stone fucking sober.
Yeah.

367
00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.093
<v 3>MMM.</v>

368
00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.620
<v 0>I Dunno.
So anyways,
that was my last little hurrah.</v>

369
00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:22.490
So now I'm on the wagon on the wagon,
you know,
woke up this morning,

370
00:22:22.491 --> 00:22:24.140
he had my steel cut oats,

371
00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.680
my two eggs over easy banana and some strawberries.

372
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.730
Then I'll probably have some Ezekiel bread with some fucking almond butter.

373
00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:33.590
And of course for lunch,

374
00:22:33.591 --> 00:22:38.300
I've already made my keen st learn how that's how you say it was some black

375
00:22:38.301 --> 00:22:42.650
beans,
maybe a little salsa.
Then I'll probably,
I don't know,

376
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:47.890
later on the afternoon have some exciting chick pea pasta that I'll have a

377
00:22:48.051 --> 00:22:53.051
protein size of my hand with some sort of garden salad and then I'm just going

378
00:22:53.861 --> 00:22:55.970
to crush waters and a hit the elliptical

379
00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.410
<v 3>back to that grind.</v>

380
00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:04.430
<v 0>My vacation is over.
No more questions.
No more baguettes,</v>

381
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.590
<v 3>no more.
Glen Levitt.
All right.</v>

382
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.550
<v 0>To be in regular.
I'm back to fucking Clark Kent.</v>

383
00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.620
Uh,
it's actually good.
You know,
something was great about eating,

384
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.720
drinking like a pig over there is you fucking,

385
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:21.783
<v 3>you know,</v>

386
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:25.150
<v 0>by the way we,
we,
we,
we have,
you know,</v>

387
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.880
I told you we had a relative on the plane too.
Okay.

388
00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.210
So it wasn't just my wife's sitting there is her husband got shit faced.
Okay.

389
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.080
This is my wife and another relative staring at me while I got shit faced.

390
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:39.270
I didn't get shit faced,
but I got a,
you know,
I was definitely tailgating.

391
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.580
How am I going to lay off?
I,
I'm going on the wagon.

392
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.920
They got the bottles sitting right up there.

393
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.380
I paid all this money for business class.

394
00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:54.030
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

395
00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.840
<v 0>Um,
I always give her shit.
I have given I,
you know,
am I going to get into it?</v>

396
00:23:57.841 --> 00:23:59.760
You know,
she gives me shit.
What the fuck you gonna do?

397
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.793
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

398
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.520
<v 0>You know what I should've done?
I should've walked.
What?
I'm,
I'm sorry.</v>

399
00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.250
You fucking,
you can't be drinking all this.
You're gonna,

400
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:12.100
you're gonna pass out and you got to think of what I said.
I was sorry.

401
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:18.340
What?
I said I was sorry.
Um,
all right.
Mandy's everybody.

402
00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:23.200
Here we go.
Oh Dude.
Oh.
Don't do beyond ease me undies.

403
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.670
Drinking on the fucking plane.

Doo.
Doo beyond ease my aunties,

404
00:24:27.671 --> 00:24:31.360
my wife is a fucking pain.
If I pass out,

405
00:24:31.361 --> 00:24:33.010
she takes my drink.

406
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:38.650
I wake up and I make a stick and then she doesn't talk to me for a couple of

407
00:24:38.651 --> 00:24:43.240
movies.
And then we land at lax wearing me undies.

408
00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.780
Me undies.
You've definitely heard me talk about me undies.
Hey,
who's kidding?

409
00:24:46.781 --> 00:24:50.350
Who you've heard me sing about me on these,
you know the fun,

410
00:24:50.351 --> 00:24:54.280
comfy undies that feel as good as they look to those of you who haven't tried

411
00:24:54.281 --> 00:24:57.270
them yet.
Listen Up.
You can get an incredibly,

412

you can get incredible underwear sent to your door with me undies meaning no

413
00:25:01.031 --> 00:25:04.390
more hunting around for the perfect pair at a crowded store and eventually

414
00:25:04.391 --> 00:25:06.310
setting for settling for good enough.

415
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.170
Mian these are made with a sustainably sourced material from beechwood trees.

416
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.890
Still don't know how you make underwear out of trees in their soft,

417
00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.700
some fucking Barney rubble shit.
They're naturally soft.

418
00:25:18.701 --> 00:25:22.750
Fiber makes a fabric that won't sag down or write up.

419
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.750
Okay?
That's what it is.
It's flying.

420
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:30.080
The underwear flies in formation with the and nuts.
Trust me,
once you,

421
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.690
you put on a pair of,
you're going to get it.

423
00:25:34.901 --> 00:25:38.380

And if they can't,

424
00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.400
just realize,
you know,
some people's balls hang one hangs lower than the other.

425
00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.480
Maybe that's what the problem is.
You know,
get somebody on there.

426
00:25:47.481 --> 00:25:50.300
Can you describe your,
uh,
your genitalia?

427
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:53.250
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

428

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:11.360
we know Bob would just be packed.

434
00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:15.440
People when they look in a mirror they get confused about which uh,

435
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:18.540

Okay.
It's,
it's fucking delicious.

460
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.180
The incredible quality of butcher box meets starts with the commitment to

461
00:27:51.181 --> 00:27:55.620
raising animals humanely before we kill them and free of antibiotics and

462
00:27:55.621 --> 00:27:59.850
hormones.
Each box comes with the at least eight to 11 pounds of meat,

463
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:03.480
which is enough for 24 individual size meals.

464
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:07.770
You can choose from five different box types.
All beef,

The mixed box.
The custom box with such,
you choose your own cuts.

466
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:18.080
A Guy,

467
00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:21.300

How about butcher?
How Butcher box works?

468
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.290
First we feed the animals that we let them outside.

469
00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:26.550
Then we shoot him in the head.

470
00:28:26.551 --> 00:28:31.260
Choose from curated boxes including a mix of high quality beef,
chicken or pork,

471
00:28:31.261 --> 00:28:32.520
or customize your own box.

472
00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:37.380
Meat is frozen at the peak of freshness in individual vacuum packed

473
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.190
biodegradable packaging.
All meet is delivered right to your doorstep for free.

This is 100% true.
This is exactly what my experience.

475
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.980
Then you throw it in your freezer.
You thought what you want,

476
00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:51.930
you take out your fucking skillet,
right?
You sear it on both sides.

477
00:28:51.931 --> 00:28:53.880
You finish it in the oven.
Take it back out,

478
00:28:53.881 --> 00:28:57.540

my calves,
my calves.

560
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:53.480
So they would stay away from it.

561
00:33:53.481 --> 00:33:55.950
I didn't realize that that meant they were all glued up and shit.

562
00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:01.610
So this person's been working on it and I'm literally coming up off the table at

563
00:34:02.881 --> 00:34:07.560
barely any pressure from the elbow.
Okay.
And she goes to see what's,

564
00:34:07.561 --> 00:34:09.990
what does it feel like?
Like what,
what type of paint I go,

565
00:34:09.991 --> 00:34:12.270
it feels like there's a ball of Hornets

566
00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.940
in my fucking cabs.
Um,

567
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:23.010
but I've just been too busy to have her finish and get it all back to the way it

568
00:34:23.011 --> 00:34:26.900
used to be because,
oh,
cause whatever cause of my fucking life.

569
00:34:26.901 --> 00:34:31.520
But I have to tell you man,
um,
being a 50 year old man now,
if you,

570
00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.610
if you could find a good misuse,
uh,
the,

571
00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:40.160
the quality of life that you're going to have,
you know,
if you stretch,

572
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:45.180
if you eat right,
if you don't drink Glenn all the way back from Paris,

573
00:34:45.181 --> 00:34:48.970
which I did,
I'm exaggerating for comedy effect.
All right.
Um,

574
00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.340
like I was having this problem where I would be,

575
00:34:54.341 --> 00:34:59.341
I would lay down and I would watch TV for like sometimes as little as like 20

576
00:34:59.561 --> 00:35:03.640
minutes.
And when I would go to stand up,
like I had to stretch.

577
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.560
That's like how fucked up my calves were.

578
00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.600
And I'm like,
I felt like my Achilles tendon was going to snap.

579
00:35:10.601 --> 00:35:11.950
Like something was going to snap.

580
00:35:11.951 --> 00:35:16.951
So I've just been having this woman beat the shit out of my legs and a co that's

581
00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:21.270
,
you know,
what I found out,
it was back when I had that psychotic nerve issue.
Um,

582
00:35:21.271 --> 00:35:23.650
and I felt a little twinge of that starting to come back,

583
00:35:23.651 --> 00:35:27.210
just that little bit of tightness.
So,
uh,
I dunno,

584
00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.400
she's going to turn me into hamburger tomorrow hopefully.
Um,
and that's it.

585
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:34.150
All right.
That's the podcast here for this week.
So great to be back here.

586
00:35:34.151 --> 00:35:38.040

589
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:53.390
<v 7>Um,
thank you to guns and roses for putting on the best concert I've ever seen.</v>

590
00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:58.560
And uh,
that's it.
I guess I'm just really good,
thankful.
Um,

591
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:02.550
enjoy the music and you can listen to another half hour of Thursday afternoon,

592
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:05.980

Monday morning podcast.
Greatest hits from

593
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.280

I have no idea.
All right.
Uh,

594
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:13.750
that's it.
Have a great weekend.

595
00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.173
<v 1>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

596
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.673
[inaudible]

597
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:43.180
<v 7>like a,</v>

598
00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:48.340
<v 0>and then we started watching this
series on Netflix.</v>

599
00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.940
It was something about these shifts.
It was all these,

600
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.650
these French cooks and a,

601
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.630
it was great to hear the French language cause I kind of stopped it once again,

602
00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.190
I was picking up,
you know,

603
00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:03.820
little phrases here or there that made me feel good in these fucking,

604
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:09.370
these chefs were incredible watch like two or three episodes of it.
Of course.

605
00:38:09.371 --> 00:38:10.750
I don't know what the name of it is

606
00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:18.600
[inaudible] but it made me want to live in Paris for like fucking three months,

607
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:20.460
four months,
five,

608
00:38:20.461 --> 00:38:24.390
whatever it would take just to get kind of passable and take a pastry making

609
00:38:24.391 --> 00:38:29.040
class.
I know that sounds like the stupidest thing ever,

610
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:30.120
but this fucking guy,

611
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:32.820
he takes like an apple and he was going like this guy was an artist.

612
00:38:32.821 --> 00:38:36.100
He was just sitting there going like,
you know,
I'm so of making all these

613
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.730
<v 8>fucking thing.
I had to come up with some new</v>

614
00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:44.530
thing to do with an apple and he fucking just imagine if he just kept peeling a

615
00:38:44.531 --> 00:38:46.570
thing.
Right.
If you just peeling the skin off,

616
00:38:46.571 --> 00:38:48.490
but you just kept going all the way down into the core.

617
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:53.760
He did that and it was all one piece you did with some hand crank thing and he

618
00:38:54.311 --> 00:38:56.980
said,
I wanted to make a rose out of out of an apple.

619
00:38:56.981 --> 00:38:59.290
And he somehow did it and turned it into a dessert.

620
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:04.160
<v 1>[inaudible] visual Monday.
Who?</v>

621
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:13.500
[inaudible] [inaudible] to [inaudible] in Nash.
Okay.

622
00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:15.763
Second male view

623
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.740
on [inaudible] this sauce you believe man did I beat

624
00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:28.090
[inaudible]

625
00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:32.020
<v 8>fucking chop to duck in a,
in a chicken in half.
And he sewed them together,</v>

626
00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:36.970
which was very naziesque slash American horror story that kind of creeped me

627
00:39:36.971 --> 00:39:37.804
out.

628
00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:42.010
<v 1>Sassy colon food,
the</v>

629
00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:44.933
[inaudible] [inaudible]

630
00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:50.880
[inaudible] [inaudible]

631
00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.140
<v 8>and then of course they had to show how they fucking,
they were cooking lobsters,</v>

632
00:39:55.141 --> 00:39:59.320
live lobsters over an open flame.
Can I kiss you guys a question?
What?

633
00:39:59.321 --> 00:40:01.260
What are the lobster ever do to us?

634
00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:06.120
Every other animal has the decency of being dead before we fucking,

635
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:08.160
at least in this country.
I know other countries,

636
00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:11.910
they've got fucking mad maggots running around their apple jacks for extra

637
00:40:11.911 --> 00:40:15.210
protein.
You know,
that's like us putting white powder into our shakes.

638
00:40:15.211 --> 00:40:18.000
They put like fucking bugs and stuff,
you know what I mean?

639
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.300
Puts a little spring in your step.
A little twinkle in your eyes.
So anyways,

640
00:40:21.301 --> 00:40:24.510
I'm watching this fucking lunatic and um,

641
00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.650
for the life of me,
I don't know why they just can't.
At least just,

642
00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:32.100
can you just fucking,
I don't know.

643
00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.280
Can they make it like a little lobster hammer and just fucking knock,

644
00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.030
knock it out.

645
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:40.140
At least does it have to be squirming on the flame and you have to keep telling

646
00:40:40.141 --> 00:40:44.030
me that it doesn't feel pain.
It doesn't have a central nervous system.

647
00:40:44.031 --> 00:40:48.540
Whatever the fuck they try to say.
It's just like,
like what?
It's like an Amoeba.

648
00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:52.800
It isn't.
Okay.
The fucking things got eyeballs and shit.
It's walking around.

649
00:40:52.801 --> 00:40:55.230
It's got its little tentacles.
What did we call it?
Those,

650
00:40:55.231 --> 00:40:58.710
those big fucking thing's coming out.
It can see it breathes.

651
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:03.390
You gotta have paid.
That's part of survival,
right?

652
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:08.760
Wish it was a way to shut it off.
I'm Jesus.

653
00:41:08.761 --> 00:41:11.520
I'm all over the map.
I was talking about La fucking not Lsu.

654
00:41:11.521 --> 00:41:15.030
I was talking about Alabama,
USC.
Now where the hell am I?
So anyways,

655
00:41:15.031 --> 00:41:17.730
the guy got sick of talking about a week after a while,

656
00:41:17.731 --> 00:41:20.310
he just got sick of the blood of all the animals.

657
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:23.840
<v 1>Excuse yourself,
at a seat.
[inaudible]</v>

658
00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.760
city Tammany
eight.

659
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.983
I pushed it back to you.

660
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.030
[inaudible]

661
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:42.910
<v 0>and he got three stars over and,
and,
and um,</v>

662
00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.540
in France in three stars is the highest you can get,

663
00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:49.420
which is so fucking Parisian.
You know what I mean?

664
00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.900
Is so fucking understated and classy.
I hate to say it is American,

665
00:41:52.901 --> 00:41:57.070
but they really are.
They really earned their snooty fucking behavior over there.

666
00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:01.660
The people that style,
they closed it,
they crush it.
You know,

667
00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:05.200
Mister t would got himself a gold chain and it was this like,
you know what,

668
00:42:05.201 --> 00:42:08.730
one isn't enough.
Let me get fucking 9,000 of them and hanger.

669
00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.510
They're the exact opposite of that.

670
00:42:10.511 --> 00:42:13.450
They got like all mood muted colors and then Bam,

671
00:42:13.451 --> 00:42:17.500
a sick as pair of shoes or a hat or the ladies with their bags,

672
00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:22.810
just fucking class.
It's not like,
you know,
it's not like us loud Americans,

673
00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.673
you know,

674
00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.590
<v 1>but it's good to be loud sometimes.</v>

675
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:01.983
[inaudible]

676
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.080
<v 0>Hey,

<v 8>podcast for Monday,
June 21st,
2010.</v>

678
00:43:10.141 --> 00:43:14.610
How the hell are you?
God dammit.
You like that.
That's my like,

679
00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:18.610
come on,
let's fucking do this.
You know,

680
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:24.280
like he gave up on your dreams and you picked an easy fucking drone route.

681
00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:29.590
Got a job at a corporation and I'm the first guy that,
you know,

682
00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.800
you're going to meet and I'm trying to get everybody all on the same team.

683
00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.470
Come on everybody.
You know,

684
00:43:36.471 --> 00:43:38.360
let's go look at some spreadsheets.

685
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.010
Why can't I fucking hear myself?

686
00:43:42.011 --> 00:43:45.190
I'm screaming right now and I'm not hearing the volume in my headphones.

687
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:50.660
These headphones getting old.
Okay.
You don't,
are they made in America?

688
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:54.490
Is anything made in America anymore?
I have no fucking idea.
But anyways,

689
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:59.010
I'm actually taping this on.
Um,
what is it?
Sunday,

690
00:43:59.011 --> 00:44:03.570
June 20th.
So it is father's day.
So happy belated father's day,

691
00:44:03.571 --> 00:44:08.190
everybody,
you know,
I hate that word.
Belated happy birthday.
Happy Birthday.

692
00:44:08.191 --> 00:44:12.420
Happy Father's Day to all the fathers out there who stuck around,

693
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:18.240
you know,
happy father's Day.
You know,

694
00:44:18.241 --> 00:44:21.660
even in the father's,
you know,
you're married some Twat,
you realize you didn't,

695
00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.700
you didn't love her anymore and you know,

696
00:44:23.701 --> 00:44:27.330
she fucking took off and started banging on the fucking dude down the street.

697
00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:30.130
So you flipped out,
you threw some furniture,

698
00:44:30.131 --> 00:44:32.580
and now you're considered danger to her and your children.

699
00:44:32.581 --> 00:44:35.910
You can't really see them today.
Happy Father's Day to you too.

700
00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:41.880
But no happy father's day to somebody who just knock somebody up and never hung

701
00:44:41.881 --> 00:44:44.250
around.
You're not a father.

702
00:44:44.251 --> 00:44:49.170
You're a guy with a dick who shot a load into a vagina and you fucking left.

703
00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:53.280
You left,
you're riding the bench.
You're not in the game.

704
00:44:55.710 --> 00:45:00.120
So a
happy father's Day fuckers.

705
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:06.090
Um,
what'd you get?
You get some ship gifts like all guys get,

706
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.600
you know what a women,
what do women get on Mother's Day?
What do they get high?

707
00:45:09.601 --> 00:45:13.320
They get fucking pancakes.
You know,

708
00:45:13.321 --> 00:45:17.640
what does a guy get a new breathable shirt for when he goes out and most of the

709
00:45:17.641 --> 00:45:20.220
lawn that day?
Is that what you get?
Some fucking

710
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:25.950
what do you get a new driver?
I'm a dad.

711
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:30.000
Get some fucking tool for the garage.

712
00:45:30.001 --> 00:45:33.300
Something to help you fix the fucking place up.
You know,

713
00:45:33.301 --> 00:45:37.730
I got a lot of balls that actually got my girl,
uh,
a gift certificate,

714
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.710
gift certificate to some cooking classes,
uh,

715
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:45.300
one year for her birthday,
you know,
and that was one of those gifts.

716
00:45:45.301 --> 00:45:46.680
As I gave it to her,
I was like,
this is,

717
00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:50.370
she's either going to love this or I'm really going to piss her off because it

718
00:45:50.371 --> 00:45:53.750
is a very nice gift.
But there's also an element of a,

719
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:57.960
why don't you learn how to cook,
bitch?
Um,
but it wasn't that,

720
00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.840
you know,
this is actually a gourmets,
you know,

721
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.830
whatever I'm going to fucking make out in the deal.
So douchey gift.

722
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:07.140
And I gave it to her,
looked her right in the eye and said,
here you go.

723
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:11.310
Here's my gift to you that will make my life better because you become more of

724
00:46:11.311 --> 00:46:15.300
the person that I want you to be.
Did that make sense?

725
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:20.250
Anyways,
I had an awesome weekend working down the,
uh,

726
00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:24.330
the Improv in Hollywood,
sold out three shows.
And let me tell you something.

727
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.730
It's a small club,
but it's still,

728
00:46:26.731 --> 00:46:30.150
I was very impressed that everybody came up because that's a hard ticket to sell

729
00:46:30.151 --> 00:46:32.220
here in Hollywood.
You know,

730
00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:38.220
when Leonardo Dicaprio's also having a pool party the same fucking night,

731
00:46:38.221 --> 00:46:41.730
do you think anybody wants to come down to the Melrose Improv?
They don't

732
00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:44.850
win.
The fucking

733
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:50.280
corona girls are showing their twats up on Fairfax in Sunday,

734
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:55.890
sunset,
Sunday sunset or whatever that all that Hollywood shit's going on.

735
00:46:56.850 --> 00:47:00.000
So the fact that everybody came down to see me was really awesome.

736
00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:03.870
And even though the Improv spelled my name incorrectly on the Marquee,

737
00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:08.410
B U R R r
Bill Burr,

738
00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:12.780
we'll be performing tonight.
Uh,
I had a great time working out my new hour,

739
00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:16.140
some hiccups here or there and,
uh,

740
00:47:16.141 --> 00:47:19.150
all the shows went great except for the late show Saturday night.
Uh,

741
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.680
it was kind hit a weird show where there was this woman talking.

742
00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:26.130
This lady was rubbing it,

743
00:47:26.131 --> 00:47:30.880
running her fucking mouth as they do.
You know,
they can't help it.

744
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:32.200
They're emotional.

745
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.760
Do you know women say like twice as many words a day as men.

746
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:39.310
What you fucking Dick?
I didn't notice.

747
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:42.580
Do you think none of us didn't notice?
You know,

748
00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:46.330
just cause you're saying twice as many words during the course of the day

749
00:47:46.331 --> 00:47:50.890
doesn't mean you're really saying anything.
You know,

750
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:54.610
you ever been hanging out with people and everybody's running their mouths about

751
00:47:54.611 --> 00:47:56.740
how to solve a fucking problem and this,

752
00:47:56.741 --> 00:47:59.800
that quiet person in the corner and like when three words,

753
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:04.390
they sum up what the fuck we should be doing this because you're running your

754
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.520
Yap doesn't mean you say anything.

755
00:48:06.521 --> 00:48:10.120
Just cause all you broads out there have so fucking afraid of silence,

756
00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:12.070
you know,

757
00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:16.540
because your clock is ticking or whatever the hell's going on with your fucking

758
00:48:16.541 --> 00:48:19.300
bodies.
Jesus Christ.

759
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:24.340
Do you fucking cycles.

760
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:31.870
Sorry,
I don't know why I'm being so ignorant right now.
I respect women,
you know,

761
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:36.700
and their wounds and their ability though to a,
you know,
take a load,

762
00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:38.621
you know,

763
00:48:38.621 --> 00:48:43.621
and then fucking walk around as it gets created with no effort on their part

764
00:48:43.871 --> 00:48:46.060
whatsoever.
You know,

765
00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.380
me shooting the load really doesn't take any fucking effort,
you know,

766
00:48:50.381 --> 00:48:52.990
a couple of strokes back and forth.
I'm a good two minute man.

767
00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:58.060
Does that feel good?
Ah,
that's it.
That's my game.
Deal with it.

768
00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:02.950
You've got to focus.
This is really disgusting.

769
00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:06.880
I usually don't do sex jokes like that.
A lot of bodily fluids so far.

770
00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:11.650
But once again,
I'm doing,
I'm doing this,
uh,
this part.
Oh No,
no,
no.
Stay on target.

771
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:16.570
Stay on fucking stay on.
Stay focused here.
I was going to talk about that.
Um,

772
00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:20.560
the,
uh,
the third show.
So I'm doing my show and you know,

773
00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:24.280
it's going great and I hear this yammering in the law,
you know,

774
00:49:24.281 --> 00:49:26.410
out of my left ear and I look over and Lo and behold,

775
00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:29.980
it's some woman talking to this other woman.
And I said,
hey,
hey.

776
00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:35.290
And she was so involved in a conversation that I,

777
00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:38.310
she couldn't even hear me,
you know,

778
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.590
standing 10 feet away with a spotlight and a microphone.

779
00:49:41.591 --> 00:49:45.820
She couldn't hear me say alone.
Hey Man,
man,

780
00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:50.170
yes you ma'am please.
Huh?
Can you listen to me?
Thank you.

781
00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:56.110
So she shuts up.
I do my shit.
And then like five minutes later,

782
00:49:56.111 --> 00:49:59.080
I dunno what she did,
she started heckling me.
And by the way,

783
00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:04.290
when the crowd gives me shit that's heckling when I give them shit,

784
00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:08.770
I'm not heckling,
there's like four people came up to me this weekend.

785
00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:11.950
I like how you heckled that woman in the audience.

786
00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:15.580
Heckling is what an audience member does.

787
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:19.960
We'll have the definition up on the [inaudible] podcast.com where you can get

788
00:50:19.961 --> 00:50:23.080
all your little tidbits,
your little fucking,
uh,

789
00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:27.400
Bacon bits off of the podcast if you new to the podcast needed.
And if I,

790
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:30.860
if I throw out references that you don't understand and when I recommend youtube

791
00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:32.990
videos and you're like,
Jesus Christ,

792
00:50:32.991 --> 00:50:36.950
do I have to go to youtube and I have to look up all these videos?

793
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:41.240
Wouldn't it be great if there was a webpage that just had all the videos that he

794
00:50:41.241 --> 00:50:45.770
recommended and pictures of the references that he made in links to shit that he

795
00:50:45.771 --> 00:50:46.604
talked to,

796
00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:50.990
rather than me having to make a list on posted after posted in my fucking

797
00:50:50.991 --> 00:50:53.630
cubicle.
Well we got that for

798
00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:59.270
you@wwwdotthemmpodcast.com you go there,
you'll see all of this shit.

799
00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:03.680
And I described that so,
well I totally forgot what the fuck I was talking about.

800
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:06.950
Oh,
that's right.
A definition of a heckling.

801
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:12.830
Heckling is what somebody in the crowd does to a performer.
All right?

802
00:51:12.831 --> 00:51:15.590
There's all different kinds of heckles.
There's,

803
00:51:15.591 --> 00:51:19.010
you could be heckling even saying something nice fucking up my rhythm.

804
00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:24.470
I was walking down the street the other day.
Oh,
I've done that.
I love streets.

805
00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.830
You know,
that's a form of heckling.

806
00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.650
It's one of the hardest hecklers to deal with.
All right.

807
00:51:30.651 --> 00:51:34.100
But when I'm trashing someone in the crowd,
I'm just doing crowd work,

808
00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:38.990
doing crowd work.
If they didn't say anything,
hey,
where are you from?

809
00:51:38.991 --> 00:51:41.450
That's playing with the crowd.
But it is not heckling.

810
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:46.100
So stop coming up to me at the end of my show is going,

811
00:51:46.101 --> 00:51:50.900
I like the way you heckled that guy in the crowd.
How exactly did I do that?

812
00:51:50.901 --> 00:51:54.920
Did I sit in the audience and then put the audience on fucking stage.

813
00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:58.160
All right bill.
We got it.
You made your point.
Okay.
You're right.
You're right.

814
00:51:58.161 --> 00:52:03.140
Sorry.
So anyways,
um,
anyway,
she like after I said,

815
00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:05.900
ma'am,
ma'am,
ma'am,
hello,
I'm trying to do my act here.

816
00:52:05.901 --> 00:52:10.430
I got back into my act like five,
six,
five or six seconds later,
um,

817
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:15.830
she yelled something at me,
something,
some sort of non sequitur.
Oh,
I said,

818
00:52:15.831 --> 00:52:20.750
I gotta take my dog to the dog whisperer.
And she goes,
should I go?

819
00:52:20.751 --> 00:52:23.660
What?
She goes,
you said dog.
Whisperers I went,
Shit.

820
00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:27.260
And it was just dead silence.
I was like,
what?

821
00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:30.620
And I was literally looking at her like,
does this,
does this person,

822
00:52:30.621 --> 00:52:34.070
is this person mentally challenged before I go with,

823
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:36.080
cause you've got to make that assessment because you don't want to do that,

824
00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:40.010
you know?
So,
uh,
I dunno,
you know,

825
00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:43.640
what end up happening was she had a major issue with the fact that I called her

826
00:52:43.641 --> 00:52:46.340
ma'am.
You know,

827
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:52.690
which brings up a very interesting point in your life is where a woman goes from

828
00:52:53.361 --> 00:52:54.770
young lady to a man.

829
00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:58.630
And when a guy goes from young man to assert,

830
00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:02.560
you guys all remember the first time somebody called you sir or Ma'am and you

831
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:04.760
were like,
Jesus Christ,
I'm fucking old.

832
00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:08.330
But after a while you deal with it and you'll start,
you forget.

833
00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:10.760
You forget that people are even saying that.

834
00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:14.540
Especially cause most of the time nowadays when someone's calling you sir or

835
00:53:14.541 --> 00:53:17.750
ma'am,
it's some Douche on the phone that you're trying to get to help you,

836
00:53:17.751 --> 00:53:22.160
but they can help you.
Yes.
I'm sorry sir.
I understand sir.
Yes.

837
00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:25.260
Well there's nothing I can do sir.
Ma'Am,
ma'am,

838
00:53:25.261 --> 00:53:27.150
I'm trying to help you but I'm sorry.

839
00:53:27.151 --> 00:53:29.670
I don't know why they transferred you to me ma'am.

840
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.900
And you're just more pissed off about the subject.
But there is that moment.

841
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:37.230
The first time somebody calls you sir,
or ma'am,
which I get,

842
00:53:37.231 --> 00:53:38.640
but if you saw this lady,

843
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:43.410
she was at least fucking eight years into being a man,

844
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:49.740
you know.
In fact,
a good friend of mine watching the show,

845
00:53:49.741 --> 00:53:53.730
Neil Brennan was standing back at the back of the room and after the show he

846
00:53:53.731 --> 00:53:58.380
goes,
she was so a ma'am,
you know,
and she was,

847
00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:03.030
she looked like that girl who played Nelly on little house in the prairie.

848
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:07.440
Remember that?
The 13 year old cunt with a fucking,
uh,

849
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:12.470
Cindy Brady haircut it 15 and she was just a cunt,

850
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:14.850
the entire fucking series.

851
00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:19.500
We'll just imagine if that cunt was now fucking like,
I mean,

852
00:54:19.501 --> 00:54:24.120
this girl was like 36,
37,
easy,
easy.
You know,

853
00:54:24.121 --> 00:54:25.050
she already had,
you know,

854
00:54:25.051 --> 00:54:28.980
when you start getting the job roles is that whatever that you're,

855
00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:32.430
it's not your chin,
they call it a double chin,
but it's really,

856
00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:35.760
it's the flesh between Your Chin and your Adam's apple.

857
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.460
It starts to sag a little bit.
Gravity has been pulling on it.

858
00:54:38.461 --> 00:54:43.080
She had that and about two tons of fucking blush on her face.

859
00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:48.990
And,
um,
oh,
she was such a,
you know,
she's Douche bag of the week.

860
00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:52.230
She was really douche bag of the week.
She just kept running her mouth.

861
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.830
And um,
I know I've got a thing.
Why'd I tried?

862
00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:59.760
This is hilarious after everything I just said this week on the podcast so far,

863
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.500
I try not to attack a,
there's a few things I don't do.
I don't,

864
00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:06.360
I don't make fun of mentally challenged people.
You know,

865
00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:08.280
I did that a couple times in my career,

866
00:55:08.281 --> 00:55:11.430
did not go well and I felt like an asshole afterwards.

867
00:55:11.431 --> 00:55:14.790
So I cut that out and uh,
you know,

868
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.120
I don't go after women's looks.
That's usually,

869
00:55:18.121 --> 00:55:23.121
that's usually a last resort because a,

870
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:25.680
I don't know,
it just,
it just,
you know,
this,
believe it or not,

871
00:55:25.681 --> 00:55:27.120
there's certain things that are too mean,

872
00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:31.860
but on the podcast evidentaly I can fucking go off on women.
Is that what it is,

873
00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:35.010
Bill?
I'm trying to think of all the shit I said in the last 12 minutes.

874
00:55:35.011 --> 00:55:37.800
I'm sure I'm being totally fucking hypocritical right now,
but whatever,

875
00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:42.240
it's my podcast.
Oh,
speaking of that shit,

876
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:47.040
my girl was watching one of these dumb ass fucking shows this week.
You know,

877
00:55:47.041 --> 00:55:51.300
those shows the,
uh,
the real fucking horny housewives of fucking Toledo,

878
00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:53.210
you know,

879
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:57.750
they've got their faces fucking Yank back and that desperately trying not to be

880
00:55:57.751 --> 00:56:01.200
their age for whatever fucking reason,

881
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:05.580
for whatever reason.
You know,
why can't they have them looking like moms,

882
00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:07.590
you know,

883
00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:12.420
so you can actually relax and enjoy the show and look at someone who's 42,

884
00:56:12.421 --> 00:56:16.680
who looks 42 and they're happy and they're in some sort of a stable

885
00:56:16.681 --> 00:56:19.440
relationship.
Rather than show in these cunts,

886
00:56:19.441 --> 00:56:23.890
go into these fucking art shows and sipping wine.

887
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:29.190
Is that doing squats up against a fucking refrigerator desperately trying to

888
00:56:30.401 --> 00:56:35.260
hold onto their youth.
It's fucking over lady.
You got like three kids relax.

889
00:56:35.261 --> 00:56:39.460
I'm not saying become disgustingly out of shape,
so you have heart disease,

890
00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:44.950
but to sit there and go to the mall and at your age and by the latest,

891
00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:48.400
the same fucking genes that the kids are wearing,

892
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:54.010
you look ridiculous.
You look ridiculous.
Whole fucking,

893
00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:57.790
uh,
what is it,
cougars?
Is that what they call them?

894
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:02.260
You know,
it's sad the same way.

895
00:57:02.261 --> 00:57:06.280
It's sad when you see a fucking older guy doing the same shit hitting on fucking

896
00:57:06.281 --> 00:57:10.090
younger girls.
It's sad.
But of course when women do it,
it's empowering.

897
00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:15.500
Anything they do,
it's fucking empowering the exact same shit.
We do all this,

898
00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:16.570
you know,
we're sad.

899
00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:21.660
We're sitting at Hooters and we're fucking pathetic and everybody goes off

900
00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.900
saying,
I'll,
you know,
fucking said our lifestyle.
A woman does it.

901
00:57:25.901 --> 00:57:29.170
They can make a goddamn series of it.
Why can't you know that Cougar town,

902
00:57:29.171 --> 00:57:30.550
when they make dirty old man town

903
00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.200
and they do it in the fucking guy would be,

904
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:38.550
would be considered a fucking creep and a woman does it for,

905
00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:42.160
I guess it's considered an accomplishment because guys are so visually
motivated.

906
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:46.680
They're like,
wow,
an old bag.
Like you can still get a young guy guys,

907
00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:51.220
good for you.
Good for you.
You're with your lizard tits.

908
00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:57.050
I'm see.
There you go.
Being hypocritical again.
Sorry.
So,
uh,
anyway,

909
00:57:57.051 --> 00:57:58.300
she's Douche bag of the weekend.

910
00:57:58.330 --> 00:58:02.350
I actually was one of the few times I ever had somebody kicked out,
you know,

911
00:58:02.351 --> 00:58:04.790
the bouncer came over at the first,
I was like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

912
00:58:04.791 --> 00:58:08.590
I'm kind of enjoying this.
I like a little bit of back and forth and um,

913
00:58:08.591 --> 00:58:11.290
I thought we were going to get to some sort of resolution,

914
00:58:11.291 --> 00:58:14.680
but like by the fifth time I went back and forth with her,
the whole crowd,

915
00:58:14.681 --> 00:58:19.360
they weren't laughing.
They just went,
Oh God,
shut up.
So then that becomes like,

916
00:58:19.361 --> 00:58:20.194
okay,

917
00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:25.990
now people aren't getting their money's worth and that's gonna Affect my
fucking,

918
00:58:25.991 --> 00:58:29.890
you know,
career.
So you got to go.
So they kicked her out,

919
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.390
they kicked her out and I'm sure she drove home feeling like it was some sort of

920
00:58:34.391 --> 00:58:38.460
victory.
See that he kicked me out because he couldn't deal with me.
Ha Ha.

921
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:43.490
That's her playing with their chins.
Um,
it's like,
no,
if he just,

922
00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:46.540
you just sort of a content,
everyone wants you to leave.

923
00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:49.120
You don't want to say cut too much more on this podcast.

924
00:58:49.121 --> 00:58:51.970
I've noticed that and all of a sudden I've made up for it in the last three

925
00:58:51.971 --> 00:58:55.120
minutes,
made up for the last 26 podcasts.

926
00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:00.430
Um,
so anyways,
what else?
Oh Jesus.
Let's delve into it.

927
00:59:00.431 --> 00:59:05.431
The Boston Celtics lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in seven games.

928
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.810
Man,
it was fucking brutal.
Uh,
one of the ugliest seven,
uh,

929
00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:13.380
game sevens I've ever seen.
And
um,

930
00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:18.370
if you really look at the series in general,
it was a pretty ugly scene,

931
00:59:19.090 --> 00:59:22.460
the whole fucking series.
And uh,

932
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:26.270
I don't remember last week when I was like,
you know,
we're in a good spot,

933
00:59:26.271 --> 00:59:30.560
but I can't,
I can't get any read on this series because it was so fucked.

934
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:35.270
So the only pattern I could see was the Celtics were old.

935
00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:37.220
So when they flew out for game one,

936
00:59:37.221 --> 00:59:39.290
they were tired and they got the shit kicked out of them.

937
00:59:39.291 --> 00:59:42.500
They get a good night's sleep.
They win game two.
All right.

938
00:59:42.501 --> 00:59:45.710
They fly back to Boston,
they're tired again.
They lose the game,

939
00:59:46.790 --> 00:59:48.500
get a good night's sleep to come back.

940
00:59:48.501 --> 00:59:53.180
They wouldn't games four and five fly out to la.
They're tired again.

941
00:59:53.181 --> 00:59:57.020
They get their fucking asses kicked,
they get a good night's sleep.

942
00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:01.130
I'm thinking they're going to win game seven.
And uh,

943
01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:03.740
they did not,
unfortunately.
I just think,
you know,

944
01:00:03.741 --> 01:00:07.850
Kendrick Perkins that was just too much for us to lose,

945
01:00:07.851 --> 01:00:11.210
took on too much water and uh,
the Lakers were just younger,

946
01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:15.440
more talented and uh,
you know,

947
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.010
when they get 13 of the first 15 fucking rebounds,

948
01:00:19.011 --> 01:00:22.970
I don't know how we were still winning that game,
but um,

949
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:25.880
you know,
it was definitely brutal.

950
01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.810
It was fucking brutal and as much respect as I had for Pau Gasol,

951
01:00:29.811 --> 01:00:33.980
I started the fucking hate him again.
You know,
the fucking asshole man.

952
01:00:33.981 --> 01:00:37.190
It's like he,
before he even drives to the hoop,

953
01:00:37.191 --> 01:00:38.690
he already has a look on his face.

954
01:00:38.691 --> 01:00:42.560
Like he's getting fouled and the way he fucking flops around.

955
01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.120
I was joking around this weekend,

956
01:00:44.121 --> 01:00:48.710
you have a drive by some shitty car wash and they have like that celery stock

957
01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:52.130
fucking looking thing.
It looks like a guy and they,

958
01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:55.490
and they shoot air up into it and it's fucking arms flap all around.

959
01:00:55.491 --> 01:01:00.110
That's what the power Gasol looks like going into the fucking hoop.
And I'm,

960
01:01:00.111 --> 01:01:01.400
and I got to tell you something,
you know,

961
01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:05.450
I'm not taking anything away from the Lakers because I just think out of all

962
01:01:05.451 --> 01:01:06.530
four major sports,

963
01:01:06.531 --> 01:01:10.760
the officiating in the NBA is absolutely fucking horrific.

964
01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.640
To the point I've been saying this forever,

965
01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:18.260
that the refs literally dictate the pace of the game.
You know,

966
01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:21.410
it used to be the point guards when they wanted to speed it up and slow it down

967
01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:26.210
or whatever.
Guys on either team would do things.
The point guards,
they would,

968
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:30.590
they'd pick it up or slow it down.
Now it's still refs.
Now it's the Reps.
Oh,

969
01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:35.120
let's let him play first half.
We fucking tackle cobia one play.

970
01:01:35.121 --> 01:01:38.390
They let it go.
I'm like,
that's exactly how you should be calling this game.

971
01:01:38.391 --> 01:01:39.770
It's game seven.
Let them go.

972
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:43.640
And then when it really fucking counted in the fourth quarter,

973
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:47.300
they would just run it down the core with their whistles in their miles.

974
01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:51.050
And I don't want to be country here,
but what the fuck?

975
01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:53.923
You know what I mean?

976
01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:58.160
None of the Lakers were falling people and then all that bullshit with the

977
01:01:58.161 --> 01:02:00.920
relationship.
I mean,
I get it.
Kobi drives into Rashid,

978
01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:02.990
Kobe's the face of the league.
I get it.

979
01:02:02.991 --> 01:02:07.100
He's going to get the call the same way Tom Brady gets the calls the same way

980
01:02:07.101 --> 01:02:10.550
Jordan gets the calls.
I get that and I,
you know,

981
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
but if Rasheed Wallace is standing sideways with his arms down by his side and

982
01:02:16.491 --> 01:02:20.850
he's not moving,
it fucking jumps into him.

983
01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:26.280
I get the no call because it's Colby and he gets to superstar rule.

984
01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:30.570
But if you're going to call a foul that's fucking offensive to put Coby on the

985
01:02:30.571 --> 01:02:34.470
line on a horse shit call like that during game seven,
man.

986
01:02:34.471 --> 01:02:37.300
That's what the fucking reps,
and I'm not shitting on the Lakers,

987
01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.490
I'm not taking this away from him,

988
01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.050
but I fucking hate the NBA reps get out of the Goddamn way.

989
01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:47.340
Let him play.
So fucking annoying.

990
01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:51.630
Go all the way to game seven and it's decided on penalty shots.

991
01:02:51.631 --> 01:02:56.520
It's like that fucking World Cup soccer
such as,
you know,

992
01:02:56.521 --> 01:02:59.070
I've,
I've gone back to saying it's a stupid fucking sport.

993
01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:04.220
Can somebody explain to me the offsides and soccer why you're not allowed to get

994
01:03:06.151 --> 01:03:10.920
behind the defender.
That defeats the fucking purpose of every sport.

995
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:13.590
I understand.
Like,
you know,

996
01:03:13.591 --> 01:03:17.550
one guy just can't run down the field to be hanging down by the other guys net.

997
01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:20.160
I get that.
But the way the dif,

998
01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:24.780
the defense is the off sideline that basically moves down the field and you'll

999
01:03:24.781 --> 01:03:28.320
see an offensive players start to run by it and the defensive player just stops

1000
01:03:28.321 --> 01:03:29.154
running.

1001
01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:34.320
So then what the offensive player has to stop running because the defensive guys

1002
01:03:34.321 --> 01:03:38.790
out of fucking position,
it's,
it's no,
no wonder you have one to nothing games,

1003
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.660
Neil Neal.
What a contest.

1004
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:46.770
Jesus Christ in those fucking idiots down there blowing those,

1005
01:03:46.771 --> 01:03:51.420
those horns that sound like mosquitoes for the whole fucking game.
I haven't won.

1006
01:03:51.421 --> 01:03:54.360
I'm going to get involved in the second real reason why I haven't gotten into it

1007
01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:58.080
was because I was watching,
I was watching the Lakers,

1008
01:03:58.081 --> 01:04:02.940
a Celtics and uh,
you know,
whatever.
Congratulations.

1009
01:04:02.941 --> 01:04:06.900
Lakers fans,
you know,
whatever.
God bless you.
I'm past the hate.

1010
01:04:06.901 --> 01:04:10.500
I don't do that shit.
But,
uh,
you know,
and that was a hell of a celebration too,

1011
01:04:10.501 --> 01:04:13.230
that you guys had,
you know,
that was awesome.
You win a championship.
Yeah.

1012
01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.420
Let's go tip over a car.
Ah,

1013
01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:20.070
take that you fucking automobile talking shit.
The whole series.

1014
01:04:20.071 --> 01:04:24.120
Now what do you got to say?
Huh?
Store front window.

1015
01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.500
I didn't think so.

1016
01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:31.110
That was what really surprised me is the classless level of fans out here.

1017
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:35.190
I don't get it.
It's so bizarre.
We have the,
uh,

1018
01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:39.420
the court side Laker fans,
which is the highest douchebag factor,

1019
01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:42.090
even more so than the Boston fans.

1020
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:46.670
The few who dress up like leprechauns that make me want to hang myself.
Um,

1021
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:50.700
that douchebag factor,
everybody went there.
Ashton Kutcher,

1022
01:04:50.701 --> 01:04:55.530
bing Crosby hats on
and their rockstar jewelry.

1023
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:59.490
Did you see that one game?
I think it was game seven when they won and they won.

1024
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.030
They were cutting to a,
the three guys announcing the game Van Gundy,
uh,

1025
01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:09.300
Mark Jackson and a fucking,
whatever the other guy's name was.
And uh,

1026
01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:13.590
that fucking like 48 year old guy holding his gold jewelry.

1027
01:05:13.591 --> 01:05:16.500
I think he had like a Laker pendant.
You know,

1028
01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.230
like he's 21,
the whole fucking thing was ridiculous,

1029
01:05:20.231 --> 01:05:22.630
but I don't get how you have like around the court,

1030
01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:24.070
you've got these fucking fans.

1031
01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:29.350
They show up like halfway through the second quarter that are on their cell

1032
01:05:29.351 --> 01:05:32.650
phones and shit.
Text messaging.
Like,
did you see Courtney Cox,

1033
01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:35.290
Cox sitting us speaking a Cougar town sitting court side.

1034
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:39.130
She looked like she was waiting to get her fucking nails done.
No emotion.

1035
01:05:39.131 --> 01:05:41.530
Just sitting there in our leather pants.

1036
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:48.810
So it really looks like there's not a lot of passion or at least on the side

1037
01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:51.610
core behind under the hoop you can start to get real Laker fans.

1038
01:05:51.611 --> 01:05:55.720
But then like up top,
like I don't understand those people.
Those people take it.

1039
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:58.480
I think they're making up for the,
uh,

1040
01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:04.260
who gives a fuck attitude of like the cast of whatever new hits.

1041
01:06:04.331 --> 01:06:07.810
Sit-Com got the fucking court side seats and they start tipping over shit.

1042
01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:13.210
I Dunno.
It's like,
what are you Canadian fans?

1043
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:18.310
I gotta be honest with you for as much shit as they give Philly.

1044
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.780
Philadelphia fans,
you know they,
they throw,
they throw a,

1045
01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:25.990
they threw snowballs at Santa Claus.
Oh yeah.

1046
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:28.750
Do they tip over a police car and light it on fire?

1047
01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.670
Did you see that shit after they won?
That's what kills me.

1048
01:06:33.671 --> 01:06:36.130
They won and it looked like fucking Tiananmen Square.

1049
01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:41.950
The only time I ever saw that in Boston was after we broke an 86 year curse and

1050
01:06:41.951 --> 01:06:43.600
you knew some shit was going to go down.

1051
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:49.120
You knew it that much fucking rage.
But they want it two years ago.

1052
01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:52.930
You see that?
I'm justifying when we act like Douche bags,

1053
01:06:52.931 --> 01:06:55.960
but when we win a basketball championship,
we don't freak out.

1054
01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:01.510
I don't know.
I gotta be honest with you.
Sports out here,
it's,
it's not fun.

1055
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:03.333
Like back east,

1056
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:06.490
there's a lot of shit talk and there's a lot of ball breaking and believe me,

1057
01:07:06.491 --> 01:07:07.960
I took a ton of Shit in New York,

1058
01:07:07.961 --> 01:07:12.430
but there was an element of fun with the misery.
But out here it's,

1059
01:07:12.490 --> 01:07:16.960
it's not fun.
You go to games out here,
you know,
you go to a game in Philly like,

1060
01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:21.400
okay,
someone's going to dump a beer on me,
maybe I'll get puked on,
you know,

1061
01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:25.180
you come out here,
you're like,
you know,
I think I'm going to get stabbed.

1062
01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:31.600
And I had that experience at a fucking charger game at a,

1063
01:07:31.601 --> 01:07:36.210
at an angel's game.
And uh,
actually not at a Lakers game,
just at a charge.

1064
01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:41.170
Is Lakers,
Anna Dodger's game.
And um,
you know,
I dunno.
I mean granted,

1065
01:07:41.171 --> 01:07:41.500
the,

1066
01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:45.070
the common denominator in all three of those is the fact that I went to a game,

1067
01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:49.540
but whatever I talk,
shit,
I get a little drunk,
I talk shit,
Talk Shit back to me,

1068
01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:54.040
you know,
so now what we're supposed to be delivered,
but you know,

1069
01:07:54.041 --> 01:07:56.560
to take it to the level that you're going to fucking stab me.

1070
01:07:58.330 --> 01:08:01.960
I don't fucking know,
Eh.
Right.
Let's get on.
And then I'd like an asshole.

1071
01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:04.930
I sat there and I watched the,
the post game,

1072
01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:10.260
the Lakers post game where they had Michael Cooper and some chick from the WWE

1073
01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.640
NBA,
you know,

1074
01:08:12.641 --> 01:08:16.220
you would think with all the Great Lakers that they could get another fucking

1075
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.300
<v 0>Laker.
Great.</v>

1076
01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:19.320
<v 8>They wanted a former player,</v>

1077
01:08:19.321 --> 01:08:24.321
but I get it that trying to hype the fucking Wnb a so this fucking twat comes on

1078
01:08:24.631 --> 01:08:25.464
there,

1079
01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:26.413
<v 0>right?</v>

1080
01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:31.030
<v 8>And starts the WNB.
A chicken starts trashing Kevin Garnett,</v>

1081
01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:35.870
which is such the classic country thing to do where it's like,
first of all,

1082
01:08:35.871 --> 01:08:36.500
sweetheart,

1083
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.830
you are on the edge of your seat and didn't know the Lakers were gonna win this

1084
01:08:39.831 --> 01:08:43.040
series until there was about 41 seconds left and now that you,

1085
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:46.310
one you're going to act like it was in the bag and she's,
she was trash.

1086
01:08:46.311 --> 01:08:49.450
And Kevin Garnett,
right?
Kicking him when he's down,

1087
01:08:49.451 --> 01:08:53.980
the guy comes off major knee surgery,
his fucking arm was jacked up.

1088
01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:58.240
He never bitched,
never made any excuses,
never responded.

1089
01:08:58.241 --> 01:09:03.060
When Pau Gasol said he's lost a step,
never said shit and this shit goes,

1090
01:09:03.061 --> 01:09:07.980
the big ticket should have called them the big coupon
enough,

1091
01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:12.220
Katie.
Well,
I want a fucking classic.
It's just unbelievable.

1092
01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:17.260
So out of a fellow athlete,
you're going to do that.
I could see,
you know,
even,

1093
01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:22.780
uh,
a former NBA player maybe,
but a WNB a play.

1094
01:09:22.781 --> 01:09:27.350
I was joking about that shit all this weekend.
WNB a really,

1095
01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:32.150
you're going to talk shit about Kevin Garnett.
Fuck it.
Yeah.

1096
01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:35.540
What do you get your Wnb a,
you've got to have a fucking bake sale at half time.

1097
01:09:35.541 --> 01:09:39.630
See a check doesn't bounce.
I Dunno.
It was really,

1098
01:09:39.631 --> 01:09:44.490
I was really surprised that the classless level of behavior with the fucking

1099
01:09:44.491 --> 01:09:46.620
people trash and debt,
the downtown,

1100
01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:52.540
her talk and Shit and even Michael Cooper still being like a cunt where it's

1101
01:09:53.151 --> 01:09:53.984
like you won,

1102
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:57.410
you don't have to think is it's really easy to be classy when you win.

1103
01:09:58.210 --> 01:10:00.130
<v 0>And uh,
they couldn't even do that.</v>

1104
01:10:00.131 --> 01:10:02.290
So I kind of lost an element of respect for the Lakers,

1105
01:10:02.291 --> 01:10:06.070
but I'm sure they don't give a fuck.
But,
uh,
um,
I don't know.

1106
01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.430
But I'm actually proud of the Celtics because if you looked at it on paper,

1107
01:10:09.431 --> 01:10:11.410
we should have got absolutely destroyed.

1108
01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:15.640
And somehow it went seven games and I dunno,

1109
01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:18.460
I don't know how the fuck we ended up losing it.
In the end.
We will actually,

1110
01:10:18.461 --> 01:10:23.050
we know what the lake has made a great adjustment.
MMM.
What's his face,
Ron?

1111
01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:27.570
Our tests when he started shutting down Paul Pierce and no one else could step

1112
01:10:27.571 --> 01:10:30.450
it up.
I thought that they made a great adjustment and uh,

1113
01:10:30.451 --> 01:10:35.060
we couldn't overcome it and then they went on like that fucking 13 zero run.

1114
01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:40.430
And uh,
that was it.
And what really kills me as a Celtic fan is that Coby shit,

1115
01:10:40.431 --> 01:10:43.240
the bed shit,
the bed,

1116
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:49.710
like we're talking about a John Starks level in a game seven.
Okay.

1117
01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.153
And once again,

1118
01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:54.850
I was going to feel vindicated the same way I did with Peyton manning when

1119
01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:57.790
everyone was saying you're arguably looking at the greatest quarterback of all

1120
01:10:57.791 --> 01:11:00.550
time.
Same thing with Coby Bryan.
All right.

1121
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:06.440
He's fucking guys who keep trying to say,
compare him to Michael Jordan.
He's not.

1122
01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:13.210
Okay.
Who's the second guy to go to the moon.
Does anybody?

1123
01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:14.340
Exactly.

1124
01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:18.720
<v 8>Cause no one gives a fuck.
Did a second guy go to the moon?</v>

1125
01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:23.280
Did we ever go to the moon?
That was a bad example.
You know,

1126
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:27.120
who's the second guy who made a light bulb work?
Nobody knows.

1127
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:32.990
Just be you doing something that's already fucking been done by somebody great

1128
01:11:33.811 --> 01:11:36.000
does not make you on the same level of great.

1129
01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.090
It's when you do something great that's never been done before.

1130
01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:42.750
That's what separates you.
Okay?
I'm not going to go into this fucking rant again,

1131
01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:47.400
but Coby Bryan Shit,
the fucking bed and that fucking Mark Jackson,

1132
01:11:47.401 --> 01:11:51.510
Jesus Christ,
he's got a poster,
a Colby over his bed.

1133
01:11:53.130 --> 01:11:53.963
At one point,

1134
01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:59.180
Colby was too for 19 in game seven two four 19 it's somebody for fucking van

1135
01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:02.760
Gundy brings it up when you get fucking Jackson's like,
yeah,

1136
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:07.680
but he's got 12 big rebounds,
but guy,
he runs down the court.

1137
01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:09.630
I love the shape of his calves.

1138
01:12:12.190 --> 01:12:14.340
He shit the bed Pagasa all kind of shit.

1139
01:12:14.341 --> 01:12:16.710
The bed to my son's missing all those foul shots,

1140
01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:21.720
that bearded ballerina with his fucking fundamental European game.

1141
01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:26.730
You don't miss those,
but it was game seven.
He bitched up a little bit,
you know,

1142
01:12:26.731 --> 01:12:28.230
but you need a little bit of luck to win it.

1143
01:12:28.231 --> 01:12:31.770
And I think a Rashid go into same way the Celtics,

1144
01:12:31.771 --> 01:12:34.620
we got lucky in 2008 when uh,
when buying them was up,

1145
01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:37.980
you need a little bit of luck and the Lakers had it.
God Damn it.

1146
01:12:37.981 --> 01:12:42.360
And they want another one and you know,
they're up to fucking 16 championships.

1147
01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:47.760
The franchises and Laker fans can stand hand in hand with another man from

1148
01:12:47.761 --> 01:12:52.761
Minnesota and say we together have 16 or as in past.

1149
01:12:52.881 --> 01:12:57.360
And we can stand like men on our own and said,
we got 17 all right fuckers,

1150
01:12:57.930 --> 01:13:01.770
you fucking cunts.
Oh God,
I'm so pissed.
Jesus Christ.

1151
01:13:01.771 --> 01:13:03.630
This was really rushed to watch baseball.

1152
01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:05.220
I don't know why I tapped out from baseball.

1153
01:13:05.221 --> 01:13:07.290
I watch the Bruins lose four games in a row,

1154
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:09.030
have to be an up three games to none.

1155
01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:13.440
And then I watched this lose a seven game fucking heartbreaker to the Goddamn

1156
01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:16.380
Lakers.
I was so hoping we were going to drink champagne.
Jesus Christ.

1157
01:13:16.381 --> 01:13:18.690
What were you fucking Laker fans do?
If you lost,

1158
01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:23.940
burned down the staples center,
you have to go back to the fucking forum.

1159
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:26.490
That would actually be better.
I like to form better.

1160
01:13:26.491 --> 01:13:30.030
If you guys ever been to the form,
he got to go out there.
It's legendary,

1161
01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:35.580
legendary.
You come in there,
you can,
you just can see the old showtime Lakers.

1162
01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:40.260
You know,
you can see all the whores lining up waiting to fuck magic.

1163
01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.200
He used to get head right on the bench.

1164
01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:46.200
It's back when the NBA was great and they'd let you play.

1165
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:50.640
And the fucking players,
we get blown right on the bench.
There was no WNB NBA.

1166
01:13:50.641 --> 01:13:55.290
Those bitches were on their knees blow in the star players in the NBA,

1167
01:13:55.291 --> 01:13:59.880
check it out.
It's all up on youtube if you don't believe me.
So,
uh,

1168
01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:05.460
so I got a couple of predictions I ever,
um,
the same way,
uh,

1169
01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:09.330
how the steroid case,
um,

1170
01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.040
started off small and became,

1171
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:15.220
I think that the NBA has a major problem with their fucking officiating.

1172
01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:19.340
All right?
And once again,
I'm not making excuses.
I gave it up to the Lakers.

1173
01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.390
You're younger and you're more talented,
you deserve that.

1174
01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:24.520
You clamped down on defense.
Okay,
we good?
Can I make this point?

1175
01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:29.860
There's something going on.
I don't know what,
I'm not on the inside,

1176
01:14:29.861 --> 01:14:34.810
but remember I said that there is something going on with those officials there

1177
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:35.561
either.
You know,

1178
01:14:35.561 --> 01:14:40.561
they had that one guy who got busted for having mob ties and somebody claims

1179
01:14:41.981 --> 01:14:45.130
somebody at the Improv last night was trying to tell me and I obviously I can't

1180
01:14:45.131 --> 01:14:46.690
back this up like most of my shit,

1181
01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:52.050
but they were trying to claim that some gamblers have been calling this guy in

1182
01:14:54.611 --> 01:14:55.444
prison,

1183
01:14:55.990 --> 01:15:00.100
Carl and phoning this guy and they'd been asking for gambling tips and he's

1184
01:15:00.190 --> 01:15:01.600
pretty much dead on.

1185
01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:06.280
If you tell them who's playing in what the officiating crew is,

1186
01:15:06.281 --> 01:15:08.080
he can't pick against the spread,

1187
01:15:08.081 --> 01:15:11.800
but he can tell you who the fuck is going to win.
Um,

1188
01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:15.430
just because he knows the personal vendettas they have and you know,

1189
01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:19.390
and if you look at Rashid has been a dick for years.

1190
01:15:19.391 --> 01:15:20.560
The refs fucking hate him.

1191
01:15:20.561 --> 01:15:25.270
That's why when he's standing flat footed sideways and Colby jumps into them,

1192
01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:30.520
it's an offense as a defensive foul.
So,

1193
01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:34.690
and I get it.
It's hard to set your personal shit aside,

1194
01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:40.360
but it was game seven.
You fucking Asshole,
you know?
But anyway,

1195
01:15:40.361 --> 01:15:42.940
I don't know.
I think,
uh,
I think it's a little fixed,

1196
01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:47.500
but it can't be fixed because the Lakers didn't even cover,

1197
01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:50.140
I don't know what's going on,
but there's something weird going on.

1198
01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:53.320
There's a deal at the very least to some new officiating style.

1199
01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:58.180
I think the reps might be finally just fed up with the fact that they only make

1200
01:15:58.181 --> 01:16:02.680
150 grand to fucking run up and down a basketball court,

1201
01:16:02.681 --> 01:16:04.690
which to Uri as a great job.

1202
01:16:04.691 --> 01:16:09.691
But I think they're sick of getting cursed out by 22 year old tattooed

1203
01:16:09.971 --> 01:16:14.410
millionaires.
I think they're tired of it.
And they've decided that,
um,

1204
01:16:15.610 --> 01:16:19.860
I don't know what they decided something,
but I don't know.

1205
01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:23.260
You don't have something,
I don't watch NBA hoop enough nowadays to,
to,

1206
01:16:23.261 --> 01:16:27.340
to really be 100% about that.
But any,

1207
01:16:27.341 --> 01:16:29.650
any hoop fans out there?
Can you,
can you go with me?

1208
01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:32.290
That doesn't seem like there's something weird going on

1209
01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:38.230
that it's the,
the,
it's like even when you watch baseball,

1210
01:16:38.290 --> 01:16:40.300
if somebody has a fucked up strike zone,

1211
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:44.400
it's a consistent strikes on for the most part.
Okay.
He's,
he's,

1212
01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:47.530
he's calling that low on a strike tonight and for nine innings.

1213
01:16:47.531 --> 01:16:51.460
That's what the fucking guy does and as much as it pisses you off your first at

1214
01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:55.420
bat,
now you kind of know the guy's parameters.
But like with the officiating,

1215
01:16:55.421 --> 01:16:57.070
it's like they,
they're letting it go.

1216
01:16:57.250 --> 01:17:01.270
Then they're calling everything and it starting to make me feel like,

1217
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:05.890
because it is a business,
then if one team goes,
goes up by too many points,

1218
01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:10.040
the officials kind of do shit to make sure that stays close so they get that

1219
01:17:10.041 --> 01:17:13.250
advertising money.
I Dunno.

1220
01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.530
Am I just pissed because my team lost.

1221
01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.890
I was saying that shit before when I went to that game when Garnette blew his

1222
01:17:18.891 --> 01:17:23.150
knee out and fucking a Utah that it seemed like something weird was going on.

1223
01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.270
Who knows?
Who knows?

1224
01:17:26.271 --> 01:17:29.720
We'll see what I think next week when I've maybe started to get over this

1225
01:17:29.721 --> 01:17:32.720
fucking loss.
You know,
it's the worst is when you,
when your team's shits the bed,

1226
01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:34.910
like the Bruin stared or if your team

1227
01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:41.660
loses a seven game heartbreaker to your absolute archrival.

1228
01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:46.280
The hardest thing is like you can't watch TV.
You can't watch any sports TV.

1229
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:48.230
Campbell,
I've been watching like the food network.

1230
01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:52.130
I was actually watching a show the other day on a,

1231
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:58.090
on this HD channel that has all this shit with like a bunch of cars and stuff

1232
01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:02.420
like psycho indycars,
my OCD.
Um,

1233
01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:05.660
I've gotten totally into cars and uh,

1234
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:09.920
so I keep going to this channel and they actually had this unbelievable show.

1235
01:18:10.730 --> 01:18:15.730
It was basically about the bird and magics of like marine corps in army snipers

1236
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:22.070
throughout the history of the US military.

1237
01:18:22.071 --> 01:18:26.900
They had the Michael Jordans of snipers and they had this dude,

1238
01:18:26.901 --> 01:18:31.700
man,
it was fucking,
it was the most fascinating God damn show

1239
01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:35.240
I've seen in a long time.

1240
01:18:35.241 --> 01:18:39.230
And I stumbled on it because I didn't want to watch the sports center,
you know,

1241
01:18:39.231 --> 01:18:43.120
the sports and watch sports center and listen to me or you're Celtics didn't get

1242
01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:46.610
it done.
You know,
they use,
you know those things to do and no you didn't do it.

1243
01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:50.960
They didn't go to,
I can't fucking watch that shit.
I know.
I got it.
They lost.

1244
01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:52.963
Um,

1245
01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:56.720
and I also didn't want to watch Colby jump up in the score table and do his one,

1246
01:18:56.721 --> 01:18:58.640
two,
three,
four,
five,
five rings.

1247
01:18:59.330 --> 01:19:02.090
But he really should be doing is counting how many fucking points he had that

1248
01:19:02.091 --> 01:19:06.470
weren't from the foul line.
Sorry,
had to get one more in.
Um,

1249
01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:11.030
so they showed this dude,
like I remember that big battle in Fallujah,

1250
01:19:11.150 --> 01:19:14.480
I guess it was in 2004 if he could fucking believe it was already like six years

1251
01:19:14.481 --> 01:19:15.314
ago.

1252
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:20.470
And there was this marine corps sniper who had like 32 kills in 30 days and they

1253
01:19:22.401 --> 01:19:27.401
were talking about this guy was like shooting through like a softball size hall

1254
01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:34.310
at targets that were like four or 500 yards away.
And it's something,

1255
01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:39.100
again,
accuracy up to 600 yards,
six fucking football fields.
All right,

1256
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:43.580
and you're peeking out from behind the rubble.
I think it's okay.
And then

1257
01:19:45.190 --> 01:19:48.020
you're fucking the back.
It gets blown out.

1258
01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:53.360
And they were talking about what a psychological mind fuck that was.

1259
01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.970
And then there are also,
they try to find you,

1260
01:19:55.971 --> 01:19:59.780
but they can't peek their heads out because this guy was so fucking bad ass.

1261
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:02.630
Like Rick Barry from the foul line.

1262
01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:06.980
He's picking these dudes off and then he picked the dude's off,

1263
01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:10.530
would try to drag the dead dude out of the street just like in saving private

1264
01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:15.400
Ryan,
but reverse cause it was an American guy doing it.
And uh,

1265
01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.370
it was,
it was absolutely fascinating.
Then they went to,

1266
01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.940
after they were talking about that guy,
he has to sit there.
And those guys,

1267
01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:27.370
what they do on the other side is they just start lobbing like,
uh,

1268
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:31.110
what does that mortar plus,
you know,
they stick it in that tube.
It goes boom.

1269
01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:35.700
You know,
it shoots over a couple of condos and he goes,

1270
01:20:35.701 --> 01:20:40.560
you just got to sit there and hope one doesn't have your name on it.
You know,

1271
01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:45.690
why do I watch action movies where there's actors who pretend to be bad ass when

1272
01:20:45.691 --> 01:20:48.630
you can watch shit like that.
That it was,

1273
01:20:48.631 --> 01:20:51.330
it was one of the fucking Manlius things I've ever seen in my life.

1274
01:20:51.331 --> 01:20:53.040
This guy was just picking people off.

1275
01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:57.390
He has to take into consideration cross winds,

1276
01:20:57.690 --> 01:21:00.960
how quickly these guys are running.
He was going after the guys like these,

1277
01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:06.330
it was like a video game.
Like the RPG guys were like worth like 2000 points.

1278
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:07.111
You know,

1279
01:21:07.111 --> 01:21:09.990
if you just got some guy running across the street trying to get a fucking

1280
01:21:09.991 --> 01:21:13.920
Tabouli salad that was worth like 25.
Anyways.

1281
01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:17.040
So then after they got done talking to talking about that guy,

1282
01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:21.270
they talked about the,
they cut to this dude in,
um,

1283
01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:26.010
in Vietnam who had like 93 confirmed kills.

1284
01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:32.240
And uh,
he went head to head with some other badass sniper,
uh,

1285
01:21:33.090 --> 01:21:37.090
who was on the Vietcong and the Vietcong guy spotted them.
This,

1286
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:38.880
how bad ass the Vietcong guy was.

1287
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.200
He shot around by his foot as a challenge.

1288
01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:47.130
You know,
this guy was bored with picking off regular people,

1289
01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:52.110
so he wanted to go mano a mano with this other sniper and for like four days,

1290
01:21:52.111 --> 01:21:56.220
they're tracking each other through the,
through the jungle,
you know,

1291
01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:59.670
coming up on each other's flank,
whatever the fuck that means.

1292
01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:04.170
One dude would be like 300 yards in front of the other dude and then they be

1293
01:22:04.171 --> 01:22:07.350
crawling on their fucking elbows and somehow by the time they were done,

1294
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:08.850
he'd be where that dude was.

1295
01:22:08.851 --> 01:22:13.230
And then the other dude was with the other dude was and just one day the via con

1296
01:22:13.231 --> 01:22:17.560
guy got unlucky
and it was the afternoon sun in it.

1297
01:22:17.561 --> 01:22:21.340
It glinted off his fucking whatever that what is there.

1298
01:22:21.341 --> 01:22:26.340
This is his gun scope in this guy literally did the shot from saving private

1299
01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:27.420
private Ryan.
He,

1300
01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:32.460
he shot at through the guys' scope and blew out the back of his fucking head and

1301
01:22:32.461 --> 01:22:35.490
the guy had a southern accent talking about,
went where I threw the scope,

1302
01:22:35.491 --> 01:22:37.230
didn't even touch the sides.

1303
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:44.500
It was great.
He was like,
he was talking about some fishy cut,
eh,

1304
01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:49.470
Yay Shit Buddy.
I was down.
I got a fucking fish on dry land,

1305
01:22:49.471 --> 01:22:52.500
mother fucker top that one bitch.
He was doing that.

1306
01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:55.250
But talking about killing guys,
I don't know.
I have,

1307
01:22:55.251 --> 01:22:59.490
I wish I knew the name of the show,
but I found it absolutely fascinating.

1308
01:22:59.491 --> 01:23:02.310
One of those shows that so manly that you get,

1309
01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:06.190
you almost get insecure watching that you have to somehow start that you're the

1310
01:23:06.191 --> 01:23:07.720
guy in it,
you know,

1311
01:23:07.721 --> 01:23:10.300
and you start talking shit like you're the guy getting interviewed and you're

1312
01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:13.840
whispering to yourself on the couch and then you catch yourself going,

1313
01:23:13.841 --> 01:23:16.840
Jesus Christ.
Am I fucking crazy?
You know,

1314
01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:19.390
for the record I was getting interviewed on Oprah.

1315
01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:26.560
Is it any wonder why I'm in this business?
All right,
it is hot as hell in here.

1316
01:23:27.390 --> 01:23:29.500
They've got to keep the windows closed.
You know,
when you say content,

1317
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:34.000
we fucking three seconds.
I get to keep the windows closed.
Um,
all right,
let's,
uh,

1318
01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:36.380
let's get to some of the shit here on the podcast.
Oh,
I wanted to,

1319
01:23:36.450 --> 01:23:41.350
I forgot to mention that I was gonna,
I was on Joe Rogan's podcast.
Um,

1320
01:23:41.351 --> 01:23:46.110
had a great time.
I went out to,
uh,
his bungalow and a,

1321
01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:49.840
I did his podcast two and a half hour podcast that went by in like three
seconds.

1322
01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:54.700
Um,
and for the life of me,
I don't know where the hell did tell you to go get it.

1323
01:23:54.701 --> 01:23:56.470
Just look up Joe Rogan podcast.

1324
01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:01.860
He's like hardcore into the Internet and technology and I'm sure his website

1325
01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:04.870
will take you by the hand and lead you right to his podcast.

1326
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:06.880
So please check that out.
And uh,

1327
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:11.380
one of the things we talked about on a Rogan's podcast was he was absolutely

1328
01:24:11.381 --> 01:24:15.460
beside himself that I was not on Twitter yet.
Um,

1329
01:24:15.490 --> 01:24:20.260
oh first that I didn't have a what does that thing you have in your car when you

1330
01:24:20.261 --> 01:24:25.120
don't want to look at a map anymore?
Keep saying,
Gee,
cast g map.

1331
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:29.590
I map map 2.0 fucking do it for me.

1332
01:24:29.591 --> 01:24:33.850
I don't want to think anymore.
Um,
mapquest.

1333
01:24:34.210 --> 01:24:37.330
Fuck,
what is it called?
Whatever.

1334
01:24:38.650 --> 01:24:42.370
I don't have that thing.
I just said,
I have a map.
Can you tell me where you live?

1335
01:24:42.371 --> 01:24:46.900
And I look it up and then I,
I,
I get there.
There is no problem,

1336
01:24:46.901 --> 01:24:48.640
but for some reason people are blown away by that.

1337
01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:51.790
But it was even more blown away with by the fact that I,
I wasn't on Twitter.

1338
01:24:51.791 --> 01:24:56.560
So he actually signed me up for a Twitter account and I told them I don't do

1339
01:24:56.561 --> 01:24:59.620
that shit.
And he goes,
uh,
he kept saying,
you gotta do what you gotta do it.

1340
01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.690
It's the best way to hype you gigs.

1341
01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:06.070
So I'm asking you guys,

1342
01:25:06.071 --> 01:25:10.060
should I get on Twitter cause I don't wanna go into that on there and tweet

1343
01:25:10.061 --> 01:25:14.890
about some fucking cheeseburger.
I just had,
um,
I could,
like most people do,

1344
01:25:14.891 --> 01:25:19.510
but a Rogan was swearing up and down.
This is that this is the best way to do it.

1345
01:25:19.511 --> 01:25:21.400
Like,
he was like,
you don't even need to do radio.

1346
01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:25.410
He just get a bunch of followers on Twitter and you tell them where you're going

1347
01:25:25.411 --> 01:25:27.790
to be and then they can all go out and see you.

1348
01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:33.070
Like that fucking Korean barbecue truck that drives around here out in La.

1349
01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:38.230
People are on Twitter to see his fucking truck that has insane Korean barbecue.

1350
01:25:38.410 --> 01:25:43.390
And people are like,
you know,
follow the thing on Twitter.
And they're like,
Hey,

1351
01:25:43.391 --> 01:25:47.020
I'm on so and such and such and vine and everybody drives over to go get some

1352
01:25:47.021 --> 01:25:51.160
fucking Korean barbecue.
So,
um,
anyways,

1353
01:25:51.161 --> 01:25:55.390
we have a poll on the MM podcast.com if you guys,
you know,
if you'd like it,

1354
01:25:55.391 --> 01:25:59.410
if you want me to be on Twitter,
uh,
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

1355
01:25:59.411 --> 01:26:04.130
But I gotta be honest with you.
I'm not going to be,
uh,
I'll only be tweeting,

1356
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:09.500
you know,
I'll tweet like I just put the podcast just is,
uh,
just got posted.

1357
01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:14.960
I can't even,
I can't do Twitter tweet.
That's fucking ridiculous.

1358
01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:19.820
You know what it is?
This part of me though,
I got to stop fighting this shit.

1359
01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:24.080
You know,
by the time I got onto Facebook it was fucking irrelevant.

1360
01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.690
Nobody gives a shit.
Now everybody's on Twitter,

1361
01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:30.950
you know I'm giving in a little bit.
I'm compromising.

1362
01:26:32.670 --> 01:26:37.340
Fuck it.
What do you want me to do?
Huh?
You want me to be the spokesperson for BP?

1363
01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:41.360
I'll do it.
Shit.
You don't stop that.

1364
01:26:41.361 --> 01:26:43.730
I could do a better fucking jobs in their spokespersons are doing,

1365
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:48.230
what's their latest spokesperson?
What?
What the fuck is that guy saying?

1366
01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:54.380
They're only birds.
I've got to open the window here.

1367
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:58.370
Sorry,
Cleo.
Sorry.
She gets so fucking freaked out whenever I do that.

1368
01:26:58.371 --> 01:27:03.110
Then she starts shaking uncontrollably.
Sorry.
All right,

1369
01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:04.930
let's get back to the podcast,
so let me know.

1370
01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:08.900
It's his Twitter is stupid as I think it is or is it actually decent,

1371
01:27:08.901 --> 01:27:11.150
but I'm going to be honest with you.
If you say to get on Twitter,

1372
01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.740
I'm not going to be tweeting,

1373
01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:19.070
just got an ice cream and the host scoop fell in my laugh.
O G lol.

1374
01:27:19.071 --> 01:27:22.490
I'm not fucking doing that.
All right,
I'll,
I'll have the most boring tweets.

1375
01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:24.650
But then that's the thing,
you get on there and then you gotta,

1376
01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:29.630
you gotta try to be fucking interesting.
Oh,
gives a fuck.
Go,

1377
01:27:29.631 --> 01:27:32.120
go on the [inaudible] podcast.
Let me know what you think,
you know,

1378
01:27:32.121 --> 01:27:34.820
and maybe send me some emails and let me know some of the positive things.

1379
01:27:34.821 --> 01:27:38.970
Even thinking if you really think it sucks,
just let me know.
All right,

1380
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:43.160
so there you go.
All right,
45 minutes in.
Let's get to some of the questions here.

1381
01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:46.220
Um,
oh,
somebody send me,
here's another tech question for you.

1382
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:50.600
As somebody sent me something about a saying,
hey bill,
I don't have an iPhone.

1383
01:27:50.690 --> 01:27:53.820
Can,
uh,
you know,

1384
01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:56.360
can you make it easier for me to listen to the thing at work?

1385
01:27:56.361 --> 01:28:00.860
I don't want to have to be,
you know,
I guess I don't know what,

1386
01:28:00.861 --> 01:28:04.550
listen to it on the computer.
So I,
I emailed the guy back like,
well,

1387
01:28:04.551 --> 01:28:06.110
can't you listen to it on your iPod?

1388
01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:09.020
It seemed like he had one of those jobs where he,
I forget what his job was,

1389
01:28:09.021 --> 01:28:12.860
but it was like he went to job sites.
Um,

1390
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:14.120
I dunno,

1391
01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:19.120
is there another place where I can post the Monday morning podcast for people to

1392
01:28:19.281 --> 01:28:24.230
listen to it on their phones?
I mean,
I dunno,
I have no idea.
But,
uh,

1393
01:28:24.231 --> 01:28:26.480
he seemed to be the only guy who said some shit like that,

1394
01:28:26.481 --> 01:28:29.360
but just in case it was a problem.
Um,

1395
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:32.930
if you guys have like tech savvy fucking questions,

1396
01:28:32.931 --> 01:28:33.980
I don't know what to do about it,

1397
01:28:33.981 --> 01:28:37.340
but if you can point me in a direction that will make it easier for you to

1398
01:28:37.341 --> 01:28:41.420
listen to this thing,
I'll try to do it as long as it doesn't involve,
you know,

1399
01:28:41.421 --> 01:28:46.190
900 bucks in like three weeks worth of work here.
Um,

1400
01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:50.440
all right.
And also I added a couple of Boston dates I've got to put up on my,
uh,

1401
01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:54.050
website.
One is up in New Hampshire for the life of me.
It's Sunday,

1402
01:28:54.051 --> 01:28:56.480
so I don't know where the fuck it is.
I gotta talk to my agent tomorrow,

1403
01:28:56.780 --> 01:29:01.500
but the other one is on August 12th.
I'm going to be in,
um,

1404
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:07.130
the 2010 new port summer comedy series at the new New Port Yachting Center.

1405
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:13.830
Huh?
You like that moving up in the world?
Um,

1406
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:18.750
yeah.
Um,
it's a seven 30 show August 12th that by the time you listen to this,

1407
01:29:18.751 --> 01:29:19.590
I'll at least have that,

1408
01:29:19.591 --> 01:29:22.740
post that up on my website and I know the day before or the day after,

1409
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:26.930
I'm going to be up in New Hampshire.
So all you people up in Maine,
you know,

1410
01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:28.290
you people over in Connecticut,

1411
01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:33.270
you know there's a couple of gigs that are easier to drive to.
Hang on a second.

1412
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:39.690
All right,
here we go.
Um,
youtube videos for the week.

1413
01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:43.470
Um,
here's one that I think is really funny,

1414
01:29:43.471 --> 01:29:46.230
but also I can't tell if it's fake or not.
Please let me know.

1415
01:29:46.830 --> 01:29:51.830
It's called BMW chase and it's a couple of rednecks judging to people in this

1416
01:29:52.231 --> 01:29:56.910
little BMW car.
They chase after him and for some reason they're filming it.

1417
01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.200
And um,

1418
01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:02.010
you think the guy in the BMW is going to get his ass kicked and all of a sudden

1419
01:30:02.011 --> 01:30:05.370
the tables turn.
It's a,
it's pretty interesting,

1420
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:08.250
but I don't know if it's real or not.
Um,

1421
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:12.900
and also the 21 foot rule over that last week,
uh,
the guy put up one more,

1422
01:30:12.901 --> 01:30:17.040
he did a final video where he actually hurts himself.
Evidently

1423
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:24.150
this guy is out of his mind.
And if I worked for the FBI,

1424
01:30:24.151 --> 01:30:27.750
I would definitely be watching this guy at all.
Fucking times.

1425
01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:32.820
21 foot rule,
final video,
go to the Mlm,
podcast.com.
All right,
just go there.

1426
01:30:32.821 --> 01:30:35.550
We'll have all of these up here.
And if you're a dog lover,

1427
01:30:35.551 --> 01:30:38.760
please do not watch this one.
All right,

1428
01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:43.860
dear versus dog.
Um,
to long story,

1429
01:30:43.861 --> 01:30:48.090
there's a baby deer and then the mother dear comes in or it looks like an

1430
01:30:48.091 --> 01:30:50.670
adolescent dear to make sure the baby deers.
Okay.

1431
01:30:50.671 --> 01:30:55.080
And there's a cat that gets a knocked around a little bit,

1432
01:30:55.081 --> 01:30:58.260
but the dog gets absolutely pummeled.

1433
01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:02.910
The dog gets pummeled
and it's,

1434
01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.670
it was really uncomfortable to watch.
But uh,

1435
01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:07.500
for some reason I'm talented and I'm laughing.

1436
01:31:07.501 --> 01:31:10.320
I don't know why cause it wasn't funny.
So if you,
I don't know,

1437
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:13.830
if you don't like watching a dog get pummeled by a deer,
check it out.

1438
01:31:13.831 --> 01:31:17.250
But for you future serial killers who have already begun torturing animals,

1439
01:31:17.251 --> 01:31:21.570
there's a video for you.
All right?
Underrated.
Overrated for the week.

1440
01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.150
Um,
this is a great one.
Underrated.

1441
01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:29.100
Letting your frozen pizza cool for the recommended two minutes after pulling it

1442
01:31:29.101 --> 01:31:31.020
out of the oven.
Good Lord.

1443
01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:36.450
That's such a classic drunk food or like you're just absolutely starving and

1444
01:31:36.451 --> 01:31:40.620
you've just fired in the microwave or the oven and the second it's done,

1445
01:31:40.890 --> 01:31:42.600
you just fucking,
you do a couple of,

1446
01:31:43.650 --> 01:31:47.460
and then you bite into it and then you got to do that.
You gotta like a,

1447
01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:50.070
you're like fanning your mouth as if that's ever worked.

1448
01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:54.030
And then for the next four days,
because you didn't,
you didn't wait two minutes.

1449
01:31:54.630 --> 01:31:58.800
You have that white burned flesh,
the top of your mouth.

1450
01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:03.140
I have somehow dislocated my jaw.
The fuck is going on here.

1451
01:32:04.890 --> 01:32:08.300
Went to the dentist and they gave me a fucking mouth guard because I grind my

1452
01:32:08.301 --> 01:32:09.740
teeth at night cause I'm a psycho.

1453
01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:11.970
<v 3>Oh fucking Kalia.
[inaudible].</v>

1454
01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:14.180
<v 8>Evidently I do that at night.</v>

1455
01:32:14.630 --> 01:32:18.320
So I got this mouth guard and now all of a sudden my job pops in and out and he

1456
01:32:18.321 --> 01:32:19.490
fucking dentists out there.

1457
01:32:19.491 --> 01:32:23.230
I gave you a big shout out last week by let you know that I know both canines as

1458
01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:27.050
six and 11,
eight,
nine or downtown,
right?

1459
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:36.610
MMM.
Yeah.
If you know how to fucking do that every once in awhile pops up.
Um,

1460
01:32:36.650 --> 01:32:40.670
anyways.
All right,
plowing ahead here.
A overrated,
those membership cars.

1461
01:32:40.671 --> 01:32:45.230
This guy obviously is a new listener,
so I think I'm up to 15 listeners here.
Uh,

1462
01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:48.230
overrated.
Listen to this.
This is unsolicited by me.

1463
01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:51.670
This guy's obviously a new listener because sir,
if you're listening to this,
uh,

1464
01:32:51.671 --> 01:32:56.660
I have done numerous podcasts about these things and I also have a bit about it

1465
01:32:56.661 --> 01:33:00.920
coming in.
My upcoming special,
yeah.
Coming out in September,
uh,

1466
01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:03.500
overrate he said those membership cards with all the,

1467
01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:06.950
that all the fucking chain stores in night now trying to push on you.

1468
01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:09.200
Apparently if I give them my name,

1469
01:33:09.201 --> 01:33:13.130
email address and a record of my shopping habit habits,

1470
01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:16.670
I could be saving hundreds of dollars a year.
Really?

1471
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:21.680
I'm supposed to believe a giant soulless corporation wants to help me out.
Sure.

1472
01:33:21.681 --> 01:33:25.940
I may save a buck or two,
but when I buy a seat when I buy a CD,

1473
01:33:25.941 --> 01:33:30.680
but at what cost?
At what fucking costs.
Exactly,
sir.
Congratulations.

1474
01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:34.220
You're a thinking human being.
These other people are just like,
oh,

1475
01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:36.680
they're trying to help you out.

1476
01:33:37.370 --> 01:33:40.940
They want you to save money while they make less money,

1477
01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:46.350
despite the fact that you would go to the store anyways,
they're morons.

1478
01:33:47.190 --> 01:33:51.990
And here's a recommended video.
A movie.
Actually,
I didn't check this out,

1479
01:33:51.991 --> 01:33:56.070
but this sounds like a great psycho movie.
I talked a little bit here.

1480
01:33:56.071 --> 01:33:59.360
I talked about snipers.
I T I made a reference to serial killers,

1481
01:33:59.361 --> 01:34:03.520
so I think this is a fine way to end the podcast here by wrecking.

1482
01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:08.550
I'm recommending a movie called rampage.
At least find out more about it.

1483
01:34:08.551 --> 01:34:11.130
I guess it's a small independent film,
but it says,

1484
01:34:11.131 --> 01:34:14.520
a dejected by the futility of is tedious life.

1485
01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:19.940
A bitter small town resident takes matters into his own hands by constructing a

1486
01:34:20.401 --> 01:34:23.090
bulletproof outfit,
uh,

1487
01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:27.860
picking up his semiautomatic weapons and attempting the largest killing spree

1488
01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:29.570
killing spree ever seen,

1489
01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:34.640
written and directed by a controversial film maker.
Who we ball,

1490
01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:38.350
I don't know you.
W E.
B o,
l.
L is that [inaudible] ball.

1491
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:44.030
If you ball this ultra violent action movie feature features,

1492
01:34:44.511 --> 01:34:48.710
jarring,
handheld camera work and original dialogue,

1493
01:34:48.890 --> 01:34:51.590
largely improvised by the cast.

1494
01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:58.010
How you watch that movie

1495
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:01.190
<v 0>is beyond me.
I would love to hear that improvised dialogue.</v>

1496
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:09.110
Oh,
don't shoot.
I mean,
what else would you fuck it?

1497
01:35:09.111 --> 01:35:13.940
Say acting like it's fucking,
uh,
Larry,
uh,

1498
01:35:13.970 --> 01:35:18.620
what's his face?
Uh,
Larry.
David.
I'm so bad with the fucking names.

1499
01:35:19.330 --> 01:35:21.710
Uh,
anyways,
that's the podcast this week.
It's a little short.

1500
01:35:21.711 --> 01:35:25.430
This week I got a mid,
I'm a little fucking burned out.
I did a podcast.

1501
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:30.410
I did my podcast,
Adam Carolla's podcast and I did,

1502
01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.980
um,
Joe Rogan's podcast.
I did,

1503
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:36.650
I'm literally making an unpaid career

1504
01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:42.580
out of these podcasts,
but they're there just to fucking there to,

1505
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:45.880
I forgot to say I did Adam Carolla's podcast to um,

1506
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:48.710
check his out is his,
actually,
he actually,

1507
01:35:48.711 --> 01:35:52.340
he's one of those guys who actually has 2 million fucking listeners and

1508
01:35:52.341 --> 01:35:53.420
advertisers.

1509
01:35:53.690 --> 01:35:57.020
His podcast is everything that I want this thing to be at some point,

1510
01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:59.870
but I'm just too fucking lazy to go out there.
You know what?

1511
01:35:59.871 --> 01:36:04.310
I would love to have a bunch of,
of,
of advertisement on this podcast,

1512
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:09.020
but it's of Shit that I enjoy,
you know,

1513
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:11.150
like my respect for snipers.

1514
01:36:11.151 --> 01:36:14.060
Like if somebody wanted to advertise their sniper scope,

1515
01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:19.310
are you sick and your neighbor?
Do you want to scare the shit out of him?

1516
01:36:19.311 --> 01:36:24.311
Or maybe take out a house pet chick out the fucking ask Sam 3000 millimeter

1517
01:36:26.151 --> 01:36:27.380
fucking guns scope.

1518
01:36:29.210 --> 01:36:34.210
Even a fucking mutant could kill someone a 300 fucking yards through a picket

1519
01:36:35.110 --> 01:36:38.840
fucking fats,
some shit like that.
Maybe we'll have that.

1520
01:36:38.841 --> 01:36:40.580
Maybe we'll try out advertising on this.

1521
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.880
Don't do free advertising for random shit.
You know,

1522
01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:50.390
Shit that I actually fucking use like toilets.

1523
01:36:52.170 --> 01:36:56.390
You Shit that you sick of Shit shitting outside.
Once you get a toilet,
you dumb.

1524
01:36:56.391 --> 01:37:00.140
Fuck,
it's 2010.
Oh that guy.
Everybody if there are more on,

1525
01:37:00.141 --> 01:37:04.770
has to have a southern accent.
I've addressed that in my act.
What else would,

1526
01:37:04.930 --> 01:37:08.810
what else,
whether kind of advertising,
Belvedere,
vodka,

1527
01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:12.740
limes,
if you make limes,
you grow limes,
I should say.

1528
01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:21.140
What else?
That's about it.
Vodka,

1529
01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:25.070
gun scopes and toilets.
Let's start there.
That'll be the,
uh,

1530
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:28.970
the advertising.
You know,
that reminds me a long time ago,
um,

1531
01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:33.380
when guns and roses there,
their appetite for destruction came out.

1532
01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:36.980
They had that song called night train and the people of a,

1533
01:37:36.981 --> 01:37:40.190
I guess it's some sort of cheap booze.
I don't know if it's wine.

1534
01:37:40.191 --> 01:37:43.020
I don't know what the fuck it was.
Um,

1535
01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:49.300
but the people at nitrane one slash to be a spokesperson and do this is back in

1536
01:37:49.671 --> 01:37:51.920
the day where if you were a spokesperson for something,

1537
01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:56.550
like you lost like 30% of your audience,
you were considered a sellout.

1538
01:37:56.850 --> 01:38:00.150
Nowadays,
these fucking Lady Gaga guys can be fucking,

1539
01:38:00.151 --> 01:38:03.870
have their legs spread around.
Some of Y'all play yogurt,

1540
01:38:03.930 --> 01:38:07.620
make an extra fucking money.
Nobody gives a shit.
But back in the day,

1541
01:38:07.621 --> 01:38:08.460
that was a big thing,

1542
01:38:08.461 --> 01:38:11.910
but he actually would have got away with it because it would have been so funny

1543
01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:16.920
because their whole thing was that were were alcoholics.
Um,

1544
01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:20.160
but at the last second,
uh,
some groups complained,

1545
01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:25.150
um,
that it would actually,
what would that do to the youth?

1546
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:28.090
What would that encourage them to do?
And that's one of the Times,

1547
01:38:28.091 --> 01:38:30.670
few times that they were actually 100% right.
Because if,

1548
01:38:31.090 --> 01:38:34.780
if slash yeah,
in 1988,

1549
01:38:34.781 --> 01:38:37.750
89 told me to drink night train,
I would have,

1550
01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:40.180
I would've would've been hilarious.

1551
01:38:40.230 --> 01:38:44.080
We would have drank night nitrane while we listened to night train and out and

1552
01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:47.080
are safe suburbs.
We would have thought we were bad ass on some level.

1553
01:38:49.530 --> 01:38:53.080
All right.
I think that's it.
That was a little little fucker reminiscing.

1554
01:38:53.081 --> 01:38:57.870
I took you back to 1988 you know when the first George Bush was in office,

1555
01:38:58.530 --> 01:39:02.780
you know when he had some sort of restraint sort of stick and move in the Middle

1556
01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:06.220
East.
Just fucking blast him right in the face and then leave.

1557
01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:11.020
Let them think about it.
Don't let them fly around the country.
Um,

1558
01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:14.290
anyways,
let me hide my guest for this week.
I am beyond excited.

1559
01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:17.380
I'm going to be in Las Vegas this weekend.

1560
01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:21.970
Co headlining with a comedian and television star.

1561
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.330
Tom Papa.
Okay.
The host and star of the marriage.

1562
01:39:25.331 --> 01:39:29.250
Ref on NBC.
Please watch the show.
Tom Papa,

1563
01:39:29.251 --> 01:39:33.620
good friend of my podcast and I'll be advertising.
Tom,
I don't,

1564
01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:37.960
I'm advertising Tom pop right now and we co headlining with him at the Orleans

1565
01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:41.650
Casino in Las Vegas a Friday and Saturday night this weekend.
Uh,

1566
01:39:41.651 --> 01:39:43.150
what the fuck dates of those?
Hang on,

1567
01:39:43.150 --> 01:39:47.260
<v 8>hang on.
Don't get your panties in.
An uproar.
A,</v>

1568
01:39:47.261 --> 01:39:51.790
that would be the 25th and the 26th of June.

1569
01:39:52.130 --> 01:39:54.460
C'Mon out all you people in Vegas but asked me to come out there.

1570
01:39:54.461 --> 01:39:58.600
I finally got a finally got a gig out there and,
and as a comedian,

1571
01:39:58.630 --> 01:39:59.770
it's an honor to perform there.

1572
01:39:59.771 --> 01:40:03.490
That's the last place I guess George Carlin did stand up.
So,
uh,

1573
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:08.780
I'm going to try to talk to a security and see if maybe I can not take a peek at

1574
01:40:08.781 --> 01:40:10.580
the theater,
maybe make a quick little video.

1575
01:40:10.581 --> 01:40:12.980
I always promise videos and then I never ended up doing them.

1576
01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:18.390
But maybe I can make a quick little video of me working in Vegas.
Yeah.
Uh,

1577
01:40:18.391 --> 01:40:21.790
actually a cool Vegas Vegas video where I'm not out there acting like strip

1578
01:40:21.791 --> 01:40:22.624
clubs are fun

1579
01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:26.260
<v 0>rather than their,
if they're fucking okay</v>

1580
01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:28.610
<v 8>debt's overrated titty bars.</v>

1581
01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:32.180
Titty bars are overrated unless you're under the age of 23,

1582
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:37.380
you fucking,
you know,
23 are under strict.
Did a titty bars are great.
Well,

1583
01:40:37.381 --> 01:40:39.660
you get a little bit older than that.
It's fucking horrific.

1584
01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:44.900
You just wasted money in and makes you fucking hate women.
Um,

1585
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:48.750
and I think actually the strippers,
they start to hate guys after a while,

1586
01:40:48.751 --> 01:40:51.990
but I think that they would like guys a lot more if they were fucking wide eyed.

1587
01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:56.980
2021,
two year olds.
Oh boy.
Oh boy.
Look at the vagina.

1588
01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:00.520
I gave her a dollar and she showed me her titty.
So polio ploy

1589
01:41:02.410 --> 01:41:04.990
to this is the greatest night ever when you're still in that phase.

1590
01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:09.870
And I'm not making fun of 22,
23 years old,
old.
Cause I wasn't that,
that I,

1591
01:41:09.871 --> 01:41:10.151
you know,

1592
01:41:10.151 --> 01:41:13.030
I was that guy at that age and I'm sure a bunch you will email me now and

1593
01:41:13.230 --> 01:41:16.780
telling me how fucking bad ass Yara and all the pussy you're getting.
You know,

1594
01:41:16.781 --> 01:41:19.780
I don't give a fuck.
Okay.
I was your age.

1595
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:23.680
I actually was I getting any at that age.
I had a bad,

1596
01:41:23.681 --> 01:41:28.090
I was a late fucking bloomer,
you know,
you know,

1597
01:41:28.091 --> 01:41:30.700
you know the middle period where mark McGwire uh,

1598
01:41:30.730 --> 01:41:33.580
right before he started doing steroids,
when he fucking tapered off.

1599
01:41:33.581 --> 01:41:36.280
That was like my pussy getting career in my early twenties.

1600
01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:44.560
And then I moved to New York and uh,
it all worked itself out.
Yeah.

1601
01:41:44.561 --> 01:41:46.930
If he can't get laid and moved to New York,
by the way,
it's,
it's just,

1602
01:41:46.931 --> 01:41:50.740
it's fucking impossible not to eat this.
They're just walking down the street.

1603
01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:53.740
I was back there last weekend.
I forgot about that.

1604
01:41:53.741 --> 01:41:58.360
Like when you're driving around
La,
they're in cars.

1605
01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:01.600
You can't get to them.
They're boxed in.

1606
01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:04.180
But in New York you can just harass the shit out of them.

1607
01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:08.790
It's like the host cities,
just a big construction site,
eh,

1608
01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:13.840
sweet tits.
Oh,
come.
You're going to be like that.
It's a matter.

1609
01:42:13.841 --> 01:42:16.630
I just made you uncomfortable.
I just threw out a,

1610
01:42:16.631 --> 01:42:18.120
maybe you're going to get raped,
vibe.

1611
01:42:18.121 --> 01:42:22.000
I can't believe you fucking giving me this attitude.
No,
I was never that guy.

1612
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:28.390
But I actually,
I used to always meet girls in the gym and oddly enough,

1613
01:42:28.391 --> 01:42:30.070
I actually met a couple on the subway.

1614
01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:34.570
I think because they have their guard up not to get mugged,

1615
01:42:34.571 --> 01:42:36.340
but they don't think that you're going to start hitting on him.

1616
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:38.530
And what I would usually do,
I think I told this story,

1617
01:42:38.531 --> 01:42:42.640
I would wait for somebody to do something weird or fucking stupid,

1618
01:42:42.641 --> 01:42:44.380
which happens all the time on the subway.

1619
01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:46.870
And if they would react to it by laughing a little bit,

1620
01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:50.430
then you went in and I had to do was make a joke and then I was in,
you know,

1621
01:42:50.530 --> 01:42:53.560
and hopefully if they had,
you know,
if I got,
you know,

1622
01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:55.330
I try to just get their number,

1623
01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:58.390
but if I got desperate I would whore out the fact that I was a comedian.

1624
01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:01.420
Actually,
I'm a comedian,
I'll be down in the comedy cellar tonight,

1625
01:43:01.421 --> 01:43:04.000
which is such a bitch move.
But I did it all the time.

1626
01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:09.060
Shamelessly can a business card with me fucking holding a microphone.

1627
01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:12.400
So they knew I was a comedian.
You know,

1628
01:43:14.170 --> 01:43:18.310
the fuck I did what I had to do.
Look at me.
I look like Richie Cunningham.

1629
01:43:18.311 --> 01:43:22.960
What do you want from me?
Look at,
I'm over an hour again.
Just like that.

1630
01:43:22.961 --> 01:43:25.210
That's how it goes.
All right,
so that is,
oh,

1631
01:43:25.211 --> 01:43:28.780
a new episode of uninformed by taped with,
uh,
Joe de Rosa.

1632
01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:32.040
The new young teen sensation of the OPN Anthony show.
Oh,

1633
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:33.430
I want to thank those guys,
by the way,

1634
01:43:33.431 --> 01:43:36.520
last week for having me go on and height my show.

1635
01:43:36.521 --> 01:43:37.810
And I want to thank [inaudible] guys,

1638
01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:48.910

So that's it.

1639
01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:51.830
Hope you guys have a great week and let me know.

1640
01:43:51.831 --> 01:43:55.380
You want me to do the tweak thing on Twitter?
Um,

1641
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:58.460
I know I'm really copping out here.
I'm acting like Julius Caesar.

1642
01:43:58.730 --> 01:44:01.340
Do you want me to kill the son of God?
I mean,
it's up to you.

1643
01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:06.140
I'll do whatever you want me to do.
Uh,

All right.</v>

1646

That's it.

1647
01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:52.370
[inaudible].
