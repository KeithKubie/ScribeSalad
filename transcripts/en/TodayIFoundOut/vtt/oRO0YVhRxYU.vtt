00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.170
Hello I'm Daven Hiskey and you are watching
the Today I Found Out Youtube channel.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.690
In the video today we're looking at the surprisingly
slow speed of electricity.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.270
Let's get started.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.919
You may be surprised to learn that electrons
flow through a typical copper wire much slower

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.090
than a turtle walks.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.080
Each wire that conducts a flow of electrons,
producing usable electric current, is composed

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.670
of billions of atoms.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.599
To move along it, the electrons have to traverse
these atoms, randomly zig-zagging their way

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.890
as they do, resulting in the net flow rate,
called “drift velocity,” in a given direction

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.850
being quite slow.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:34.940
How slow exactly?

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.079
To calculate it, we use this formula: I = n*A*v*Q
or v = I/(n*A*Q)

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.610
I is the current, n is the number of electrons
per cubic meter, A is the cross-section of

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.520
the wire, Q is the charge of an electron and
v is the drift velocity of the electrons.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.930
Since the number of electrons in a copper
wire (n) is 8.5 * 10^28 per m^3, and the charge

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.739
of an electron (Q) is 1.6 * 10^-19 coulombs,
if we also know the cross sectional area and

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.180
the current, we can calculate the electrons’
drift velocity.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.030
For example, suppose you have a current of
14 amps and a copper wire with a cross section

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.760
of 3 * 10^-6 m^2.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.729
Plug in all the numbers and you get that the
electrons are moving at a speed of 3.4 * 10^-4

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.650
m/s – or about a whopping one-third of a
millimeter per second.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.960
To put it in values that are easier to conceptualize,
this works out to about 1.2 meters or 4.1

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.220
feet per hour- a rate about 195 times slower
than the average box turtle, which can cover

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.430
about 800 feet in that same amount of time.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.079
So how is it that something that makes a turtle
look like the Road Runner can more or less

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.990
instantaneously turn on a light across a room?

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.610
Chain reaction.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.369
The atoms in the wire are crammed together
cheek to jowl, which, while it makes the going

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.840
slow, also has the electrons more or less
abutting one another.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.030
When the switch is turned on, thanks to the
electrical potential difference created by

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.040
the generator, a force is created to move
the electrons, with each pushing its neighbor,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.720
which in turn pushes its neighbor and so on
all the way through the wire.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.860
So, while no electrons zoom through the wire
to turn on the light as you might have previously

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.580
thought, it ends up seeming like that is what’s
happening.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.070
This is not unlike how when you turn on your
faucet, water instantly comes out despite

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:31.500
the fact that your water source might be many
miles away.
