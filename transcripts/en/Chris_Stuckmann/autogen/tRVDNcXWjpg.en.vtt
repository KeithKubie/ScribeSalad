00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240
it was kind of like dead space 3 where
 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.449
it was kind of like dead space 3 where
that entire world was so well realized

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459
that entire world was so well realized
 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.040

it was better in dead space 3 but I
 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.990
it was better in dead space 3 but I

think here they did a pretty good job of
 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.660
think here they did a pretty good job of
recreating what an apocalypse might be

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670
recreating what an apocalypse might be
 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.730
