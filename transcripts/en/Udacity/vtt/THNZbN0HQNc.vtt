00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.570
In this lesson, we're going to discuss mutations. Now mutations can

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.550
be good or bad depending on the individual and the context.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.310
&gt;&gt; Now, a mutation is simply a change in the DNA sequence. For example, Lauren

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.070
has the mutation for lactase persistence, allowing

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.870
her to drink lactose containing products like milk.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.110
&gt;&gt; Well, don't make me feel like a mutant Matt.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.750
&gt;&gt; Oh well, it's okay Lauren. In the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.690
genetics world, everybody's a mutant because mutation and variation

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.130
are pretty much the same thing.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.780
&gt;&gt; So a mutation in eye color is the same thing as a variation in eye color?

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.490
&gt;&gt; Exactly. In this course we're going to use

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.570
the words interchangeably. So take heart, everyone out

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.690
there is a mutant for something. To help

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.722
you get acquainted with all sorts of new mutations

00:00:41.722 --> 00:00:46.850
in this lesson, this is an incomplete concept map for you to print off and keep

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.840
along with you. Fill in the blanks as we go along. At the end of the lesson,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.730
you'll have an opportunity to fill in the blanks

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.610
with the answers you've collected along the way. Now, if

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.850
you're someone who still needs to see the complete concept

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.730
map to learn, then please go to the end of

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.870
the lesson and download the complete copy. But otherwise,

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.980
please just use this version. Try to fill it out

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.800
as you go along. And at the end of the

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.140
lesson, you'll have a chance to see the complete version.
