00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
It's the Domesday system,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.300
and  this was a project in 1986 developed by BBC

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.700
with a lot of input from BBC Schools.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.160
But it was using brand new technology,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.280
to remember the 900th anniversary of the Domesday book.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.500
This is a modern version of it.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.540
And what it was

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.100
was an enormous catalogue

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.760
of everything that "William the Conqueror" had conquered.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.920
Although the original Domesday book you can still read,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.660
if you know the language,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.600
these sadly are beginning to fail after barely thirty years.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.880
This was a Phillips laser vision player.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.220
When the coding was first starting, when the first development of the Domesday disc started,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.440
They hadn't even got this particular player ready.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.920
By the time they were testing it they got the prototypes.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.820
There are actually two discs in all;

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.380
these are double sided and each surface is an active surface.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.700
The two discs were called the "national disc" and the "community disc",

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.720
they had different sorts of content.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.900
They aren't digital discs, so you can't actually say they're

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.700
a particular amount of megabytes or gigabytes.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.000
It had actually got tracks on it,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.320
just like frames, analog frames in an old fashioned TV.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:33.100
Across this width there are 55,000 tracks, which is about half an hours playing time.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:41.460
Unfortunately this technology, not only the disc but the players are very hard to keep in order.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.660
We have been in touch with Phillips

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.740
We can't find anybody who can help us to repair them.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.880
So we've got a couple of players that work fitfully and a few discs that are just about readable.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:04.280
So this is the 2011 remake of it, using all the original data that has been devised to work on a program on this

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.080
touch table but basically using a PC with windows underneath it.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.960
That's where we are now, near Bletchley.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.760
Just about here, keep zooming in

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.380
and eventually you get the map as it was in 1986

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.260
Put the modern maps on, and you can see the city is now full of housing.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.980
Here is Bletchley, here is what people wrote about Bletchley at the time.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.660
There were pictures, one of the lakes near Bletchley, children biking in the Milton Keynes bowl,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.840
and here is Wellsmead School, the school that contributed this information.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:50.780
The BBC contacted schools all over the country and invited them to write  little bits about the area, about special things about their area,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.240
send in photographs and there was a massive operation digitizing all of that.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:05.560
Some of it was written on BBC micros, the schools were trying to get their students to learn about using computers within this whole project.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:13.600
But then that all had to be moved into a standard form. Plugged into what we would now call a geographical information system.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.500
So the country was split into these areas of about 3 by 4 kilometres

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:29.880
So when you did this searching down to a particular area you would then get these little stories or descriptions of the area and the pictures as well.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.120
Of course, it was only cameras in those days. They didn't have smart phones or anything of that sort.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:45.580
And they would have been film cameras, so they would have sent in actual photographs on photographic paper.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.680
And every picture would have used one single frame and they all would have been indexed.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:00.400
So there were tens of thousands of pictures, all of which were indexed. When the program was written they had to have all that data,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:08.420
so that when you clicked on a particular area on the map, it came up with the right pictures and not somewhere else.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:16.480
--This is just like thirty year old street view, isn't it?  --It's exactly like that. There was indeed a walk function within it

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.500
where there were certain towns and cities where they did just like street view

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:30.720
and you could turn sideways and backwards onto your direction of travel and look at what was filmed at the time.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.200
This was not done by the schools, this was done by the BBC.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.880
The Domesday disc and all of this hardware cost a great deal of money for schools to buy.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.080
Very quickly the BBC realized they got to produce some other titles

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.660
One of those titles was THE ECODISC and another was called VOLCANOES

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.240
I was involved in the ECODISC and it was about the ecology of a field study centre

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.100
that was in Slapton Ley in South Devon.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:09.260
And this was much more like some of the educational software BBC schools were producing at the time.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.800
That's the virtual walk, where you could walk around the lake.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:22.620
But also if you can see the dots that run across the middle there was a walk in a boat - there was a paddle across the middle of it as well.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.460
I was brought in to do the programming of this, it used a language called BCPL.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:37.020
And we used the same system and the same user interface as the Doomsday discs and we talk about

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:44.140
40 percent of our code was parts of the Doomsday disc code and then we wrote all these additional exercises

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:52.440
that allow students to investigate this field study centre. The plants, the animals, the fishes, the birds etc.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.300
And then there was a module that did the management of it

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:05.280
and they had to work out how to make the field study centre survive and thrive over a prolonged period of time.
