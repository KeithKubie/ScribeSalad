00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.580
Blanca can write 256
lines of code in 8 hours.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.520
To solve this,
we should set up a proportion.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.950
So 96 lines of code in 3 hours.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.888
We set that equal to x / 8.

00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:16.425
It actually wouldn't have mattered

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:20.444
if we had written this as 3
/ 96 is equivalent to 8 / x.

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:23.080
The important thing is
that we're consistent.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.290
If lines of code is in the denominator
in one of the proportions,

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.540
then it should also be in
the denominator of the other proportion.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.800
And then the hours should be
the same for both as well.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.180
But getting back to our original
proportion, let's cross multiply.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.200
We can multiply 96 by 8, and
set that equal to three times x.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.230
96 times 8 is 768, which equals 3x.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.510
Let's divide both sides by
three to isolate x, and

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.487
then we're left with x = 256.
