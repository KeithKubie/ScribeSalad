00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.440
Alright. This is pretty cool, Sam. We've got all these charts, and let me put

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.280
them in our dashboard. And then what else could we do for a music festival?

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.360
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, there are so many different chart types, right?

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.940
&gt;&gt; Like we haven't used pie chart yet.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.560
&gt;&gt; You could probably have a distribution

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.970
of all the different types of music.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:14.115
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:15.480
&gt;&gt; That were playing at the festival.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.710
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.150
&gt;&gt; Maybe a percentage of how may are Bossa nova?

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.551
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:19.100
[LAUGH]

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.100
&gt;&gt;

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.650
[LAUGH]

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.427
&gt;&gt; I don't even know who Bossa nova is.

00:00:21.427 --> 00:00:21.734
&gt;&gt; I know.

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:24.050
&gt;&gt; Well maybe we like I would like

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.660
to know, for the different stages, who's racking up

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.540
the most maintenance tickets, cause you know maybe

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.140
they need to get their act together or something.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I mean that's another pie chart we could make. Is distribution

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.390
of priority of tickets. Like how many are marked as high priority versus low?

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.760
&gt;&gt; Right, well let's let's make one.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.860
&gt;&gt; Okay.
