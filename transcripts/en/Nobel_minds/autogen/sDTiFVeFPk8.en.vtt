we don't know how to do that yet but

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329
we don't know how to do that yet but
 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.630
we don't know how to do that yet but
this should be possible and but even if

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640
this should be possible and but even if
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.430
this should be possible and but even if
we make the major technical breakthrough

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440
we make the major technical breakthrough
 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.500
we make the major technical breakthrough

we'll still have to go through all the

we'll still have to go through all the
 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.560
we'll still have to go through all the
other aspects which are involved so I

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570
other aspects which are involved so I
 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.260
other aspects which are involved so I
say you make a molecular computer which

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270
say you make a molecular computer which
 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.930
say you make a molecular computer which
is a thousand times smaller than the

the same sort of software does it all

the same sort of software does it all
 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.140
the same sort of software does it all
that software you can't you probably

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150
that software you can't you probably
 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.910
that software you can't you probably
won't be able to transfer it easily I

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920
won't be able to transfer it easily I
 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.010

mean the brain it seems to be some sort

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020
mean the brain it seems to be some sort
 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.530
mean the brain it seems to be some sort
of computing machine but it seems to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540
of computing machine but it seems to
 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.290
of computing machine but it seems to
work a lot differently from the way that

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300
work a lot differently from the way that
 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.300
work a lot differently from the way that
are very sort of serial machines work we

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310
are very sort of serial machines work we
 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.820

still don't understand the brain when we

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830
still don't understand the brain when we
 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.630
still don't understand the brain when we
do if when and if we do well we're

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640
do if when and if we do well we're
 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.910
do if when and if we do well we're
making a lot of progress and we'll see

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920
making a lot of progress and we'll see
 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.590
making a lot of progress and we'll see
that it's a very clever machine or

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600
that it's a very clever machine or
 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.080
that it's a very clever machine or

modern computers can't cannot do it

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560
modern computers can't cannot do it
 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.820
modern computers can't cannot do it
probably cannot do it I don't know so

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830
probably cannot do it I don't know so
 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.040
probably cannot do it I don't know so
that's the thing I think Mitsubishi are

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050
that's the thing I think Mitsubishi are
 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.440
that's the thing I think Mitsubishi are
mass producing material and if it's

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450
mass producing material and if it's
 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.080
mass producing material and if it's
really going to have a bulk value then I

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090
really going to have a bulk value then I
 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.840
really going to have a bulk value then I
think it will be come down very very

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850
think it will be come down very very
 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.270
think it will be come down very very
easily in course they'll be it could be

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280
easily in course they'll be it could be
 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.310
easily in course they'll be it could be
a hundred times cheaper as long there

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320
a hundred times cheaper as long there
 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.440
a hundred times cheaper as long there
was a bulky application that's on the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450
was a bulky application that's on the
 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.160
was a bulky application that's on the
cards but the moment that isn't the case
