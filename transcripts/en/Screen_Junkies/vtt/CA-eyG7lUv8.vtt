00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.639
In 1989, the same year that Taylor Swift was
born, the world met an even doe-ier eyed girl

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.029
whose songs got even MORE stuck in your
head.

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.950
The Little Mermaid.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.740
Travel under the sea to the whimsically fascist
kingdom of

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.630
Atlantica, where some fish are allowed to
swim free,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.269
while others are forced to drag the ruling
class around in

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:30.210
their chariots

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.340
Or use their own bodies as instruments.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.160
And meet Ariel, a half naked 15 year old and
confirmed hoarder.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.680
Follow along on her literal fish-out-of-water
story,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.720
as she falls in love with the human Prince
Eric

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.080
because he's...

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.659
hot.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.159
"Ohhhh, he's very handsome, isn't he?"

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.909
"He's so beautiful."

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.409
The only thing swimming in their way is the
most clearly evil

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.159
villain in the Disney pantheon:

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:57.010
Ursula.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.409
"The sea witch?"

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.030
"No! She's a demon!"

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.220
An old witch who keeps the tortured souls
of her victims in her front yard,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.720
eats seafood,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.150
and hates Ariel's whole family.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.970
But none of that will stop Ariel from trading
away her voice for a pair of legs and a 72

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.100
hour time limit to french a stranger.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.200
"He is quite a catch, isn't he?"

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.070
Get swept up in a fantastical romance where
love conquers all

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.710
If by love, you mean acting like a clueless
mute brat so an older guy will make out with

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.100
you.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.210
And enjoy the vintage Disney classic with
an equally vintage message for today's young

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.640
girls:

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.510
Look pretty.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.670
"You gotta look your best."

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.230
"You look wonderful."

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.930
"But without my voice, how can I--"

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.159
"You'll have your looks!"

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.560
Surround yourself with friends who are dumber
and fatter than you,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.730
abandon your family to marry a guy you just
met,

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.320
and if you're not happy with the contract
you signed without even reading...

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.960
get your fiance to murder the person who outsmarted
you.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.660
So strap on your fins for the musical you
can't help but sing

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.940
along to.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.640

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.709
"So bland."

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.100
"So blah."

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.180
"But to move the plot along, the villain has
to have a song."

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.440
"But in the soundtrack it gets skipped."

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.290

pork the girl."

the girl."

"Even though the heroes are all fish."

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.040
"Like if they made sushi of Nemo and Dory,"

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.280
"You'd have something as messed up as this."

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.489

"Even when you sleep, it plays on repeat."

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.340
"It's so catchy!"

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.540
"So what? The message is kinda sexist."

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.300
"Girls don't need brain cells, just big ole
seashells."

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.980

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.400

if her top

half was a fish instead.
