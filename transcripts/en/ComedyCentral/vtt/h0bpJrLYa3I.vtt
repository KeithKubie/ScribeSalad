00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.137 line:92%
as we go to our next game,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.239
Moon Landing.
Moon Landing.

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:09.075
Yeah, wipe off your coke noses.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.580
Now, nearly 50 years ago,
millions of people

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:16.282
around the world
watched what is arguably

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:18.551
the number-two most important
achievement in history--

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:20.453
the second man on the moon.

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:22.055
12 minutes after Neil Armstrong

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:24.323
stepped in full on the lunar
surface with his famous words,

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:27.360
"That's one step for man, that's
one giant leap for mankind",

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:30.396
his co-pilot Buzz Aldrin slammed
onto the dust and shouted,

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.833
"Buzz Aldrin has arrived,
motherfuckers!"

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:42.975
I'm paraphrasing, but, uh, today
is Buzz Aldrin's 86th birthday.

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:45.678
So comedians, please
give me some other badass

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:47.814
or just plain bad
moon landing quotes

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.982
in 60 seconds, and begin.
Jordan.

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:51.818
Whassup?

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:53.486
All right, points.
Bryan.

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.222
One small step for man,
'cause women be shopping.

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:58.524
Poin... Points.
Erin.

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:00.593
Started from the bottom,
now I'm here.

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:02.895
All right, points.
Jordan.

00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:04.831
Hey, Neil, take a picture
where it looks like

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.132
I'm fucking Denmark.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:08.201
Points.
Erin.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:11.337
Oh, my God, this is incredible--
my dick is floating.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.805
Points.
Bryan.

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:14.040
Do I look fat?

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.875
Points.
Jordan.

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:18.678
Oh, shit, my edibles
are kicking in-- I lo...

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:23.116
Points. Bryan.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.617
Really-- not a single Starbucks?

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.053
All right, points.
Bryan.

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:28.921
Guys, the moon sucks.

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:30.723
Yeah, points.

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:32.422
There is nothing up here.
