DON DODGE: Hi.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.770
I'm Don Dodge.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.920
And this is Google Root Access.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.940
Today my guest is Ryan
Damico, founder of Crocodoc.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.540
I had Ryan on last week.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.040
And it was such a
great story, I wanted

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.860
to continue the story this week.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.610
So welcome Ryan.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.630
RYAN DAMICO: Thanks Don.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.170
DON DODGE: So last
week, we talked

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.020
about how you
started the company

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.060
and how it pivoted from
a consumer-facing app

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.560
to a more business
and enterprise app.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.250
And how you're now selling
to enterprise customers.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.530
So let's talk a little bit
about-- you made the pivot,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.530
you got focused on enterprise.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.170
How did that process
work to scale it up

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.545
and to get it to
a good business?

00:00:52.545 --> 00:00:53.961
RYAN DAMICO: It's
a good question.

00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:56.480
So we were really sucked into
the thermals of the enterprise

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.980
market.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.210
It wasn't our idea initially.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.370
We built this technology.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.190
Companies took notice and
started knocking at our door.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.379
So once that happened,
we did our first deal

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.880
with Yammer that
went really well.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.505
And they became our
lighthouse customer

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:09.697
that really helped us get
our next set of customers.

00:01:09.697 --> 00:01:11.530
And especially when
you're a small start up,

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.738
every one of those reference
accounts really matters.

00:01:13.738 --> 00:01:16.514
So each company that we were
able to convert into a customer

00:01:16.514 --> 00:01:18.430
really snowballed and
made the next one easier

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.110
and the next one easier.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.840
Our whole strategy
was-- in starting

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.340
at the top of the market and
going after these big companies

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.534
first-- was really to
build up reputation.

00:01:26.534 --> 00:01:28.950
So when people thought about
high-quality document viewing

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.449
in any kind of
professional web app,

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:31.880
they thought about
us immediately.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.150
And eventually that
started to happen for us.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.390
And that was what kind
of led us down and helped

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.040
us grow our sales.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.380
DON DODGE: So were
those like OEM kinds

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.590
of arrangements where they
were using the Crocodoc product

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.870
within their product?

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.620
RYAN DAMICO: Yeah.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.120
Yep.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.400
We OEM'd the service.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.020
It was a hosted
web API basically.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.400
And sometimes you would
see the Crocodoc branding.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.590
Sometimes it was a white
label implementation.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.590
But in every case, we
talked about the customer.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.131
We had a good
relationship with them.

00:01:58.131 --> 00:02:00.700
And we really just talked
about all the different ways

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.200
that our technology
was integrated

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.927
into the product
and the benefits

00:02:03.927 --> 00:02:05.260
for the users of those products.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.140
And that was a really
good story for us to tell.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.669
DON DODGE: So was
the business model

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:13.400
to be an OEM provider to a
bunch of different products?

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.140
Or was that just a early
revenue step on the way

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.350
to a bigger vision?

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.930
RYAN DAMICO: Yeah that was
a deliberate stepping stone

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:21.430
for us.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.860
What we really wanted to
do with the company is

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.200
take documents and really
make them first-class citizens

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.034
of the web-- just like
images and videos are

00:02:28.034 --> 00:02:30.033
all over the place, they're
really easy to view.

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:32.736
We wanted to see the same shift
happen from documents, where

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:34.360
you didn't need to
download large files

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.760
and have the right version of
Microsoft Office installed,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.180
or Acrobat installed
on your desktop.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.470
We wanted to make that
ubiquitous across all devices

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.210
everywhere.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.550
So OEMing this
viewer out was kind

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.564
of one step in that direction.

00:02:46.564 --> 00:02:47.980
But really, the
bigger picture was

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.290
to just change the way people
are interacting with content

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.540
and just make that a much
easier and better experience

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.320
for users.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.440
DON DODGE: So when
I first met you,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.430
you were two or three guys
working on a consumer thing.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.160
Now you're at the
point where you're

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.370
OEMing your product to
pretty large companies.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.090
How big are you at that point?

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.840
And have you raised
any more money?

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.230
RYAN DAMICO: We did raise
around a couple years ago just

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.730
to keep things going and give
us a little bit more cash flow

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.030
to makes some more hires.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.830
But the business took
off pretty quickly.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.535
I think, in the last two years
Crocodoc has converted over,

00:03:18.535 --> 00:03:20.295
I think, 200 million
different documents

00:03:20.295 --> 00:03:21.720
from our various customers.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.294
So that ramped up
pretty quickly.

00:03:23.294 --> 00:03:24.710
And it's still
growing even faster

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.810
as we expand not only
to more customers,

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.342
but as existing
customers use us more.

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:31.550
It's really interesting to
see that growth happening.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.730
So yeah, we did raise a
little bit of funding.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.420
But we've been very profitable
for the last couple of years.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.260
DON DODGE: So you're profitable.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.690
Did you hire more people?

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.773
RYAN DAMICO: A little bit.

00:03:40.773 --> 00:03:43.507
We grew from four founders to a
whopping seven people in total.

00:03:43.507 --> 00:03:44.090
DON DODGE: OK.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.240
So seven people.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.420
You've got a good product.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.870
You're selling to
the enterprise.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.400
You're profitable.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.960
Things are going well.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.030
Then you start getting knocks
on the door for acquisitions.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.640
So how did you think about
those early acquisition offers

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.517
and whether to
accept them or not?

00:04:01.517 --> 00:04:03.100
RYAN DAMICO: We were
really fortunate.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.795
We had a number
of opportunities.

00:04:04.795 --> 00:04:07.170
And they dated way back to
when we were just starting out

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.086
from the pivot from our
first product WebNotes

00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:10.240
into what is now Crocodoc.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.940
And you know, the first
few are really exciting.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.932
You get really into it.

00:04:12.932 --> 00:04:14.640
And then you kind of
go through a process

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.220
and you realize for whatever
reason it didn't work.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.304
It wasn't good timing,
wasn't good fit, et cetera.

00:04:18.304 --> 00:04:20.386
And then you realize that
was a huge waste of time

00:04:20.386 --> 00:04:21.329
and a waste of focus.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.815
So after that, we didn't really
want to go through that process

00:04:24.815 --> 00:04:26.440
unless we were really
interested in it.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.899
And the funny thing is
that in the early stages

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:30.690
of our start-up-- I
mean, we've been around

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.630
for about eight years or
so-- the business plan was

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.963
essentially to sell the company.

00:04:33.963 --> 00:04:35.110
That was another fallacy.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.360
But then we switched that
mindset at one point to say,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.290
you know what, screw that.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.600
We want to build the best
company we ever worked for.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.140
And then of course, that's
when we started to do well

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.306
and got some other interest.

00:04:43.306 --> 00:04:45.650
So it was an
interesting process.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.590
But the reason why we
chose to go with Box

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.900
was really interesting.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.760
It really jumped out
at us as an opportunity

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.300
that I think very few
startups ever get.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.070
Which is to not only join
another company that's

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.220
doing really exciting
things, but to be

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.900
able to stay true to your
vision as a startup company.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.200
And be, not just a
feature or a product

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.730
that gets end-of-lifed at
another company, but actually

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.729
to become a core,
strategic element

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:09.770
of the company you're at.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.980
And at Box, we get
to do two things.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.890
We get to continue building this
really great technology that we

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.880
set out to build, with the same
vision of making content really

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.520
a first-class citizen on the
web, especially for documents.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.890
We get to expand what we're
doing so we're not just

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.620
selling a developer
tool anymore.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.931
But we're also developing
an end-user integration.

00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:28.930
So when you use Box, you
actually use our stuff.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.150
And these are all the things we
wanted to do as a seven person

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.010
company but just never
have the opportunity to,

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.218
without losing tons of focus.

00:05:34.218 --> 00:05:36.980
So it's been a really
great opportunity

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.070
to just be able to just do the
same thing that we were before,

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.806
but just to it 10 times better.

00:05:41.806 --> 00:05:43.430
DON DODGE: So that's
a great segue-way.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.070
Let's go back to those
earlier acquisition offers.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.580
Was it that the
price wasn't right?

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.660
Or the timing wasn't right?

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.650
Or the cultural
fit wasn't right?

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.189
What kinds of things
did you go through?

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:00.730
Because getting an acquisition
offer's pretty exciting stuff.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:01.730
RYAN DAMICO: Yeah it is.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.640
And looking back,
it's kind of funny

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.050
how your perspective
shifts over time.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.410
But for us, I mean,
we turned down

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.290
offers for all those reasons
and more at various points.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.580
But the main thing was timing.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.560
When you're a
startup, you really

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.930
are being super
ambitious in going

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.120
after a really large vision.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.680
And we especially didn't
want to give up on that

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.540
before we knew it
was even possible.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.062
And I think the timing
was great with Box

00:06:28.062 --> 00:06:30.270
because we validated the
technology we were building.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.440
We validated the market
need for what we were doing.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.291
And we ourselves were just
entering a big inflection

00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:35.790
point.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.370
So it was either-- going to
raise a big round of financing,

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.050
go join another
company-- something

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.600
big was going to happen.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.840
And it turned out that
the timing and the stars

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.339
kind of lined up
at the right point.

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:47.200
So we saw the path
to do what we really

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.160
wanted to do and effect
this huge change--

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.680
and just have a lot
of fun doing it,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.390
and work with a great company
that was already established.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.670
As a side note, had
we not gone down

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.690
the path we did-- where
we were licensing a web

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.940
API-- plan B was actually
to compete with Box.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.090
So it's a pretty small
world, and kind of funny

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.250
when we look back where
we were at that point.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.750
DON DODGE: So another
aspect of that

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.370
decision is, you
have investors who

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.660
invested in your company four
years ago or six years ago.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.910
They want an exit.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.430
So it's not just about
you and what you want.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.070
You had to balance the
promises made to investors.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.760
So how did you go
through that decision

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.300
and turn down earlier
acquisition offers

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.134
and accept this one?

00:07:28.134 --> 00:07:29.758
RYAN DAMICO: Yeah
well, it did turn out

00:07:29.758 --> 00:07:31.626
that this was a great
outcome for everyone.

00:07:31.626 --> 00:07:32.750
That's not always the case.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.730
A lot of companies will
just go lowball startups,

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:35.680
hoping that they just bite.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.790
And maybe sometimes that
makes sense for a startup

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.240
if things aren't going well.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.789
But we decided to hang in
there for the longer run.

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:43.580
And I think all of our
investors knew that.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.592
We were never in this
to just kind of flip

00:07:45.592 --> 00:07:46.550
the company real quick.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.190
We actually set out
to change something

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.826
that touches millions and
millions of people using

00:07:50.826 --> 00:07:52.700
all sorts of applications
all over the place.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.717
So lucky for our
investors, we didn't

00:07:54.717 --> 00:07:56.050
want to do a lifestyle business.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.150
So that would have been
a little bit difficult.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.840
But we really wanted
to make an impact.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.506
And then it turned
out that the best way

00:08:01.506 --> 00:08:04.090
to do that was to have a great
outcome for the investors too.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.465
DON DODGE: So
there was alignment

00:08:05.465 --> 00:08:09.900
between the investors
and the acquiring company

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.330
and what you wanted to do.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.940
Everything lined up
perfectly, and it

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.320
was a-- was it a fairly
obvious decision for you,

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.500
or was it still troubling?

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.458
RYAN DAMICO: It's hard.

00:08:18.458 --> 00:08:21.240
I don't think it's ever easy
to decide to sell your company.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.440
It was pretty difficult for us.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.190
Every time the
conversation would come up,

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.480
it just really
forces you to think

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.021
about where you're
going, what you're

00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:31.371
doing-- I think looking back,
it was just great timing for us.

00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:32.620
It was a really good decision.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.039
It was a really great fit.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.659
We're just happy
where we are now.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:38.700
But it's scary when
you're your own company.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.080
And the concept of
joining another one-- it's

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.789
a scary thought.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.540
It really forces you to
think through a lot of things

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.410
when you have a
conversation like that.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.020
And also as an
entrepreneur, you learn

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.480
that you don't want to go
through a process like that

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.320
unless you really think there's
a serious possibility that it's

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.320
going to go somewhere.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.819
Because otherwise
you can just spend

00:08:56.819 --> 00:09:00.892
a lot of mental and emotional
energy in an unnecessary way.

00:09:00.892 --> 00:09:02.600
