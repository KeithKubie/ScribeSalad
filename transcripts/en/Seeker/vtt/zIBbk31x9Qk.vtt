00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.080
Our galaxy is in the middle of NOWHERE.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.359
We’re regular joe’s, rockin' the boat...
at The Redneck Galaxy Club.

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.500
The universe seems chaotic, but it’s actually
not as bad as you think…

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.709
There is quite a bit of order.

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.330
20-percent of our universe is made of filaments...
like these.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.680
The other 80-percent of it… are voids of
mostly empty space.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.840
Superclusters, galaxies, planets, galactic
dust… everything is either densely-packed

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.740
into a filament or in a lonely void.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.110
And some researchers are saying our Milky
Way galaxy might exist smack-dab in the middle

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.620
of one the largest voids of them all.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.750
We could be living in the middle of nowhere!

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.330
Which is unusual for a galaxy!

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.840
It’s like we’re living in the boonies
and most other galaxies are in cities...

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.360
We’re so alone...

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.960
As scary as this may sound, the researchers
seem to think it’s not that big of a deal.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.540
It sounds like because we’re further away
from the filaments, our night sky is a bit

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.270
darker, but other that, not much else is different.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.540
There is something big that could come from
this study though (if it’s proven)…

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.620
Our universe is massive and it’s constantly
expanding.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.119
Just the observable cosmos reaches about 46
billion light-years!

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.820
But astronomers have been struggling for decades
to figure out the exact rate of expansion

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.899
-- also known as the Hubble Constant.

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.380
There are two methods to measure this -- to
look at nearby bright stars that are moving

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.840
away from us, or to look at the Cosmic Microwave
Background radiation (left over from the Big

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.959
Bang) and see how fast that is moving.

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:27.740
It’s actually a big debate, because these
two methods don’t give us the same Constant.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.610
This new research suggests that because we’re
in a void, gravity is pulling us closer to

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.439
the filaments and that movement could be messing
up calculations with the nearby stars.

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.860
So to put it all together -- if we do live
in the cosmic boonies, the CMB method of analyzing

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.759
the expansion of the universe is probably
more accurate!

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.399
So living out here is fine.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.960
I like country music anyway.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.700
So now that you know a bit more about what’s
inside our universe, don’t ya wanna know

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.900
about what’s outside of it?!

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.440
Check out this video here.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.660
Real talk though, would you rather live in
the city or the country?

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.200
