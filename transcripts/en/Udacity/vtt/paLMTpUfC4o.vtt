00:00:00.215 --> 00:00:04.310
Peer Feedback is a tool many classes
use for peer to peer review.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.950
The first time you're enrolled in
a class that uses Peer Feedback,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.080
you'll receive an email invitation.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.740
The link in that email will take
you to the account creation screen.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.290
Create your account using the email
that was pre-populated in the form, and

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.690
then click Register.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.010
Once you create your account you'll
see an invitation to join your class.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.610
Then click accept.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.790
The class will now appear
under your courses.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.420
Once your class is underway, you'll
see a number of tasks on the right.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.220
If your class lets you submit
assignments through Peer Feedback,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.230
you'll see some seat
assignment tasks on the right.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.190
&gt;&gt; Right now though, most classes that
use Peer Feedback have you submit your

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.660
assignment through either T-Square or
Udacity, and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.160
then they copy the assignment
over to Peer Feedback.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.140
So usually you won't submit
assignments directly to Peer Feedback.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.370
&gt;&gt; If you have received some feedback,
from peers or

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.520
graders, you will see
the View Feedback buttons at the top.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000
Click one of those to see your feedback.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.140
You'll see your scores along the rubric,
and you'll see some written feedback.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.870
You can also give some meta
feedback in the field below,

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.480
which can only be seen
by the teaching team.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.640
Back on the home screen,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.740
if you have some feedback to give,
you'll see these Give Feedback buttons.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.170
The data on the left is the deadline for
giving feedback.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.290
Click Give Feedback to
review the assignment.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.190
You'll see the assignment at the top,
and the rubric at the bottom.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.090
Evaluate the assignment
according to the Rubric,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.040
leave some written feedback,
and then click Submit.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.220
And if you have more feedback to give,
you can click here and just keep going.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.770
Finally, at any time,
you can review the feedback given and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.030
received by clicking the course,
and then clicking the assignment.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.310
You will see your assignment
submission on the left.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.710
Feedback you have received
in the middle, and

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.100
feedback you have given on the right.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.700
&gt;&gt; Some classes also use this tool for
grading.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.360
They actually have the graders or TAs in
the system grading assignments the same

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.000
way the peers are giving feedback.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.850
If you received a grade or
feedback from a TA through this system,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.850
it will be marked with a TA icon
in the Feedback for You box
