00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.560
This is a quadratic equation. We know it's not a linear equation because we

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.700
have this term that has an x squared in it.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.610
We also know that it's not an equation for

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.600
a parabola because x is the only variable. We don't have a y anywhere that we'd

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.000
be able to relate to x so we could graph the equation on a coordinate plane.
