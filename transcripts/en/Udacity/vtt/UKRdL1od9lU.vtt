00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.609
Here is my answer.

00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:05.050
We run the input program
M on the empty string.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.330
If this loops then N will as well.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.350
On the other hand,

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.370
if this halts, then we just accept
everything including the string 34.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.950
In one case,
the language of N is the empty set.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.800
In the other, it is sigma*,
every input string.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.240
And a decider for
L could tell the difference.
