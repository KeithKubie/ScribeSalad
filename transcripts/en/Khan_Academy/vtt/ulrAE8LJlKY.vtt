00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.475
- [Instructor] Let's say
we need to find a solution

00:00:02.475 --> 00:00:04.280
to the differential equation

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.379
that the derivative of y
with respect to x is equal

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.046
to x squared over e to the y.

00:00:12.183 --> 00:00:15.015
Pause this video and see
if you can have a go at it,

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.742
and I will give you a clue.

00:00:16.742 --> 00:00:20.766
It is a separable differential equation.

00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.316
All right, now let's do this together.

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:24.827
So, whenever you do any
differential equation,

00:00:24.827 --> 00:00:27.829
the first thing you should try
to see is, is it separable?

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.016
And when I say separable,

00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:33.083
I mean I can get all the
expressions that deal with y

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:36.768
on the same side as dy,
and I can separate those

00:00:36.768 --> 00:00:38.508
from the expressions that deal with x,

00:00:38.508 --> 00:00:42.708
and they need to be on the same
side as my differential dx.

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.274
So how can we do that?

00:00:44.274 --> 00:00:48.357
Well, if we multiply both
sides times e to the y,

00:00:49.305 --> 00:00:53.055
then e to the y will go
away right over here.

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:56.332
So we will get rid of this y expression

00:00:56.332 --> 00:00:57.823
from the right hand side,

00:00:57.823 --> 00:01:00.948
and then we can multiply both sides by dx.

00:01:00.948 --> 00:01:04.038
So, if we did that, just
let me move my screen

00:01:04.038 --> 00:01:05.632
over a bit to the left.

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:08.477
So I'm gonna multiply
both sides by e to the y,

00:01:08.477 --> 00:01:12.644
and I'm also gonna multiply
both sides by dx, times dx.

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.357
And multiplying by dx gets rid

00:01:16.357 --> 00:01:17.949
of the dx on the left hand side,

00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:20.815
and it sits on the right
hand side with the x squared.

00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:23.815
And so all of this is now e to the y

00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:27.074
dy is equal to x squared,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.643
x squared dx.

00:01:33.217 --> 00:01:35.629
And just the fact that we
were able to do this shows

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:37.138
that it is separable.

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:39.078
Now, what we can do now is integrate

00:01:39.078 --> 00:01:43.571
both sides of this
equation, so let's do that.

00:01:43.571 --> 00:01:46.988
So what is the integral of e to the y dy?

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:51.447
Well, one of the amazing
things about the expression,

00:01:51.447 --> 00:01:53.320
or you could say the function,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.525
something is equal to the e to the,

00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:56.871
and normally we say e to the x

00:01:56.871 --> 00:01:58.477
but in this case it's e to the y,

00:01:58.477 --> 00:02:01.591
is that the antiderivative
of this is just e to the y.

00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:02.973
We've learned that in multiple videos.

00:02:02.973 --> 00:02:05.893
I always express my fascination with it.

00:02:05.893 --> 00:02:07.825
So this is just e to the y.

00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:09.302
And likewise, if you took the derivative

00:02:09.302 --> 00:02:13.055
of e to the y with respect
to y, it would be e to the y.

00:02:13.055 --> 00:02:15.134
Remember, this works
because we are integrating

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:16.619
with respect to y here.

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:20.376
So the integral of e to
the y with respect to y,

00:02:20.376 --> 00:02:22.000
well, that's e to the y.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.219
And so that is going to be equal to

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.882
the antiderivative of x squared.

00:02:25.882 --> 00:02:28.037
Well, that is we increment the exponent,

00:02:28.037 --> 00:02:29.581
so that gets us to x to the third power,

00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:32.320
and we divide by that
incremented exponent.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.789
And since I took the indefinite
integral of both sides,

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:37.854
I have to put a constant on
at least one of these sides,

00:02:37.854 --> 00:02:41.236
so let me throw it over here, so plus c.

00:02:41.236 --> 00:02:42.601
And just to finish up,

00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:45.828
especially on a lot of
examination, like the AP exam,

00:02:45.828 --> 00:02:47.458
they might want you to write it in a form

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:50.541
where y is an explicit function of x.

00:02:51.786 --> 00:02:55.107
So to do that, we can take
the natural log of both sides.

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:57.018
So we take the natural log of that side,

00:02:57.018 --> 00:03:00.074
and we take the natural log of that side.

00:03:00.074 --> 00:03:02.214
Well, the natural log of e to the y,

00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:05.510
what power do we have to raise
e to to get to e to the y?

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.187
Well, that's why we took the natural log.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:10.056
This just simplifies as y.

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:12.139
And we get y is equal to,

00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:17.788
is equal to the natural log of
what we have right over here,

00:03:19.461 --> 00:03:22.211
x to the third over three plus c.

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:25.970
And we are done.
