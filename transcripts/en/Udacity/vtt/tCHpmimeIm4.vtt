00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For the next quiz, you are going to define a procedure that can help

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
solve the problem of figuring out how many different ways there are

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to order objects.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here is the problem we want to solve.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Suppose we have four blocks.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We have a red block.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We have a blue block.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We have a purple block and we have a green block.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We have a baby who wants to play with the blocks, and we want to know how

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
long can the baby play with the blocks without getting bored.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What the baby wants to do is try all the different ways of arranging the blocks.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The baby will stack the blocks in a tower.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The baby might pick the red block firstÃ¢Â€Â”put that on the ground.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Then put the blue block on top.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Then put the the purple block on top of that, and then

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
put the green block on top.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
When she's made one tower, she is going to knock it down and

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
make another one.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
She's going to keep doing this as long as she can make different

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
color combinations.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If she has to make the same tower twiceÃ¢Â€Â”well, that's pretty boring.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Maybe the next one she'll pick the purple block first, then she'll pick

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the red block, then she'll pick the blue block, and then she'll pick

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the green block.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
These two are different.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The question we want to answer is, how many different towers

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
can she build?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Given that she has four blocks, we want to know how many different towers

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
could you build with four blocks, but maybe she gets some more blocks.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
What we really want to know isÃ¢Â€Â”given that she has "n" blocksÃ¢Â€Â”whatever

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
number "n" isÃ¢Â€Â”how many different towers could you build where

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the color combinations are all different?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The way to solve that is to think about combinatorics.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The way to pick the first blockÃ¢Â€Â”well, it could be any one of these four.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We have four choices.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Let's sayÃ¢Â€Â”for our exampleÃ¢Â€Â”she chooses the red block first.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Now it's time to choose the second block.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Well, she can't use the red block again.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
She has already used it, so she can either use the purple, the blue,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
or the green block.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
She has three choices now.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
She can use the purple block, the blue block, or the green block.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Let's say she chooses the green block, so she is going to have the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
red block and then the green block.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
She had three choices.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
She could have chosen any of the other two, but now that she has chosen

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
the red and the green, she only has two choices left for the third block.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
She can either use the purple one or she could use the blue oneÃ¢Â€Â”those

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
are the only two that are left.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Let's say she uses the purple one.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Now for the final blockÃ¢Â€Â”well, she's used the red one, she's used

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the green one, and she's used the purple one.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The only one that's left is the blue one, so she has no choice but to use

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
the blue block.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
That means for the fourth block, there was only one choice.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So, for each of these choices, she could choose any of the four

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
for the first one, any of the three remaining ones for the second

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
oneÃ¢Â€Â”regardless of what she picked for the first one.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
If she picked red, she could pick either purple, blue, or green, but if she'd

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
pickedÃ¢Â€Â”sayÃ¢Â€Â”blue for the first one, then what she'd have left is purple,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
red, and green.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
She always has three choices for the second one.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
After that, there's only two choices leftÃ¢Â€Â”there's only two blocks left and she

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
can choose either one.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The pattern here is every time she chooses a block there's one less

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
because she's used the block in the previous choice.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
For the total number of choices, what we want to do is multiply

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
all these numbers.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
To figure out the total number of choices, what we need to do is multiply

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
the number of choices for the first block, and then we multiply that by the number

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
of choices for the second and we keep going for however many

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
choices there areÃ¢Â€Â”in this case there are only fourÃ¢Â€Â”until we get down to one.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Each time we make a choice, we have one fewer items left to use for

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
the next choice.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So the function that we are computing here is mathematically called

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
factorial, and it's sometimes written with an exclamation point.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
A way to define factorial isÃ¢Â€Â”for any value n, we can compute the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
factorial, which is the number of ways of arranging "n" items.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
We can compute that by multiplying "n"Ã¢Â€Â”which is the number of choices

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
for the first itemÃ¢Â€Â”times "n" minus oneÃ¢Â€Â”that's the number of choices

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
we have left for the second itemÃ¢Â€Â”times "n" minus twoÃ¢Â€Â”that's the number of

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
choices for the third item and so fourth, all the way until we get down to one.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So, your goal for this quiz is to define a procedure named "factorial" that

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
takes one number as its inputÃ¢Â€Â”that's the number "n" hereÃ¢Â€Â”and

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
outputs the factorial of that number, which we can compute by

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
multiplying "n" times "n" minus one all the way down to one.
