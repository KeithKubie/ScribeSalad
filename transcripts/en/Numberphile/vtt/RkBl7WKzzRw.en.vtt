00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.320
A proof has been announced of a
unsolved, so far, conjecture

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.720
called the abc Conjecture.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.580
If this proof is right, then
it's going to be news on the

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.460
scale of Fermat's last theorem
was in the '90s, which was

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.100
this big unsolved problem.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.500
And was this huge event.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.570
So it's really exciting.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.660
We don't know if this proof is
right yet, so a Japanese

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.270
mathematician called Mochizuki
has released these papers, and

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.310
altogether, it's
500 pages long.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.700
He's been working on this
for a very long time.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.060
He's come up with his own theory
of maths-- a whole new

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.870
body of maths--

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.350
and he's called it
interuniversal geometry.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.980
I know nothing about that.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.830
Very few people do.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.100
Even the experts don't know much
about this at the moment.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.800
So it's going to take a very
long time to make sure if the

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.310
proof is right, because they're
going to have to learn

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.220
this whole new theory
of mathematics.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.170
So the abc Conjecture involves
the most simple formula you

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.140
can think of.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.330
It's this--

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.110
a plus b equals c.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.130
It doesn't get much
easier than that.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.010
And that's where it gets
its name from.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.650
The rules are, these are whole
numbers, and they don't share

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.955
any factors.

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:25.160
So that means if I can divide
a by 2, then I'm not allowed

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.970
to divide b by 2.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.350
Or if I could divide a by 3,
then b is not allowed to be

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.320
divisible by three.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.010
They're not allowed to share
any factors like that.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.100
All right, let's try an
example that works.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:46.130
1,024 plus 81 equals 1,105.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.720
Right, now let's just check they
don't share any factors.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.280
In fact, I've picked
these on purpose.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.090
This one is 2 to the power of
10, and this one is 3 to the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.830
power of 4.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.290
So they don't share
any factors there.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:10.289
Oh, and this one, I'll do the
same, is 5 times 13 times 17.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.000
Now, this is what I want
you to notice.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.610
On the left hand side, you've
got lots of prime numbers.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.480
We've got all 10 of them over
here, and another four.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.920
Loads of them over here.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.050
On the right hand side, you only
have three, and this is

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.200
what you tend to see
most of the time.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.570
This is what's normal.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.930
If you get lots of primes on the
left, you only get a few

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.820
on the right hand side.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.230
So this is what the conjecture
is about.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.610
I want to show you one where
it doesn't work.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.870
3 plus 125.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.530
That's equal to 128.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.950
Let's just check they don't
share any factors then-- well,

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.380
that's 3, this is 5 cubed,
and this, 128, is 2

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.070
the power of 7.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.780
Now, this one is not like the
first one I showed you.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.490
You've only got a few primes
on the left, but we've got

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.880
loads more on a right.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.800
So you've got more on the right
than you do on the left.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.630
That's unusual.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.400
That's weird.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.170
So rather than not working, like
I said earlier, it's the

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.020
unusual example.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.210
These don't happen so often.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.090
So the technical way to
say this is this.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.780
Times those primes together.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.460
So I'm going to do that.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.500
So 2 times 3 times 5 times
13 times 17, and

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.920
that equals to 13,260.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.550
It's a big number, and it's
bigger than the right hand

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.820
side, which was this.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.420
That's what normally happens.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.680
OK, so if you do this, you
get a bigger number.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.010
I'm going to show you this one
that I said was unusual.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.250
If we do the same thing--

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.130
3 times 5 times 2, that's
equal to 30, and that's

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.170
smaller than 128.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.850
So that's the difference.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.100
So this is unusual.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.740
This is much smaller than
the right hand side.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.140
This number, when you multiply
the primes together, is called

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.180
the radical of ABC.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.070
It's called the radical because
it is [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.550
The abc Conjecture
is the radical--

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.020
which I told you how to work
out, that's this--

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.570
the radical of abc is bigger
than the right hand side.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.769
I said that was c.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.360
That's what you get normally.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.110
In fact, the conjecture
is more than that.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.940
It talks about the powers
of that, too.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.140
But there are exceptions, and
these are the exceptions.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.820
When k equals 1-- that's
the power is 1--

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:43.320
there are infinitely many
exceptions just like the one

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.750
I've just shown you there.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.150
Infinitely many, even though I
said these were the rare ones,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.310
the unusual ones, there are
infinitely many of them.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.300
But if you take a power bigger
than 1, even if it's only a

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:04.350
little bit bigger, even if it's
like a power of 1.00001--

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.810
tiny, tiny little bit bigger--

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:14.115
if it's bigger than 1, then
you get finitely many

00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:17.090
exceptions.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.230
And this is a little bit
surprising, because, yes, if

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.230
it's just a little bit bigger
than 1, you get finitely many

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.940
exceptions.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.470
You could count them off.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.930
You could write them down.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.620
You could say, here are all the
exceptions for this power.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.720
And that's unusual.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.120
That's unexpected.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.220
Now, this is the conjecture.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.770
It's very abstract.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.200
It's very pure.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.810
This was made in the '80s,
this conjecture.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.520
But if this can be proven, what
it's going to do is it's

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.500
going to prove a whole bunch
of other stuff at a stroke.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.060
And that's why it's big news.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.930
Originally, they thought that
Fermat's last theorem, which I

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.790
talked about being solved in
the '90s, they thought this

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.230
was the way to solve it.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.020
Because there is a way that, if
you can solve this, you can

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.770
solve a version of Fermat's
last theorem.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.530
It didn't turn out that way,
because Fermat's last theorem

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.230
was solved first.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.050
I heard of it, I think, before
it went around the nerdy

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.020
blogs, and I thought, well,
we could talk about it on

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.490
Numberphile.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.550
But then, it's still not been
checked, so maybe we shouldn't

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.140
talk about it on Numberphile.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.570
But then when all the blocks
started going mad about it, I

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.940
thought someone might ask us.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.300
I mean, that's how you probe
extra dimensions.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.190
That's how you probe
the very small.
