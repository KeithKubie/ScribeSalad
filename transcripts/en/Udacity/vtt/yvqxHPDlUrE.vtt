00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.200
So what are some of the challenges
when it comes to the CFAA or the DMCA?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.400
The laws that we just talked
about related to fraud abuse and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.450
protection of distal objects.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.370
First of all, enforcement is
actually quite challenging.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.390
It's difficult for a number of reason
first of all, attribution is hard.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.110
How exactly do you know that this is
the person who was responsible for

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.620
something fraudulent that was done?

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.160
We know that a request or data may
have flowed to a certain computer,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.730
but there may be malware
sitting on that computer.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.610
It may not be any fault of the person
who owns that computer, it could be some

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.370
bot that's under the control of somebody
else who's actually doing that.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.250
So how exactly do you attribute
a certain illegal activity,

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.270
or action to a person?

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.510
And what makes this really even harder

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.442
is the fact that the internet
has no national boundaries.

00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:04.940
So that international nature or the
transnational nature of the internet,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.070
of course presents another
set of challenges.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.880
Finally, I think we had
a quiz question talking about

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.410
have the various laws related
to computer fraud done any good?

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.510
Have they reduced cyber crime or
has cyber crime gone up?

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.960
Well one of the challenges that we,
making laws is a slow process.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.950
And cyber criminals can
basically stay ahead of it.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.760
The criminal ecosystem
can keep evolving.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.000
They can work around the legal
safeguards we put in place.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.490
Though and that can happen very rapidly,
much faster than our ability

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.520
to put laws in place and
find ways to enforce them,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.330
get people in front of judges and
courts and things like that.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.550
So there have been cases
we're going to look at a few,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.130
but obviously one of the challenges.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.590
How do you stay current with what is
going on in the cyber criminal world?
