00:00:05.748 --> 00:00:06.710
BOB OMER: Well, thanks.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.835
Thanks for having us today.

00:00:07.835 --> 00:00:10.430
We're actually excited to
be here, and appreciate

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.400
the opportunity to come in and
tell you a little bit what Defy

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.475
Ventures Colorado is about.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:21.487
I think the place to
start is entrepreneurship.

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:23.070
And you might think
to yourself, well,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.880
why are we talking about
entrepreneurship with work

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.170
that you do in prisons?

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.460
And our belief is that
entrepreneurship is actually

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.160
one of the keys to giving
people a second chance who

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.980
are incarcerated within
the state of Colorado

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.590
as well as in the United States.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.070
And so you might think
to yourself, well,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.950
what does that mean
to be an entrepreneur?

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.800
How are you teaching
entrepreneurship?

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.060
And I think what we
have found the best way

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.520
to do that is just to give you a
short glimpse into what happens

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.320
into one of our prisons.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.435
And so I'm just going to play
for you a short video that--

00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:58.207
it's about 60 seconds long.

00:00:58.207 --> 00:00:58.874
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:58.874 --> 00:00:59.778
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:59.778 --> 00:01:02.150
- Colorado should
be the worst place

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.040
to commit a violent
crime, and the best

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.340
place to get a second chance.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.830
I think what Defy does,
it defies the odds,

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.600
it defies the traditional way
of looking at rehabilitation,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.650
and kind of creates its own
energy, its own hurricane,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.460
a possibility.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.436
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.300
My goodness, this
is a happy day.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.240
We're showing that we can
become more than our past.

00:01:54.192 --> 00:01:54.918
[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:54.918 --> 00:01:56.210
BOB OMER: So what do you think?

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.640
Maybe not what you expect
to be happening in prisons,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.380
particularly in our more secure
prisons within the state.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.440
And you probably got
a sense from watching

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.020
that video the energy,
but also the passion that

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.639
came from the
community, maybe even

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.992
recognized a few of the faces.

00:02:12.992 --> 00:02:15.450
And part of the reason we love
coming out to the community,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.630
particularly here in Boulder,
to talk with everyone

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.100
is Defy was very much born out
of the passion for innovation

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.910
here in Boulder.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.310
And I don't know if
anybody recognizes,

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.160
obviously, we have the
former governor up here,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.540
Brad Feld, a couple of other
people from the Foundry Group.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.910
And the Foundry Group
were really the proponents

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.120
to bring Defy
Ventures to Colorado,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.530
that passion for
entrepreneurship,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.690
that passion of bringing
the community together

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.100
to try to solve one
of society's problems.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.820
And so, our goal here today
is to spend the next 10 to 15

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.010
minutes to tell you a little
bit about Defy Ventures

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.250
Colorado, the kind of the
what, the why, and the how.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.830
And I'm going to have our
program manager, Stacey Putka,

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.570
come up and do that.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.400
And before we move
to that, I just

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.490
want to encourage
everybody in the room--

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.260
our goal today is to make this
as interactive as possible.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.350
And so we'll have plenty
of time for Q&amp;A at the end.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.600
But if anybody
has any questions,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.350
feel free to ask
them at any point.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.540
When we get done with our
overview of the program

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.440
from Stacey, we've actually
got a very diverse panel here

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.370
who brings quite
differing perspectives

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.800
from the incarcerated sector
in terms of talking about Defy

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.400
the program, but
more importantly,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.978
how we can all come together
to solve this issue.

00:03:34.978 --> 00:03:36.770
And so with that, I'm
going to turn it over

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.455
to Stacey, who will come up
and talk about the program.

00:03:39.455 --> 00:03:41.650
STACEY PUTKA: So,
Defy Ventures Colorado

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.522
was born out of the idea
that we lack some things.

00:03:44.522 --> 00:03:45.980
We think about our
past, we can all

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.190
think of something that
we've done that we're not

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.750
necessarily proud of.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.090
And we believe in second
chances and providing

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.270
those second chances
through entrepreneurship.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.570
We do that in a
really unique way

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.590
that most programs
that work with people

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.660
with criminal histories
aren't able to do,

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.310
that we're very lucky to do.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.770
So we start inside
prisons, and we

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.070
provide an eight-month long
program called "CEO of Your New

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.250
Life" where individuals
engage in character

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.430
development, career readiness,
and entrepreneurial education.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.570
So you can see up here from
are very complicated program

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.510
diagram, that we start
inside the facilities,

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.760
and then we continue to work
with people once they are

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.798
released from incarceration.

00:04:28.798 --> 00:04:30.590
There are a few things
that we do with them

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.030
when they are released.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.630
One is they go through what's
called "Pathways to Re-entry"

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.400
where they basically get
stable in the community--

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.190
housing, health care,
jobs, financial stability--

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.310
so that they don't need to
revert to old ways of thinking

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.650
or being.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.310
They're stable.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.590
Once they're stable
within their communities,

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.960
they can go into our business
incubator, where they then

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.320
learn to actually start and
run their own small business

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.510
that they planned and
worked on while they

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.560
were currently incarcerated.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.990
So you can see
that our mission is

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.350
to transform the lives of
people with criminal histories

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.880
along the
entrepreneurial journey.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.880
The reason that we do
this is because America

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.370
has a prison crisis.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.690
We have 5% of the
world's population,

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.610
but 20% of the world's
incarcerated population.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.970
30% of 23-year-olds
have a criminal history.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.012
So whether you're watching
this on your computer,

00:05:31.012 --> 00:05:33.095
or you're sitting in the
audience, how many of you

00:05:33.095 --> 00:05:34.790
can think of something
really stupid

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.790
that you did before
the time you were 23?

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.900
We think that's really early
to start writing people off.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.190
Of people who go to
prison, 67% of them

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.920
are rearrested and
go back to prison

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.750
within three years
of being released.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.900
In Colorado, it's 45%.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.380
Having a criminal history makes
it significantly difficult

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.560
to get and maintain employment.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.060
People who have a
criminal history

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.940
have employment rates that are
27% lower than other people.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.120
And by checking the box,
"I have a felony history"

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.580
on a job application
reduces their chances

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.830
of getting a callback
from an employer by 50%.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.353
So, not only do we have a
program in prison that's

00:06:22.353 --> 00:06:24.270
eight months long where
they work on character

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.960
development, entrepreneurship,
and career readiness,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.720
we bring in volunteers to
help them along that journey.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.190
So last year alone, we brought
in over 340 volunteers.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:40.350
We brought in 452 Googlers
in our counterpart

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.150
in northern California.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.090
So, Googlers have been involved
in this for a very long time

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.270
in northern California.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.690
And we're looking
to get Googlers here

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.100
in Colorado involved as well.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.473
The secret sauce to what
works, why this program works,

00:06:54.473 --> 00:06:56.640
is the community that we
build around the people who

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.650
are currently incarcerated.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.040
It's very rare for someone
who's incarcerated to see anyone

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.130
else other than correctional
officers and their family

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.450
members.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.040
So to have these
opportunities to talk

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.830
about character development,
career readiness, and business

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.180
with top executives and
empathetically-minded people

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.850
from the community allows them
an extra advantage to success

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.620
once they reintegrate
into society

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.570
that most people don't have.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:30.240
So on that theme of building
community and having

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.940
this community travel with
the people in our program

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.300
from the inside to the outside,
I'm going to bring Bob back up,

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.940
and he's going to introduce
some of our key stakeholders

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.440
in the community who are going
to give you guys a little bit

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.367
more information.

00:07:42.367 --> 00:07:44.950
BOB OMER: So, why don't we start
with-- go down the line, just

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.500
start with a brief intro.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.660
A lot of it'll come out as
we go through our panel,

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.300
but maybe spend one or two
minutes just telling us

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.800
a little bit about yourself,
and why you're here today.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.605
And we'll start next
to me with Brandon.

00:07:55.605 --> 00:07:57.480
BRANDON HAGANS: So my
name is Brandon Hagans.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.700
I'm the Gang
Intelligence supervisor

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.310
at Colorado State Penitentiary.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.140
Colorado State
Penitentiary is where

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.350
we keep probably the
most dangerous offenders

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.180
in the State of Colorado.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.145
And we were actually
the first facility--

00:08:11.145 --> 00:08:12.270
were we the first facility?

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:16.170
We were the first facility
to give us this program a go.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:20.010
Initially when we were told
that they were going to come in,

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.380
and this is what
they wanted to do,

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:28.170
it scared us just because of
our [INAUDIBLE] population.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.540
So we sat down, and
we picked 20 guys

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.909
that we thought we
could put in a room

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:36.039
without them trying
to kill each other

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:39.570
and keeping these
wonderful individuals safe.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.850
And it worked out.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.210
And from that initial
class, just the amount

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.490
of guys that are
wanting to get into this

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.880
and participate in it, I
mean, it's just been amazing.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.390
Our violence within our facility
has dropped off drastically.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.070
I can't give you
exact percentages,

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.870
but I can tell you
being in there day

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.370
in and day out that
our violence has

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.890
dropped because these guys
want to get in this program.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.071
They want to do better for
themselves and learn something.

00:09:07.777 --> 00:09:10.060
BOB BUCHOLZ: Hello,
my name's Bob Bucholz.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.220
I work for the Colorado
Department of Corrections.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.340
I work at the Arkansas
Valley Correctional Facility.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.120
That's about two
hours east of Pueblo.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.560
And Defy fire has--

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.750
from what we can tell,
has made a huge difference

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.560
in our population as
far as having offenders

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.540
involved in the program have
bled over to them talking

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.030
to staff, which before--

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.030
I mean, that's kind of the no
man's land as far as offenders

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.910
wanting to talk to staff.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:44.260
And Defy, when they're
working on their programs,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.900
the offenders are
working on their plans,

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.720
they end up coming and
asking staff for input,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.480
which is really neat.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.626
It's a really neat
opportunity for us and them.

00:09:56.626 --> 00:09:59.360
RONNIE MADRID: Hi, my
name is Ronnie Madrid.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.160
And I am an entrepreneur
in training,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:09.790
graduate from the first class
in Colorado State Penitentiary.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.160
I agree, it's been amazing.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.820
I had to work my butt off
to get into that class.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.930
And it absolutely
changed the path

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:25.200
that I was taking before, simply
because the people with Defy

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.090
who came in, as well as this
gentlemen right here, they

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.110
are the first ones probably
throughout my whole life who

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.760
actually gave me a chance.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.300
And seeing that, I wanted to
do better so I could be better.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:42.310
And I've been able to
present myself to the world

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:46.240
while I'm working on
being towards my best.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.850
And it's because of the things
that I have around me now,

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.850
the people that I
have around me now,

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:58.190
from what I learned about myself
in transition from being a gang

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.940
member and a drug
dealer, somebody

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.780
who made terrible choices
throughout his life

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.090
to a single father
who wants to learn how

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:14.090
to cook so my kids don't have
to eat Hot Pockets anymore,

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.100
Fruity Pebbles.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.970
And they help me
when I'm out here.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.420
Izzy's always asking if she
can help me with anything.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.980
It really does extend
from the inside

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.230
out when not a
lot of programs do

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.660
that are involved with the
Department of Corrections.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.115
Thank you.

00:11:33.115 --> 00:11:35.520
TOM WYMAN: Hey, I'm Tom Wyman.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.820
I'm a volunteer
from the community.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.090
I'm on the Defy Ventures
Colorado Advisory Board.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.980
I used to work at Google,
Boulder Office for six years

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.015
a while back.

00:11:50.015 --> 00:11:52.400
Now I'm with a company
called Building Ventures.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:59.000
But, yeah I've been a
volunteer with Defy Colorado

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.815
for about a year.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.680
First saw it from a
Brad Feld blog post.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.245
He was talking about his
experience in prison and how--

00:12:11.245 --> 00:12:13.370
I mean, the enthusiasm just
completely came through

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.262
in the blog post.

00:12:14.262 --> 00:12:17.450
And the end, after describing
his whole day and what

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.980
it was like, he had Bob's
email at the bottom.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.227
And so I e-mailed Bob
to find out what's

00:12:24.227 --> 00:12:25.310
the story with this thing.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:28.130
And he, and Stacey, and
I went out to lunch.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:32.930
And then Stacey, Izzy,
and I went in to prison.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:37.690
And yeah, I lost track at how
many times have gone back.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.520
It's been a wonderful thing.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.590
TRAVIS TAYLOR: Oh, me?

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.360
My name is Travis Taylor.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.850
And that wonderful,
beautiful human being

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.010
that you see to my
left and your right

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.060
with the long hair
and glasses, he and I

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.400
are four years and
four hours apart.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.480
He is my younger brother.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.670
His name is Darius Taylor.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.420
I am the very,
very proud brother

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.330
of an Arkansas Valley
Correctional Facility

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.010
EIT and graduate.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:13.630
I met Bob at my little
brother's graduation.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.975
And to say the meeting
was life changing

00:13:16.975 --> 00:13:20.320
does not do it justice.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.660
Defy, in order for it to
reach the communities the way

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:31.060
that we expected, we will
need people such as yourselves

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.100
to see what we see.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.500
And part of that is
going to be today.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:40.510
And I hope you become as excited
about joining Defy and having

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.650
it do what it did in my life
and in my family's life for you

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:45.370
and yours.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.766
So, I thank you
all for being here.

00:13:47.766 --> 00:13:48.770
BOB OMER: That's great.

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:52.810
So we've got about
as diverse as you

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.600
can get in this issue, two
people who actually work

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.570
inside the prison,
somebody who was in prison,

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:00.910
and then two volunteers, and
one who brings the family

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.843
perspective that's there.

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:05.260
The question I would like to
go to-- and I guess I'm going

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.790
to do this because the two
people who drove the farthest--

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.373
Bob you drove, what, about three
and 1/2 hours to come up here

00:14:10.373 --> 00:14:14.270
for an hour, and Brandon
about two and 1/2 hours is--

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.400
why did you do that?

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.817
I mean, why did
you get in the car

00:14:16.817 --> 00:14:21.538
and drive up here, and come
here and talk, and explain

00:14:21.538 --> 00:14:23.080
the perspective from
your standpoint?

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.010
Bob, do you want to go first?

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:24.760
BOB BUCHOLZ: Sure.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.000
I made the trip because Defy
has, like I stated earlier,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.710
has made a huge impact for
us on the prison population.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.630
It was actually impressive
on the first day

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.410
they came in there, we
had over 100 offenders.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.890
And when they started
off the program there,

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.900
it was amazing how they could
control the offender population

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.550
in that room.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.610
The respect that happened
between the volunteers

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:01.290
and the actual offenders in
the room was just incredible.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.420
And it was really nice for us
to see us staff working there

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:08.390
because we're there to help,
we're not there to punish.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.450
The courts have
already done that.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:14.480
Our job is to help out
for them to be successful.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.980
And it's great because when
you looked at Defy's mission

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.950
statement, it actually
leads right into our mission

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.890
statement, which is a successful
reentry of all offenders

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.960
back into society.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.150
So it really matches up well.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.520
That's worked very well.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.200
It keeps them busy.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.660
You can walk through at
night, do cell checks,

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.150
look in the doors,
they're actually

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.490
working on their business plan.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.200
They take it serious.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.610
So that's been a really,
really good program.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:46.840
And we believe in it.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.345
BOB OMER: Brandon,
what about you?

00:15:49.345 --> 00:15:54.070
BRANDON HAGANS: So for me coming
from CSP and just the clientele

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.710
that we have there,
when we initially

00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:00.340
walked these guys into the
room to start this program,

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.340
usually when they leave they day
hall, they're fully restrained.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:07.030
Wrist, ankles, they've
got handcuffs everywhere.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.640
And this was the first time we
ever took these individuals,

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.470
and put them in
our visiting room,

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.290
and took the cuffs off
with a bunch of volunteers.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.550
And it was kind of hairy.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.430
It didn't feel right
for the environment.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.900
But once they got rolling
with the program, I mean,

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.240
these guys were standing
up hugging each other.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:30.310
And the whole time I'm thinking,
please don't hurt anybody.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:32.470
But this program gave them hope.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.890
With the volunteers coming
in, a lot of these guys,

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.300
they don't get
family to come in.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.580
They don't have much
communication at all.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.362
And when the volunteers
come in, they

00:16:41.362 --> 00:16:42.820
give them a sense
of being, a sense

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.040
of hope, a sense of purpose.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.410
And it's just amazing to
see their faces light up,

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.770
the changes they make, their
demeanor, their attitudes,

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:55.925
it's just amazing to
watch these guys change.

00:16:55.925 --> 00:16:58.300
BOB OMER: Ron, I want to direct
this next question to you

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.337
because I think what would
be beneficial for the people

00:17:01.337 --> 00:17:02.920
here in the room and
watching on video

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.740
is to understand that that
initial engagement point,

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:07.240
right?

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.460
We didn't talk about it
earlier, but real quickly

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.480
the Defy program is an
eight-month program.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.910
I would describe
it as intensive.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:16.952
Obviously, we'd love your
opinion on that an hour

00:17:16.952 --> 00:17:19.180
or two a day to stay up with it.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.140
Why did you come
into the program?

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.567
And then what kept you going
through those eight months

00:17:24.567 --> 00:17:26.859
because obviously, there were
the ups and downs of life

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.776
that were happening as
you went through that.

00:17:29.776 --> 00:17:31.780
RONNIE MADRID: OK, Bob.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.420
I came into the program because
it's an entrepreneurship

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.460
program.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.290
I was in prison for
a distribution case.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:42.680
I gangbanged my whole life.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:47.190
I lost my wife 18 months
ago to a drug overdose.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:51.140
She started using drugs, the
same drugs that I was selling.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.080
She lost her life
eventually after it.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.930
Our kids were separated.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.320
I'm still fighting
for my kids right now.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.850
And so when that stuff
started to happen to me,

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:07.565
and I seen where
my life was headed,

00:18:07.565 --> 00:18:10.190
I realized that it was time for
me to absolutely make a change,

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.680
or I was in a die in prison.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.190
And at that point, the
most important thing to me

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.330
was family.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.340
And I have a job right now.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.150
I'm in a halfway house.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.220
I got out December 26.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.428
And it's the third job that
I've ever had in my life.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.140
But the entrepreneurship
program, when I went in there,

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:35.100
and we were working on our
resumes, and our job skills,

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.322
I realized that I have
marketing, distribution,

00:18:38.322 --> 00:18:39.030
quality control--

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.640
[LIGHT LAUGHTER]

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.870
--customer service.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.654
I have all of these--

00:18:43.654 --> 00:18:46.220
I have all of these
skills that I can tran--

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.620
that are transferable
skills that Stacey has--

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.550
you know, she's my [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.630
You could do this.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:58.325
And I realized I
absolutely can, and I will.

00:18:58.325 --> 00:19:00.950
Right now, I'm trying to get it
approved with the halfway house

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.255
for me to go to Metro State.

00:19:03.255 --> 00:19:05.130
I want to go for
organizational communication

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:10.100
so I can be a
mentor, a consultant.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.940
I want to be able to
just pass the buck.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:19.160
I also want to look into some
certification for addictions

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.135
counseling simply because I've
been on both sides of the dope

00:19:23.135 --> 00:19:24.020
game.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.182
I've been in the streets.

00:19:26.182 --> 00:19:27.890
I was a gang leader
from my neighborhood,

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:28.740
and I walked away.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.950
And that was the scariest--

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:33.740
to walk away from the streets,
it was the scariest thing

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:38.960
that I've ever done in my
life because I had made it

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.810
through the ups and the downs.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:45.260
The Colorado State Penitentiary,
I don't know if you are aware,

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.570
but it's the absolute worst
that the State of Colorado

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.612
has to offer as far as
punishment minus the death

00:19:49.612 --> 00:19:51.470
penalty.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:52.598
You go to prison--

00:19:52.598 --> 00:19:54.140
you get in trouble,
you go to prison.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.182
You get in trouble in
prison, you go to the hole.

00:19:56.182 --> 00:19:58.250
You keep getting in
trouble, they send your butt

00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.780
to Colorado State Penitentiary.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.060
And it's a war zone.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.020
It's a war zone.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.270
They let us out for breakfast.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.118
And everybody's
running into the shower

00:20:07.118 --> 00:20:09.410
so they could go get their
shower because we might have

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.868
been locked down for six, seven
days because of a stabbing,

00:20:11.868 --> 00:20:14.280
or an assault, or
something like that.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.690
And as soon as three
or four minutes later,

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.720
it's doo, doo, doo,
first responders.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.970
And it's literally a war zone.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.500
But when Defy came, and
we were ready to go,

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.600
every Tuesday I
was like, I'm gone.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.560
I'm leaving this place.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.340
I'm getting some sanity
on [INAUDIBLE],, some peace

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.602
for a while because everybody
in that program was like,

00:20:34.602 --> 00:20:35.810
this is not what we're doing.

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.880
This is what we're
doing for us tomorrow.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.160
We can leave all the
politics and all the prison

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.470
stuff back at the house.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:43.610
And everybody did it.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.298
I don't know how
these people did it.

00:20:45.298 --> 00:20:47.340
I don't know Bob, and
Stacey, and the volunteers,

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.730
and everybody came
in, but they did it.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.620
I got seriously-- this man
right here said they do walks,

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.990
and people are doing
their homework.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.060
And they're big books like this.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:02.210
And I would literally
stay in my room

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.000
some days for two or
three hours thinking

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.330
about what I need to
say for this answer

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.630
because it affected me because
I really wanted that change.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:14.750
And these people really put
forth the effort, and the time,

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.320
and were patient with us.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.360
They literally laid on the
floor with us and were like,

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.135
we're here.

00:21:22.135 --> 00:21:24.260
We've got something if you
want to accept it, fine.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.400
You now what I mean?

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.160
We're willing to give it
to you all the way through.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.440
And they follow through.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.790
It started on the inside.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:37.280
I came out, and this is the
best I've ever done in my life.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.780
This is the best I've
ever done in my life.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.870
I know for sure I'll be a
multimillionaire in five

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:46.610
years-- legit, legit, legit,
legit, seriously legit.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:50.773
BOB OMER: But that's great.

00:21:50.773 --> 00:21:52.190
I think that's
interesting, right?

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.650
As we go down the line, we
hear the impact in prisons.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:56.450
We hear the impact
Ron in your life.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:22:00.710
But I want to switch to
hear about the impact

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:04.380
that Tom and Travis have
seen both from themselves

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.720
and the community.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.970
But I think Travis, I want
to start with you as I also

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.730
talk a little bit
about the impact you've

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:15.620
seen in your brother, Darius,
who's at Arkansas Valley.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:25.740
TRAVIS TAYLOR: So, usually I
tell the story about my brother

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.400
and how he wound up in prison.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:35.340
But listening to that, I want
to back up just a second.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:42.510
So when my brother first went
to prison, the first time,

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.880
it was in 2001--

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.780
or 2000.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.150
He went from 2000 to 2005.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:50.598
He's in the federal
penitentiary,

00:22:50.598 --> 00:22:52.140
and he was prosecuted
under something

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.500
called Project
Exile, where if you

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.230
carry a gun, an illegal gun
in the State of Colorado,

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.570
you automatically got a
five-year federal prison

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:01.440
sentence.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.070
Don't pass go.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:03.570
Don't collect $200.

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.980
Don't say hi to your momma.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.180
You're gone.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.610
My brother was 19 years old.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.880
My brother went to
prison at 19 weighing--

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.140
he was 5'4"--

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.780
5'5" weighing 140 pounds.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:22.100
My brother came out of
prison weighing 215 pounds.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.190
And he looked like one
of them action figures

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.890
from Batman or something.

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.530
Now, for the rest of
us, we're like, oh, OK.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:37.100
Well, my brother stayed for
exactly six weeks, six weeks.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:41.870
That second time, they sent
my brother away for 44 years.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.490
Let that sink in your
head for a second--

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:51.010
44 years.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.040
The problem with
that is my brother

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.190
wasn't doing 44 years alone.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:24:02.550
My mother, myself, my father,
his sister, nieces, nephews,

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:07.350
we all got that 44-year
prison sentence.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:10.650
We all got the five-year
prison sentence.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:15.180
We all got the
six-week furlough.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.260
So my brother never
understood this concept.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.470
No matter how many times
we tried to talk to him,

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.740
there was a period where
I didn't write, speak,

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.420
or talk to my brother.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.850
He'd write letters,
I'd take the letters--

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.100
and someday if I ever see
y'all again, I'll show you--

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.690
I kept the box.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.730
And y'all didn't know this.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.580
I kept the box of
the unopened letters

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.860
because I didn't feel
he deserved my energy

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:46.740
or time to read another
excuse, another it

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.490
won't happen again
because it kept happening.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:53.570
Even when he was in
prison, it kept happening.

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.460
Then Defy comes along.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.190
And I'm going to kind
of speed it up now.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.640
Defy comes along.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:07.500
And his entire thought pattern
of how he processed information

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.510
changed.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.850
The way he carried
himself changed.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.680
The way he started
talking changed.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.590
He said something
that I had never heard

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:18.330
him say before in a visit.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:21.390
And he goes, I did it.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:22.915
Excuse me, what, huh, what?

00:25:22.915 --> 00:25:23.760
He said I did it.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.760
I did everything
they said I did.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.490
I did it all.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:31.350
I made that mistake,
but that was me then.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.300
That's not me now.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.240
So while you're here on this
visit, you have a choice.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.510
You can keep looking
at me for who I was,

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:43.830
or you can look at me for
who I'm trying to become.

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:47.130
I have seen my brother
virtually every weekend

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.570
since that meeting.

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:53.190
I was proud to go
to his graduation.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:55.860
I walked up to Bob, because they
don't-- you weren't supposed

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.320
to get up and walk around
because it's a prison,

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.340
and you weren't
supposed to be moving.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:03.057
But the guy that saw
me was like, hey,

00:26:03.057 --> 00:26:04.140
can I go talk to this guy?

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.140
And I'm pointing at Bob.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.160
And he's like, ah,
I ain't see you.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.660
So I jump up, and
I run over to Bob,

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.610
and he's in the middle
talking to somebody.

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:13.710
And I'm trying to
keep it together,

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.450
but I can't stop crying.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.540
And it wasn't sadness,
it was absolute elation

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.400
because I had never
seen my brother graduate

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.250
from anything but
a prison sentence

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.230
to another prison sentence.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:28.618
That's all I had seen.

00:26:28.618 --> 00:26:30.910
And now, I see my brother
walking around with his chest

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:32.670
out, his hands up.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.400
And he's recognizing
not only what he was,

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.895
but who he can become.

00:26:36.895 --> 00:26:38.520
And I walked up to
Bob, and I told him,

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.280
I said, Bob, listen,
I own a company.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.730
It's a finance company.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:43.695
I make a little bit of
money, not like this,

00:26:43.695 --> 00:26:45.760
but I make some money.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.490
And I said, Bob,
whatever you want,

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:50.550
I'll write you a check, whatever
you need, whatever you need.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.843
He was like, I don't really
know you, but OK, cool.

00:26:52.843 --> 00:26:54.760
And I'm sitting there
like, I love you people.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.010
And he's like, I just met you.

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:58.710
I was like, no, no,
I still love you.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:01.452
And he and Stacey gave
myself and a gentleman

00:27:01.452 --> 00:27:02.910
in the back there
who's my business

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:06.090
partner, his name's Gil Datz,
and a young lady in their named

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:09.070
Kayla [? Goley-- ?] she just
got married everybody, Kayla

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:12.990
[? Goley-- ?] and they
decided to help me

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.930
with Bob, and Stacey, and Izzy.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:23.310
And listening to you,
I can only imagine

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:25.800
what that felt like
walking out the door

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.400
and changing your
life for the good.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.790
These two gentlemen who, we're
not go knock them for they

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:37.150
do for their living,
because they have a purpose,

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.780
but I'm certain they're happy
to hear that they will never

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:45.140
meet you in their professional
life again, right?

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.583
And that's really
what this is about.

00:27:47.583 --> 00:27:49.500
That's what I guess you
wanted me to tell you.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.950
I'm not going to bore you
with all the family history.

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.930
But the bottom line
is my little brother

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.210
is now a different person.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:59.190
And it would have
never happened--

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:01.840
listen to me very closely.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.660
They say never use
the word never.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.430
It would have never happened
without Bob and Stacey.

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:11.220
My brother came from
a two-parent home.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.060
My dad was in the military.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:17.112
My mom was a
registered dietitian.

00:28:17.112 --> 00:28:18.070
We all went to college.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:20.520
He got a football scholarship.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.670
There was absolutely no reason
for him to ever join a gang,

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:29.020
let alone put that monstrosity
that's on his back.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.980
But he did.

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:35.130
And now he's understanding
that he did not

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:42.780
belong in prison except to learn
the life he had was a blessing.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.870
You've learned the life
that you have is a blessing.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.490
No matter what
environment you were in,

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:52.140
Defy gave that
back to my family.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.000
And as I told you
then, I'll tell you now

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.970
for the rest of my
life, whatever you need,

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:01.500
whenever you need it, you call.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.450
And I hope you do.

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:06.990
And I thank Defy for giving
my family an opportunity

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:09.590
to have my brother back.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:12.540
And I thank you for
all of your hard work.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.970
Stay on his ass
while you're in there

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:22.410
and bring my brother home
because I once he comes home,

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:25.110
the only time we'll
ever think about you

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.470
is when we see you at Defy
event because you will never

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:31.830
see him in your
professional capacity again.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:35.520
And I thank you, and Defy,
and Stacey for all of that.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.760
And I hope all of you join
us with working with Defy.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.600
I really do.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.406
It'll change your lives
because it changed ours.

00:29:42.406 --> 00:29:46.020
BOB OMER: Well what-- so let me
just jump in because what are

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.670
we really saying here, right?

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.260
I mean we've--

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.220
I mean, let's just reframe it.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.560
We don't have a shortage of
people in prisons, right?

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.060
We don't have a shortage of
programs in prisons, right?

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.890
These aren't one-off
situations with Ronnie,

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.920
with Darius, et
cetera, that's here.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.830
I have my belief of what we're
talking about here, which

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:12.030
is this issue of volunteerism
and collective community

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:12.978
impact.

00:30:12.978 --> 00:30:14.520
But I'm actually
interested following

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:18.990
on Travis' point, Tom,
is to hear from you.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:21.270
What's been your
experience as a volunteer?

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:22.230
I mean, you didn't--

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.480
I'm assuming you'd never
been into prison before,

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.990
before you came in with
Defy for the first time.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:31.060
Before we talked about,
what, 340-plus volunteers

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:36.605
came in 2018 who made the two
and 1/2 hour drive from Boulder

00:30:36.605 --> 00:30:38.280
and places.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:42.026
I mean, how many times have
you been to prison with us?

00:30:42.026 --> 00:30:43.100
TOM WYMAN: I'm not sure.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.280
I've sort of lost count.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.870
BOB OMER: Yeah, I mean it
easily has to be about five,

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:47.787
I mean, at this point.

00:30:47.787 --> 00:30:50.180
TOM WYMAN: Yeah, I think
it's double digits.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.250
BOB OMER: But is it
from your perspective?

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:55.735
You don't come with Travis'
background of having a loved

00:30:55.735 --> 00:30:56.860
one who had been in prison.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:02.167
What is it from
that perspective,

00:31:02.167 --> 00:31:04.000
from the volunteer's
perspective, you think,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.792
that makes it work?

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:14.230
TOM WYMAN: Well, I think
what motivates you to go in,

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:17.043
and then what your
experience is once you're in

00:31:17.043 --> 00:31:18.460
are sort of two
different stories.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:24.295
And I think the thing that
motivated me to go in is--

00:31:24.295 --> 00:31:26.040
that's probably a little fuzzy.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:30.600
As I get older, I'm more
curious about different people's

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:37.860
experiences, more maybe
aware of some of the benefits

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.750
I've had in my life.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:45.098
But mostly, I'm kind of
a sucker for a cause.

00:31:45.098 --> 00:31:46.890
And I didn't know if
this was going to be--

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.780
I didn't know this was
going to be the cause.

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.980
I just thought it was an
interesting thing to do.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:54.725
And so I talked
to Bob and Stacey,

00:31:54.725 --> 00:31:56.040
and they made it sound great.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:00.030
And so I hopped in the car
and drove to Arkansas Valley.

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.430
And it's a long drive.

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:06.007
And it's a long time
to think about, wow,

00:32:06.007 --> 00:32:07.340
I'm going to walk into a prison.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.988
I never really been in a prison.

00:32:09.988 --> 00:32:12.030
Maybe that's a little bit
out of my comfort zone.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:16.200
Maybe I-- I wonder why I
signed up for this exactly.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:21.573
And so you go in-- or at least
I went in with Stacey and Izzy

00:32:21.573 --> 00:32:22.240
that first time.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:27.240
And it was to speak to a class--

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.120
every week there's a class
with a different topic.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.960
And I think I was talking
about sort of personal brand,

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.840
and raising money, and
that sort of thing.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:46.140
And I walked in the room, and
all these guys wearing green

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.250
just sort of made a
beeline right for me.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:52.380
And everyone had a giant grin on
their face and their hand out.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:56.250
And it wasn't that polite, well,
it's very nice to meet you.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:58.290
It was like they were
a psyched to see me.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.707
And I wasn't exactly sure why
they were psyched to see me,

00:33:00.707 --> 00:33:02.460
but it was like this
instant acceptance

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.335
that you don't get when
you just sort of walk

00:33:04.335 --> 00:33:06.730
into a business meeting.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.430
And so that felt--

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:11.820
I mean, I was immediately
at feeling comfortable

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.110
with the whole thing.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:18.600
And I got on with
my presentation.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.960
And we were talking about
ways to fund your company.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.890
So we're talking about
bootstrapping, our friends

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:29.320
and family around, or angel,
or venture, or whatever.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.980
And somebody raised
their hand and said, hey,

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.070
what about a bank loan?

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.050
And I started to
answer and realized,

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:41.310
I've never really been involved
in one of those transactions

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.120
with a startup with a bank loan.

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.720
And so I started to explain
that this isn't something

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.568
I have a lot of experience in.

00:33:47.568 --> 00:33:50.110
And this guy in the back row,
one of the EITs in the back row

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:50.777
raises his hand.

00:33:50.777 --> 00:33:54.288
He's like, excuse me, the
first company that I started,

00:33:54.288 --> 00:33:55.830
actually we started
with a bank loan.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:57.640
I could address
this if you like.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:04.620
And this guy gave a great
explanation of how that works.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.730
And it was at that moment that
I realized, wow, I totally

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:09.750
sold these guys short.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:12.719
And as you listen to
the questions they asked

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:17.980
and the points they
made, there were

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.699
a bunch of very sharp,
super-motivated people

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:22.480
in that room.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.260
And you realize,
oh my gosh, there

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:28.909
is a ton of potential
locked up in this space.

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:31.030
I think the other thing
Bob that totally motivated

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:37.909
me was the way these guys
make themselves vulnerable.

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.409
I mean, part of every
session starts with--

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.650
commitments, thank you--
commitments and affirmations.

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:51.600
And one of them is, "I
will be vulnerable."

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.480
And you just know
from life experience

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:59.400
that you can have so much better
conversation with someone--

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.310
you can learn so
much more from them,

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:03.660
and they can get more from
you if you allow yourselves

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.000
to make yourself vulnerable.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.650
But if you think
about it in prison,

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:11.370
that's probably the last
thing that you want to be

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.670
is vulnerable?

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:14.170
Yeah.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.030
And so the fact that they
could come into this room

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:23.940
and have so much trust in
each other and the volunteers,

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.980
and they can just
flips that switch

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:32.250
and be completely open and
vulnerable for a couple hours,

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.170
and then go back to the
regular life and turn that off,

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:37.740
I mean, to me that
just showed they're

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.020
willing to make a giant
leap to make this work.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.450
That can not be an easy thing.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:47.160
And I think that was one of
the things that partly sold me

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.270
on the effort that
they put into it.

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:53.100
But partly just made it so
much more rewarding for me

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:57.000
and made it such a privilege
to spend time with these guys

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.894
and get to know
them a little bit.

00:35:58.894 --> 00:36:01.440
BOB OMER: Yeah, I think
that's an interesting point

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.850
on the vulnerability.

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:07.230
And Ron, I want to come back
to you and your experience

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.850
being on the inside.

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:11.370
We use the word EIT,
entrepreneur in training,

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:14.640
which everybody who comes
into our program, that's

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.540
what their title is.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:20.370
What was the impact
of that volunteers,

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:24.840
of those volunteers coming into
the facility week after week?

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.720
Not only how did it tie
into your personal journey,

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.320
but how did it tie into that
aspect of vulnerability,

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.010
of people feeling like
they can kind of not

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:37.900
let their guard down for
lack of a better term,

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.170
but to work on what's
important in terms of making

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:42.741
transformational change?

00:36:42.741 --> 00:36:46.560
RONNIE MADRID: Well, the
thing is everybody in prison

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.305
wants to change.

00:36:48.305 --> 00:36:49.680
Every single
person, I don't care

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:53.220
who it is, everyone
is tired of it,

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.263
especially repeat offenders.

00:36:55.263 --> 00:36:56.180
I'm a repeat offender.

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.160
I actually do know your
brother [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:58.993
TRAVIS TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:36:58.993 --> 00:37:00.480
RONNIE MADRID: We were--

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.840
we started out together at
the same time in prison.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.600
And he had just
got out the feds.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.713
And I was on my
way back to prison.

00:37:08.713 --> 00:37:10.130
We were in Denver
County together.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:12.250
We used to work-- that's
a good friend of mine.

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:14.040
I just haven't seen
him in forever.

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:18.810
But especially repeat
offenders, we're always like,

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:19.900
I'm so tired of this.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:20.583
I'm tired of it.

00:37:20.583 --> 00:37:21.250
I'm tired of it.

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:21.917
I'm tired of it.

00:37:21.917 --> 00:37:26.460
But there is never
anything available to us

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:31.170
simply because of our
jackets, of our background,

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:33.240
of who we are on paper.

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:39.360
The recidivism rate
stays high because nobody

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.890
knows who we are, because
nobody gives us a chance.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:45.490
Up until very
recently, I start--

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:49.410
I grew up in the
juvenile system and spent

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:53.250
about 13 and 1/2 years of my
adult life in the adult system.

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:57.810
And I take full responsibility
for the choices that I made.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:01.440
And sentences were deserved.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.515
They were deserved because I
was making poor life choices,

00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:08.310
and I was where I needed to be.

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:10.800
Going back to what I
said in the beginning,

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.690
everybody wants to change.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:13.810
Everybody wants to change.

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:15.560
And even when we speak
up, and we're like,

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.942
I want to do this no more,
up until very recently,

00:38:17.942 --> 00:38:19.650
the Department of
Corrections hasn't been

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:21.300
the Department of Corrections.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.650
It never corrected behavior.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:25.423
It was a Department
of Confining.

00:38:25.423 --> 00:38:26.340
They would lock us up.

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.980
And CSP, they'd
just opened it up.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.330
It's a closed facility now.

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:35.160
But I did six years in
solitary confinement

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:39.900
because of the choices that
I made inside of prison.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:47.070
And nobody cared about what I
wanted to do because I was just

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:48.130
like everybody else.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:50.540
Like I said, everybody
inside wants to change.

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:51.837
And they speak it.

00:38:51.837 --> 00:38:53.170
I don't want to do this no more.

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:54.870
I don't want to do this no more.

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:59.580
The fact of the matter is,
it's another world inside.

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.020
Being vulnerable
is the last thing

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:04.477
that you want to be in prison.

00:39:04.477 --> 00:39:06.060
You have to be an
alpha male or you're

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:10.020
going to be somebody's something
that you don't want to be.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:13.230
Going to be the victim
of something or somebody.

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:19.330
And when Defy would bring
their volunteers in, all of us,

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:23.290
we couldn't wait to
go to class on Tuesday

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:27.210
because it was five hours
away from the craziest stuff

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:28.600
that you could imagine.

00:39:31.485 --> 00:39:37.470
You never realized what
people could do to people

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:39.420
when you're in a war zone.

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:45.670
And you go into them classes,
and these people right here,

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:51.520
they would come up, and they
didn't look at you like that.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.700
They wanted to hear
what you actually

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.850
had to say about your
business, or about your day,

00:39:56.850 --> 00:40:00.910
or about your family, about
what you wanted to do.

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:03.360
And they really
wanted to help you.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.780
Every conversation
that I had with anybody

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.710
as far as a volunteer
that came up,

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:11.967
they've held true to their word.

00:40:11.967 --> 00:40:13.800
They seriously have
held true to their word.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:17.700
And I feel like the way to
lower the recidivism rate

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:21.670
is for people to get
to know who we are.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.560
We're not a product
of our land--

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.930
of our environments.

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:27.280
We're just products of the
choices that we've made.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.780
Sometimes we didn't
know any better.

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.290
I learned everything in life
through trial and error.

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:34.530
I didn't have a dad, or a big
brother, or anybody to show me.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.990
All my parents were there.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:40.300
I'd been on my own
since I was 13.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:46.560
So when they would
come in and just

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:51.360
get to know us and see the type
of people who we are and not

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:57.460
the crime that we committed, it
made them look at us different.

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:01.590
So if you guys want to lower
the recidivism rate in Colorado,

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:06.060
get to know some criminals
who want to change.

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:06.780
Be volunteers.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.090
Go up and speak with the
people at the Defy events.

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:12.430
Even if it's just one
time, I guarantee you

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:16.170
it's everybody wants to change.

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:17.700
Everybody wants to change.

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:22.220
For the most part, a lot of
people just don't know how.

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:23.780
BOB OMER: I think that's--

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.280
looking at the
clock, I want to make

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.550
sure we leave enough time
for question and answers.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:29.760
So try to drive
towards a wrap up.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.180
But I think, Ronnie, that's
a perfect segue to what I'd

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.890
like for the final
question to be

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:40.880
is what can the community do to
solve this issue of recidivism,

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.880
and in a more finite level to
support what's happening here

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.180
in the State of Colorado?

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:49.140
And I guess Travis, I'd like
to start with you because I

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:52.065
think your perspective--

00:41:52.065 --> 00:41:54.060
you've seen it coming
back to your brother,

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.950
but you're also an
entrepreneur yourself.

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:58.710
And so I think it's an
interesting perspective

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:03.105
of saying, what can people
in the community do?

00:42:03.105 --> 00:42:08.340
TRAVIS TAYLOR: So I'm glad
I was asked that question.

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.283
Indulge me for a second.

00:42:10.283 --> 00:42:12.450
Everybody in this room, put
your hands up like this.

00:42:15.188 --> 00:42:16.730
Just keep them up
there for a second.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.850
Think about this.

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:24.750
Imagine you just
walked out of prison,

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:29.250
and you just applied for
a job, and they told you

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:31.830
they're going to call
you back, and this

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:34.530
is the ninth time
today someone said

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:37.040
they're going to call you back.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.200
And your probation officer's
calling you asking you

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.480
why you don't have a job.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.180
Your kid's mom or dad
is screaming at you

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.370
about not paying your bills.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:49.740
You're living with your
family, and they're

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.770
telling you how you're
a loser, and how

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.410
you're not going to work.

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:56.160
And then you're turning
around, and you're

00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:00.360
looking at the world, and
how does the world see you?

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.540
With your hands up, right?

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.280
You're vulnerable right now.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:09.690
Your hands are up because it
shows that you're giving up.

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:13.770
If we don't work together
to change our society

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:19.350
and help Defy, this is
how we will be someday.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:21.440
Our hands are going to be up.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.930
And there's going to be someone
at the business end of a hand

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:27.000
gun or a knife,
and they're going

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.350
to be trying to take what
we worked so hard to get

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:34.630
because they felt like
this that morning,

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:37.140
and they got sick of it.

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:41.310
We as a society need to get
sick of people walking around

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:43.620
with their hands in the air.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:47.550
We have to decide that
we, as a community,

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:50.350
can work together to
bring our hands down.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:59.020
This is not about a handout.

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:02.580
This is about a hand up.

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:06.600
It's about you
being in a position

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.930
to change someone else's
life with something

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:16.950
as simple as your time, simply
listening to someone's story

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:20.560
and saying, hey, I can't
promise you that you're going

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.820
to get a job at Google, right?

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.510
I can't promise you that you'll
be a millionaire in five years.

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:30.060
But you know what
I can do for you?

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:33.240
I can help you make
a better decision

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:36.660
so that you and I aren't
talking inside of a prison.

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:41.880
That's what you can do.

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.910
You can write a check,
that's true, too.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:51.690
You can-- I can just simply
pay the problem away, right?

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:55.050
And you can leave it on the
shoulders of Izzy, and Stacey,

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:58.680
and Bob, and the correctional
folks here to take the money

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.560
and try to do some good with it.

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.620
That works, too.

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:09.840
But is that a solution
to a long-term problem?

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:15.600
You guys deal with code and
complex algorithms every day.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.900
I know, I pay y'all.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:20.760
With Google AdWords,
I pay you for that.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.147
And you guys work--

00:45:22.147 --> 00:45:22.980
you're very welcome.

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.980
I paid for all of this,
just so you know--

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.320
just so you know.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.870
Discount brother, hear me.

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:42.880
But imagine how complex
it is not having this.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.270
I'm not trying to guilt
you into anything.

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:48.660
I'm trying to get you to step
back and say, we, as a society,

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:53.110
have to decide when
enough is enough.

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:55.690
5% of the world's
population, yet 20% of them

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:57.910
are incarcerated?

00:45:57.910 --> 00:46:01.700
We've turned punishment
into a business.

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:07.660
And business is good.

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:09.730
Is this who we are?

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:17.180
We define who we are by
simply taking an opportunity

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:19.880
to reach out to somebody
else, if it's just

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.240
your time, if you're more
comfortable with the money,

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.970
if you're more comfortable
with a mentorship.

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:29.012
All of this is needed by Defy.

00:46:29.012 --> 00:46:32.850
Each one of you in this room
have the power to do something,

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:36.200
no matter how small
you think it is.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.060
And all I'm asking
you as somebody

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:41.825
whose brother was blessed enough
to be part of this, please.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:48.210
I'm asking for my brother,
for my mother, my father,

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:51.030
and for every person
that is not here, please.

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:57.805
You can change our lives.

00:46:57.805 --> 00:47:02.648
And all we're asking is please.

00:47:02.648 --> 00:47:03.907
I have nothing to say.

00:47:03.907 --> 00:47:05.740
BOB OMER: We're going
to end it right there.

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.800
That was incredibly
well said Travis.

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:09.640
Thank you very much.

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.515
Let's give our panelists
a round of applause.

00:47:11.515 --> 00:47:14.249
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:19.040
And I think now we'll open it up
to questions from the audience.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.011
Anybody have a question?

00:47:21.011 --> 00:47:22.850
AUDIENCE: I was
just wondering, you

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:24.950
talked a little bit about
what some of the roles

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:26.840
that volunteers have.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.572
But I was curious
if you could give

00:47:28.572 --> 00:47:30.530
a little more of an idea
of what kinds of roles

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:33.050
and opportunities there are
in terms of volunteering,

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:34.810
and what you would
do in those roles.

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:35.625
BOB OMER: Sure.

00:47:35.625 --> 00:47:37.250
STACEY PUTKA: Do you
want me to answer?

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:38.040
BOB OMER: Yeah, why
don't you take that one.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:38.832
STACEY PUTKA: Sure.

00:47:38.832 --> 00:47:42.380
So volunteers have
several opportunities

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.900
to come into the
facilities with us.

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:47.360
We have three big
events throughout

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:50.660
the eight-month program
that focused mostly

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:53.690
on empathy building and
coaching on deliverables

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:56.730
that they all create as
a result of the program.

00:47:56.730 --> 00:48:00.200
So those are-- we have a
one-to-one ratio those days.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.890
So if we have 40 EITs, we'd
have 40 volunteers come in.

00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:07.430
And if I was your EIT, I
would show you my resume,

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:09.500
and you would give
me coaching on how

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:13.260
to better craft my resume.

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:14.840
So those days are
very structured,

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.660
and everyone's getting feedback
on the same deliverables.

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:19.880
Then we have our weekly
classroom sessions,

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:22.430
which are every Tuesday at both
Arkansas Valley Correctional

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:25.160
Facility and Colorado
State Penitentiary.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:28.010
They're two and 1/2 hours long,
and people come in and go over

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:30.392
a variety of different topics.

00:48:30.392 --> 00:48:31.850
I always have
volunteers say to me,

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:34.038
I'd like to come in
and observe a class.

00:48:34.038 --> 00:48:34.955
There's no such thing.

00:48:34.955 --> 00:48:37.940
You get thrown right
into it and have

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:41.000
some of the most impactful,
very cool conversations.

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:47.240
The other is with
our alumni groups.

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:51.320
So specifically, if we talk
about Travis' brother, Darius,

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.630
we have a lot of the guys
who have longer or even life

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:55.910
sentences who graduated
from our first cohort,

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:58.880
but are still very committed
to change and transformation.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:02.210
So we've put together
an alumni program

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:04.640
where we continue to
provide them kind of like--

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.650
think of it as like
elective courses,

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:09.050
where if you guys wanted to
put together a presentation

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:11.930
to show them, I would set
up the day and the time.

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:15.350
And I would call Bob and
ask him to get me a room.

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:18.650
And we'd bring all the alumni
in, bring in the volunteers,

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:22.100
and create something new,
which UZU Media actually

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.403
did for us, Travis' company

00:49:25.403 --> 00:49:27.320
TRAVIS TAYLOR: Gil Datz'
company, right there.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.195
STACEY PUTKA: Gil's--

00:49:28.195 --> 00:49:29.802
Gil and Travis.

00:49:29.802 --> 00:49:31.760
BOB OMER: I think the
other part, because we've

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.420
talked primarily today
about the in-prison program,

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:38.630
obviously Stacey hit on
that inside-out model.

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:40.770
But the aspect of
the outside piece

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:42.350
is the post-release program.

00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:46.040
And graduates who are coming
back out into the community,

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:48.920
Ronnie being one, and having--

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:51.380
starting to run
corporate workshops,

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:54.770
starting to run mentorships
in the community

00:49:54.770 --> 00:50:00.650
to continue on that path of
assisting on entrepreneurship

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:03.380
path, assisting on life
skills, and that sort of thing.

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:08.420
And so it's certainly
largely in prison right now.

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:10.120
But also out in the
community, there

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.176
is a variety of
opportunities as well.

00:50:12.176 --> 00:50:14.110
TOM WYMAN: Bob, can I
just jump in real quick.

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:14.735
BOB OMER: Yeah.

00:50:14.735 --> 00:50:21.050
TOM WYMAN: I would just say, if
you're wondering whether you're

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:24.560
qualified to help, or you
would be good to help,

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:28.550
if this resonated
with you at all,

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:32.270
then you're totally qualified,
and you will be really good.

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:36.050
And you will think of it maybe
as going in for a volunteer

00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:38.690
opportunity, and you giving.

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:42.780
But I promise you, you
will get so much more back.

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:44.720
And I know that's
trite, and it's cliche,

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:51.890
but I probably spend four
or five days after prison

00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:55.460
just processing, just processing
all the conversations I've had,

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:58.400
processing what I've learned
about people, processing--

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.970
putting my life in sort of
a different perspective.

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:03.890
Yeah, it's a great deal.

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:05.120
You should jump on it.

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.750
BOB OMER: That's an
interesting point.

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:07.917
I just want to jump back in.

00:51:07.917 --> 00:51:11.540
Because we have as a program--

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:13.065
we have two
requirements for anybody

00:51:13.065 --> 00:51:14.940
who wants to come into
our program or prison,

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:17.030
and we have two requirements
for any volunteer.

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:19.327
And anybody who wants to
come into our program, when

00:51:19.327 --> 00:51:21.410
we go into a new prison,
I stand in front of them,

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:24.860
and I say we don't
work with criminals,

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.110
we work with people who
have done some bad stuff.

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:28.730
And we don't work with slackers.

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:30.950
And if you meet
both of those boxes,

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:33.200
then you're welcome to
come into the program.

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:38.210
And for volunteers, the numerous
that I meet and talk to,

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:39.990
there's only two requirements.

00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:41.390
One is showing up.

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:43.460
Showing up's half
the ballgame here.

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:46.652
And the other thing is coming
in with an open mindset.

00:51:46.652 --> 00:51:48.360
And I think it's back
to your point, Tom.

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.990
If you're willing to come
in with that open mindset,

00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:54.606
that's where the
interaction takes over.

00:51:54.606 --> 00:51:57.980
RONNIE MADRID: Can I just
say something real quick?

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:01.140
About coming in, we're
all human beings,

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:04.070
so we relate to each
other in different ways.

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:07.190
It's not about being poor,
or rich, or whatever.

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:09.440
It's about being a human being.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.660
You never know who
you're going to run into,

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:15.580
who one word to actually
change your perspective.

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:16.990
I come from the streets.

00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:21.580
And my life was on the curb
selling dope or doing whatever.

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:26.010
And with Defy and the
path that I was taking,

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:28.180
they absolutely helped me
stand on that same curb,

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:31.150
just like this,
from the streets,

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:34.930
looking at the streets,
and say, hey, turn around.

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:37.390
And when I turned around, I
seen the rest of the world.

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:39.910
And I want to be a part of that.

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:47.290
And maybe somebody who you talk
to in prison or whatever you

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:49.390
guys could do, you
guys might just

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:53.700
be the one to change that
one person who nobody thought

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.490
would be changed
and let them see

00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:57.240
the rest of the world
from that same curb.

00:53:00.222 --> 00:53:01.805
That's the best thing
you guys can do.

00:53:01.805 --> 00:53:02.763
BOB OMER: That's great.

00:53:02.763 --> 00:53:04.500
I think we had a
question over here.

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:07.660
AUDIENCE: Your courage,
your empathy are tremendous.

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:08.720
And I feel it.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.570
And I think most in
this room feel it.

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:13.720
I think people
who work at Google

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:16.300
tend to have that in there.

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:18.890
It is part of our
hiring criteria.

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:20.650
There's a Google in
its hiring criteria

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:22.510
that we often go through.

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:27.140
And we can sense that
empathy in others as well.

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:29.590
That said, what I
wanted to ask really

00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:34.540
is, how many of your
graduates of the program

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:37.510
actually come back
and volunteer then?

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:39.590
I'm very curious about that.

00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:41.503
And also, Trevor was it?

00:53:41.503 --> 00:53:42.420
TRAVIS TAYLOR: Who me?

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:42.957
I'm Travis.

00:53:42.957 --> 00:53:43.665
AUDIENCE: Travis?

00:53:43.665 --> 00:53:44.850
TRAVIS TAYLOR: Yeah,
yeah I can be Trevor

00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:46.392
if you give me a
discount on AdWords.

00:53:46.392 --> 00:53:48.220
AUDIENCE: Brother, I got your--

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:51.350
I got your AdWords
optimization all ready for you.

00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:52.935
So I can help you with that.

00:53:52.935 --> 00:53:53.560
BOB OMER: Yeah.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:54.520
[TRAVIS CLAPS]

00:53:57.250 --> 00:53:59.680
On the first question,
I'll jump in on that.

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:07.630
So in Nebraska and in
California, other Defy states,

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:10.630
there's actually EITs that
work for those chapters that

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:11.390
have come back.

00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:14.470
So that's taking volunteering
to the utmost level

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:16.120
from that standpoint.

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:19.618
Here in Colorado,
Ronnie came with us.

00:54:19.618 --> 00:54:21.160
We did a radio show
a couple of weeks

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.810
ago when Ronnie was with us.

00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:26.020
Two weeks ago, we
made a presentation

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:29.350
to about 150 people in the
community corrections industry

00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:30.625
in Colorado.

00:54:30.625 --> 00:54:34.990
And we brought another one of
our graduates, Damien, with us.

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:39.910
And Brandon and Bob could
talk about this more,

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:42.760
but this was all people
who run the community

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.790
corrections across Colorado--

00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:48.093
the halfway houses,
the other facilities.

00:54:48.093 --> 00:54:49.510
And they came up
to us afterwards,

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:55.690
and they said, we've never
had somebody come back in

00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:56.770
and present.

00:54:56.770 --> 00:54:58.310
And they just
couldn't believe it.

00:54:58.310 --> 00:55:00.550
They were just
baffled by the fact

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:04.030
that Damien was
willing to come in,

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:06.130
and was willing to stand
up there, and be part

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:08.170
of our presentation,
and do the Q&amp;A.

00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:13.720
And so for us, that's a key
tenet of the overall program

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.210
is to continue to
pay it forward.

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:19.490
I had one final one if we
have time that's there.

00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:22.160
I'd like-- Ron put you
on the spot a little bit,

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.970
but we talked about one of the
tenants of the Defy Ventures

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:28.718
Colorado program is
business ideation.

00:55:28.718 --> 00:55:30.010
You have to develop a business.

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:31.700
You have to pitch a business.

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:34.900
In fact, it's a
requirement to graduate

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:37.660
to pitch a for-profit business
at a formal business pitch

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:39.460
competition.

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:40.960
What was your business idea?

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.870
And tell us a
little bit about it.

00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:46.360
RONNIE MADRID: My business
idea was a taco truck.

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.530
I know, it's--

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:49.640
Denver is saturated with them.

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.495
But when I talk with Taco
truck is Yummy Yum-Yums.

00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:57.440
I feel like the
name alone is going

00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:00.520
to be catchy enough to go
along with the quality of food

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.700
that I'm going to produce.

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:04.950
It's going to be authentic Latin
cuisine, [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:07.990
tacos [SPEAKING SPANISH],,
tacos de lengua,

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:12.340
real authentic Mexican food,
Latin food with a drink

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.570
and some chips or whatever.

00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:17.360
It's going to cost
me about $7,300

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:21.460
to purchase a used car,
two grills, a freezer.

00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:25.030
I have this idea that I'm
going to candy paint it up,

00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:26.720
make it appealing to the eye.

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.060
I want to park it--

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:30.310
I'm going to focus on the
nightlife in downtown Denver

00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:33.460
because you know when
everybody gets out of the clubs

00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:35.320
or from going out,
everybody wants

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:37.900
to go and get something to eat.

00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:40.270
And everybody's trying to
get pushed out of the clubs.

00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:42.280
And people want to
interact with each other

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.780
and figure out
what's going on next.

00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:48.340
So I have this vision
of a Yummy Yum-Yum truck

00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:52.090
with some really good food on
the grill with some music still

00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:55.180
playing to kind of keep it
going a little bit afterwards.

00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:00.190
And my plates are going
to be like anywhere

00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:02.080
between like $8
and $11 per plate

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:05.290
of like three to five tacos
depending on what you get.

00:57:05.290 --> 00:57:09.450
Drinks are going to be
like $1.50, $2 extra.

00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:12.280
$7,300 hours is the truck--

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:15.860
or excuse me, the trailer,
first month's inventory,

00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:17.000
licensing, and permits.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.520
And the paint job parts
to get it screen wrapped.

00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:23.610
And the employees,
my employees will--

00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:24.980
I will pay them just $100 a day.

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:26.480
They'll have to pay
their own taxes.

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:31.400
But, yeah coming soon,
actually next summer.

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:33.320
I get out of the halfway
house this summer.

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.000
So I'm going to
have a whole year

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.060
to work on saving the $7,300.

00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:43.520
And I plan on launching
Cinco de Mayo next year.

00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.387
I'll have my first
Yummy Yum-Yum truck.

00:57:46.387 --> 00:57:47.470
It's going to be official.

00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:49.803
I'm going to do merchandising,
everything, Yummy Yum-Yum

00:57:49.803 --> 00:57:53.600
shirts, everything.

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.550
Because when you guys
are hungry and stuff,

00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:57.420
you guys are thinking
about what to eat,

00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:59.642
you're going to be like,
what should we eat?

00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:00.350
You want Mexican?

00:58:00.350 --> 00:58:03.090
Oh yum, Yummy Yum-Yums.

00:58:03.090 --> 00:58:05.406
And we have these tacos.

00:58:05.406 --> 00:58:06.590
BOB OMER: So there we go if.

00:58:06.590 --> 00:58:10.220
We have anybody in the audience
or anybody watching who

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:11.840
has restaurant
experience and wants

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.580
to work with Ron
on helping him get

00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:16.040
his business off the ground,
you know where to come to.

00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.510
So I think we'll
end right there.

00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:21.220
I want to thank our panelists
once again for coming up

00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:22.645
here and doing this.

00:58:22.645 --> 00:58:24.545
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:24.545 --> 00:58:27.040
And I want to say on
behalf of everybody

00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:30.160
at Defy Ventures Colorado,
I want to thank Google,

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.630
in particular, I
want to thank Jess

00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:35.110
for giving this opportunity
to come in and tell you

00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:37.660
a little bit about
the work we do,

00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:39.550
the work we're very
passionate about.

00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:43.220
And we're incredibly grateful
that you had us here today.

00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:44.050
So thank you.

00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:47.100
[APPLAUSE]
