00:00:01.814 --> 00:00:04.157
- [Sal] We are now going
to go further in our study

00:00:04.157 --> 00:00:07.351
of the evolution of the empires in Asia.

00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:09.979
And in this video, we're
going to focus on what happens

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:13.563
in North India, Persia, the Middle East,

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:15.532
and the Anatolian peninsula,

00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:19.068
what we would consider modern-day Turkey.

00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:22.150
So right here is roughly
what Asia looked like

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.900
around the year 1300.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.337
As you might remember
from previous videos,

00:00:28.337 --> 00:00:31.105
as we entered into the 13th century,

00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:35.925
you have Genghis Khan or Genghis
Khan take over much of Asia

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:37.092
from Mongolia.

00:00:37.946 --> 00:00:42.472
But by the time you get to
1300, the empire has fragmented

00:00:42.472 --> 00:00:44.633
into these various khanates.

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:48.800
The Yuan Dynasty in China,
Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia,

00:00:50.112 --> 00:00:52.356
the Golden Horde in Northwest Asia,

00:00:52.356 --> 00:00:57.072
and the Ilkhanate in
Persia and the Middle East.

00:00:57.072 --> 00:00:59.864
Now, two things to keep note
of as we look at this map

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:02.151
that are relevant to this video

00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:05.468
is notice this tiny little
kingdom right over here.

00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:08.830
This is one of the many
fragmented kingdoms that result

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.830
after the Sultanate of Rum collapses

00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:15.650
in the middle of the 13th century.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.161
This kingdom in particular
is founded by someone

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:22.888
by the name of Osman, or the
Arabic version of the name

00:01:22.888 --> 00:01:25.435
would be Uthman or Othman.

00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:28.777
And so this is the nascent
Ottoman empire forming

00:01:28.777 --> 00:01:30.519
right over here.

00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:33.017
And over here you have
the Delhi Sultanate,

00:01:33.017 --> 00:01:36.040
which was the first
significant Muslim empire

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.774
over in North India.

00:01:37.774 --> 00:01:40.447
And notably, they were
one of the few empires

00:01:40.447 --> 00:01:43.919
that were able to fend off the Mongols.

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:47.669
But now let's fast
forward roughly 100 years.

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:51.868
Now a few things have changed.

00:01:51.868 --> 00:01:55.234
The Ming Dynasty has taken
over the Yuan Dynasty

00:01:55.234 --> 00:01:58.266
in the middle of the 14th century.

00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:01.064
The Mongols in the east are now relegated

00:02:01.064 --> 00:02:03.301
to the Northern Yuan Dynasty,

00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:05.267
but there still is the Chagatai Khanate

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:07.113
and the Golden Horde.

00:02:07.113 --> 00:02:10.683
But much of their territory,
including the Ilkhanate,

00:02:10.683 --> 00:02:13.558
has now been taken over by Timur,

00:02:13.558 --> 00:02:16.133
who we talk about in previous videos.

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:19.039
And Timur famously sacked Delhi

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.869
and really brought the
Delhi Sultanate to its knees

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:23.971
and as we will see, it will only last

00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:26.501
for roughly another 100 years.

00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:29.315
Now, you might also notice
that the Ottoman empire,

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:33.778
founded by Osman or Othman
is continuing to grow

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:36.675
and continuing to conquer.

00:02:36.675 --> 00:02:39.017
Now one thing to keep in mind.

00:02:39.017 --> 00:02:43.243
In previous videos, we talk
about the invention of gunpowder

00:02:43.243 --> 00:02:46.660
in Tang China and the early Song dynasty,

00:02:47.664 --> 00:02:49.936
which was about four to five hundred years

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:52.998
before the period that we're
talking about right now.

00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:57.299
But as we get into this period,
we are now starting to see

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.518
the use of gunpowder for guns
and in particular artillery.

00:03:01.518 --> 00:03:04.209
And when I say artillery, think cannons.

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.459
So let's fast forward another 200 years

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:12.066
to see how the empires
of Asia have evolved.

00:03:13.222 --> 00:03:15.658
So now we see several things.

00:03:15.658 --> 00:03:19.156
The Ming Dynasty is still
in control of much of China.

00:03:19.156 --> 00:03:22.148
The Northern Yuan are still in Mongolia.

00:03:22.148 --> 00:03:26.852
You have a Kazakh Khanate,
descendant from the Mongols.

00:03:26.852 --> 00:03:29.915
By the late 16th and early 17th century

00:03:29.915 --> 00:03:33.340
the Ottoman Empire has now
expanded significantly,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.996
encompassing much of the Middle East.

00:03:36.996 --> 00:03:41.387
In Persia, you see that
the Timurid Empire fell

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:44.980
within a few decades
after the death of Timur.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.599
And as we enter into the 16th century,

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.982
you have the Safavid Dynasty take over.

00:03:50.982 --> 00:03:54.045
And then also in the 16th
century, almost coincident

00:03:54.045 --> 00:03:57.368
with the founding of the
Safavid Dynasty in Persia,

00:03:57.368 --> 00:04:01.535
you have Timur's grandson's
great-grandson, Babur,

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.867
who's born in current-day
Uzbekistan, is able to defeat

00:04:07.952 --> 00:04:12.232
the Delhi Sultanate and
establish the Mughal Empire.

00:04:12.232 --> 00:04:15.366
And Mughal is just the
Persian word for Mongol

00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:17.695
and Babur is a direct descendant of Timur

00:04:17.695 --> 00:04:20.491
on his father's side and of Genghis Khan

00:04:20.491 --> 00:04:22.736
on his mother's side.

00:04:22.736 --> 00:04:24.788
Now, many historians often group

00:04:24.788 --> 00:04:28.739
these three empires or dynasties together

00:04:28.739 --> 00:04:32.464
because they do share some commonalities.

00:04:32.464 --> 00:04:34.667
And so let's think about
each of them individually

00:04:34.667 --> 00:04:36.556
and think about where they are similar

00:04:36.556 --> 00:04:38.973
and where they are different.

00:04:40.495 --> 00:04:44.662
Not a lot is known about Osman
who founds that first kingdom

00:04:46.698 --> 00:04:48.826
in the Anatolian peninsula.

00:04:48.826 --> 00:04:51.637
It's a Sunni Islamic empire.

00:04:51.637 --> 00:04:54.997
In fact, the leader is
eventually named a caliph.

00:04:54.997 --> 00:04:58.487
The ruling class of
this empire is Turkish.

00:04:58.487 --> 00:05:01.771
Now, one of their
distinguishing characteristics

00:05:01.771 --> 00:05:05.232
is what's known as the Devshirme system

00:05:05.232 --> 00:05:09.570
in which the Sultan, the Emperor,
would have a personal army

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.703
of what could be called
slaves, these Janissaries.

00:05:13.703 --> 00:05:16.997
These Janissaries were
actually Christian boys

00:05:16.997 --> 00:05:19.730
taken at a young age
and then indoctrinated

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.096
into the Janissary system.

00:05:22.096 --> 00:05:25.066
The reason why I said you
can kind of call them slaves

00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:28.020
is that although they were
forced to become Janissaries

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.040
and taken from their families,

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.888
they were given many
privileges and over time,

00:05:32.888 --> 00:05:34.836
many of these Janissaries
became some of the most

00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:37.429
notable figures in the Ottoman Empire,

00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:39.873
some of them even
becoming the Grand Vizier,

00:05:39.873 --> 00:05:42.721
effectively ruling over the empire.

00:05:42.721 --> 00:05:45.244
Now, the Ottomans are also known

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:49.238
for one of the earliest
empires to very successfully

00:05:49.238 --> 00:05:51.488
to use gunpowder in battle.

00:05:52.558 --> 00:05:55.589
The Safavids, as you can see
here, were really founded

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:59.767
in the very early 16th
century, officially 1501,

00:05:59.767 --> 00:06:03.934
by their founder Shah Ismail,
sometimes known as Ismail I.

00:06:06.293 --> 00:06:10.460
And he is the heir to a
religious dynasty, the Safavias.

00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.898
It is a Muslim dynasty,
like the Ottoman Empire,

00:06:14.898 --> 00:06:16.826
but unlike the Ottoman Empire,

00:06:16.826 --> 00:06:19.659
it is based on Twelver Shia Islam.

00:06:20.893 --> 00:06:25.257
Twelver Shia is the major
group of Shias today

00:06:25.257 --> 00:06:29.397
and it is based on the belief of 12 imams

00:06:29.397 --> 00:06:31.777
following Mohammed starting with Ali

00:06:31.777 --> 00:06:35.381
and we have videos on
the Sunni-Shia split.

00:06:35.381 --> 00:06:38.609
Now, even though Ismail spoke Turkish

00:06:38.609 --> 00:06:41.965
and was raised in a Turkic society,

00:06:41.965 --> 00:06:45.666
this dynasty brought
back much of the culture

00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:47.338
of Ancient Persia.

00:06:47.338 --> 00:06:50.018
In fact, it's viewed as the first dynasty

00:06:50.018 --> 00:06:54.072
since the Sassanids that
actually had native Persian rule

00:06:54.072 --> 00:06:56.143
and brought back that Persian culture,

00:06:56.143 --> 00:06:58.761
part of which is using the word Shah.

00:06:58.761 --> 00:07:01.151
You remember Cyrus the
Great, the Shahanshah,

00:07:01.151 --> 00:07:02.312
the King of Kings.

00:07:02.312 --> 00:07:06.119
Now they had what is known as
Ghulams, which is very similar

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:08.801
to the idea of a Janissary.

00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:13.242
These are slave soldiers
which are taken as captives

00:07:13.242 --> 00:07:16.778
but then are raised to
be an elite military unit

00:07:16.778 --> 00:07:19.447
and eventually often
have significant wealth

00:07:19.447 --> 00:07:21.646
and significant power.

00:07:21.646 --> 00:07:25.057
Now you might be wondering,
why did any of these empires

00:07:25.057 --> 00:07:27.437
and these aren't the only
ones, you have the Mamluks

00:07:27.437 --> 00:07:29.621
and other Muslim empires.

00:07:29.621 --> 00:07:34.201
Why would people create these
elite soldiers out of slaves

00:07:34.201 --> 00:07:36.479
and give them that much power?

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:39.337
Well, the answer is, they
were the safest people

00:07:39.337 --> 00:07:40.927
to give power to.

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:45.594
Remember, these empires
are ruling over many tribes

00:07:45.594 --> 00:07:48.015
and many groups and many kingdoms

00:07:48.015 --> 00:07:50.237
that are constantly vying for power,

00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:53.335
trying to establish their own dynasties.

00:07:53.335 --> 00:07:55.895
And if you allowed people
from those various tribes

00:07:55.895 --> 00:07:59.028
to protect you as Emperor,
well, there might be a good shot

00:07:59.028 --> 00:08:01.087
that one of them might want to kill you

00:08:01.087 --> 00:08:03.399
and establish their own dynasty.

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:06.206
But from a young age, if
you could indoctrinate

00:08:06.206 --> 00:08:10.123
these young boys as
Ghulams, or as Janissaries,

00:08:11.177 --> 00:08:13.173
well, they might be more loyal to you.

00:08:13.173 --> 00:08:17.340
And indeed, it did provide an
unusual amount of stability.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.653
As I mentioned, the Mughal
Empire was able to be founded

00:08:23.653 --> 00:08:27.820
by Babur, who was Timur's
great-grandson's grandson

00:08:29.513 --> 00:08:34.055
and he, too, was born in a
Turco-Mongolian tradition.

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:37.787
As he's able to famously
defeat the Delhi Sultanate

00:08:37.787 --> 00:08:40.692
which had already been
significantly weakened,

00:08:40.692 --> 00:08:44.859
one, on its own, but then by
Timur over 100 years before,

00:08:45.768 --> 00:08:49.674
he famously comes to power
with the aid of gunpowder,

00:08:49.674 --> 00:08:53.262
being able to defeat
a significantly larger

00:08:53.262 --> 00:08:55.599
Delhi Sultanate army.

00:08:55.599 --> 00:08:58.678
The Mughals practiced Sunni Islam

00:08:58.678 --> 00:09:02.184
but they ruled over a
large Hindu majority,

00:09:02.184 --> 00:09:04.995
and so the first several Mughal rulers

00:09:04.995 --> 00:09:07.183
were actually quite tolerant.

00:09:07.183 --> 00:09:09.977
Perhaps the most tolerant was Akbar,

00:09:09.977 --> 00:09:11.481
often known as Akbar the Great,

00:09:11.481 --> 00:09:12.893
who we'll do other videos on,

00:09:12.893 --> 00:09:14.874
who actually tried to create a religion

00:09:14.874 --> 00:09:17.695
which was a merger
between Islam and Hinduism

00:09:17.695 --> 00:09:20.134
and Jainism and Christianity.

00:09:20.134 --> 00:09:22.025
But then they become less tolerant

00:09:22.025 --> 00:09:25.062
under Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb.

00:09:25.062 --> 00:09:28.709
Shah Jahan famous for building
the Taj Mahal for his wife,

00:09:28.709 --> 00:09:31.369
but what's often not
noted is he was building

00:09:31.369 --> 00:09:34.717
this fairly grand mausoleum at a time

00:09:34.717 --> 00:09:36.717
when there was a famine in India

00:09:36.717 --> 00:09:39.621
and he was also known as
being fairly intolerant

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:42.181
and persecuted many Hindus and Sikhs

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:46.546
and his son, Aurangzeb,
continued to do so.

00:09:46.546 --> 00:09:49.992
Now, some historians will
refer to these three empires

00:09:49.992 --> 00:09:51.819
as the Gunpowder Empires.

00:09:51.819 --> 00:09:53.525
If someone says Gunpowder Empires,

00:09:53.525 --> 00:09:55.834
they're referring to these three.

00:09:55.834 --> 00:09:58.319
The reason why they're
called that is this view

00:09:58.319 --> 00:10:01.616
that these major centralized
empires were able to form

00:10:01.616 --> 00:10:03.989
only with the power of gunpowder.

00:10:03.989 --> 00:10:08.254
The Ottomans, famous for
early use of artillery.

00:10:08.254 --> 00:10:10.459
The Mughals, Babur in particular,

00:10:10.459 --> 00:10:12.483
came to power with gunpowder.

00:10:12.483 --> 00:10:14.962
But today, historians are
somewhat skeptical of grouping

00:10:14.962 --> 00:10:18.641
just these three empires
as Gunpowder Empires.

00:10:18.641 --> 00:10:21.753
