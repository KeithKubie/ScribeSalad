00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.190
 What I want to do in this video is to speak about a simple disclaimer 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.500
 About the kidney, (this is a magnifying glass of the kidney) 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.200
 And I'm talking about how college works - I guess you are 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.500
 You can call it a smaller functional unit and that is it 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.420
 The nephron. 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.700
 If we talk about kidneys and kidneys (nephrons). 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.780
 And I think it is possible that you have learned about kidneys in advance. 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.680
 We own two of them (kidneys) 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.270
 These two members, I think, are the most famous 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.860
 Produce or allow us to get rid of waste. 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.229
 But this is part of the process, and it also helps us maintain 

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.410
 Water (in the body), the correct level, and the actual quantity of salts 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.010
 Or electrolytes, which we have, and blood pressure. But I will 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.870
 Just call it water conservation 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.960
 The kidneys also produce hormones and things I will not do 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.190
 Enter more details at this, for now. 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.580
 I really just want to stack on the first two as a kind of 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.210
 They only understand a general image of college function. 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.130
 Most of us own two of them. 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.480
 The kidneys are close to our backs, in both extremes 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.210
 Of the spine behind the liver. 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.470
 This is a magnifying picture of these. 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.239
 And if you see this in full screen mode. These will not be 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.150
 The same size as this picture. But we cut it to enable us 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.980
 Imagine what goes on inside the college. 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.130
 And to accommodate the different parts here. Just 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.660
 Because you will be clear when we start 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.520
 We talk about the functional unit or the nephron (Nepron) within 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.930
 College, this area from here to here, these 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.910
 They are called renal cortex. 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.550
 And when we talk about holistic, as 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.110
 You notice that they are preceded by the word "renal" (Renal), and this really refers to 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.580
 the college. 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.800
 Hence on the right there is a renal cortex, which is 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.230
 The outside part is there. 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.380
 And then this area specifically here, this is the heart of the kidney (Renal medulla) 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.480
 The word Medulla comes in the middle sense. 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.050
 That's why you can almost see it in the middle of college. 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.680
 In addition to understanding these words, we are going 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.350
 Note that this truth plays a very important role in 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.720
 Actual clearance or disposal of waste 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.730
 And the ability to not unload too much water or get rid of many of the 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.020
 Water when we try to filter the blood in our bodies. 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.720
 Like what I said before, I could have heard this before 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.330
 From another attendant or from another teacher, that 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.490
 The functional unit in the college is Nephron. 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.040
 The reason I called it a functional unit - I'll put it between quotation marks - 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.290
 Because of its level 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.250
 These two things happen 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.980
 The two basic functions of the kidney: disposal of waste 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.580
 And maintain water level 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.730
 In our bloody system 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.730
 To take his idea of ​​how Nephron is found in this 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.840
 Image of the College - I took this photo from Wikipedia - 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.420
 Paint Try to draw a number of Nephrons here 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.630
 The billionth would look like something like this 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.680
 And descends down towards the pulp, and then returns to 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.640
 Peel, and then pour into the university channels (Collecting ducts) 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.620
 The fluid will end up in the ureter in this area 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.960
 The end will reach the urinary bladder that we can then 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.880
 Get rid of them when we find the right time 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.770
 But that's all about - I think you can imagine 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.780
 Nephron length 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.030
 Here is where it starts and then pours there again 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.840
 So many kidneys continue to do this, but 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.840
 These are very thin 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.140
 These tubes or tubes, maybe should 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.800
 To say, is very slim 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.190
 Your average college will contain within limits 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.440
 Million million 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.470
 Can not say, Cleonate (Nephrones) microscopic 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.390
 It is somewhat at least - at least as long as it descends below 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.880
 I can notice the distance 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.510
 You can, however, accumulate many of them within one college 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.580
 In this essay, let us discover how the billionth 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.880
 Cleans the blood and make sure it is not too much 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.530
 Water or not much useful material in our blood ends 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.330
 In the urine 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.070
 Let me draw here a million 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.200
 I'll never do that 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.850
 We will start with blood flow 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.480
 Blood will enter through the artery - these are 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.780
 Blood capillaries, as you can say 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.589
 It will start to enter like this 

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.820
 This truth is called the evil that is contained 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.230
 You do not need to know the names 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.480
 But you can see it sometime 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.170
 The blood inside is here 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.060
 And then enter this great winding place 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.810
 This zigzag like this 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.060
 This is called cabbages 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.870
 And then departs through the two evils issued 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.610
 "Out" means far from center 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.750
 "Inward" means a region, "out" means far from center 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.340
 I will talk about this more in the future, 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.830
 But it is interesting that we are still dealing with 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.040
 An artery at this point 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.770
 The blood is still oxidized 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.260
 In normal, when blood capillaries leave like in 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.950
 The tubs here, are supposed to deal with 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.650
 Venous system, but here is still an arterial system 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.280
 This is probably because arteries have higher blood pressure 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.760
 And what we need to do is we need to 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.730
 Press the liquid and place the dissolved material in the liquid outside 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.970
 Blood and in the tubing here specifically 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.420
 The tubing is highly porous and surrounded by b 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.460
 Other cells 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.710
 This is somewhat cross-sectional 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.200
 It is surrounded by such a structure, and these 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.350
 Cells here, you can imagine these cells here 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.980
 Blood capillaries certainly have cells 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.960
 So there are cells here 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.140
 So when I draw these lines, these lines are actually made 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.420
 Of small cells 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.540
 Which happens that the blood enters 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.900
 In high pressure 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.960
 These are highly porous 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.410
 These cells are called external cells 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.880
 Here there is a weak capacity to choose 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.630
 What is filtered, almost a fifth of the liquid 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:20.640
 Which comes, comes in this area 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.550
 It is called the Bowman wallet 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.690
 Well, really, all this is called 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.940
 Bowman Wallet 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.650
 It is a spherical body containing an opening here, which blood capillaries can 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.050
 There are types that wrap around, and this area is precisely here 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.890
 Bowman Wallet 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.270
 Is the area within the Bouman portfolio, 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.150
 Everything has cells 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.200
 All these combinations are clearly - or can be 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.830
 Very clearly - composed of cells 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.730
 Eventually we will get primary urine 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.190
 The first urine is the thing that gets him to be purified
