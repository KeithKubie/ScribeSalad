I think the question of whether we
 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.350
I think the question of whether we
should be afraid of strong AI taking

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360
should be afraid of strong AI taking
 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.390
should be afraid of strong AI taking
over and squashing us like bugs because

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400
over and squashing us like bugs because
 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.759
over and squashing us like bugs because

that they employ they usually live
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.709
that they employ they usually live
longer and they're much more powerful

longer and they're much more powerful
 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.049
longer and they're much more powerful
than people and it's very hard for a

agency of the system that builds it that
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.290
agency of the system that builds it that
employs it and of course most of the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300
employs it and of course most of the
 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.849

according to the logic of these systems
if so if we want to have these systems

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100
if so if we want to have these systems
 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.010
if so if we want to have these systems
built in such a way that they treat us

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
built in such a way that they treat us
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.010

nicely we have to start right now and it

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020
nicely we have to start right now and it
 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.600
nicely we have to start right now and it
seems to be a very hard problem to do so

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
seems to be a very hard problem to do so
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.300
seems to be a very hard problem to do so
and the job loss because of automation

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310
and the job loss because of automation
 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.050
and the job loss because of automation
has several aspects on I think the most

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
has several aspects on I think the most
 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.609
has several aspects on I think the most
obvious thing that we should be seeing

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
obvious thing that we should be seeing
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.280
obvious thing that we should be seeing
is if our jobs can be done by machines

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290
is if our jobs can be done by machines
 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.080
is if our jobs can be done by machines
that's a very very good thing it's not a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
that's a very very good thing it's not a
 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.700
that's a very very good thing it's not a
buckets of future if I don't need to

clean the street if I don't need to
drive a car for other people if I don't

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729
drive a car for other people if I don't
 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.399

need to work a cash register for other

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
need to work a cash register for other
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.219
need to work a cash register for other
people if I don't need to pick goods in

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229
people if I don't need to pick goods in
 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.289
people if I don't need to pick goods in
a big warehouse and put it into boxes

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
a big warehouse and put it into boxes
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.499
a big warehouse and put it into boxes
that's an extremely good thing and the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
that's an extremely good thing and the
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.179
that's an extremely good thing and the
trouble that we have with this is that

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189
trouble that we have with this is that
 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.910
trouble that we have with this is that
right now this mode of labor that people

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920
right now this mode of labor that people
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.380
right now this mode of labor that people
sell their lifetime to some kind of

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390
sell their lifetime to some kind of
 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.050
sell their lifetime to some kind of
cooperation or employer is not only the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060
cooperation or employer is not only the
 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.639
cooperation or employer is not only the
way that we are productive it's also the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
way that we are productive it's also the
 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.859
way that we are productive it's also the
way we allocate resources this is how we

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869
way we allocate resources this is how we
 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.410
way we allocate resources this is how we
measure how how much bread you deserve

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420
measure how how much bread you deserve
 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.719
measure how how much bread you deserve
in this world and I think this is

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729
in this world and I think this is
 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.399
in this world and I think this is
something that we need to change some

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409
something that we need to change some
 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.080
something that we need to change some
people suggest that we need a universal

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090
people suggest that we need a universal
 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.690
people suggest that we need a universal
basic income I think it might be good to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
basic income I think it might be good to
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.730
basic income I think it might be good to
be able to pay people to be good

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
be able to pay people to be good
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.100
be able to pay people to be good
which means massive public employment

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110
which means massive public employment
 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.410
which means massive public employment
they are going to be many jobs that can

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420
they are going to be many jobs that can
 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.210
they are going to be many jobs that can
only be done by people and these are

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220
only be done by people and these are
 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.010
only be done by people and these are
those jobs where we are paid for being

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020
those jobs where we are paid for being
 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.600
those jobs where we are paid for being
good interesting people

good interesting people
 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.700
good interesting people
for instance good teachers good

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710
for instance good teachers good
 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.230
for instance good teachers good
scientists good philosophers good

thinkers good social people good nurses
for instance good people that raise

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900
for instance good people that raise
 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.380
for instance good people that raise
children good people that build

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390
children good people that build
 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.240

restaurants and theaters with people

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250
restaurants and theaters with people
 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.690
restaurants and theaters with people
that make art and for all these jobs we

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700
that make art and for all these jobs we
 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.180
that make art and for all these jobs we
will have enough productivity to make

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190
will have enough productivity to make
 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.770
will have enough productivity to make
sure that the enough bread comes on the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780
sure that the enough bread comes on the
 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.690
sure that the enough bread comes on the
table the question is how we can

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700
table the question is how we can
 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.610
table the question is how we can
distribute this there's going to be much

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620
distribute this there's going to be much
 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.500
distribute this there's going to be much
much more productivity in our future

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510
much more productivity in our future
 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.690
much more productivity in our future
actually actually we already have enough

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700
actually actually we already have enough
 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.790
actually actually we already have enough
productivity to give everybody in the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800
productivity to give everybody in the
 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.100
productivity to give everybody in the
u.s. an extremely good life and we

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110
u.s. an extremely good life and we
 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.720
u.s. an extremely good life and we
haven't fixed the problem of allocating

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730
haven't fixed the problem of allocating
 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.700
haven't fixed the problem of allocating
it how to distribute these things in the

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710
it how to distribute these things in the
 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.100
it how to distribute these things in the
best possible way and this is something

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110
best possible way and this is something
 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.360
best possible way and this is something
that we need to deal with in the future

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370
that we need to deal with in the future
 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.790
that we need to deal with in the future
and AI is going to accelerate this need

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800
and AI is going to accelerate this need
 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.410
and AI is going to accelerate this need
and I think by a large it might turn out

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420
and I think by a large it might turn out
 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.420
and I think by a large it might turn out
to be a very good thing that you're

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430
to be a very good thing that you're
 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.800
to be a very good thing that you're
forced to do this to address this

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810
forced to do this to address this
 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.620
forced to do this to address this
problem I mean if the past is any

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630
problem I mean if the past is any
 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.330
problem I mean if the past is any
evidence of the future it might be a

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340
evidence of the future it might be a
 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.660
evidence of the future it might be a
very bumpy road but who knows maybe when

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670
very bumpy road but who knows maybe when
 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.160
very bumpy road but who knows maybe when
we are forced to understand that

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170
we are forced to understand that
 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.980
we are forced to understand that
