00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:03.102
Well, I've been pretty busy. Met
a girl at SoHo house.

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:04.270 line:0%
-Was she your waitress?
-Yes.

00:00:04.303 --> 00:00:05.805 line:0%
Then I met a girl at Mastro's.

00:00:05.838 --> 00:00:07.640 line:0%
-Was she also your waitress?
-Yes.

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:09.108 line:0%
Then I met a girl
at P.F. Chang's.

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:11.144 line:0%
-Let me guess. She was your--
-A hooker, yes.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:14.113 line:0%
-But what she really wants to do
is wait tables.
-(LAUGHS)

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:17.183 line:0%
So I'm sending
the first draft of the book
to Pinky this afternoon.

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:20.053 line:0%
-What? It's done?
-Not yet. Almost.

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:22.155 line:0%
I'm excited for you to read it,

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.223 line:0%
but I'm also
cripplingly nervous.

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:26.192 line:0%
I actually kind of feel
like throwing up,

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:28.094 line:0%
but I can't throw up
because I haven't had
anything to eat

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:29.195 line:0%
because this lady
won't let me in my own kitchen.

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:31.731 line:0%
Cast and crew only.

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:34.067 line:0%
Listen, if reading a book
you wrote

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.169 line:0%
is anywhere near as great
as it is to actually spend time
with you,

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.703 line:0%
I'm sure
it's gonna be wonderful.

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:39.839 line:0%
Having said that,
what do I know about books?

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:41.775 line:0%
I'm just a dumb actor.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:46.345 line:0%
I'm here with Hollywoo darling,
Naomi Watts.

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:49.215 line:0%
Tell me, what attracted you
to the role of Diane?

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:51.084 line:0%
I just keep getting pigeonholed

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:53.753 line:0%
as these complex characters
in highly acclaimed movies.

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:55.721 line:0%
For once, I would just love
to phone it in

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:57.857 line:0%
and play a two-dimensional girl
in a rom com

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.325 line:0%
with no inner life of her own.

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:01.427 line:0%
Ha-ha! You said words.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.164 line:0%
Now, is it true
you stay in character
between takes?

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:07.767 line:0%
Oh, we all do.
The director insists upon it.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.770 line:0%
He even has everyone
calling me Diane

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:12.338 line:0%
to help me get in the headspace.

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:13.706 line:0%
Diane, looking good.

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:15.775 line:0%
-Um, thanks.
-Ugh, not you.

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:18.244 line:0%
-I was talking to Diane.
-Oh, thank you.

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:20.346 line:0%
-Now, where's my peanut butter?
-Right over here, Q.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:23.182 line:0%
-No, I'm looking
for peanut butter.
-Oh, you mean BoJack?

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:25.184 line:0%
If I wanted BoJack,
I would call BoJack.

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:27.186 line:0%
Did someone call for BoJack?

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.123 line:0%
It really cuts down
on confusion.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.295 line:0%
Aloha, kemosabe.

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:38.731 line:0%
Hey, allow me
to put on my producer hat

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:41.167 line:0%
and produce you
just for one second here.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.302 line:0%
I have a few notes
on how you're playing me.

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:44.370
Let's see. Here we go.

00:01:44.403 --> 00:01:46.339
I find it really troubling

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:49.775
that my movie self
is wearing a crew-neck T-shirt.
(LAUGHS)

00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:51.811
-You see the problem.
-I do not.

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:53.179
I just think
if we're telling the story,

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:54.914
we should tell it
how it really happened.

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:57.150
Yeah, this whole story
isn't how it really happened.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.252
Right...

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.853
because of the shirts.

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:02.421
Because I'm the one
who stole the D.

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:03.890
I'm the real hero here.

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.191
My life is full
of exciting adventures.

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:08.194
I should write a book.
Oh, wait. I did.

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:10.329
Hey, you're in a mood.

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:13.299
Perhaps the tightness
of that crew neck is cutting off
circulation to the brain?

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:14.867
Let me talk to Donna
in wardrobe.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.900
Donna!
