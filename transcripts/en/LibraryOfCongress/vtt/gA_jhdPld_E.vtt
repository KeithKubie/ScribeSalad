00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.900
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.200
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: So welcome

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.570
to the sixteenth annual
National Book Festival.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.570
On behalf of the Library of
Congress and all of our donors,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.890
I'm very pleased to be here today.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.300
My name is Colleen Shogan.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.030
I'm the Deputy Director at the
Library of Congress of National

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.800
and International Outreach,
the unit that takes care

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.840
of the National Book Festival so
we're very excited after months

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.070
and months of work to be here today
and I'm joined by two gentlemen,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.440
two authors that really
need no introduction,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.200
but I'm going to try
to do it anyways.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.170
Newt Gingrich is the former Speaker
of the House of Representatives.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.440
He the author, co-author of over
25 fiction and non-fiction books

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.320
and his latest book is
a page turning thriller

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.650
that we're going to
talk about today.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.650
And Congressman Steve Israel
represents the third district

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.850
of New York and previously
had an anthology of one

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.970
of the greatest wartime speeches

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.950
and his latest book
is a political satire.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.580
So, please join me in
welcoming these two guests

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.510
to the National Book Festival.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.870
[ Clapping ]

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.210
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: So,
we'll start out just talking

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.020
about your most recent books.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.620
Speaker Gingrich, can you
tell us about "Duplicity"?

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.800
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: Well, we wanted
to set out to explore the tension,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.500
for example, between
loyalties and so,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.960
"Duplicity" really has
three parallel tracks.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.640
One is a member of the
Somali community in Minnesota

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.870 position:56%
who is running for Congress while
his brother is the number two leader

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.050
in Al Shabaab in Somalia,
and you have all the tension

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.640
of a family split between those
who have become modern and American

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.300
and those who have rejected America
and gone back to be terrorists.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.470
Second, we have the
actual adventure in Somalia

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.050
in which we have a marine officer,
and african-american woman,

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.360
who is directly engaged in
very difficult situation along

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.180
with the head of the CIA
station and that's sort

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.100
of a pure action, classical thing.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.960
And then third, we have
a Presidential campaign

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.530
in which the incumbent President
has made the decision to prove

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.210 position:56%
that they're tough on foreign policy
by opening the embassy in Somalia

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.260
against everybody's advice and
it blows up and then you get

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.540
into the sort of underlying,

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.870
do you really tell the truth
even though it might cost you the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.770
election or do you find a
way not to tell the truth,

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.220 position:56%
which actually runs parallel to some

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.200
of the things that's
in Steve's novel.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.330
So, Steve and I in
some ways are dealing

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.070
with very different angles towards
the same dilemma of a free society

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.090
that finds transparency
a little difficult.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: And can you tell
us about "The Global War on Morris"?

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.270
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel: I
will Colleen, thank you.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.790
You know there's congressional
courtesy.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.250
There's also author's courtesy.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.960
Colleen is a great author...

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.260
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Thank you.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.820
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel: She's written
some thrillers about Capitol Hill

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.440
and the word thriller and Capitol
Hill don't really belong together

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.340 position:56%
in the same sentence, but I
commend your attention to her books.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.220
My book, "The Global War on Morris"
is a parody of Washington, D.C.,

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.890
the White House and Congress
and it was based on truth.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.820
I was elected to Congress in
2001, 2000 starting serving 2001

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.320
and I immediately found
myself, tragically after 9/11

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.860
in the most classified settings
you could imagine the President

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.660
of the United States and the Vice
President and so I had perspective

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.380
into the thinking and the dialog
of our nation's top leaders

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.160
and how you respond to terror.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.280
And several years later I
happened to be at a hearing

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.200
of the Armed Services
Committee, where I learned

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.090
that the Federal Government,
and this is consistent

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.310
with Speaker Gingrich's writing,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.920
that Federal Government had
accidentally spied on a group

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.860
of innocent elderly Quakers
in the state of Florida.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.830
And I had my plot.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.710
Now, I know nothing about innocent
elderly Quakers in Florida,

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.640
but I'm an expert in white Jewish
men in their fifties on Long Island

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.490
and so I invented this
character, Morris Feldstein,

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.030
who is non political,
hates watching the news.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.170
He just likes watching Met
and Turner Classic Movies.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.210
Mr. Speaker, Atlanta.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.460
And for some reason he is
believed to be a leading terrorist.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.180
So it is a story of what happens

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.300
when a completely innocent
human American is believed

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.370
to be a major terrorist
and I tell the story

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.610
through the prism of
parody and satire.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.780
Rob Reiner is trying to develop
it for film, but I've learned

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.980
that giving a famous
Hollywood producer an option

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.500
on a book is the functional
equivalent

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.150
to a bill being referred
to committee.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.920
It just languishes forever
and that's where it is.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.030
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Let's talk a
little bit about Morris Feldstein.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.920 position:56%
He's a pharmaceutical representative

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.700
who becomes a national
terrorism suspect.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.400
The first time I read
your book, I thought well,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.140
this was a tire happenstance of
circumstance, all these bad things

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.960
that happen to Morris Feldstein.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.970
Then, the next time I read the
book, when I was getting ready

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.170 position:56%
for the book festival, I thought
maybe Morris made some bad decisions

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.600
that inadvertently led to some of
the things that happened to him.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.060
So, can you comment on that and
tell us more about the genesis

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.300
and how you view Morris Feldstein?

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.860
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel: Morris
is a completely innocent

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.610
apathetic character.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.040
His wife Rona is very involved.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.340
Very engaged.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.760
She has a crush on Wolf Blitzer,
but Morris, like all of us,

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.230
occasionally makes a mistake.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.930
He may have visited an
internet site unwittingly

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.050 position:56%
that the Federal Government notices.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.580
He may have had a conversation
with somebody

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.070
who he doesn't realize may
be a person of suspicion.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.000
And through the entire series
of accidents, of coincidence,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.910
of innocence, Morris Feldstein is
believed to be a major terrorist

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.880 position:56%
and the story is about how the
entire Federal Government just comes

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.390
down on this poor guy who can't
understand why every time he goes

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.250
to work there are helicopters over
him on the Long Island Expressway.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.710
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Speaker
Gingrich, talking in keeping

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.410
with the character
development, you mentioned one

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.560
of your very interesting
characters, Captain Brooke Grant,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.610
your book moves from place to
place and storyline to storyline

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.980 position:56%
from different points of view, which
is actually very difficult to do

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.860
as a writer because you have
to keep it all in your head,

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.940
but tell us about Captain Grant.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.430 position:56%
Why you came up with that character?

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.110
It's very unusual to have a heroine
in a thriller and are we going

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.240
to see her in future books?

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.810
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: Well, working
backwards, yes, you'll see her

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.190
in a book that comes out in October
that's called "Treason" and I think

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.810
by that stage she's a Major and
her career is semi prospering.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.650
We want to do a couple things and
we talked about this in length

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.310
and I have to say that this
particular book was written

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.840
with Pete Earley who
is a terrific talent.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.550
He used to work at the Washington
Post and has written a number

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.090
of books in his own right
and we would really sit down

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.170
and really try to think through.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.850
So, we started from an
outline because we have

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:39.190
so many parallel threads that you
really have to have some sense

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.490
of how they're going
to fit together.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.630 position:56%
It's like sort of building
architecture before you start laying

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.930
the foundation.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.590
And part of our discussion
was that we wanted

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.100
to represent the complexities
of the modern military.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.850
So, we wanted to find somebody,

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:59.320
and the Marines are normally
assigned to Embassys.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:05.350
So, we wanted to find somebody who
would represent the change over,

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.030
which is very real, in
which you would have a woman

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.300
in a position that's
potentially in combat

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:18.000
and in this case her
parents had both died in 9/11

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.290
and so she had a real
vested interest.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.390
We also tied her back
into the power structure

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:28.910
because her father's brother,
her uncle, had become Chairman

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:32.940
of the Joint Chiefs and there's
a tension between his desire

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.290
to not let her get in
danger and her determination

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.450 position:56%
to be treated like any other Marine.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.600
Although, nobody knows going
into it that Somalia's going

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.210
to blow up the way it does.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.350
By the way, in doing some of
the research for some of this,

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:49.070
if you go to Australian Foreign
Ministries website they very

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.690
explicitly say, do not go
to Somalia and remember

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.140
that the airport is a high
value target for the terrorists

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.540
because it's where people like
you who are really stupid go.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:03.560
I mean we were just reassured that
nothing had improved dramatically

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.730
and we weren't writing about
something was implausible.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.560
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: You have
written all kinds of books,

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.220 position:56%
as I mentioned in your introduction.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.450
You've written some
historical fiction,

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.230
I believe that writing thrillers
is a new endeavor for you.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.420
Do you have any particular
influences?

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.100
Why did you decide
to write a thriller?

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.700
Are there other thriller
writers that you like to read?

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.000
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: Well,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.210
we've written some very
interesting fiction books,

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:29.500
both straight historical fiction,
three volumes on George Washington,

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.890
for example, and then
alternative histories,

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.240
one of which we have Lee winning
at Gettysburg and then walk

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.370
through permutations for two more
volumes of what might have happened

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.420
in a post Gettysburg
Confederate victory kind of world.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:49.200
And we did a Pearl Harbor which we
had Admiral Yamamoto come forward

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.270
and lead the raid as the
greatest Japanese aviation leader.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.110
So, we've done that kind of
stuff and I've been approached

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.290
for a number of years to do
something that was contemporary,

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.740
but I didn't feel comfortable
and the more I got engaged

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.160
in studying terrorism and it's a
funny thing because our two books

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:12.190
in a way are really both
pieces of the same problem.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.740
In that Steve is giving
you a cautionary tale

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:21.400
about the security state's ability
to get totally wrong and to do it

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.730
in a way that you as an
individual are almost helpless

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.030
in competing with.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.490
I'm trying to get across
the idea that that's true,

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.240
but by the way there
really are bad guys.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.070
And the bad guys actually
tend to lie

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.490
and that our politicians
are stunningly short sided

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.230
and I'm can say this
having been a politician.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:44.720
All the pressures of the
system are on this morning.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.010 position:56%
I once spoke to a very sophisticated
National Security Advisor

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.820
who had a very deep training
in all this stuff and I said,

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.110
so what's your strategic plan?

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:59.160
And he said, it's the front
page of the Washington Post.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.690
He said, I get up in the morning
and that defines how we're going

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.350 position:56%
to spend the day and so we want to
indicate that when we make decisions

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.240 position:56%
in that framework, and they start to
go bad, particularly if it's close

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.020
to an election, everybody
has a pressure to lie.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.830
And it's not particularly Benghazi.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.860
You can go back through the last
five Presidencies, there are plenty

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.920
of examples of that underlying
pressure to say the thing

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.110
that will get you through
the election even

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.550
if you know it's totally wrong.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.340
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Talking
about writing style,

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.540
when I read "The Global War on
Morris" I was really reminded

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.900
of the writing of Christopher
Buckley.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.850
You have a very witty, humorous,

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.180
laugh out loud at times
writing style.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.480
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel: Thank you.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.780
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Tell us a
little bit about your influences

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.340
and how did you develop
that writing style?

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.640
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel:
Well, let me just comment

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.940
on something the Speaker said.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.440
He said he's no longer a politician
so he can say certain things.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.970
I have to wait until January fifth

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.760
when I'm no longer a politician
to say the same things.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.060
So invite me back next year.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.360
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Ok.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.970
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel: I was very
much influenced by Carl Hiaasen.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.270
I think he's...

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.570
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: He's here.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:08.870
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel: He's here?

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.170
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: He's
here at the Book Festival.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.470
Unfortunately, I think
at the same time.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.770
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel: Oh.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.980
I'll see you guys later.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.280
Christopher Buckley.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.390
One of the great thrills in writing
the book, there were two thrills.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.610
Well three, Speaker Gingrich said
he enjoyed the comedy in the book.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:29.030
Bill Clinton called me, I was on
the road one day and I got a call

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.300
from Bill Clinton and I thought,
oh my God he's going to grill me

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.830
about some race in
Arkansas, I was the chairman

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.380
of the democratic national
campaign committee.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.940
He's unhappy about
something and he got one

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.170
and he said, Steve,
I love your book.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.180
That was the second thing.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.190
And the third was I got an
email from Christopher Buckley

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.660
who had read my book
saying he enjoyed it

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.990
and he encouraged me
to write further.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.650
But the guy who really influenced
me the most, I have to say,

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.260
is an author named Nelson DeMille.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.520
I don't know if all of
you are familiar with him.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.820
He's just wonderful.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.120
He happens to be a Long Islander.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:05.490
The John Corey series, "Gatehouse",
"Lions Gate", "Panther" and I got

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:10.070
to know him and I just loved his
style because he writes thrillers,

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.540
but with that kind of comic
overtone to it and I said Nelson,

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.010
I'm thinking about writing
this book, what's your advice?

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.420
He said, well if I
were you I would one,

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.070
don't quit your day
job, stay in Congress.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.880
Two, get plenty of alcohol.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.350
Lock yourself in a room and
don't bring in any weapons.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.400
And he helped mentor me
during the writing of the book

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.180
and he was very, very helpful.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.990
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Well, speaking
of that, you wrote "The Global War

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.600
on Morris" when you're a
sitting member of Congress

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.810
and that's a pretty busy job right?

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.290
We can all agree on that.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.890
So, how did you fit that
into your day to day work.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.450
Writing takes time so
how did you manage that?

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.750
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel: I
wrote the entire book,

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.960 position:56%
and I know this seems implausible,
I wrote the entire book on what used

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.480
to be my Blackberry and
then my iPhone in real time.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.390
So, I would come out of a
briefing with President Bush,

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.880
Vice President Cheney, obviously
I wasn't allowed to bring anything

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.910
out of the briefing, but I would
just kind of write my impressions

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:08.140
and the dialog that I heard and
then when I would see something

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.710
or hear something I
would just start writing.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.920
Planes, trains and automobiles.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.500
I would wake up every morning
at five, write for a couple

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.240
of hours then go to work and then
during some Congressional committee

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.500
meetings, depending
on who was testifying.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Speaker Gingrich,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.840
you're not in Congress
anymore, but you're very busy.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.790
You're a political consultant
in political communications.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.110
When do you find time to write?

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.410
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: Before
I answer that,

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.950
let me say what you'll find
if you read these books.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:42.030
His understanding of that part of
his constituency is extraordinary

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:47.310
and if like me you have not grown
up surrounded by aging Jewish,

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.700
males who are intimidated
by their wives,

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.210
the whole thing is a
revelation, the way he writes it.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.870
And this is one of the keys
to these kind of books.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.110
It has the ring of
such authenticity,

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.890
that it's really remarkable

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:05.600
and I think it makes it a
very, very intriguing book.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.880
I mostly write on airplanes

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.000
or we take cruises occasionally,
I'll write on the ship.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.240
But it's a little bit like Steve
said, I tend to write episodically

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:24.030
when I can get around to it and I
have the virtue I write very fast.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:27.000 position:56%
Callista will tell you I don't write
very well because she edits a lot

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.710
of my stuff and it's accompanied
by a lot of painful noises.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:38.210
I write very fast and I can edit
very fast and so the key thing

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.300
to me is, there are two things.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.030
One, when I was very young, I wrote
a book called "The King of Paris"

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.490
which was a biography
of Alexandre Dumas,

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:51.440 position:56%
who was the second most popular
French novelist of the 19th century.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.330
And when he was young
somebody said to him,

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:59.460 position:56%
live life until it's overflowing and
then write, and so part of it is,

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.440
I've studied history, I've
lived a little bit of history.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.380
A lot of things I can
write about very fast

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.070
because they're already in my head.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:13.710
The second part of it is, I find
thinking harder than the writing.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.150
So, getting it in your head.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:19.400 position:56%
When we did Gettysburg, for example,
we got the Army warcologist experts

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.630
and went out for three days,
walked the real battlefield,

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.870
then we developed an alternative
battlefield and had people

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.530
who had really immersed their
lifetime in understanding that

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.770
and that's part of what we do.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:37.230
We went out to Minneapolis and the
sheriff was very helpful and we sat

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.700
down with a whole group of Somali
community leaders and talked

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.680 position:56%
about the pressures in the
community and what they worry about,

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.280
what's happening and so forth.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.190
So, we tried to build
that sort of thing.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.680
I spend time with some people who
had been in Somalia for Black Hawk

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.970
Down so over the years, so
I had a pretty good sense

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.040 position:56%
of Mogadishu and that sort of thing.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.940
So, you piece together all those
things and then I agree with part

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.130
of what Steve was saying, it's
really helpful to write like crazy.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:08.040 position:56%
Don't get too tied up in parsing it.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.880
Just get it out of you and
then you can start editing.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.180
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Ok.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.480
A question for both of you.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.070
How much of your fiction
writing, if at all,

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:20.420
a proxy for your own
political beliefs?

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:25.910
Or do you tend to keep those two
things, like I do, very separate?

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:27.920
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: In my
case, it's 100 percent.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.990
I mean I'm writing about a
world that I worry about.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:36.310
Whether it's about the
alternative histories or Washington

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.650
or the current problems
with terrorism.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:43.460
So, for me, whether I'm
writing non-fiction or fiction,

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.140
they're actually parallel
because they're didactic.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.310
I'm trying to communicate messages

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:52.340
that I hope people will take
seriously and will think about.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.780
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel: I
write from right to left,

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:59.530 position:56%
not from the Jewish perspective, but
from the ideological perspective.

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:04.980
So, my writing is left of center,
but I was cognizant as I wrote

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.000
"The Global War on
Morris" that this had

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.640 position:56%
to be an equal opportunity offender.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.540 position:56%
So, I actually take on President
Obama in various points in the book.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:17.610
There are quotes in this book from
President Obama, and so I tried

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.200
to make sure there was some balance

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.210
and you know frankly I'm just
putting a question out there

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:26.590
and that is, how does the
government get it right

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:31.220
when the pendulum swings
from protecting our security

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.490
to protecting our civil liberties?

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:35.630
What happens when the
government gets it wrong?

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.910
And I think that that's
a question that is

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.650
in fact a bipartisan inquiry.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:41.950
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Ok.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.430
One last question before we
open it up to the audience.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.440
Two parter.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.740
What are you writing now?

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.210
What are you working on right now

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.020
and do you have a new
book coming out soon?

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.270
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: Well, the book
we have coming out in October is

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:58.020
"Treason" and actually
what we're working on now,

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.990
plus in addition to
books, I do movies.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.920
We just finished a documentary
on Washington called,

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.060
"The First American" and we're
working on the first phases

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.210
of a documentary or potentially
a multipart series on women

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:15.050
in the American Revolution,
which is really interesting

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:18.700
and a much more powerful
story and has been told.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.580
So, that takes up a lot
of our creative time

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:26.160
and then we frankly run Gingrich
Productions and do 25 other things.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.780
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Ok.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.110
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel: I am almost
finished with a manuscript to Simon

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.330
and Schuster, it's similar to
"The Global War on Morris".

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.360
It's a political parody
about the gun debate

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.490
in Congress called "Big Guns".

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:39.790
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Ok.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:41.090
Terrific. We'll look
forward to that.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:42.880
If there are any questions
from the audience,

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.330
we'd be happy to take them.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:51.290
There's two microphones
situated here on the aisles.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.620
&gt;&gt; Hi thanks.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.590
I liked "Duplicity", though
I must say that I did not

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:55.890
like the heroine a little bit.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:20:01.230
I think she's a little bit
too snarky, but she was brave.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:06.400
I wondered, the woman
President, was there anything

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:10.550
about the Hillary campaign in that?

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.210
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: There wasn't,
but we really wrestled more

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:17.240
about whether or not to have a
woman President than we wrestled

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.830
about to have a woman in
combat because we thought

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:24.800
that that would lead to that and
it's not necessarily Hillary and,

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.580
in fact, I don't know that Hillary
would behave very much the way we

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.950
had President Alworth
behaving in the novel.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.810
But again, we wanted to
portray a moment in time

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:38.710
where an incumbent President
felt they had a real challenger

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:42.240
and took steps to knock out the
real challenger and the steps blew

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.650
up in their face and now
they had to figure out how

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.940
to handle the last six
weeks of the campaign.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:51.670
And I think that's a very plausible
scenario no matter what the sex

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:55.610
of either, the challenger
or the incumbent.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.390
&gt;&gt; This also for you
Speaker Gingrich.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.570
You wrote about a strong
african-american woman.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:06.850
How did you go about being able
to write from her perspective?

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:11.970 position:56%
What would be your research in doing
it from such a not you perspective?

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: Well, I don't know

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.590
if I should resent that
implication or not.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:22.180
We talked to a number of people,
particularly in the Marine Corp,

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.250
and the longest serving
teacher in the senior military.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.870
I've spent about a quarter century.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.780
My dad was a career
infantryman in the Army and so,

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.470
I have a very wide
range of contacts.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:38.930
We were also careful because
we wanted her to be a person

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:42.990
who was very determined
to be a professional

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:47.170 position:56%
and this has been my experience
when you talk with the vast majority

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.380
of rising younger women
in the military,

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.710
particularly in the officer
corp. I mean they're in there not

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:57.120
to be judged as a woman and not to
be judged as an african-american.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.200
They're in there to be judged
as a professional and you find,

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.630
for example, in the Marine
Corp a very deep sense

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:08.400
of cultural esprit de corp and we
tried to communicate that sense

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.360
and her unwillingness to back down.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:15.130 position:56%
Her unwillingness to be relegated
to a secondary role by various guys,

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.590
most of whom are less
competent than she was.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.780
&gt;&gt; Thanks for the time.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.190
This is a little bit more
of a political question.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:29.470
So, I apologize, but for both of
you, I actually got into politics,

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:33.260
volunteered for a Congressman
and Senator about ten years ago.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.380
I thought things were
really bad back then,

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.340
they seem to have gotten a little
bit worse, especially I'm going

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.880
to say on the polarization front.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:47.150
So, you go onto Facebook or
Twitter and it's sometimes you open

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.810
up Facebook and you
close it down again

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:50.680
because you're like
I don't need this.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.750
And I'm wondering what
you guys think

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.010
from leadership positions
in respective parties.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.190
What's driving this
rigorous political

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:59.490
[ inaudible ]

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.020
. This has been going
up and up and up.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.700
What's driving the
polarization at root?

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.410
What can you guys do about it?

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:06.920
Do you think it's a problem?

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.530
I mean and what should we
do about it as individuals?

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.610
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel:
Here's my experience.

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:16.460
Several years ago there was
a Republican Congressman

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.570
from Springfield, Illinois
named Tim Johnson.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:25.350 position:56%
Tim Johnson and I, understanding how
polarized the Congress had become

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.510
and how polarized the country was,

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:31.730
created the House Center
Aisle Caucus and we would meet

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:37.200
on Monday nights at the Hunan
Dynasty Chinese restaurant

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.980
because cheap chinese food
is something Republicans

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.770
and Democrats can agree to
instantly and this is what we'd do.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.070
So, I use this as an example

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:46.720
and then I'll tell you
quickly what went wrong.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.570
We would have a timer and
set it for five minutes,

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.460
pick an issue, healthcare.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.780
Five minutes, state
your disagreements.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.780
Fifty five minutes
what can you agree on?

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.130
It was the most liberating
experience I've had in Congress.

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.560
Twenty five Democrats,
Twenty five Republicans.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:06.890
After two years, the Center
Aisle Caucus was almost defunct.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.190
Members had to leave.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:12.870
Why? I believe because of
Congressional redistricting

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.490
on both sides of the aisle.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:17.360
There were 435 Congressional
Districts in Congress.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.660
I'm the former Chairman

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.250
of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.410
My job was to elect Democrats
and defeat Republicans.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:27.280
I can tell you, the true number of
competitive Congressional Districts

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:32.860
in the country out of 435,
maybe 60 if that much.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.420
So, if your Congressional District
has been drawn to the far left

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:40.480
or to the far right, you wake up
every morning in fear of a primary

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.900
from the far left or the far right

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:46.830
and that divides the
Congress to the extremes.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:50.750
One of the smartest things we can
do in my belief, is to find a way

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:53.400
to have non-partisan redistricting.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.440
Draw districts back
towards the center.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.560
So, members of Congress
are incentivized

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.510
to compromise rather
than to polarize.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:07.900
[ Clapping ]

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.160
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: Yeah, I guess
I'd make two very different points.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:18.210
The first is, intense
polarization is not uniquely 21st

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:19.510
century behavior.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.330
If you go see the musical
"Hamilton",

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:24.630
you'll notice that the Vice
President shoots the Secretary

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.840
of Treasury.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.830
And we haven't had
that happen in years.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:34.750
Yeah, so I start with the
idea that this is a very rough

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:38.600
and tumble country and
politics, Dick Gephardt,

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.890
who was a Democratic
leader when I was speaker.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:42.780
Dick and I used to
talk about the fact

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.790
that politics is how
we sublimate Civil War.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:51.390
Politics is about dreams,
passions, ideals, interests,

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:56.650
money and there are really
big differences that are real.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.680
They're not just made up by things.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.610
I think the one where I
guess I would be skeptical

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:04.230
of Steve's solution, is
if you look at the Senate

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.420
where they're elected
statewide there's no

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:07.720
[ inaudible ]

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.580
. The Senate is at least as
deadlocked as the House in terms

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.130
of partisan and I think
that's in part

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.350
because the divide is that real.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:18.100
I mean if you look at the
underlying polling data right now,

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.240
the gap between a hard
line Hillary person

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.410
and a hard line Trump
person is a really big gap

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:29.060
and it's reflected in
the two candidates.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:33.500
And remember in some ways to
Trump's to Cruz was in some ways

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.520
to Trump's right and certainly
Sanders was in some ways

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.090
to Hillary's left, so the potential
gap could have been bigger.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.660
Not smaller and I think we're
in a process as a conversation

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.340
as a country that could easily
take 20 more years to sort out.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.970
If we had really smart it could
take four to eight to twelve years,

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:56.110
not very smart it could take up to
20, but we've had very difficult,

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:58.240
now, I'm not being a Pollyanna.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:02.280
Charles Krauthammer asked me one
night why I was fairly comfortable

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.830
with the risk of Trump
and what was going on

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.720
and I said, well I'm a historian.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.830
Compared to the American
Civil War, this isn't bad.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:12.570
He said, that's your standard?

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.350
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Terrific.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:19.650
Next question.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.640
&gt;&gt; Mr. Speaker, first a comment.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.270
A lot of people write about the
Army and I appreciate your writing

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:28.270
about the Marine Corps
in your most recent book.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.710
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: Let me point
out that as an army brat,

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:35.370
there was a certain
pain in that decision.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:38.360
&gt;&gt; Secondly, take you
back to the 90's.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.550
A book you wrote, "1945".

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.820
Are there any plans for any
type of sequel in the works?

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.030
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: You know,
Bill Fortune who was my coauthor

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:51.410
for that, "1945" was an alternative
history in which for a variety

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:55.210
of reasons, Hitler does not
declare war on the U.S. We end

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:57.890
up only staying the
Pacific Campaign.

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:01.520
Hitler wins the European Campaign
and then things evolve from there.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.590
We talk about it occasionally,

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:08.640
this is an interesting
insider book story.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:14.680
I'd given a speech at the annual
Science Fiction Convention

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.860
on the importance of man's space
and the importance of breaking

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:21.450
out of the NASA bureaucracy and Jim
Bane, who was a wonderful guy came

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:25.030 position:56%
up to me and said, you know I'll
pay you some money to you know write

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:28.050
about a book about all
these ideas and he did

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:30.700
and I wrote a small book called
"Window of Opportunity" which came

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:34.450
out in 1984, which discouragingly
is still fairly accurate.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.310
We haven't broken through
on most of those fronts.

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:40.670
So, he came back to me, the
year before he became Speaker

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:44.680
and he said, I want you and
Fortune to write this novel

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.730
about alternative history,
so we did.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:52.060
When I became Speaker,
I wrote a book called,

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:56.740
"To Renew America" based in course,
we're doing American Civilization.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:02.980
And it began the number one
bestseller for it did very well.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:06.000
And Bane suddenly got excited.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.600
He has a little novel which has
nothing to do with public policy.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:14.570
And is in the shadow of a number
one bestseller and he prints

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:18.840
like 200,000 copies
and I said to him Jim,

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.780
you know, so the book was a dog.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:24.920
As his perspective as a
publisher it sold 30,000 copies,

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.470
which might have been
nice if he printed 40,000,

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:29.280
but you print 200,000
and he's eating them

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.690
as a little publisher, he's dying.

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:35.270
So, for years people said
Gingrich can't sell fiction.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:38.470
When we finally got a
contract to do Gettysburg,

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:41.550
they printed like 25,000
copies and sold

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:44.810
out the second week
we're sitting there

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:46.110
because they didn't believe it.

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:48.630
They said, how does this happen?

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:52.290
So, all these years later,
fortunately I've looked at the idea

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:55.030
of trying to find somebody
who'd be interested in the idea

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:59.170
of publishing the sequel to
"1945" because it does kind

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:01.960
of have a cult following, and
it's just one of those things

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.100
where of all the projects
we're working on,

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.400
we've never quite had the energy,

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:09.350 position:56%
but I suspect if a publisher hearing
this decides to rush up to us

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.650
that Bill and I could be talked to.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:13.670
&gt;&gt; Well, hopefully.

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.050
Thank you.

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:18.300
&gt;&gt; So, one of the last
questions was about polarization

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:22.230
and about social media and my
question is for both of you.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.940
Since both of you write books,

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:28.860
which most people my age don't
read anymore, how do you both

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:34.450
as politicians and as authors
thrive in this age of social media

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:37.690
where everything is
instant and built

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:44.700 position:56%
to this very shortened tailored
sound byte, rather than a full novel

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.200
or book or complete idea?

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.500
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel:
That's a great question.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:52.980
That's a great question and for
me the book was a form of therapy

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:56.170
because as a member of Congress,
when I go on any network,

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.990
doesn't matter whether
it's Fox or CNN or MSNBC,

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:01.990
I've got to make my
point in sound byte.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:04.020
These days when you go to the floor
of the House of Representatives,

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:08.490
you get a one minute
speech, a one minute speech.

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:12.670
If you're lucky a five minute
speech, no more than that and so,

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:15.150
as a member of Congress, there
may be some of my colleagues here

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:17.700
and I think they would agree,
I found myself very frustrated

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.560
with the fact the we're dealing
with some of the most complex

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.510
and profound issues of our time.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:26.250
Maybe in all of American
history and we've got

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.250
to boil it down to sound byte.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:32.240
So, one the issue of the
balance between personal security

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.940
and personal liberty, this was my
way of really thinking about it.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.510
Of exploring it and
not being confined

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:42.460
to a sound byte or
a one minute speech.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.960 position:56%
It's how I grappled with that issue.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.730
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: Let me offer
you a slightly different version.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.800
First of all, don't they still
allow one hour special orders?

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.060
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel: Yeah,
but nobody watches those.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.820
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: Just as
a background for a minute.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:03.570
My career began, I'd lost twice
in '74 and '76 and I arrived

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:08.190
in Congress and was sworn in
in January of '79 and in April

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:15.120
of '79 C-SPAN started and so I
became the leading user of C-SPAN

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.620 position:56%
and because I used to teach college,

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:22.760
I thought 55 minutes was a
plausible length of time.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.580
And so several of us got in the
habit, we would speak for an hour

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.230
and all of our colleagues would
say, nobody's listening to that.

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:31.280
Well the truth was that a quarter
of a million people were listening

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:35.750
to it in any given hour and so, I
would try to say to my colleagues,

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:38.510
how far would you fly to try to
talk to you a thousand people,

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:41.050
which is a big crowd if
you're a House member.

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:42.990
You know, they'd fly
all across the country.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:46.150
I said ok, so you can walk across
the street from your office,

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:48.880
go on the house floor and reach
a quarter of a million people.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.510
And one of my favorite
stories, Bob Walker was one

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:55.410
of the leading people,
he's from Pennsylvania.

00:32:55.410 --> 00:33:04.480 position:56%
And there was a group in Waterloo,
Iowa who were the Waterloo Watchdogs

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.940
and they were Republican women
and they would watch C-SPAN

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.200
and then they would all get
together over coffee and talk

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.160
about whatever we had just
talked about on C-SPAN.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.270
And in this period, Jack Kemp
was the best known Republican

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:17.570
House member.

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:23.030
Kemp ends up in Puerto Rico
and says, oh my God, Mr. Kemp,

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:24.330
do you serve in the House?

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:25.630
He says, yes I do.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.690
She said, do you know Bob Walker?

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:30.580
Suredly enough for Kemp

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:35.960
who was totally humiliated,
says I know Bob Walker.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.890
But here's my point.

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:43.470
Abraham Lincoln could debate for
hours as he did with Douglass

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:48.340
and could also give the
most important inaugural

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:52.180
and the most important kick
off speech in American history,

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:57.000
both of which you could stand at
the Lincoln Memorial and read.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.670
They're that short.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.760
So, Lincoln would have done
fine in one minute units,

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.680
because he would have summarized
what he was going to say.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.930
Now, he could also send up and
I recommend to you the State

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:11.940
of the Union address he sent
up in December of 1862 as one

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.380
of the great state
documents in American history.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:19.900
He could also write extraordinary
deeply thought through messages

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:23.650
to Congress which were
aimed at the country.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:26.960
The greatest single
political achievement

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.340
in American history is
Lincoln sustaining the morale

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:35.570
of the North despite the casualty
rate and despite the defeats.

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:39.900
And it's all done by the
ability to articulate in a way

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.250
that combines moral effect
with practical effect

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:48.140
so people decided yeah, I have
the pain, but we have no choice.

00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:51.470 position:56%
And if you want to really study the
genius at that level, study Lincoln.

00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:56.870
In our case, we are enormously
helped by Christina Maruna

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:59.250
who leads our social media project.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:02.320
We have like a million,
600,000 people on Twitter,

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:07.930
about 710,000 on Facebook and
we do from documentary films

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:10.430
to short things on Facebook.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:12.290
We do lots of Facebook live,

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.870
some of which gets a couple
hundred thousand views

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:18.080
and then we write books,
so we live in a country

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.540
that if you're willing to,
there's an amazing number of ways

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:24.960
to reach people and let
them go through a crescendo.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.200
You know, they get the one minute
version, the ten minute version,

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.700
the long article, the book,
the seven volume course.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.270
I mean you can do all these things

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.500
and have a conversation,
but it takes times.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.990
We're not used to the
frustration that maybe this kind

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:44.330
of dialog takes 10 years
rather than 13 weeks.

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:45.860
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Ok.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.160
Next question.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.370
&gt;&gt; Yes, good afternoon Speaker
Gingrich, both speakers.

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:53.100
I was thinking you know,
all day, especially in light

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:57.480
of the different presentations
here today that the framers

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.920
of our Constitution had to
have in mind national security

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.800
and religious liberty as the
founding kind of modus operandi

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.230
and modus vivendi of this
nation or it wouldn't exist.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:13.060
And in light of the security
climate world we live in today,

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.760
do either of you gentlemen
have a perspective on the role

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:21.720
of religious ideologies
and national security?

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.020
What's the casm?

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:24.760
What do you forecast for the future

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.770
of this nation given
that both climates are..

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:32.850
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: I don't
think there's a contradiction.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:34.150
&gt;&gt; Ok.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:37.210
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: And let
me draw the distinction.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:41.570
This is a country that gives
you an enormous range of freedom

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:45.890
to be an atheist, to
have any sort of beliefs.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:50.390
What it doesn't give you
is the right to attempt

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.620
to overthrow the government.

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:56.390
So, if you come into the U.S.
and I'll give you an example.

00:36:56.390 --> 00:37:03.100
The man who built the car bomb and
it didn't go off in Times Square.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:08.580 position:56%
The one where he got his engineering
backwards and it fizzled and the guy

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:13.340
who was running a hot dog
stand walked over to the cop

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:16.050
and said that car is smoking.

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:18.800
And they looked at it and it
turned out it was a car bomb.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.250
Well, he was a Pakistani, he
had gotten American citizenship,

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:28.160 position:56%
he had gone back to Pakistan to take
an advanced course in bomb making,

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.550
much the way you might go to an
extension school or something.

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:35.730
He came back the U.S.
and he built the bomb.

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:42.880
He's taken to court and the judge
says to him, how could you do this?

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:46.650
You swore an oath of allegiance
when you became a citizen.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:50.070
And the man's answer was
very straight, I lied.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.830
You are my enemy.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.320
I have a moral duty to lie to you.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:59.370
Now, we don't today know how to
have a debate about what you do,

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:02.150
this is not in the sense that
you mean religious liberty,

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:04.660
this is not a religious opponent.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:08.280
This is an ideological opponent
dedicated to the destruction

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:12.600
of the American system and you
have every right to defend yourself

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.630
against somebody who wants
to destroy your country.

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:17.150
And the fact that they happen to be

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.620
of a particular religion
makes it complicated,

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.110
but you can also divide that up.

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:24.670 position:56%
You could say look, if you happen to
be Muslim and you're willing to live

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:28.820
under the U.S. Constitution
we have no complaint.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.740
If, on the other hand, you
believe it's your moral duty

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:36.200
to replace the U.S. Constitution
and you're prepared to kill people

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.430
to do so, we have an enormous
disagreement with you,

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:41.710
but that's not a religious
liberty issue.

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:43.570
That's a national survival issue.

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:44.870
Steve?

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:47.330
&gt;&gt; Steve J. Israel: Very briefly,
I'm a right of center Democrat

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:49.660
in the United States Congress
on National Security issues.

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.640
I'm considered to be a conservative
Democrat on those issues.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.840
I believe that our first
obligation in public life is

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.140
to protect the American people.

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:59.280
Keep them safe against all
threats, foreign and domestic.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:01.640
We have been having this debate

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.620
since the Alien Sedition
Acts by the way.

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.840
The debate between national
security and religious liberty.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.140
This is not a new debate.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:12.650
It's a heightened debate, but it
is not a new debate and I agree

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:16.960
with the Speaker's perspective
that it has nothing to do

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.070
with what religion you are.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:22.480
It has to do with are you
loyal to the Constitution

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.780
of The United States of America?

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.950
I took an oath to protect
and defend the Constitution

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:28.130
of The United States of America.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.710
And if there's disloyalty, I
don't care what religion you are.

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:33.350
If you're perceived to be a threat
to the national security interests

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:36.680
of the United States government,
the government has a responsibility

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.490
to protect its constituents.

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:42.480
Sometimes the government gets
it wrong and goes too far.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.910
Sometimes the government screws
up and doesn't go far enough

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:49.740
and that has been the essence
of our debate on those issues

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.070 position:56%
since the founding of this republic.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:53.370
&gt;&gt; Well said gentlemen.

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:55.180
As the widow of a veteran
and the daughter

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.060 position:56%
of one I thank you for your service.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.100
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel: Thank
you for your sacrifice.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.400
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.560
This question is for both speakers.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:07.830
When the contract with America was
introduced in 1994, Mr. Gingrich,

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:14.430
the only part of it that was really
enacted was the welfare reform

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:17.200
and whenever people talk
about it's success today,

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.580
they mention welfare reform
and it come to a full stop.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:24.630
And I believe your contract
also included entitlement reform

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:26.870
and tax reform that would have

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:29.880
like caused some dislocation
among non poor people.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:34.210
So, both speakers, why is it that
the only part the parties were able

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.790
to get together on was the part
that caused the dislocation

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:42.250
to the least empowered and
when are you going to come

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:47.450
to some bipartisan agreement on
some of the entitlement reforms

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:54.420
and the tax reforms that will cause
dislocation among the empowered.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:55.790
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel: I'm
going to yield to you

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:57.160
since I wasn't there at the time.

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.570
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: Well, I
actually participated this week

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:05.980
in a Brookings Institution
Workshop on the 20th

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.220
of passing the welfare reform bill.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:11.220
So, let me start with that.

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:15.220
It's biggest single change was
to establish a work requirement

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:20.050
that was a very substantial
number of people

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.100
who left dependency
and went to work.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.180
Their incomes rose.

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:30.210 position:56%
We had the biggest decrease in
children in poverty in the late 90's

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:33.590
in modern history and most people
think it was directly related

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:37.390
to the fact that we required
welfare offices to shift

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:41.260
from being dependency offices
to being employment offices

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.720
and to focus on how they could help
people get jobs rather how they

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.020
could help people remain dependent.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.600
So, that was that part.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.340
We had a commitment
to a balanced budget.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.690
The only four balanced budgets

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:55.070
in your lifetime came
out of the contract.

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:56.850
So, that was a fairly
significant change.

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:59.930
By the way, we did it
while setting priorities.

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:02.330
We doubled the size of
the national institutes

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:04.990
of health while balancing
the federal budget

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:10.230
because we thought research
into biology and into health was

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:15.110
in fact a major part of
our future as a country.

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:17.660
We passed everything
through the House.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.910
We voted everything
in the first 100 days.

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:22.560
Actually the first 93.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.920
We passed everything
except term limits

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:29.500
which did not get a constitutional
majority in the House and frankly,

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:33.280
the desire for term limits dropped
dramatically once we had won the

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:37.830
election because we proved to
people you could defeat incumbents.

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:40.550
In a sense, the election
of 2006 and the election

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:43.410 position:56%
in 2010 had a similar kind of effect

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:44.710
because if you can beat
them you don't need

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:46.010
to worry about term limits.

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:47.310
Just go out and beat them.

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:52.920
And so I've seen three wave
elections in modern times, in '94,

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:57.320
2006 and then again in 2010.

00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.410
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel: I
am retiring from Congress

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:02.390
and there are certain things that
I worry about long term and one

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:05.600
of them is entitlement reform.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:06.900
Here's why.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:10.310
We are facing a demographic crisis.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:13.060
When Social Security was created,
within ten years of the creation

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.980
of Social Security, there was
approximately 40 workers supporting

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:17.450
every retiree.

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:21.630
Now, it's closer to two workers
supporting every retiree.

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:24.190
If you read the National
Intelligence Council's Quageneral

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:28.640
Report on what the world will
look like in the year 2030,

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.940
and the next report is coming

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:34.600
out describing the
world in the year 2035.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.400
We're going to add more
elderly people to the population

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.710
of the planet Earth than
ever before in human history.

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:42.010
It's going to be extraordinary.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:45.290
The good news is medical
technology will keep us alive much,

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:47.740
much longer than anybody
ever predicted.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.780
The bad news is there is no way
that social security, medicare,

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.270
public pensions or private
pensions here or anywhere else

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:56.270
in the world can sustain
that population.

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:58.770
And so while Democrats and
Republicans need to continue

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:01.980
to find bipartisan accord
on national security,

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:04.930
they're also going to have to have
figure out how we're going to care

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:08.970
for that massive increase in
the population of the elderly

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:11.650
with respect to retirement
security and no matter

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:16.320
who wins the Presidency, I have
my own theories on the matter,

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:19.950
that is going to be the ticking
time bomb that either Mr. Trump

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:25.600
or Secretary Clinton will be facing
on the day that they are sworn in.

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.810
&gt;&gt; This question is for
both of you gentlemen.

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:31.740
How do you envision
a Trump presidency?

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:34.690
&gt;&gt; You took my question.

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:39.000
I was pretty close to that.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.300
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel: I don't.

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:41.600
Mr. Speaker.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:50.650
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: That was a good
answer, but I'm not loving it.

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:53.390
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel:
Sound byte though.

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.030
Two words.

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:57.980
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: I
think it will be, well,

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.790
I tell people to get some
historical perspective in Trump.

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:06.960
Combine the disruptive
patterns of Andrew Jackson

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.470
with the sheer physical
energy of Theodore Roosevelt

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:15.480
and the permanent salesmanship of
P.T. Barnum and there's something

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:21.380
in those three that comes together
and that sort of creates Trump.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.770
If Trump wins, and I think the
odds are at least even money,

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:31.290
we'll know a lot more after Monday
night, but if Trump does win,

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:35.280
I think he'll be an extraordinarily
change oriented President.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:40.510
I think that he will rely on his
ability to generate enormous waves

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:44.530
of public demand so that
his instinct will be to go

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:49.170
into Congressional districts and
have you know rallies of 40,000

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:53.710
to 50,000 people at a time in the
football and baseball stadiums

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:56.000
and he'll be capable
of generating that.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.060 position:56%
And that will get a lot of attention
from the members of the Congress.

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.250
You know, you get 50,000 of
your constituents somewhere,

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:05.160
you tend to listen to
the guy who did it.

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:11.920
Reagan, the best study of what
Reagan learned is a book called

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.270
"The Education of Ronald Reagan".

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:18.740
It was a little book that was a
study of Reagan at General Electric

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:25.470
and Reagan worked with a guy
who was the Vice President

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:27.630
of Employee Relations at GE.

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:29.240
He had seven unions.

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:33.160
Two were headed by communists
and five were just left wing

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:38.230
and all seven made demands that
would bankrupt General Electric

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:40.350
and you couldn't negotiate
with the senior leadership.

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:43.640
So, this guy, his name was Bulwor.

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:48.470
Bulwor actually built a
model of communication

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:54.010 position:56%
to convince the members of the union
of what was economically sustainable

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:59.540
so they would not vote for a
strike that was irrational.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:03.430
And he brought Reagan in because
he wanted a popular figure

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:06.150
who would be nice and pleasant.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:11.100 position:56%
So, Reagan went around the country
and gave something like 370 speeches

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:15.200 position:56%
to blue collar workers at
factories owned by General Electric.

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.700
Back then it was a huge
employer of blue collar workers.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.240
Reagan wouldn't fly.

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:25.890
He went through a period
from 1945 to 1965

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:27.780 position:56%
when he wouldn't get on an airplane.

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.530
And so he was going around by train

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:35.540
and Bulwor's giving him all these
conservative economic texts to read

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:40.650
and Reagan learned the whole model
that if you could move the opinion

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:42.010
of the majority of the people,

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:44.500
that the political
leadership would follow it.

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:48.870
Now, they were doing it at GE to
get the union leaders to follow.

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:50.580
Reagan did it to the country.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:54.830
Reagan's model was, I will show
the light to the American people

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:57.420
so they will turn up
the heat on Congress.

00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.130
And I watched him do
it again and again

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.000
where he'd make a speech,
which is very

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.300
[ inaudible ]

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:03.720
, if you go look at
Reagan's speeches, Callista

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:09.520
and I did a documentary on Reagan
called "Rendezvous with Destiny".

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:14.150 position:56%
Reagan's speeches have lots of facts
and they're designed to drive home

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:19.210
for you why you have legitimacy to
call your Congressman or Senator.

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:22.620
And Reagan could move the
county 20 or 30 points

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:25.310
with an Oval Office
address and people knew it.

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:26.910
He's very formidable.

00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:31.090
Trump will use a variation on
that model, if he gets elected

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:34.380
and he will start with very
big changes in my judgement.

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:38.860
He will not come here to be one
more normal political leader.

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:43.990
He'll come here to pass very large
changes and will gamble the rest

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:47.010
of his career on being
able to get things done

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:50.210
with the American people
insisting that Congress pass it.

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:52.020
That's my guess.

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:54.880
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: We have
time for just a brief question.

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.120
One last brief question.

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.640
&gt;&gt; I hate to do this,
but I have a question

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.140
about the debate Monday night.

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:04.910
My concern is is that
Donald Trump is not a policy

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:06.210
[ inaudible ]

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:10.070
. You have lots of familiarity
with policy and how do you coach

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:13.720
like Donald Trump to
be able to talk policy

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.430
with somebody like
Hillary Clinton...

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:16.730
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: You don't.

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:18.030
&gt;&gt; Or how do you coach
him during the debates?

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:22.060
&gt;&gt; Newt Gingrich: Well, I'm going
to say and I do a brief commercial.

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:25.610
I do two free newsletters a
week at Gingrich Productions.

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:31.250
One of them this week
was on debate coaching.

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:34.700
And I describe both Hillary's
problem and Trump's problem.

00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.000
And they're very different.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.310
Trump is the fastest
debater I've ever seen.

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:45.750
If you look at the Republican
debates, there were 12 of them,

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:47.810
the elites didn't believe
he was very smart

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:50.340
and the elites didn't
believe, in fact if you watch,

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:56.490 position:56%
I got turned on the very first
debate with Megyn Kelly, Fox hosted.

00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:59.670
Everybody in the elite said Trump
lost the debate because he got

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:00.970
in a big fight with Megyn Kelly.

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:06.130
Callista and I were looking at
it and about midnight I began

00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:09.860
to realize that on
Twitter and Facebook,

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:13.610
70 percent said Trump had
won, out of a field of 16 now.

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:15.510
Wasn't 70 percent of
Trump versus Cruz.

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:20.160
Out of 16 people, 70
percent were picking Trump

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.650
and I said, wait a second.

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:27.230
If everybody who's an expert on Fox
News said he lost and 70 percent

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:30.680
of the everyday people said he
won, this is about as big a gap

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.970
as I've ever seen and it
continues up into today.

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:39.700
Trump's strength is
sheer speed and the fact

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.660
that he's totally comfortable
with himself.

00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:45.190
I mean whether he's talking
about the size of his hands,

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:49.220
which is the weirdest moment
in Presidential debate history,

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:55.350
or he's talking about little
Marco or low energy Jeb

00:50:55.350 --> 00:51:01.780
or the 647 buildings he built on
Tuesday morning before he got up.

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:06.850
He's totally authentic and so
you're staring there fascinated

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:12.080
by this weird hair and this big
guy and he's bouncing around,

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:16.400
but he has lots of energy and he's
very comfortable and they're going

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.300 position:56%
to ask him lots of questions he
won't know, so he won't answer them.

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:23.030 position:56%
He'll make up his own answer for the
question he wishes they'd asked him

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:27.110
and the average person
will go that's fine.

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:31.180
Hillary's great strength is
she knows an enormous amount,

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:33.890
but she's not nearly
as fast as Trump is.

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.870
What she's going to
try to do is practice

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:40.580 position:56%
and my guess is they've gone through
30 different debate variations

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:44.180
and they figure if he does A
you do B, if he does C you do D

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:47.330
and she's practiced every one of
them and they've videotaped them

00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:49.620
and they've looked at them and
she'll be totally prepared.

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:53.570
The problem is, she's totally
prepared against a person

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:56.410
who you can't prepare against.

00:51:56.410 --> 00:52:01.330
Well, is it going to be the
noisy Trump or the quiet Trump.

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:04.610
You know, it's going to the Trump,
because he's a counter puncher,

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:09.850
it's going to be the Trump, it
needs to be based on who she is

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:13.040
and he will evolve in
about four seconds.

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.480
So, whichever version
of Hillary shows up,

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.590
four seconds later the
appropriate counter veiling version

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:22.190
of Trump will show up and he
will do it almost seamlessly

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:26.300
and at home we won't notice he did
it and the challenge for her is,

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:30.710
if she takes him head on,
he will go right at her.

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:33.750
If she doesn't take him head
on, he won't take her head on,

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:35.640
he will be very respectful.

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.970
He really doesn't counter punches.

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:42.930 position:56%
He doesn't actually go out and start
fighting, he just clobbers you.

00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:46.290
Bill O'Reilly once said to me,
why don't these guys attack Trump?

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:49.780
And I said because Trump is the
grizzly bear in "The Revenant".

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:53.840
You know, you get his attention,
he gets awake, he comes over,

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.380
he bites off your face,
he sits on you for awhile,

00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:02.160
everyone else in the room is
going not me, I'm not doing that.

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.980
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Well,
we've definitely heard a lot

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:06.620
of differences of opinions
today, but...

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:08.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Steven J. Israel: This is why he
should have been Donald Trump's Vice

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:10.080
Presidential nominee.

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:13.680
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: But, there's
one thing that we can all agree

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:16.980
on is these two gentlemen are
terrific writers and I commend both

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:19.280
of their books to you
so happy reading.

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:23.040
Thank you for coming
to the Book Festival.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.700
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of The Library of Congress.
