00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.130
- [Voiceover] We've given a lot of importance

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.760
to individual cells and that's for good reason.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.400
Cells are the basic unit of life

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.120
and they are fascinating in their own right.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.160
As we've seen in other videos,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.750
there's whole universes inside of cells.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.890
There's a lot more complexity than many

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.617
of us might have guessed before really studying cells.

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:21.260
But how do we go from cells to tissues?

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.550
So when you know if you look even

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.720
if you look at your skin, that tissue of your skin,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.800
or your tendons or, if you think about heart's tissues

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.190
or the different organs' tissues.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.290
How do you go from a different tissue,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.960
which of course, eventually, will then get you

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.960
to a full multi-cellular organism.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.890
So all the tissues and organs together,

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.350
you're going to get the whole organism.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.750
How do the cells get together, coordinate,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.220
structure themselves to form me or you?

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.800
And the answer is, or at least it involves,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.850
something called the extracellular matrix.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.880
Extracellular

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.773
matrix.

00:01:02.773 --> 00:01:05.353
And just as we've talked about the insides of a cell,

00:01:05.353 --> 00:01:07.683
not just being a bunch of organelles floating around

00:01:07.683 --> 00:01:10.243
that we have a cytoskeleton that gives the inside

00:01:10.243 --> 00:01:13.123
of the cell structure and allows it to even,

00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:15.093
potentially, move and divide

00:01:15.093 --> 00:01:16.663
and transport things.

00:01:16.663 --> 00:01:19.333
So if you assume that this blob

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.693
right over here is a cell,

00:01:21.693 --> 00:01:22.593
what I just drew in yellow,

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:25.093
that would be its cytoskeleton on the inside,

00:01:25.093 --> 00:01:27.493
but there's also an analogous thing on the outside

00:01:27.493 --> 00:01:31.383
that helps coordinate how the cells all relate to each other

00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:32.723
and that's what we're talking about

00:01:32.723 --> 00:01:36.603
when we talk about the extracellular matrix.

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:39.102
And it's made up of a bunch of different types

00:01:39.102 --> 00:01:42.713
of fibers and proteins and glycoproteins

00:01:42.713 --> 00:01:45.593
and probably the most notable of these

00:01:45.593 --> 00:01:47.263
is collagen.

00:01:47.263 --> 00:01:49.263
So I'll do colagen in yellow right over here.

00:01:49.263 --> 00:01:53.653
So these could be strands of collagen right over here

00:01:53.653 --> 00:01:58.033
and collagen is actually the most common protein in mammals.

00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:01.983
It makes up approximately, so this is collagen

00:02:01.983 --> 00:02:03.617
in the yellow right over there,

00:02:03.617 --> 00:02:05.523
and it makes approximately, I've seen estimates

00:02:05.523 --> 00:02:08.793
of 25 to 35%, but I'll just go with it makes

00:02:08.793 --> 00:02:12.993
approximately 30% of the proteins in mammals.

00:02:12.993 --> 00:02:17.213
30% of mammalian, I'll say mammal,

00:02:17.213 --> 00:02:18.923
mammal protein.

00:02:18.923 --> 00:02:23.283
So roughly 30% of the protein in your body is collagen

00:02:23.283 --> 00:02:25.823
and a lot of it is making up these strands

00:02:25.823 --> 00:02:28.353
that help make up, it's not the only protein found,

00:02:28.353 --> 00:02:31.623
that help make up the extracellular matrix.

00:02:31.623 --> 00:02:32.853
And you see these cells here,

00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:34.423
these things that I've drawn,

00:02:34.423 --> 00:02:37.083
they're kind of embedded in this the way I've drawn it.

00:02:37.083 --> 00:02:38.653
They can be fixed.

00:02:38.653 --> 00:02:40.463
They look like they're a little bit, they're attached

00:02:40.463 --> 00:02:42.753
to this matrix and it helps position them.

00:02:42.753 --> 00:02:44.816
And it is true that the extracellular matrix,

00:02:44.816 --> 00:02:48.163
the collagen fibers and other things that we find there

00:02:48.163 --> 00:02:52.033
help attach the cells and structure the cells into tissues.

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:54.263
They also help inform the cell,

00:02:54.263 --> 00:02:56.293
let the cell know when to grow, when to divide,

00:02:56.293 --> 00:02:58.383
even potentially when to die or when to produce

00:02:58.383 --> 00:03:01.053
different types of molecules.

00:03:01.053 --> 00:03:02.333
And to get a little bit deeper,

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:03.933
to understand what's actually going on,

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.693
how the cell actually attaches,

00:03:05.693 --> 00:03:06.833
if we were to zoom in,

00:03:06.833 --> 00:03:10.563
let's say we were to zoom in right over there on that square

00:03:10.563 --> 00:03:12.723
so I'm zooming in on the cellular membrane,

00:03:12.723 --> 00:03:14.313
we could get to this bigger picture

00:03:14.313 --> 00:03:18.123
that is taking up most of the screen right over here,

00:03:18.123 --> 00:03:20.963
so a view of this is like zoomed in representation.

00:03:20.963 --> 00:03:23.863
So right over here this is inside the cell.

00:03:23.863 --> 00:03:26.993
This is inside the cell here

00:03:26.993 --> 00:03:28.953
and we an see that we even have

00:03:28.953 --> 00:03:32.783
an actin microfilament right over here

00:03:32.783 --> 00:03:36.523
that helps form, this is part of the cytoskeleton

00:03:36.523 --> 00:03:38.093
and then have the collagen fibers

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:41.710
which is making up part of the extracellular matrix

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.193
and then we see that it all gets attached

00:03:44.193 --> 00:03:46.333
with these proteins and these proteins,

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:49.583
they're a class of proteins called integrins.

00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:50.583
Integrins.

00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:53.053
And they're embedded in the membranes

00:03:53.053 --> 00:03:55.884
of cells and through other fibers,

00:03:55.884 --> 00:03:58.023
it's something like a fibronectin,

00:03:58.023 --> 00:04:01.963
they can be attached to the broader

00:04:01.963 --> 00:04:03.921
extracellular matrix

00:04:03.921 --> 00:04:05.361
and this is fascinating because it obviously

00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:09.221
structurally connects this extracellular,

00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:10.761
I guess you could say structure,

00:04:10.761 --> 00:04:13.591
this extracellular matrix to the inside of the cell,

00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:16.776
to the cytoskeleton, through these proteins

00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:18.661
and as I mentioned, these proteins help

00:04:18.661 --> 00:04:21.561
kind of lodge things together, lock them in place,

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:23.961
but they can also be used to signal,

00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:25.561
they can sense tension depending

00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:26.831
on what type of cells you have,

00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:28.951
they can signal for the cell itself

00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:33.421
to get active or deactivate in some interesting ways.

00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:34.751
So it's a fascinating thing

00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:36.511
and I wanna make it very clear to you,

00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:38.161
a lot of times when you're studying biology

00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:39.761
even an introductory biology class

00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:41.801
you'll see things like this in textbooks,

00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:43.561
it's like, "Oh, of course, we have intogren proteins

00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:46.561
"that are going across our cellular membrane

00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:48.121
"and they're attached to things like fibronectin

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.151
"and they're attached to the cytoskeleton

00:04:50.151 --> 00:04:54.091
"and they get attached to the collagen fibers

00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:55.791
"throughout the extracellular matrix."

00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:57.201
And it seems like oh, all of the biology

00:04:57.201 --> 00:04:58.761
is already figured out,

00:04:58.761 --> 00:05:01.191
but the real answer is how all of these things

00:05:01.191 --> 00:05:03.621
actually work together and how they signal

00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:05.001
to each other and how cells know

00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:06.701
what to do based on how much stress

00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:08.791
or tension or how crowded a certain area is.

00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:11.541
These are areas of open research.

00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:12.951
In fact everything that I'm talking about,

00:05:12.951 --> 00:05:15.091
if you were to delve a little bit deeper,

00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:17.001
and I encourage you to do web searches on these,

00:05:17.001 --> 00:05:19.231
you'll find current research papers

00:05:19.231 --> 00:05:20.521
where people are saying, "Well, how exactly

00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:22.591
"does an intogren know what to do?"

00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:24.670
or "How does it exactly signal to the cell?"

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.891
or "How does it exactly bind itself

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:32.621
"to either the cytoskeleton or the extracellular matrix?"

00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:34.791
These are all interesting areas of research

00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:36.000
and people are gonna be researching them

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.721
for some time because there's always more questions

00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:40.801
on how these incredibly complex proteins

00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:44.001
and glycoproteins, fibronectin is a glycoprotein,

00:05:44.001 --> 00:05:45.980
it's proteins where the side chains

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.961
have

00:05:48.961 --> 00:05:52.551
carbohydrate chains, saccharide chains,

00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:54.121
branching off of them.

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:55.861
And so how do all of these thing interact

00:05:55.861 --> 00:05:57.951
and how do they kind of "know what to do"

00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:00.091
and how do all of these complex signaling mechanisms work?

00:06:00.091 --> 00:06:01.751
So it's a fascinating area of research.

00:06:01.751 --> 00:06:03.792
But, hopefully this gives you an appreciation

00:06:03.792 --> 00:06:06.498
for even a further appreciation for the complexity

00:06:06.498 --> 00:06:07.631
that makes you you.

00:06:07.631 --> 00:06:09.867
We've already talked about cells themselves being complex,

00:06:09.867 --> 00:06:12.751
but now they're lodged in this extracellular matrix

00:06:12.751 --> 00:06:14.751
which helps us better define tissues

00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:17.551
and helps kind of let the cells live

00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:18.921
in this community and know how

00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:21.891
to relate to each other and have a little bit of signaling

00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:24.811
from their outside environment.

00:06:24.811 --> 00:06:26.091
And I've just drawn one

00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:29.451
kind of intogren complex right over here,

00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:30.621
but you would have many along the cell

00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:33.046
or along the membrane

00:06:33.046 --> 00:06:34.551
and these aren't the only proteins.

00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:36.051
The fascinating things about cellular membranes,

00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:39.021
you'll often just see them drawn as this lipid bilayer.

00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:40.591
They have all sorts of proteins

00:06:40.591 --> 00:06:42.191
that are lodged inside of them

00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:44.221
that are used as receptors that allow certain molecules

00:06:44.221 --> 00:06:45.791
in and certain molecules out.

00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:48.691
So they really almost cities unto themselves

00:06:48.691 --> 00:06:49.891
and then they interact with

00:06:49.891 --> 00:06:52.251
their broader environment as well.
