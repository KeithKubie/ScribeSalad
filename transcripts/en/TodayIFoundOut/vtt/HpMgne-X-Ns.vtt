00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.950
While the World Wide Web was initially invented
by one person (see: What was the First Website?),

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.230
the genesis of the internet itself was a group
effort by numerous individuals, sometimes

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.200
working in concert, and other times independently.
Its birth takes us back to the extremely competitive

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.050
technological contest between the US and the
USSR during the Cold War.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.101
The Soviet Union sent the satellite Sputnik
1 into space on October 4, 1957. Partially

00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:58.290
in response, the American government created
in 1958 the Advanced Research Project Agency,

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.220
known today as DARPA—Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency. The agency’s specific mission

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.220
was to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.030
…prevent technological surprises like the
launch of Sputnik, which signaled that the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.990
Soviets had beaten the U.S. into space. The
mission statement has evolved over time. Today,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.890
DARPA’s mission is still to prevent technological
surprise to the US, but also to create technological

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.550
surprise for our enemies.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.880
To coordinate such efforts, a rapid way to
exchange data between various universities

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.960
and laboratories was needed. This bring us
to J. C. R. Licklider who is largely responsible

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.180
for the theoretical basis of the Internet,
an “Intergalactic Computer Network.” His

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.200
idea was to create a network where many different
computer systems would be interconnected to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.530
one another to quickly exchange data, rather
than have individual systems setup, each one

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.930
connecting to some other individual system.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.050
He thought up the idea after having to deal
with three separate systems connecting to

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.310
computers in Santa Monica, the University
of California, Berkeley, and a system at MIT:

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.890
For each of these three terminals, I had three
different sets of user commands. So if I was

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.539
talking online with someone at S.D.C. and
I wanted to talk to someone I knew at Berkeley

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.280
or M.I.T. about this, I had to get up from
the S.D.C. terminal, go over and log into

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.980
the other terminal and get in touch with them….
I said, oh man, it’s obvious what to do:

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.780
If you have these three terminals, there ought
to be one terminal that goes anywhere you

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.349
want to go where you have interactive computing.
That idea is the ARPAnet.”

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.379
So, yes, the idea for the internet as we know
it partially came about because of the seemingly

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:40.180
universal human desire to not have to get
up and move to another location.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:49.299
With the threat of a nuclear war, it was necessary
to decentralize such a system, so that even

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.579
if one node was destroyed, there would still
be communication between all the other computers.

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.739
The American engineer Paul Baran provided
the solution to this issue; he designed a

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.599
decentralized network that also used packet
switching as a means for sending and receiving

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.599
data.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.930
Many others also contributed to the development
of an efficient packet switching system, including

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.489
Leonard Kleinrock and Donald Davies. If you’re
not familiar, “packet switching” is basically

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.689
just a method of breaking down all transmitted
data—regardless of content, type, or structure—into

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:25.049
suitably sized blocks, called packets. So,
for instance, if you wanted to access a large

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.859
file from another system, when you attempted
to download it, rather than the entire file

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.670
being sent in one stream, which would require
a constant connection for the duration of

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.840
the download, it would get broken down into
small packets of data, with each packet being

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:48.499
individually sent, perhaps taking different
paths through the network. The system that

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:53.529
downloads the file would then re-assemble
the packets back into the original full file.

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:58.430
The platform mentioned above by Licklider,
ARPANET was based on these ideas and was the

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.919
principle precursor to the Internet as we
think of it today. It was installed and operated

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:08.450
for the first time in 1969 with four nodes,
which were located at the University of California

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.769
at Santa Barbara, the University of California
at Los Angeles, SRI at Stanford University,

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.400
and the University of Utah.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.510
The first use of this network took place on
October 29, 1969 at 10:30 pm and was a communication

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.010
between UCLA and the Stanford Research Institute.
As recounted by the aforementioned Leonard

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.780
Kleinrock, this momentous communiqué went
like this:

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.270
We set up a telephone connection between us
and the guys at SRI… We typed the L and

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.300
we asked on the phone,

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.660
“Do you see the L?”
“Yes, we see the L,” came the response.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.600
We typed the O, and we asked, “Do you see
the O.”

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.250
“Yes, we see the O.”

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.590
Then we typed the G, and the system crashed…
Yet a revolution had begun.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.740
By 1972, the number of computers that were
connected to ARPANET had reached twenty-three

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.260
and it was at this time that the term electronic
mail (email) was first used, when a computer

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.420
scientist named Ray Tomlinson implemented
an email system in ARPANET using the “@” symbol

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.980
to differentiate the sender’s name and network
name in the email address.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.970
Alongside these developments, engineers created
more networks, which used different protocols

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.560
such as X.25 and UUCP. The original protocol
for communication used by the ARPANET was

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.490
the NCP (Network Control Protocol). The need
for a protocol that would unite all the many

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.490
networks was needed.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.880
In 1974, after many failed attempts, a paper
published by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, also

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.060
known as “the fathers of the Internet,”
resulted in the protocol TCP (Transmission

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.750
Control Protocol), which by 1978 would become
TCP/IP (with the IP standing for Internet

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.310
Protocol). At a high level, TCP/IP is essentially
just a relatively efficient system for making

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.070
sure the packets of data are sent and ultimately
received where they need to go, and in turn

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.900
assembled in the proper order so that the
downloaded data mirrors the original file.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.800
So, for instance, if a packet is lost in transmission,
TCP is the system that detects this and makes

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.810
sure the missing packet(s) get re-sent and
are successfully received. Developers of applications

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.640
can then use this system without having to
worry about exactly how the underlying network

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.640
communication works.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.790
On January 1, 1983, “flag day,” TCP/IP
would become the exclusive communication protocol

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:57.790
for ARPANET.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.010
Also in 1983, Paul Mockapetris proposed a
distributed database of internet name and

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.900
address pairs, now known as the Domain Name
System (DNS). This is essentially a distributed

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.510
“phone book” linking a domain’s name
to its IP address, allowing you to type in

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.300
something like todayifoundout.com, instead
of the IP address of the website. The distributed

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.450
version of this system allowed for a decentralized
approach to this “phone book.” Previous

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.160
to this, a central HOSTS.TXT file was maintained
at Stanford Research Institute that then could

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.491
be downloaded and used by other systems. Of
course, even by 1983, this was becoming a

00:06:21.491 --> 00:06:24.890
problem to maintain and there was a growing
need for a decentralized approach.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.700
This brings us to 1989 when Tim Berners-Lee
of CERN (European Organization for Nuclear

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.040
Research) developed a system for distributing
information on the Internet and named it the

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.040
World Wide Web.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.700
What made this system unique from existing
systems of the day was the marriage of the

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.220
hypertext system (linked pages) with the internet;
particularly the marriage of one directional

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.040
links that didn’t require any action by
the owner of the destination page to make

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.930
it work as with bi-directional hypertext systems
of the day. It also provided for relatively

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.730
simple implementations of web servers and
web browsers and was a completely open platform

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.730
making it so anyone could contribute and develop
their own such systems without paying any

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.870
royalties. In the process of doing all this,
Berners-Lee developed the URL format, hypertext

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.650
markup language (HTML), and the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.630
Around this same time, one of the most popular
alternatives to the web, the Gopher system,

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:10.350
announced it would no longer be free to use,
effectively killing it with many switching

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:19.380
to the World Wide Web. Today, the web is so
popular that many people often think of it

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.590
as the internet, even though this isn’t
the case at all.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:28.600
Also around the time the World Wide Web was
being created, the restrictions on commercial

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.270
use of the internet were gradually being removed,
which was another key element in the ultimate

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.430
success of this network.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.280
Next up, in 1993, Marc Andreessen led a team
that developed a browser for the World Wide

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.140
Web, named Mosaic. This was a graphical browser
developed via funding through a U.S. government

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.820
initiative, specifically the “High Performance
Computing and Communications Act of 1991.″

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:51.340
This act was partially what Al Gore was referring
to when he said he “took the initiative

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:57.150
in creating the Internet.” All political
rhetoric aside (and there was much on both

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:02.040
sides concerning this statement), as one of
the “fathers of the internet,” Vincent

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:17.760
Cerf said, “The Internet would not be where
it is in the United States without the strong

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:24.550
support given to it and related research areas
by the Vice President [Al Gore] in his current

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:31.280
role and in his earlier role as Senator…
As far back as the 1970s, Congressman Gore

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:47.100
promoted the idea of high speed telecommunications
as an engine for both economic growth and

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:55.340
the improvement of our educational system.
He was the first elected official to grasp

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:02.690
the potential of computer communications to
have a broader impact than just improving

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:09.710
the conduct of science and scholarship…
His initiatives led directly to the commercialization

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:18.660
of the Internet. So he really does deserve
credit.” (For more on this controversy,

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:27.960
see: Did Al Gore Really Say He Invented the
Internet?)

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.260
As for Mosaic, it was not the first web browser,
as you’ll sometimes read, simply one of

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:42.700
the most successful until Netscape came around
(which was developed by many of those who

00:09:42.700 --> 00:10:07.800
previously worked on Mosaic). The first ever
web browser, called WorldWideWeb, was created

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:24.560
by Berners-Lee. This browser had a nice graphical
user interface; allowed for multiple fonts

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:31.000
and font sizes; allowed for downloading and
displaying images, sounds, animations, movies,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.940
etc.; and had the ability to let users edit
the web pages being viewed in order to promote

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.290
collaboration of information. However, this
browser only ran on NeXT Step’s OS, which

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:48.910
most people didn’t have because of the extreme
high cost of these systems. (This company

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:53.760
was owned by Steve Jobs, so you can imagine
the cost bloat… ;-))

00:10:53.760 --> 00:11:07.300
In order to provide a browser anyone could
use, the next browser Berners-Lee developed

00:11:07.300 --> 00:15:06.930
was much simpler and, thus, versions of it
could be quickly developed to be able to run

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:11.420
on just about any computer, for the most part
regardless of processing power or operating

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:15.440
system. It was a bare-bones inline browser
(command line / text only), which didn’t

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.310
have most of the features of his original
browser.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:24.160
Mosaic essentially reintroduced some of the
nicer features found in Berners-Lee’s original

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.950
browser, giving people a graphic interface
to work with. It also included the ability

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:32.370
to view web pages with inline images (instead
of in separate windows as other browsers at

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:36.959
the time). What really distinguished it from
other such graphical browsers, though, was

00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:42.040
that it was easy for everyday users to install
and use. The creators also offered 24 hour

00:15:42.040 --> 00:17:00.350
phone support to help people get it setup
and working on their respective systems.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:25.539
Berners-Lee

00:17:25.539 --> 00:17:29.299
chose the name “World Wide Web” because
he wanted to emphasize that, in this global

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:34.500
hypertext system, anything could link to anything
else. Alternative names he considered were:

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:39.299
“Mine of Information” (Moi); “The Information
Mine” (Tim); and “Information Mesh”

00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:43.160
(which was discarded as it looked too much
like “Information Mess”).

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.790
Pronouncing “www” as individual letters
“double-u double-u double-u” takes three

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:53.039
times as many syllables as simply saying “World
Wide Web.”
