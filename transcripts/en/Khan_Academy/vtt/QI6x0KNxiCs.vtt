00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.092
We've got 24 triangle
things right over here.

00:00:04.092 --> 00:00:05.550
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.130
is to divide it into
different numbers of groups.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.600
So the first thing
I want to do is

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.760
I want to divide this 24
triangle things into 3 groups

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.020
and think about how many
do I end up per group.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.660
So let's try that out.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.370
So I'm going to divide
it into 3 equal groups.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.450
So that is one equal
group right over there.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.470
Then I have another equal
group right over here.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.340
And then I have a third
equal group right over here.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.280
So if I divide 24 into 3 equal
groups-- 1, 2, 3-- how many

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.890
are going to be in each group?

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.970
Well, we can count that.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.500
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8 in each group.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.239
So we could say that 24
divided by 3 is equal to 8.

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.780
Now, you might say,
hey, this is very

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.488
similar to what we
saw in multiplication.

00:01:02.488 --> 00:01:06.830
In multiplication, we said
if we have 3 groups of 8,

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.720
we could view that as
3 times 8 and get 24.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.035
And you are exactly right.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.940
Let me do those same colors--
we could also write that 3

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.620
times 8-- so if I
have 3 groups of 8,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:32.040
that that is going
to be equal to 24.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.580
So when we started in this
video, we had 24 things.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.440
We want to divide it
into 3 equal groups.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.780
We got 8 in each group, or you
could say 3 equal groups of 8

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.160
is equal to 24.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.620
But there's even other ways
of thinking about this.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.840
So let me clear this
up a little bit.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.390
So let me clear that.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.460
So in the first example, I
divided 24 into 3 equal groups.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.730
But you could also
view 24 divided by 3

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.500
as dividing 24 into groups of 3.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.890
So let's think about
what that looks like.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.680
So if we divide it
into groups of 3,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.270
then, for example,
this is a group of 3.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.860
That is a group of 3.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.494
This is a group of 3.

00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:20.910
You might see where
this is going.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.050
That's a group of 3.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.430
That is another group of 3.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.570
And we're going to think
about how many groups of 3

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.190
we're actually going to get.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.780
So this is another group of 3.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.750
And that's another group of 3.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.490
So how many groups
of 3 did we get?

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:45.120
Let's see, we have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8 groups of 3.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.580
So another way of
viewing 24 divided by 3

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.450
is divide 24 into groups of 3.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.120
And then you will
have 8 groups of 3.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.620
And one way of
thinking about this--

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.900
if you want to express
the same thing in terms

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.550
of multiplication--
is if you have

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:13.070
8 groups of 3, that is also
going to be equal to 24.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.140
Whether you have 3 groups
of 8 or 8 groups of 3,

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.820
either way, you're
going to have 24.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.830
Now, let's make things
more interesting.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.650
What I want you to think about
is, based on what we just saw,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.640
what is 24 divided by 12?

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.330
And I encourage you
to pause the video,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.050
draw out 24 triangles
like this, and try

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.460
to figure out what
24 divided by 12 is.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.170
Well, I assume you've
paused the video.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.260
And there's two ways to
think about 24 divided by 12.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.860
You could say, well, let's
divide 24 into groups of 12

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.720
and think about how
many groups we have.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.660
So we could do that.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.201
So let's see.

00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:04.530
This is one group of
12 right over here.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.000
That's one group of 12, and then
here is another group of 12.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.080
So how many groups
of 12 do we have?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.780
Well, we have 2 groups of 12.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.120
So we could say 24
divided by 12 is 2.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.010
But another just as reasonable
way of doing this is you

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.190
could have said,
well, let me divide 24

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.460
into 12 groups instead
of groups of 12.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.240
So if I want to divide
it into 12 groups,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.530
12 equal groups--
well, let's see.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.749
This is 1 equal group,
2 equal groups--

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:40.040
actually let me do it this way.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:54.600
Well, let me do this-- 2 equal
groups, 3 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.840
11, 12.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.910
So once again, if you say, oh,
I'm going to divide 24 into 12

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.480
equal groups, how many do
you have in each group?

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.620
Well, you have 2.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.100
So once again, 24
could be viewed

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.585
as 24 divided into
12 equal groups.

00:05:07.585 --> 00:05:09.210
And how many do you
have in each group?

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.860
Or 24 divided into groups of
12, and how many groups would

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.420
you have?

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.020
And that's what we saw
in the last example.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.940
So now, let's make things
even more interesting.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.840
What I want you to think
about-- a couple of things.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:31.100
I want you think about
what 24 divided by 6 is.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.215
And I also want you to figure
out what 24 divided by--

00:05:36.215 --> 00:05:41.070
let me use that
same color-- 4 is.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.450
And once again, I encourage
you to pause the video,

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.170
draw these triangles,
and figure it out.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.210
What is 24 divided by
6 and 24 divided by 4?

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.360
So let's tackle 24
divided by 6 first.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:59.239
And let's try to divide
24 into 6 equal groups.

00:05:59.239 --> 00:05:59.780
So let's see.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.310
This could be 1 equal group,
2 equal groups-- in fact,

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.490
each group here is a group of 4.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.300
And we have 6 rows.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:19.190
So 3 equal groups, 4, 5, and 6.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.150
And so if you divide
24 into 6 equal groups,

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.690
how many do you
have in each group?

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.780
Well, it's pretty
clear you have 4.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.406
You have 4 In each group.

00:06:29.406 --> 00:06:30.780
Another way we
could have thought

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:39.710
about that is we
could have said,

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.220
let me divide 24
into groups of 6.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.860
So if you divided
24 into groups of 6,

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.000
you could have
viewed it like this.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.490
So that's 1 group
of 6 right there.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.090
That's another group
of 6 right over here.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.475
That's another group of 6.

00:06:58.475 --> 00:07:01.480
And I think you see how
many groups of 6 we have.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.056
How many groups of 6 do we have?

00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:04.484
We have 4.

00:07:04.484 --> 00:07:10.120
We have 4 groups of 6.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.370
Well, now let's think about
what 24 divided by 4 is.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.400
Well, if I view 24 divided by
4 as taking 24 and dividing it

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.780
into 4 equal groups,
I've just drawn that.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.965
I have 4 equal groups, and
in each group I have 6.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.453
So notice 24 divided by 6 is 4.

00:07:30.453 --> 00:07:33.900
24 divided by 4 is 6.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.100
And that's because I could
view this as 4 groups of 6

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:44.140
or say that 4 times
6 is equal to 24.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.890
Or you could just as
equivalently say that 6 times 4

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.570
is 24.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:08:00.198
You could equivalently say
that 6 times 4 is equal to 24.
