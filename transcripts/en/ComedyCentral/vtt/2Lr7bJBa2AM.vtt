'Good morning, people.'

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:04.804
Well, apparently,
the Hells Angels

00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:08.241
who own that
brothel out there, out on 80...

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:12.678
They're doing a program, uh,
hand in your gun for a, uh...

00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:13.780
[clicks tongue]
Uh, ***.

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:15.948
- 'Hand job?'
- Yeah.

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:18.785
"Hand guns for hand job ***."
That's what the poster said.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:20.787
Yeah, they wanted us
to sponsor that, you know

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.923
but, uh,
up there said, "Unh-unh."

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:25.591
[knock on door]

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:27.927
- Hey, guys.
- Can I help you, sir?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.096
Uh, just the lady out,
out front said that

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:31.731
maybe I could talk to Trudy
for a second.

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:33.399
The lady
out front was wrong, sir.

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:35.568
We are in a meeting.
She is working right now.

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:37.537
I can talk to you for a...
Uh, hold on.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.338
Let me talk to him
for one second.

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:41.541
God, so rude.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.643
- Hi.
- '25 seconds. Go, sir.'

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.979
- Hey, Trude. What's going on?
- How are you?

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:49.115
- 'How are you doing?'
- How are you?

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:52.185
- Good. I got you this.
- Thank you.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:54.153
(Craig)
'This is kind of,
it's kind of personal.'

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:58.024
Yeah? Tur...
Can you turn around? God.

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:00.393
'I was just wondering
if you'd like to, maybe'

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:02.395
go grab a, a cup
of coffee sometime?

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:04.197
- I would love to.
- 'Alright.'

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.866
So I guess I'll,
I'll call you or something.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.634
- Okay.
- What's your number?

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:11.737
You can just call 911, or you
can just stop by here any time.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.973
It would be fine if you wanted
to stop by at any time.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:15.741
Alright, great. Sorry to,
sorry to inconvenience...

00:01:15.774 --> 00:01:18.444
- It wasn't an inconvenience.
- I didn't get your name.

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:20.480
Uh, Pullin. Craig Pullin.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:21.781
- 'Craig Pullin.'
- Okay.

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:24.450
- See you later, Trudy.
- Thank you, Craig.

00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:25.618
Bye.

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:27.620
[indistinct chatter]

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:29.055
[Williams laughing]

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:31.424
♪ Two little retards
sittin' in a tree ♪♪

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:33.226
- I think it's cute.
- Shut up!

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.660
You don't think it's cute!

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:36.229
You think it's funny,
and you think it's pathetic.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:39.298
and you think it's sad.

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:42.902
Well, F you.
F you, and *** you.

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:50.776
- Did everyone see this?
- Holy ***!

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:53.012
Oh, my, God! That's the guy.

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:55.681
(Dangle)
'Run it, run it through
the computer. P-U-L-L-I-N.'

00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:57.350
- 'What should we do?'
- Let's get him...

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:58.618
No, no don't...
We-we can't do that.

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:00.620
'We have nothing.
We have no evidence.'

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:01.988
If we jump on him
with no evidence

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:03.623
Trudy will say it's just
'cause we're trying

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:04.891
to *** up her life again.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:06.359
'Find his home address.
Find his home address.'

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:08.794
We need to get close to him,
we need to find out what we can.

00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:11.531
I'm taking Trudy to Sears
for a makeover later

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.533
and I will have some
girl-talk time

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.268
and I will find out
what she knows about him.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.802
(Jones)
Can I google him?

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:19.105
It's the *** sheriff's computer,
don't use Google.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:20.806
You've been wa... Looking up
too much pornography

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:23.276
and you forgot how the regular
sheriff's computer works.
