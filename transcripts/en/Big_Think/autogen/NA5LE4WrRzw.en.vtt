well you know I was a regulator in the
 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.610
well you know I was a regulator in the
nuclear arena and you know nuclear

an area that people tend to feel as
 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.920
an area that people tend to feel as
strongly about is some social issues so

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930
strongly about is some social issues so
 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.550
strongly about is some social issues so
much so that maybe it is one when you're

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560
much so that maybe it is one when you're
 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.790
much so that maybe it is one when you're
in that arena and you know it is an

in that arena and you know it is an
 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.340
in that arena and you know it is an
important technology and it has a role

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350
important technology and it has a role
 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.870
important technology and it has a role
in this energy future we're talking

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880
in this energy future we're talking
 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.049
in this energy future we're talking
about but it is a very sensitive

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059
about but it is a very sensitive
 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.889

design in construction and especially in
 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.579
design in construction and especially in
operation and it has a very

that it really needs to accompany but
the real message is when you're thinking

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230
the real message is when you're thinking
 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.399
the real message is when you're thinking
about the use of nuclear power then risk

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409
about the use of nuclear power then risk
 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.479
about the use of nuclear power then risk
has two components its probability of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
has two components its probability of
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.790
has two components its probability of
something untoward happening and its

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800
something untoward happening and its
 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.840
something untoward happening and its
consequence and they are certain arenas

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850
consequence and they are certain arenas
 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.020
consequence and they are certain arenas
where the consequence is so high that

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030
where the consequence is so high that
 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.240
where the consequence is so high that
even if one thinks the probability is

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250
even if one thinks the probability is
 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.330
even if one thinks the probability is
small then one has to take mitigating

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340
small then one has to take mitigating
 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.940
small then one has to take mitigating
steps and so that's what I would say an

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950
steps and so that's what I would say an
 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.389
steps and so that's what I would say an

change because whether we think the
 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.490
change because whether we think the
probabilities are high that it is

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500
probabilities are high that it is
 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.149
probabilities are high that it is
already upon us or will be within a

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159
already upon us or will be within a
 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.399
already upon us or will be within a
short time when we think consequence

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
short time when we think consequence
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.099
short time when we think consequence
then it says that maybe we mitigate and

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109
then it says that maybe we mitigate and
 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.849
then it says that maybe we mitigate and
whether we think that climate changes

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859
whether we think that climate changes
 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.940
whether we think that climate changes
are due to some fundamental long period

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950
are due to some fundamental long period
 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.480
are due to some fundamental long period

periodicity natural evolution that
depends on other things if there is any

exacerbating effect that we have on top

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420
exacerbating effect that we have on top
 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.580
exacerbating effect that we have on top
of that and we think we can lessen that

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590
of that and we think we can lessen that
 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.980
of that and we think we can lessen that
exacerbating effect or if you think we

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990
exacerbating effect or if you think we
 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.009
exacerbating effect or if you think we
really drive see what we see in either

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019
really drive see what we see in either
 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.160
really drive see what we see in either
of those cases because of consequence we

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170
of those cases because of consequence we
 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.490
of those cases because of consequence we
should do something about

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500
should do something about
 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.060
should do something about
but even if we don't believe it at all

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070
but even if we don't believe it at all
 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.160
but even if we don't believe it at all
just as you mentioned the question of

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170
just as you mentioned the question of
 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.380
just as you mentioned the question of
two billion people that really don't

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390
two billion people that really don't
 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.710
two billion people that really don't
even have access to real energy where

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720
even have access to real energy where
 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.310
even have access to real energy where
people's are still living in poverty and

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320
people's are still living in poverty and
 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.250
people's are still living in poverty and
everybody wants to rise and developing

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260
everybody wants to rise and developing
 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.920
everybody wants to rise and developing
countries wish to rise then just the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930
countries wish to rise then just the
 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.100
countries wish to rise then just the
global competition for what in the end

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110
global competition for what in the end
 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.690
global competition for what in the end
is always a limited resource says we

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700
is always a limited resource says we
 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.560
is always a limited resource says we
ought to be smarter about how we use it

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570
ought to be smarter about how we use it
 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.290
ought to be smarter about how we use it
you know what effect it has and so

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300
you know what effect it has and so
 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.850
you know what effect it has and so
that's what always links these two

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860
that's what always links these two
 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.479
that's what always links these two
things energy security and climate

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489
things energy security and climate
 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.580
things energy security and climate
change and so what you really do in the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590
change and so what you really do in the
 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.570
change and so what you really do in the
one impacts and can impact in a positive

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580
one impacts and can impact in a positive
 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.930
one impacts and can impact in a positive
way what happens in the other so if you

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940
way what happens in the other so if you
 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.280
way what happens in the other so if you
believe in climate change and therefore

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290
believe in climate change and therefore
 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.870
believe in climate change and therefore
we should go to alternative renewable

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880
we should go to alternative renewable
 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.810
we should go to alternative renewable
energy sources or you believe in energy

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820
energy sources or you believe in energy
 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.970
energy sources or you believe in energy
quote-unquote independence and I never

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980
quote-unquote independence and I never
 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.100
quote-unquote independence and I never
talked about that I always say energy

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110
talked about that I always say energy
 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.550
talked about that I always say energy
security then maybe you go to renewables

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560
security then maybe you go to renewables
 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.640
security then maybe you go to renewables
as well and so that's where I think we

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650
as well and so that's where I think we
 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.740
as well and so that's where I think we
all need to try to come together a

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750
all need to try to come together a
 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.110
all need to try to come together a
little bit more

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120
 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.720
I do think they can be effective it is

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730
I do think they can be effective it is
 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.470
I do think they can be effective it is
not easy but but there are known

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480
 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.680
compounds that can can capture co2 from

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690
compounds that can can capture co2 from
 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.509
compounds that can can capture co2 from
flue gas and there are techniques for

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519
flue gas and there are techniques for
 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.979
flue gas and there are techniques for
pumping co2 into you know storage

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989
pumping co2 into you know storage
 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.990
pumping co2 into you know storage
reservoirs but they are still our

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000
reservoirs but they are still our
 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.660
reservoirs but they are still our
studies that need to be done and

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670
studies that need to be done and
 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.449
studies that need to be done and
understood in terms of how much of an

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459
understood in terms of how much of an
 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.270
understood in terms of how much of an
engineered reservoir do we need that is

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280
engineered reservoir do we need that is
 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.099
engineered reservoir do we need that is
what is the role of engineered systems

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109
what is the role of engineered systems
 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.339
what is the role of engineered systems
as opposed to natural reservoirs and if

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349
as opposed to natural reservoirs and if
 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.750
as opposed to natural reservoirs and if
we think we want to use natural

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760
we think we want to use natural
 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.089
we think we want to use natural
reservoirs then we have to understand

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099
reservoirs then we have to understand
 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.979
reservoirs then we have to understand
things like porosity escape paths how

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989
things like porosity escape paths how
 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.480
things like porosity escape paths how
long can the carbon or the co2 be

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490
long can the carbon or the co2 be
 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.909
long can the carbon or the co2 be
sequestered and are there other things

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919
sequestered and are there other things
 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.090
sequestered and are there other things
that we can use that involve natural

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100
that we can use that involve natural
 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.939
that we can use that involve natural
vegetation or things that are that bio

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949
vegetation or things that are that bio
 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.060
vegetation or things that are that bio
mimic natural vegetation that can

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070
mimic natural vegetation that can
 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.020
mimic natural vegetation that can
actually bind the co2 or even turn it

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030
actually bind the co2 or even turn it
 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.770
actually bind the co2 or even turn it
into more elemental forms of carbon so

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780
into more elemental forms of carbon so
 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.620
into more elemental forms of carbon so
so the answer is yes I think it is a

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630
so the answer is yes I think it is a
 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.570
so the answer is yes I think it is a
solvable problem is it a challenge

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580
solvable problem is it a challenge
 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.790
solvable problem is it a challenge
absolutely but you know the deal we owe

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800
absolutely but you know the deal we owe
 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.580
absolutely but you know the deal we owe
the Department of Energy already is

the Department of Energy already is
starting to do a number of projects and

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.480
well are starting to look at these
things and to begin to do things to

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490
things and to begin to do things to
 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.510

is the kind of infrastructure that we
use to extract gas and to get oil is the

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349
use to extract gas and to get oil is the
 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.279
use to extract gas and to get oil is the
same infrastructure that we can use to

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289
same infrastructure that we can use to
 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.710
same infrastructure that we can use to
sequester carbon
