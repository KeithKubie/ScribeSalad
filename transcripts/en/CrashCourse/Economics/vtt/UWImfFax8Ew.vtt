00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.500
Adriene: Welcome to Crash Course Economics,
I’m Adriene Hill

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:06.890
Jacob: and I’m Jacob Clifford, and I have
a confession. Economists’ perfect little

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.750
models don’t exactly reflect real life.
Which is disappointing.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.900
Adriene: Don’t worry. You’re not wasting your time.
Microeconomics explains ideas and concepts in

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.580
pretty broad terms, and leaves the business
specifics to other courses like accounting,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.679
management, and marketing. Understanding
economics can help entrepreneurs become better

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.460
decision makers. Think of it like a liberal
arts education — it's not where you go to

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.160
learn any specific job — but it can help
you see the big picture.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.760
[Theme Music]

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.339
Jacob: Let’s say a lawyer stops practicing
law and decides to open up a pizza parlor.

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.469
Let’s say his total revenue from selling
pizza is $50,000 and he has to pay $20,000

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.730
to cover stuff like the ingredients, the oven,
rent, and wages. Now, an accountant would

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.339
calculate his profit, the revenue minus the
costs, as $30,000. Not bad.

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.430
But an economist recognizes that there‘s
a cost missing: the opportunity cost. Our

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.420
pizza entrepreneur loses the income he would
have earned by being a lawyer, let’s say

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.049
$100,000. If you factor that in, he is actually
losing $70,000.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.780
But he's his own boss. He might be happier
running a pizza shop even though he is making

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.500
less money. Well, maybe, but the point is,
you have to factor in these implicit benefits

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.219
and costs when you make decisions.

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.770
So there's actually two types of profit. Accounting
profit, which is revenue minus just explicit

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.380
costs, those traditional out-of-pocket costs
you think of when you run a business. And

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.100
there’s Economic profit which is revenue
minus explicit and implicit costs — which

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.720
is those indirect opportunity costs.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.280
Adriene: In this example, putting a dollar
price on opportunity cost is pretty easy.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.920
It’s just the income he’s not earning
as a lawyer. Maybe the idea of putting a price

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.090
on intangible implicit things seems a little
strange, but you do it all the time. When

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.250
you’re deciding whether or not to get a
job you calculate the explicit costs — like

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.079
how much it costs to get to work every day,
but also the implicit costs — the value

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.990
of the things you have to give up.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.500
Maybe you’re giving up the money you could
earn doing some other job, time with family

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.520
and friends, or the opportunity to binge watch
Gilmore Girls. How much that actually costs depends

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.200
on the individual, but if the wage offered is greater
than the cost of all those things, you take the job.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.680
Businesses use this same logic. They calculate
their potential revenue and their costs of

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.600
production, including implicit costs, to make
informed decisions. This means that companies

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.630
in competitive markets don’t make very much
profit.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.120
In fact, economists argue that they make no economic
profit. To be clear, companies need to make accounting

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.300
profit to stay in business, so they do make a profit,
just not above and beyond their opportunity costs.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.060
Here’s why: If you're the first one to start
selling glowsticks at a rave, you might make

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.570
some economic profit. You would cover the
cost of glow sticks and possibly all of your

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.370
opportunity costs, the money you could be
earning doing something else.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.430
But if you’re making a ton of extra money
on top of that, it's likely that glowstick

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.030
competitors will jump in the market. Competition
will lower the price and reduce your sales.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.540
New vendors will continue to enter until all
that extra profit disappears, just like the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.640
beautiful light of a glow stick fading away
on Sunday morning. Businesses that stay in

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.640
the market make just as much as they would
doing something else.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.800
In other words, they have zero economic profit
— that’s what economists call normal profit.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.530
And it’s the minimum level of economic profit
a company needs to stay in business. But remember,

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.280
this is only in very competitive markets that
have low barriers for entry. If it's hard

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.590
for other companies to enter a market than
a business can earn economic profit.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.870
Jacob: So now, let’s look at the cost of
production. The actual cost of producing things.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.220
Economists point out that there's two types
of costs: there's variable costs and fixed

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.530
costs. Variable costs change with the amount
produced. So, a variable cost for a pizza

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.090
restaurant is the costs of ingredients, like
wheat and cheese, and the wages paid to workers.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.070
The more pizza you make, the more of those
resources you need, and the higher those costs.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.150
But, fixed costs, as you might imagine are
fixed. The cost of an oven or rent don’t

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.380
change, even if you produce more pizza. Now,
together, fixed costs and variable costs make

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.070
up the total cost for a specific number of
pizzas.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.880
Now, Average cost, or the cost per unit, is
the total cost divided by the number of output.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.120
The average cost of producing most things
initially falls as more is produced.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.889
So if the owner of the pizza shop spends $10,000
on a brand new oven, the average cost of that

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.480
very first pizza produced is gonna be about
$10,000. The average cost of producing two

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.780
pizzas would be around $5,000. And once you get to
10 pizzas, it’s like $1,000 — that’s an expensive pizza.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.159
The more units he makes, the lower the average
cost per pizza, because fixed costs can be

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:43.240
spread over a large number of units. Now obviously
the owner wouldn't have bought that oven if

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.819
he expected only to make 10 pizzas.

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:48.550
Buying expensive equipment only makes sense
if you plan on making a lot. That’s one

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.960
reason why large companies often have a cost
advantage over small companies.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.449
Adriene: So, the cost to produce only one
car would be really, really high. Like, millions

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:03.180
of dollars. But the average price of a new
car in the US is over $33,000. To keep their

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.620
average cost down, car manufactures make hundreds
of cars per day in huge, expensive factories.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.720
Their total total costs are astronomical,
but the average cost per car is relatively low.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.720
Unless you want an Aston Martin or something.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.320
This is called economies of scale. Companies
that produce more can utilize mass production

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.759
techniques and spread out their fixed costs
over a lot of units. Economies of scale work

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.719
so well, some companies get big enough to
dominate their industry and limit competition

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:37.159
We’ll get to that. For now let’s go back
to the pizza example. Economies of scale means

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.740
that a larger pizza restaurant may have a
slight cost advantage compared to a smaller

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.969
restaurant because they can afford things
like ovens with conveyor belts. To get the

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:51.199
average cost to fall even further, a restaurant
could automate the entire process and have

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.379
robots produce 1000 pizzas per hour, but that
doesn’t make sense if no one wants to buy

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:00.840
all those pizzas. Although it’s great to
keep costs down, the goal of a business is

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.660
not to have the lowest average cost. The goal is to
make the right number of pizzas that maximize profit.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.200
To produce the right amount, a business
should follow the profit maximizing rule:

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.900
continue to produce as long as the marginal revenue
of the last unit produced is greater or equal

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:22.629
to the marginal cost. This is often shortened
down to “produce where MR equals MC.”

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:28.080
Let’s break it down. Marginal revenue is the
additional revenue earned from selling another unit.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.480
So if a pizza company can sell every pizza for
$10 then their marginal revenue for each is $10.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.160
Marginal cost is the additional cost
of producing another unit.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.700
It is the change in total cost from
producing one more pizza.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.900
So if the marginal cost of another pizza is
$5 and you can sell it for $10 then you should

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:52.770
definitely produce that pizza. You would make
a $5 profit off it. If the marginal cost of

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.789
next pizza is $9 then you should produce that
pizza too.

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:01.550
But, if the marginal cost of the next pizza
is $12, you shouldn’t make it. The additional

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:07.159
cost is greater than the additional revenue.
Notice in this example the marginal cost is

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:12.080
increasing. That’s true for the production
of almost everything. The more you make, each

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.949
additional unit is eventually going to cost
more. Let’s learn why in the Thought Bubble

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:20.639
Jacob: Businesses have all kinds of variable
costs, but let’s imagine a pizza shop where

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:24.479
the only variable cost is labor. And while
we’re using the power of imagination, let’s

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:28.419
say that they’re making rainbow flavored
pizza. Anyway, when one worker is hired,

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.699
that worker does absolutely everything himself.

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:34.479
He purees the rainbows, assembles the 
pizza, puts it in the oven, and delivers it.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.560
But, when a company hires a second worker, they
can start to specialize. One worker prepares

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:43.259
the ingredients while the other makes the
pizza and puts it in the oven. Now, this specialization

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:48.259
decreases the the marginal cost of each pizza.
If one worker can make 5 pizzas in an hour,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.840
but two workers can produce 20 pizzas then the
additional cost of each of those pizzas will be lower.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.340
But the benefits of specialization are limited.
As the company continues to hire more and

00:07:57.349 --> 00:08:01.379
more workers, the total amount of pizzas they
produce each hour is going to increase at a slower rate

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:06.349
They’ve run up against the law of diminishing
marginal returns. As you add variable resources,

00:08:06.349 --> 00:08:11.110
like workers, to a set number of fixed resources,
like ovens, the additional output generated

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.070
from each additional worker will eventually decrease.
There are just too many cooks in the kitchen.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:19.120
Now, eventually, they’ll get to a point
where hiring another worker only adds one

00:08:19.129 --> 00:08:23.939
more pizza to their hourly total. Now, the
marginal cost of that last pizza is huge.

00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:27.999
And, it's likely to be higher than the additional
revenue the company is gonna get from selling

00:08:27.999 --> 00:08:32.130
that pizza. So to maximize profit, a company
should make sure they produce the right number

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.410
of pizzas. Where the marginal cost of the
last unit produced is going to be up to,

00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.360
but not greater than, the marginal revenue.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.580
Adriene: Thanks Thought Bubble. The Law of
Diminishing Marginal Returns applies to all

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:47.620
sorts of tasks. For farmers, there’s likely
to be a large additional yield from fertilizing

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.940
a field for the first time, but each time
they fertilize the additional gains diminish.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:59.180
At some point, too much fertilizer can actually cause
the total yield to fall. This also applies to studying.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:04.900
The returns from your first hour of studying are high.
Instead of failing your final exam, you may get a C.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:10.570
Another hour of studying may get you a B and
another hour may get you up to a B+. But every

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:16.500
hour you get lower and lower returns. And, again at
some point — maybe the twelfth hour of studying

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.700
— your grade would actually go down since you
stayed up all night and fell asleep during the test.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.040
Understanding this law helps people balance
costs and benefits, but there's one more cost

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:31.440
we need to cover: sunk costs. A sunk cost is a cost
that's already been paid and can't be recovered.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.500
Economists stress that sunk costs
shouldn't be included when making future decisions.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.380
Assume a business spends 2 million dollars
developing a new product, and then no one

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:44.890
wants that product. They have to come up with
something else. The money spent on developing

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:50.600
the first product is a sunk cost and should
be ignored moving forward. This type of rational

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.270
decision making seems like common sense, but
behavioral economists point out that people

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.640
make irrational decisions all the time.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.590
Think about dating. Imagine a you’ve been
with someone for a couple years. If your relationship

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:06.790
starts going sour, you might try to ignore
the red flags. Who wants to give up on a relationship

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:12.850
that you’ve invested so much time in? Economics
tells us to think about sunk costs and focus

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.460
instead on the benefits and costs in the future.
Get outta there!

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.520
Jacob: So there you have it. Everything you
need to know to run your own business.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.080
Except, not really. Economics explains
business decision making in broad terms.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.700
Adriene: If you really want to learn all the details,
become an entrepreneur and start a business.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.180
And if you ever get interviewed by Fortune
magazine or The Wall Street Journal,
