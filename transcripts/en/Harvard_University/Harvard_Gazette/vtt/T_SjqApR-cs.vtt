Because I grew up sick I spent most of
my time at home often in bed.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.200
Sci-fi and fantasy and fiction it just became like, my own little escape world.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.480
Having cystic fibrosis can be a bit of a
lonely experience. It's really hard to

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.330
connect with people in person. CF has
definitely like a younger life

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.750
expectancy. I've had friends who have
passed away at 21, at 19. It's given me a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.040
lot of drive to move forward and see my
life as something that's precious and  meaningful.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.580
I decided that if I was going to
do anything I wanted to go to school.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.980
I was like well if I'm gonna die young and
if I'm gonna go to university before I

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.199
die I'm going to go to like the best
school. I worked really hard for it and

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.570
then I did it. I really feel passionate
about using what I've learned here at

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.930
Harvard to do good for the people that I
care about. Storytelling has always been

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.630
a way for me to escape and experience
things I wouldn't be able to physically.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.440
It gave me an opportunity to kind of get
a taste of things that I knew I would

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.130
never be able to do and ways to connect
with the characters and learn and grow

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.060
from them. I first started dressing up as
Leia actually when I heard about Carrie

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.220
Fisher coming to campus. You know put my hair into buns, found all the white

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.470
pieces of clothing I had and threw on my
boots and dressed up as Leia. I always

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.939
connected with Leah because I felt like
she's the strongest. Her entire planet

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.189
blew up and she just keeps moving
forward. I love Star Wars because it's

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.650
just so much fun. It meant more to me
when it became something I used to

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.549
connect with other people.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.229
I'm really passionate about working 
with disability especially children with

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.090
disabilities. I hope to go to law school
after Harvard and work in child welfare

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.400
and disability. I struggle a lot but you
know I'm not willing to just like roll

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.989
over and die I just have to keep moving
forward and accept where life takes me.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.010
