so yes then you can solve it in a way

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830
so yes then you can solve it in a way

that does that those can go away to

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810
that does that those can go away to
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.900
that does that those can go away to
bring up the the other individually

circuit basically you could elaborate

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510
circuit basically you could elaborate

well I can sure run a possibility around

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649
well I can sure run a possibility around
 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.700

there senators well I've derived that

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
there senators well I've derived that
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.650
there senators well I've derived that
partly from my study of addiction and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
partly from my study of addiction and
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.180
partly from my study of addiction and
also from my study of recovery from

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
also from my study of recovery from
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.250
also from my study of recovery from
post-traumatic stress disorder but let's

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260
post-traumatic stress disorder but let's
 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.660
post-traumatic stress disorder but let's
talk about addiction so there's a series

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670
talk about addiction so there's a series
 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.930
talk about addiction so there's a series
of actions that occur before you take

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940
of actions that occur before you take
 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.479
of actions that occur before you take
your cocaine some of those are local

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489
your cocaine some of those are local
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.529
your cocaine some of those are local
they are the things that happened

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
they are the things that happened
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.910
they are the things that happened
immediately before and some of those are

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920
immediately before and some of those are
 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.160
immediately before and some of those are
distal they're farther back in the chain

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
distal they're farther back in the chain
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.219
distal they're farther back in the chain
of events and when you when you have a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229
of events and when you when you have a
 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.660
of events and when you when you have a
hit of cocaine it produces a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
hit of cocaine it produces a
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.060
hit of cocaine it produces a
dopaminergic burst and that feels really

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070
dopaminergic burst and that feels really
 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.980
dopaminergic burst and that feels really
good but it also makes the circuits that

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990
good but it also makes the circuits that
 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.880
good but it also makes the circuits that
were immediately active before that grow

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890
were immediately active before that grow
 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.109
were immediately active before that grow
that's what reinforcement is and then

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119
that's what reinforcement is and then
 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.410
that's what reinforcement is and then
the growth is proportionate not linearly

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
the growth is proportionate not linearly
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.120
the growth is proportionate not linearly
but it's proportionate to how long

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130
but it's proportionate to how long
 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.230
but it's proportionate to how long
before that event occurred the closer it

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
before that event occurred the closer it
 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.640
before that event occurred the closer it
is the Hulk stronger they're going to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
is the Hulk stronger they're going to
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.380
is the Hulk stronger they're going to
get but even the ones that are somewhat

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390
get but even the ones that are somewhat
 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.270
get but even the ones that are somewhat
distal gets some reinforcement because

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
distal gets some reinforcement because
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.950
distal gets some reinforcement because
you might say well what did you do

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
you might say well what did you do
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.030
you might say well what did you do
before you you found your latest fix and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040
before you you found your latest fix and
 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.340
before you you found your latest fix and
the answer is well how long before well

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350
the answer is well how long before well
 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.460
the answer is well how long before well
the closer the more reward and so what

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
the closer the more reward and so what
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.770
the closer the more reward and so what
happens then is that so if you take that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
happens then is that so if you take that
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.480
happens then is that so if you take that
person out of the normal environment you

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
person out of the normal environment you
 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.330
person out of the normal environment you
put them into a treatment center they're

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
put them into a treatment center they're
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.280
put them into a treatment center they're
off they're a physical addiction which

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290
off they're a physical addiction which
 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.899
off they're a physical addiction which
is a weird thing in the case of cocaine

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
is a weird thing in the case of cocaine
 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.280
is a weird thing in the case of cocaine
but like not that long a week I'll do it

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290
but like not that long a week I'll do it
 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.380
but like not that long a week I'll do it
two weeks for sure even heroin and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390
two weeks for sure even heroin and
 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.719
two weeks for sure even heroin and
alcohol for sure if you can get them

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729
alcohol for sure if you can get them
 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.630
alcohol for sure if you can get them
through the seizure part without dying

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640
through the seizure part without dying
 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.580
through the seizure part without dying
and so they're done there aren't

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590
and so they're done there aren't
 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.260
and so they're done there aren't
physiologically it dependent anymore but

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270
physiologically it dependent anymore but
 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.729
physiologically it dependent anymore but
you let that person go and the first

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739
you let that person go and the first
 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:13.910
you let that person go and the first
thing

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
thing
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.710
thing
that happens his old friend who he's

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720
that happens his old friend who he's
 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.990
that happens his old friend who he's
always out doing drugs with shows up and

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000
always out doing drugs with shows up and
 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.479
always out doing drugs with shows up and
bang he's craving like mad and that's

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489
bang he's craving like mad and that's
 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.670
bang he's craving like mad and that's
because that thing is me there is not

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680
because that thing is me there is not
 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.270
because that thing is me there is not
dead at all and it's it's activated by

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280
dead at all and it's it's activated by
 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.270
dead at all and it's it's activated by
the cue and it's a it's a circuit it's

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280
the cue and it's a it's a circuit it's
 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.360
the cue and it's a it's a circuit it's
not it's a personality it only wants one

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370
not it's a personality it only wants one

not it's a personality it only wants one
thing it wants cocaine it's going to

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500
thing it wants cocaine it's going to
 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.070

suppress any non related thoughts and

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080
suppress any non related thoughts and
 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.170
suppress any non related thoughts and
it'll use lies that's no problem

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180
it'll use lies that's no problem
 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.630
it'll use lies that's no problem
especially if lies have been reinforced

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640
especially if lies have been reinforced
 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.280
especially if lies have been reinforced
which they certainly have where are you

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290
which they certainly have where are you
 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.220

off to son you know you'll have a life

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230
off to son you know you'll have a life
 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.960
off to son you know you'll have a life
for that and then 10 minutes later you

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970
for that and then 10 minutes later you
 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.670
for that and then 10 minutes later you
have your drug and so that little lie

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680
have your drug and so that little lie
 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.430
have your drug and so that little lie
has just grown or maybe you think you've

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440
has just grown or maybe you think you've
 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.170
has just grown or maybe you think you've
tried to quit you think to hell with it

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180
tried to quit you think to hell with it
 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.960
tried to quit you think to hell with it
and every time 10 minutes before you

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970
and every time 10 minutes before you
 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.699
and every time 10 minutes before you
take your drug you think to hell with it

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709
take your drug you think to hell with it
 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.590
take your drug you think to hell with it
and you do that a thousand times

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600
and you do that a thousand times
 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.270
and you do that a thousand times
well believe me that to hell with it

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280
well believe me that to hell with it
 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.110
well believe me that to hell with it
circuit that sucker is strong and so

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120
circuit that sucker is strong and so
 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.210
circuit that sucker is strong and so
it's alive and it's not like it just

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220
it's alive and it's not like it just
 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.570
it's alive and it's not like it just
disappears it can't it's you it's grown

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580
disappears it can't it's you it's grown
 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.479
disappears it can't it's you it's grown
in there now you can build another

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489
in there now you can build another
 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.699
in there now you can build another
circuit to shut it down and you can help

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709
circuit to shut it down and you can help
 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.190
circuit to shut it down and you can help
it decompose across time by not giving

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200
it decompose across time by not giving
 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.319
it decompose across time by not giving
it what it wants but you're going to

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329
it what it wants but you're going to
 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.210
it what it wants but you're going to
have to not give it what it wants in all

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220
have to not give it what it wants in all
 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.099
have to not give it what it wants in all
of the multiple contexts that you've

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109
of the multiple contexts that you've
 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.440
of the multiple contexts that you've
already associated with the drug some of

you probably smoked and then tried to

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160
you probably smoked and then tried to
 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.710
you probably smoked and then tried to
quit smoking and what you'll see is you

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720
quit smoking and what you'll see is you
 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.140
quit smoking and what you'll see is you
get a craving when well when you have a

get a craving when well when you have a
 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.550
get a craving when well when you have a
cup of coffee or when you're finished
