00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.590
Let's talk a bit about the team projects. As you'll learn later on,

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.720
current EHRs are typically deficient, in the ways they collect, and display

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.050
clinical data. Although we'll discuss some innovate approaches to data capture,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.500
the visualization challenge is still largely unsolved. The team project is your

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.870
opportunity to solve it. Your four person team will develop an approach and

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.840
submit it for review. You will then develop a web app based on that approach and

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.710
submit it along with a short paper describing your thinking and

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.500
what you feel you've achieved. The projects will be evaluated and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.540
graded by the target end user, actual physicians. It will be due at the end of

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.240
the course and will account for half your grade. We'll ask each of you for

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.490
some background data, so we can assemble four person teams with the right mix of

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.920
skills. I'm telling you about the project now and suggesting how you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.830
can begin to do some reading to familiarize yourself with current thinking and

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.410
work. Please don't wait until later to start doing this. While this project

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.600
may appear to be simple to some of you, I can assure you that it is in fact

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.830
quite challenging. Doing it well will require careful thought, analysis, and

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.160
design, as well as coding skills. The sooner you start, the better you will do.
