let's say you're a problem where a team

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.760
achieves 0.5% error a single human 1%
error and you have an algorithm with 0.6

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770
error and you have an algorithm with 0.6
 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.610
error and you have an algorithm with 0.6
percent training error and 0.8 percent

death error so in this case what is the

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360
death error so in this case what is the
 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.799
death error so in this case what is the
avoidable bias so this one is relatively

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
avoidable bias so this one is relatively
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.830
avoidable bias so this one is relatively
easier to answer 0.5 percent is you

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
easier to answer 0.5 percent is you
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.350
easier to answer 0.5 percent is you
estimate a Bayes error so you avoidable

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360
estimate a Bayes error so you avoidable
 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.240

byers you're not going to use this 1%

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250
byers you're not going to use this 1%
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.979
byers you're not going to use this 1%
number as reference you can use this

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
number as reference you can use this
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.290
number as reference you can use this
difference so maybe you estimate your

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
difference so maybe you estimate your
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.380
difference so maybe you estimate your
avoidable buyers as at least open 1% and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
avoidable buyers as at least open 1% and
 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.160
avoidable buyers as at least open 1% and
your variance as 0.2% so there's maybe

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
your variance as 0.2% so there's maybe
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.789
your variance as 0.2% so there's maybe
more to do to reduce your variance than

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799
more to do to reduce your variance than
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.510

that is the fact that your training
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.840
that is the fact that your training
error 0.3 percent does this mean you've

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.069
basil 0.2 percent or maybe Bayes error
is 0.3 percent you don't really know but

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079
is 0.3 percent you don't really know but
 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.940
is 0.3 percent you don't really know but
based on the information given in this

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
based on the information given in this
 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.719
based on the information given in this
example is actually you actually don't

example is actually you actually don't
 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.030

have enough information to tell if you

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040
have enough information to tell if you
 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.190
have enough information to tell if you
should focus on reducing bias or

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
should focus on reducing bias or
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.109
should focus on reducing bias or
reducing perience in your algorithm so

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119
reducing perience in your algorithm so
 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.150
reducing perience in your algorithm so
that slows down the efficiency which

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160
that slows down the efficiency which
 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.300
that slows down the efficiency which

the right label for an example then it's
 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.900
the right label for an example then it's
just also harder to rely on human

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910
just also harder to rely on human
 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.350

are ways that your algorithm could still
improve the performance so in this

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410
improve the performance so in this
 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.550
