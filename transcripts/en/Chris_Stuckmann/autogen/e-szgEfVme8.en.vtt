being born there were boycotts due to
 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.270
being born there were boycotts due to
the level of violence and the fact that

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280
the level of violence and the fact that
 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.500
the level of violence and the fact that
it was a kid and a doll

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510
it was a kid and a doll
 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.790
it was a kid and a doll
I don't know I don't really consider it

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800
I don't know I don't really consider it
 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.550
I don't know I don't really consider it
the more violent of the horror films

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560
the more violent of the horror films
 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.789
the more violent of the horror films
I've seen like I've seen way worse

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799
I've seen like I've seen way worse
 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.440
I've seen like I've seen way worse

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450
obviously my dad didn't have it probably
 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.220
obviously my dad didn't have it probably
watching it when I was like

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230
watching it when I was like
 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.980
watching it when I was like
eight nine years old because it's not

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
eight nine years old because it's not
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.800
eight nine years old because it's not
it's not as graphically violent as I

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810
it's not as graphically violent as I
 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.050
it's not as graphically violent as I
think some of the slasher films are I

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
think some of the slasher films are I
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.520
think some of the slasher films are I
kind of don't understand I think it's

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530
kind of don't understand I think it's
 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.020
kind of don't understand I think it's
because people just weren't used to

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030
because people just weren't used to
 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.570
because people just weren't used to
seeing a child and a doll that's what it

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580
seeing a child and a doll that's what it
 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.160
seeing a child and a doll that's what it
is situation that's definitely what it

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
is situation that's definitely what it
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.680
is situation that's definitely what it
is it's the subject matter combined with

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
is it's the subject matter combined with
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.840
is it's the subject matter combined with
the kid and the fact that it's a doll

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850
the kid and the fact that it's a doll
 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.180
the kid and the fact that it's a doll
and I don't really consider it that

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190
and I don't really consider it that
 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.410
and I don't really consider it that
violent either I mean there are some

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420
violent either I mean there are some
 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.690
violent either I mean there are some
moments of gore but most of it is hidden

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700
moments of gore but most of it is hidden
 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.550
moments of gore but most of it is hidden
or off screen like when Chucky pushes

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560
or off screen like when Chucky pushes
 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.440
or off screen like when Chucky pushes
the woman out of the window

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
the woman out of the window
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.790
the woman out of the window
you basically just see like a

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800
you basically just see like a
 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.800
you basically just see like a
first-person point of view of Chucky

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810
first-person point of view of Chucky
 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.510
first-person point of view of Chucky
coming towards her and then you get like

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520
coming towards her and then you get like
 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.130
coming towards her and then you get like
a really cool shot of her falling out of

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140
a really cool shot of her falling out of
 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.690
a really cool shot of her falling out of
the window but I mean it's it's not all

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700
the window but I mean it's it's not all
 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.300
the window but I mean it's it's not all
that violent really and so I don't

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310
that violent really and so I don't
 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.190
that violent really and so I don't
really consider this movie to be

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200
really consider this movie to be
 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.200
