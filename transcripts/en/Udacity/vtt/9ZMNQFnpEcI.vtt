00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.640
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm going to make a double

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.200
2048. There's going to be one grid up here

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.360
and one grid down here and there's going to

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.000
be, it's just going to be a disaster of tiles.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.920
&gt;&gt; All right, let's see what happens.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.610
&gt;&gt; So, I'm going to copy everything from game container which is two levels in.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.640
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.320
&gt;&gt; So, I'm going to highlight down, and

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.935
then this is the closing div.

00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:21.310
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.330
&gt;&gt; And it's two levels in, so I'm going to copy and

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.050
paste. Save it.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.310
&gt;&gt; All right, let's see what happened.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.030
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, here we are. Let's reload the page.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.120
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.825
&gt;&gt; And, okay, whoa, [LAUGH] that is not what I wanted.

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:40.370
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.900
&gt;&gt; I was hoping that there would be way more tile

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.970
movement. But it looks like just the top tiles are going.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:46.900
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.340
&gt;&gt; That's unfortunate, but I guess I shouldn't

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.610
have expected too much. Any idea what happened here?

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.720
&gt;&gt; Not without looking at the code a little bit more.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.650
&gt;&gt; All right, well, maybe we'll do that in lesson two.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.930
&gt;&gt; All right.
