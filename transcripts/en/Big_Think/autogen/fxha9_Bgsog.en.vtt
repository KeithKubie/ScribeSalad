road map and it really has to do with

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280
road map and it really has to do with
 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.920

of supply but diversity of source and
 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.389
of supply but diversity of source and
and so that means we both have to think

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399
and so that means we both have to think
 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.950
and so that means we both have to think
about how we get more out of the sources

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960
about how we get more out of the sources
 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.600

high carbon content energy sources we
 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.550
high carbon content energy sources we
need to think about how we can use less

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560
need to think about how we can use less
 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.270
need to think about how we can use less
of them for the same thing and then how

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280
of them for the same thing and then how
 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.160
of them for the same thing and then how
do we mitigate the effects of them with

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170
do we mitigate the effects of them with
 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.640
do we mitigate the effects of them with
things like carbon capture and storage

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650
things like carbon capture and storage
 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.180

transportation sector for instance the
 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.620
transportation sector for instance the
airline industry I don't think the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630
airline industry I don't think the
 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.180
airline industry I don't think the
airline industry is going to become

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190
airline industry is going to become
 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.490
airline industry is going to become
purely electrified shortly whereas we

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500
purely electrified shortly whereas we
 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.490
purely electrified shortly whereas we
can go a long way in that direction with

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500
can go a long way in that direction with
 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.560
can go a long way in that direction with
ground-based transportation because

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570
ground-based transportation because
 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.469
ground-based transportation because
range is clearly an issue even for

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479
range is clearly an issue even for
 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.659
range is clearly an issue even for
automobiles if we think of battery

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669
automobiles if we think of battery
 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.969
automobiles if we think of battery
technologies and so we have to push

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979
technologies and so we have to push
 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.640
technologies and so we have to push
further on those sorts of undergirding

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650
further on those sorts of undergirding
 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.879

then we have this whole infrastructural

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340
then we have this whole infrastructural
 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.909
then we have this whole infrastructural

country it needs to be rejuvenated both
 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.670
country it needs to be rejuvenated both
to be more reliable and safe for what we

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680
to be more reliable and safe for what we
 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.149
to be more reliable and safe for what we
already use it for but as we do that we

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159
already use it for but as we do that we
 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:12.600
already use it for but as we do that we
need to think about how do we design it

need to think about how do we design it
 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.970
need to think about how do we design it
in a way to put more intelligence

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980
in a way to put more intelligence
 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.180
in a way to put more intelligence
into the grid how do we design it in a

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190

transportation future we got to think

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790
transportation future we got to think
 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.400
transportation future we got to think
about where that electricity is coming

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410
about where that electricity is coming
 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.490
