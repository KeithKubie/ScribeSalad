00:00:00.825 --> 00:00:03.064
- [Voiceover] Where is the
point on the number line?

00:00:03.064 --> 00:00:05.985
Well, here it is, here is the point.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:08.167
But I'm guessing that
they're asking not literally

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:09.904
just to find it and look at it

00:00:09.904 --> 00:00:13.307
but what number is this point graphed at.

00:00:13.307 --> 00:00:15.898
Where is this on the number line?

00:00:15.898 --> 00:00:17.645
So, one thing we know pretty quickly

00:00:17.645 --> 00:00:20.119
is the number is between three and four.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.505
It's greater than three
but it's not quite four.

00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:25.642
But to figure out how
much greater than three

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:29.776
we need to know what these
black tick marks represent.

00:00:29.776 --> 00:00:31.902
So, between three and four there is

00:00:31.902 --> 00:00:35.207
one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:00:35.207 --> 00:00:38.290
seven, eight, nine, ten equal spaces.

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:41.514
So, each of these distances,

00:00:41.514 --> 00:00:44.172
each of these equal spaces,

00:00:44.172 --> 00:00:45.172
is one tenth

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:50.863
or one tenth of the distance
between three and four.

00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:53.613
It's one out of ten equal spaces.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.314
So, if that's one tenth

00:00:57.314 --> 00:01:00.501
and this next space is another one tenth.

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:03.096
And then we have to travel one more tenth

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.284
to get to our point.

00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:08.273
So, we went three, we know it's three.

00:01:08.273 --> 00:01:09.651
Plus,

00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:11.568
one, two, three tenths.

00:01:13.878 --> 00:01:16.462
Three and three tenths.

00:01:16.462 --> 00:01:19.519
Or, let's write this as a decimal,

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:21.316
let's look at it as a decimal.

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:25.980
If we wanted, we could
have our ones place value

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.703
and then after the ones,
the decimal and the tenths.

00:01:29.703 --> 00:01:32.983
So, for the ones, there's three ones.

00:01:32.983 --> 00:01:35.558
And how many tenths did we see here?

00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:37.748
There were three tenths.

00:01:37.748 --> 00:01:41.221
So, either way we can say
three and three tenths

00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:43.896
or three and three tenths.

00:01:43.896 --> 00:01:46.626
Our decimal, our point

00:01:46.626 --> 00:01:49.793
is 3.3 on the number line.
