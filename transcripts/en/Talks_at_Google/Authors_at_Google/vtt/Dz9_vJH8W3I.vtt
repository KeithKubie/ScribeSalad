[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.674 --> 00:00:06.590
SHANNON KAISER: Hello!

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.630
How's it going?

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.540
It's Friday!

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.170
And we're all here together.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.550
I promise this hour--

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.350
I'm going to call it a Power
Hour-- it'll be a little less

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.150
than an hour because I know
you're honest your lunch break,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.640
and you guys are like in
the middle of the workday.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.490
But I am here to jazz you
up and really inspire you

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.770
because I've been on my
own personal journey, which

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.350
turned into a book called
"The Self-Love Experiment."

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.495
So as we get started, I
want to ask you a question.

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:35.120
And just think about
this for a moment.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.453
And I will ask you to share
with the person next to you.

00:00:37.453 --> 00:00:39.170
So that's kind of fun, right?

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.130
Get cozy.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.100
Think about someone who
really inspires you.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.920
It could be a mentor, a boss,
a teacher, a best friend.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.380
Maybe it's someone
you don't know,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.030
a public figure, an author.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.650
Just kidding.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.490
Most of you probably
don't know me.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.161
So, ha ha.

00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:54.660
But no.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.201
Think about someone
who inspires you.

00:00:56.201 --> 00:01:00.000
And what are the qualities
of an empowered person?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.500
OK?

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.950
So just take a quick moment
and workshop with each other.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.270
So you can say who it is
and why they inspire you.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.480
OK.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.840
So we'll come back to the group.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.340
Does anyone want to share?

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.790
All I want to hear is
just maybe qualities

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.590
of the inspiring person.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.010
Just shout them out.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.720
Self-empowered.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.190
Just qualities of
that empowered person.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.940
Determined.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.020
Empowering other people.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.220
Yes.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.080
Confidence.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.930
Passionate.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.430
Yes.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.910
These are great words.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.800
Anyone else?

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.990
Qualities of the
empowered person.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.440
Happy, driven, all of these.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.470
Honest.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.040
These are amazing.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.790
So these qualities are also
qualities of self-love.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.830
These qualities
are also qualities

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.976
of an empowered person, someone
who is standing in their truth.

00:01:58.976 --> 00:02:00.350
And today, I'm
going to help you.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.544
Yes, I'll be talking about my
experiment and my experience

00:02:03.544 --> 00:02:05.210
in writing my book,
but I'm here to help

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.980
you stand in your truth.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.009
Because my ultimate goal is that
when people ask that question,

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.590
you say, I empower me.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.990
I'm empowered and inspired
by me because I've

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.510
worked really hard to get
to where I am in my life.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.520
And I'm super excited
where I'm going to go.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.230
So that's where
we're going today.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.900
And so when you
first hear the word

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.950
self-love what are some of
the things you guys think of?

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.350
We're here today at a lunch
break to talk about self-love.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.870
Anybody kind of think
maybe it's selfish?

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.410
You don't have to raise your
hand, but I hear that a lot.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.600
Narcissistic.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.720
A little bit selfish.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.940
A little bit uh, right?

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.050
I used to think that.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.800
I used to think that
for many, many years.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.770
In fact, I was war with myself.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.480
For almost three
decades, I hated myself.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.400
I hated my body.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.450
I blamed my body for everything.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.710
I didn't make the dance
team in high school.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.730
It was my body's fault. A
man didn't call me back.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.210
Whenever they
didn't call me back,

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.300
it was always me,
my body, to blame.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.970
And it didn't matter what
size my body was because I

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.560
used to be a triathlete.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.470
I would run half marathons
every other weekend.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.980
I would participate in
half Iron Man triathlons.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.710
So I looked really
healthy on the outside.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.150
I looked really fit.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.687
Looked like I had it together.

00:03:18.687 --> 00:03:20.020
I haven't always been an author.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.660
I haven't always been talking
to people and writing books.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.770
In fact, several years
ago, all through my 20s,

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.410
I was in corporate.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.520
I was in advertising.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.430
Anybody have friends
in advertising?

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.290
Especially here, right?

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.840
And I was climbing the corporate
ladder, living in Chicago,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.030
and it looks like I
had it all together.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.120
I was dating a man who
wanted to marry me,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.360
and I was making a lot of money,
so much money I didn't even

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.460
know what to do with it.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.426
Yet I was in a lot of
debt, so much debt.

00:03:49.426 --> 00:03:51.358
Just wipe my sweat here.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.877
And I got to a point where I
said something's got to give.

00:03:59.877 --> 00:04:02.210
Because on the outside, it
looked like I had everything,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.860
but on the inside,
I was crying myself

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.110
to sleep every single night.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.760
I was suffering from
eating disorders,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.045
and my doctor diagnosed me
with clinical depression.

00:04:11.045 --> 00:04:12.710
So it was actually
a point in my life

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.670
where we can't look and
judge people and say

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.890
by on the outside how they
look because everyone's having

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.344
their own internal experience.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.510
And so I got to a place
where I said, you know what?

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.980
Something has to change.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.720
In my inner voice, I said,
depression, why are you here?

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.360
What could you
possibly teach me?

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.120
And my depression said,
follow your heart.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.210
You're sad because you're
not being true to yourself.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.000
So I got up the courage
to follow my heart, which

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.670
meant leaving advertising,
leaving Chicago, and moving

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.160
back to Portland,
Oregon, where I grew up

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.460
and finding my passion
for writing, and speaking,

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.160
and leading retreats.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.160
And through this process,
I started to write books.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.490
And I found the most joyous
activity in the world.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.174
I found my life passion
through writing.

00:05:02.174 --> 00:05:03.840
And when I was promoting
my first book--

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.350
called "Find Your Happy," which
talks about how to be happy--

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.080
I was going on tour,
and I was getting

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.880
ready to go on the morning
television show in Seattle.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.570
And the night before I
was in the hotel room,

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.447
and I was looking in the
mirror, and I was crying.

00:05:21.447 --> 00:05:23.030
Because here I was,
going to go on TV,

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.900
and I was going
to talk to people

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.358
about how to be
happy because I had

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:26.900
been much happier than I was.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.700
I had worked through
the addictions,

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.450
I had to overcome
the depression,

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.960
here I was living
my dream job, but I

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.120
couldn't say one good thing
about myself I hated myself.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.470
I said, how happy can you be
if you don't love yourself?

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.040
And that's where the
Self-Love Experiment was born.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.990
So this was several years
ago, but through the process,

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.210
I started to do research.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.590
And-- excuse me-- what I
discovered is that 90% of women

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.570
hate their bodies.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.300
Ladies, 90% of us.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.290
And I discover
that 95% of people

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.180
absolutely want to change
something about themselves.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.030
So just take a look at the room.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.150
Almost all of us, we have
something we dislike.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.900
And it gets worse.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.290
6 out of 10 people
actually opt out

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.550
of important activities because
of a flaw or insecurity.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.780
So this is actually
controlling our life, OK?

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.740
So an insecurity blocks
us from showing up.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.050
And that's when I realized
the self-love experiment has

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.750
to happen to save my
life because I was not

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.920
living my life.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.020
I was letting my
insecurities hold me back,

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.701
and I was preventing myself
from living my potential.

00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:45.200
And that's what I
offer to you today

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.900
to think about what is
that problem, the flaw,

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.330
the insecurity, that you
feel has been stopping you

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.440
from moving forward.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.450
Just take a moment.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.390
I call it the Almost
Paradise Syndrome.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.300
It's the "when I lose the
weight, I'll be happier,"

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.390
"when I get the promotion,"
"when I moved to the city

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:12.360
I really want to be in," "when
I get that X, Y, Z," then

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.450
maybe my life can start.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.730
But guess what?

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.500
Most of the time when we
get that we realize we're

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.060
still not happy.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.830
I lost all the weight.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.690
I still wasn't happy.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.190
I got that dream job.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.850
Something was missing.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.060
And so at the core
of every single thing

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.017
we want in our life is
empowerment, self-love.

00:07:34.017 --> 00:07:36.350
So we chase it, and we look
for it outside of ourselves,

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.840
but really it's inside,
inside of ourselves.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.610
So today, I have a process
I'm going to take you through.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.151
But I first want to
talk a little bit

00:07:43.151 --> 00:07:45.650
about what the Self-Love
Experiment actually is

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.440
and how I got to learning
how to love myself fully.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.780
Because truly I stand
up here in front of you,

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.574
loving myself, every
fiber of my body,

00:07:52.574 --> 00:07:54.740
even though I sweat in front
of people all the time.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.520
It doesn't matter.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.320
I'm sitting on the
couch, and I sweat.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.190
And so it really becomes
about showing up as you are,

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.030
no matter where you are, and
letting yourself be seen.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.760
Let yourself be who you are.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.800
So what is the
Self-Love Experiment?

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.000
It had three goals.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.840
Number one, I wanted
to lighten up.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.820
How many of us want
to lighten up, right?

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.790
Spiritually, emotionally,
physically, mentally,

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.470
I was taking life so serious.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.650
I would go out to dinner
or lunch with friends,

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.020
and I couldn't be present
because I was so focused on

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.760
how the next bite I took would
put me over my calorie limit.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.480
My best friend called me, and
said, I'm getting married.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.100
I want you to be in the wedding.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.570
And my first thought--

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.210
this is before the
Self-Love Experiment--

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.705
was not, I'm so excited for you.

00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:44.330
Yes, I can't wait to
be in the wedding.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.810
It was, holy crap, do I have
enough time to lose the weight?

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.180
And I wasn't
overweight at all then.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.950
So we have these
things about ourselves,

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.830
and really the war that's
happening is inside our head.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.111
The inner critic is
driving us, and that's

00:08:57.111 --> 00:08:58.610
why this book is
out, and that's why

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.490
I did the Self-Love Experiment
So just as I take you

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.850
through the process, think about
where your insecurities have

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.880
been blocking you, what flaw
do you wake up in the morning

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.970
and focus on, because this
process will reverse it.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.810
This process will let you be
who you are in a world that

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.612
tries to tell you to change.

00:09:16.612 --> 00:09:18.320
Because the world's
going to keep saying,

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.500
be smarter, richer,
prettier, thinner.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.780
Go chase whatever.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.240
But the real magic of
the Self-Love Experiment,

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.550
and also being alive,
is to say, guess what?

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.510
I'm not going to subscribe to
that anymore because that's

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.485
where our anxiety comes from.

00:09:34.485 --> 00:09:36.860
That's where the depression
and the addictions come from.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.220
I was able to heal my depression
and my eating disorders

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.220
and find my life
purpose and passion

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.357
by discovering self-love.

00:09:45.357 --> 00:09:46.940
So the second part
and the second goal

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.490
of my self-love experiment
was to say only nice things

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.750
about myself.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.290
Can I look in the mirror
and say kind things?

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.870
Yes, it's possible.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.520
What do you say to yourself
when you look in the mirror?

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.720
Let's turn it into
a kind conversation.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:09.030
And then the third goal was to
see myself the way my dog does.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.080
Any dog lovers?

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.080
Animal lovers?

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.601
Cats?

00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:14.100
Do you ever notice
how they see you,

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.784
and you're the most
amazing thing in the world?

00:10:16.784 --> 00:10:19.200
I wanted to be the coolest,
most beautiful, awesome person

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.280
in the world.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.020
Because they don't judge you.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.490
They love you no matter what.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.940
That's really the ultimate
expression of the Self-Love

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.590
Experiment, and those goals are
realized through the process.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.890
So you have to-- and I had to--
realize that I have to treat it

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.760
like an experiment.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.250
So like a scientist you go into
it, you have some type of goal,

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.170
but really it's the process.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.250
Each experiment that you
do, each thing you try,

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.620
is going to move you one
step closer to possibly

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.155
what it is you want.

00:10:51.155 --> 00:10:53.280
So instead of putting the
expectation on each thing

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.630
you do, you say, guess what?

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.590
I learned from this.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.400
Now I'm going to
try something else.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.340
So the experiment
is actually what

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.104
I think we should try
to do for our life.

00:11:02.104 --> 00:11:04.020
What if we looked at our
life as an experiment

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.560
and we took off the expectations
and we stopped saying

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.270
I have to do this to get here?

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.590
I should do this.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.030
So much pressure we
put on ourselves.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.950
So the experiment
is super important,

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.620
and I encourage you
guys to look at how

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.020
you can take your weekend,
go into the weekend, and say,

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.700
I'm going to make
this an experiment.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.116
What am I going
to do that's going

00:11:22.116 --> 00:11:23.730
to be more fun, more playful?

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.220
And I'll be in the process.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.040
So about three months into
my self-love experiment,

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.120
I started to say,
OK, this is working.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.590
I'm feeling good about
myself but not all the time.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.170
It was kind of fleeting.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.890
So I was at my mom's house,
and you guys know the coloring

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.300
books where you can color?

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.760
They were really
popular a few years ago.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.990
They might still be popular.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.840
And mine had a mantra on
it that said everything

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.430
happens for a reason.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.510
And it had butterflies
and flowers,

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.920
and I didn't know that that was
a universal sign right there.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.932
But I was coloring,
and I was talking.

00:11:57.932 --> 00:11:59.640
And my mom and I, one
of my best friends,

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.400
talking about our
dreams and goals.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.700
About three months into
my self-love experiment,

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.370
and she started to bring up a
conversation about some friends

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.786
of ours that were
getting married,

00:12:09.786 --> 00:12:11.220
and it triggered
something in me.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.270
Didn't even matter
who they were.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.760
I started to cry.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.030
A woman in her mid-thirties,
very successful in her career,

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.180
looks again like she has
happiness, which I was happy.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.430
I'm going to talk
about that in a second,

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.650
how to not chase the happiness.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.480
And I was crying.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.860
And she said, why
are you crying?

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.610
What's the matter?

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.590
She put her pencil down.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:35.290
And I said, Mom,
do you think anyone

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.590
can love me the way that I am?

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.180
And that was right
there the core

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.920
of my biggest limiting belief.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.710
I felt unlovable.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.560
What I was really asking, and
I didn't know at that time,

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.787
was, do you think I can love
myself the way that I am?

00:12:50.787 --> 00:12:52.870
And of course, she put her
pencil down right away,

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.286
and she said, Shannon, don't
ever say that about yourself.

00:12:55.286 --> 00:12:58.090
Of course a mother would
never want to hear that.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.840
And the next thing she said
was the most important thing

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.150
that really kicked in
the Self-Love Experiment

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.680
and changed my life forever.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.700
She said, Shannon, the
most important thing

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.960
is that you're happy.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.240
And if you're not happy
at this body size, then

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.250
maybe this isn't
the size for you.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.510
Now she meant this with so
much love and compassion,

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.210
and this is what we hear a lot.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:25.600
I grew up with this.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.610
But in that moment I rejected
that because I said, no,

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.430
that's not the answer
because for my whole life

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.700
I've tried to change
myself to be happy,

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.220
whether I was 40 pounds
underweight or 60, 70,

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.630
pounds overweight.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.480
The problem is
not outside of me.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.370
So in her saying
that, I decided I'm

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.740
going to stop asking
everyone else,

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.900
and I'm going to go inward
and start to trust myself.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.750
And that was the most
revolutionary thing

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.000
that I could do because I
was also saying, guess what?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.082
Society that says I
should be smaller,

00:13:56.082 --> 00:13:58.290
or I can't be happy until
I have this amount of money

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.180
in the bank, or I'm
with my soul mate.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.754
A woman who's single
in her mid 30s?

00:14:01.754 --> 00:14:02.670
What's wrong with her?

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.310
All these things we
say to ourselves.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.640
But in that moment I
said, nope, the goal

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.500
is for me to learn how
to love myself as I am.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.340
And that is what the
Self-Love Experiment is.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.640
Because we all have things we
want to change about ourselves,

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.079
but learning how
to love yourself

00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:21.120
does not have to mean you
have to change yourself

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.860
from a place of self-hate.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.460
It means you can take steps
to move forward and be

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.760
more kind and compassionate with
yourself from a loving place.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.040
So that was really the key.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.320
And so it is not
outside of ourselves.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.500
The answer is really
on the inside.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.280
And so how did I
get to here today

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.680
from crying on my
mom's living room

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.720
and crying in the bathroom?

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.330
I did a self-love experiment,
and it was the most

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.980
glorious thing I've ever done.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.760
As a writer, it
turned into a book.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.020
I didn't know it was going to
be a book when I started it.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.050
But this book healed me
because I found self-love.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:03.440
I stand up here loving every
single fiber of my body

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.280
and showing up as I am.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.100
And that is the
key for all of you,

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.470
to show up through
your insecurities,

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.850
to show up through
the things you

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.621
think you need to change because
you are enough as you are.

00:15:14.621 --> 00:15:16.370
So I have a process,
three things that I'm

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.540
going to share with you.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.440
And then we'll kind of do a
Q&amp;A, and that's how we'll go.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.230
So there's actually--
the book is actually

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.110
divided in different
layers because there's

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.730
layers to self-love.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.010
So I take people
through a process.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:33.510
The first layer is self-care.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.040
OK.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.590
When you guys hear
self-care a lot of times,

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.680
in the wellness
industry especially,

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.090
we hear drink green
juice, do your yoga,

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.980
go to soul cycle, which
is really fun, by the way.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.290
I just did it.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:50.100
So we get so wrapped
up in having to be

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.460
and do a cert-- we stay
in this box, right?

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.900
The wellness community, and
just taking care of yourself.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.600
I got to a point where I
realized I am sick of yoga.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.150
I don't want any more 30-day
hot challenge yoga challenges.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:03.260
I'm done with it.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.710
I don't want any
more kale salad.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.980
And I said, what does
self-care really mean?

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.050
And I discovered it's about joy.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.690
What brings you joy?

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.030
And that is why, also,
when I said a lot of us

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:20.180
are chasing happiness, we
never really get there.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.670
Because happiness is a feeling.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.710
It's something
that will elude us

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.830
whereas joy is an experience.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.960
It's a process, but
it's a way of living.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.640
So I truly believe that joy is
the best barometer for success,

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.520
in any layer, in any level
of your life, whether it's

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.580
a relationship, whether it's
a career, whether it's trying

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.400
to reach your goal of losing
weight, or going on your dream

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.480
vacation.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.350
Joy.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:48.825
So how can you put more joy
into your life right now?

00:16:48.825 --> 00:16:50.450
So I started to do
that, and I realized

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.910
I wanted more nature
walks with my dog.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.560
I wanted to join
a spinning studio

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.060
instead of to do the yoga.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.670
And so I started
to fill myself up.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:59.920
I started to cook more.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.170
I started to do things that felt
good and made me feel alive.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:07.490
So ask yourself, what
makes you feel alive?

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.609
That's the most caring thing
you can do for yourself.

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:13.400
If you love camping,
get out and go camping.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.339
If you love animals,
go adopt a pet.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:19.250
There's things we can do to
bring more joy into our life

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.450
right now.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.329
So that's one part
of the process,

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:26.235
but I'm going to share three
of the principles that really

00:17:26.235 --> 00:17:28.610
stand out that I think can
help you guys in your own life

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:29.781
as well.

00:17:29.781 --> 00:17:31.280
And at the back of
the book, there's

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.130
15 principles so I'm pulling
out the highlighted ones.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.300
So I think we have to
first ask ourselves,

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.360
how do you know when
you're lacking self-love?

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.110
Because I didn't know
that I didn't love myself.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:46.140
I just knew that my experience
of life was difficult.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.230
A lot of times we don't
walk around saying,

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.510
I don't love myself.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.690
It's in our actions.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.540
It's in our behavior.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.760
It's in the way we're
always trying for something

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.250
more than what is.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.206
And so anybody wonder?

00:18:00.206 --> 00:18:01.580
Like throw out
why do you think--

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:06.350
what would be an example of
when we don't love ourselves?

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:07.080
Rejection.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:07.580
Yeah.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.750
When we feel rejection.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:10.320
So good.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:16.610
One of the main ones is
when we compare ourselves

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.870
to other people.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.970
And I bet if we get really
honest with ourselves,

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.344
we've probably
compared ourselves

00:18:22.344 --> 00:18:26.190
to someone else within the
past three or four days,

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.200
especially at work.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.440
And then also when we
compare ourselves to ourself.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.990
You may have had a different
version of you five years ago,

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.360
a skinnier you, one who
was in a different job,

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.300
or one who was in a
different relationship.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.050
You're like, man, if
only I could go back.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.030
Or maybe not go back,
but what happened?

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.749
Or we look to the
future part of us,

00:18:43.749 --> 00:18:45.540
and we're like, gosh,
that person out there

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.380
I'm not there yet.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.410
I'm not in the body I
want or the career I want

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.074
or whatever it may be.

00:18:51.074 --> 00:18:52.740
So we compare ourselves
to other people,

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.531
but we also keeping
ourselves to ourselves.

00:18:54.531 --> 00:18:56.980
And this is detrimental, but
it's part of being human.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.724
You cannot get out of it.

00:18:58.724 --> 00:19:00.390
And so I get to share
a process with you

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:04.680
to help you if you fall into
comparison because judgment

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.530
and comparison
keeps us from love.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.480
Judging is a form of fear.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.630
It's a form of lack
that I'm not enough

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.961
and what that person has is
better, and they're deserving,

00:19:16.961 --> 00:19:17.460
and I'm not.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.377
And we go into the cycle
where we spin out of control.

00:19:20.377 --> 00:19:22.710
Now the trick and the goal
with the Self-Love Experiment

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:24.750
is to give you guys
tools, lots of tools,

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:28.000
to help you feel
empowered in your life.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.434
And one of the tools is
to work through judgment.

00:19:30.434 --> 00:19:32.100
And I actually have
a three-part process

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.558
that I'll share
with you right now.

00:19:33.558 --> 00:19:36.150
Number one is to recognize
when you're comparing yourself

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:40.540
to other people, they are just
showing you what is possible.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.260
So for example,
I'm a book author.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.520
I have a book obviously
that just came out.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.190
But in September, there's
amazing books coming out too

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.140
from some of my
favorite authors,

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.110
who have been writing
for much longer.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.180
Amazing people, and their books
are already like number one,

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.780
and they haven't even come out.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.524
So my mind is like, oh my gosh.

00:20:00.524 --> 00:20:02.190
I just wrote this
book, and these people

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.606
have a book coming
out in a month.

00:20:03.606 --> 00:20:04.360
What's happening?

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.235
They're doing better.

00:20:05.235 --> 00:20:06.330
And I fall into ugh.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.340
Now before my
self-love experiment,

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.460
I would have carried that
energy all through my tour,

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.150
I would have showed up and
gone to bed each night feeling

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.920
not enough.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.070
But the Self-Love Experiment
gave me the process of saying,

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.137
oh, yes.

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:22.595
They're showing me
what's possible.

00:20:22.595 --> 00:20:24.120
Thank you.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.390
I can have that.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.180
Because if we don't
compare ourselves--

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.275
there's so many things
going on in the world.

00:20:30.275 --> 00:20:31.900
We don't compare
ourselves to everyone.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.733
The ones we compare
ourselves to are usually

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:36.550
the ones that show us something
within us that we want,

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.750
which means it's already
within us to have.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.320
It's just about
becoming who you need

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.230
to be to get to receive that.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.300
And so to recognize, thank you.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.920
You're showing me
what's possible.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.514
I see this can be an option
for my life if I want it.

00:20:50.514 --> 00:20:52.180
And then number two
is to immediately go

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:57.530
into appreciation,
appreciation for your own life.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.260
So I turn my attention
right away to,

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.330
oh my gosh, I just,
I wrote a book.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.260
And I get to go travel
all over the country,

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.080
and I get to just
celebrate self-love.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.820
How awesome!

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.700
Also, celebrate the people
who are showing up for you.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.190
Appreciate the things that
are going well in your life.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.460
Because if we keep focusing
on what's not going well,

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.420
we stay stuck.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.980
We stay in lack.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.140
So I want you to take
a moment right now

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.320
to just think about what
you are appreciative of

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.190
and give thanks.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.940
Just for a moment.

00:21:29.222 --> 00:21:30.680
I won't ask you to
share this time.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:38.620
So this practice of
appreciation is one of them

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.560
best and fastest
ways to move forward.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.860
I helped to heal
my depression when

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.740
I was in corporate, hating my
job, hating my life, by first--

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.460
very first step--
turning to appreciation.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.010
So if we ever feel trapped
by life circumstances

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.190
and victimized by the world,
then we can go to-- what

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.660
can I be appreciative of?

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.640
What can I be thankful
for right now?

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.740
And then from that place,
you can step forward.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.840
It's a much more loving energy.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.800
So I did the same thing with
the things I hated about myself.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.410
How can I appreciate
my overweight belly?

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:12.050
Or my chin?

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:15.694
Or all of the things that we say
we don't like about ourselves?

00:22:15.694 --> 00:22:17.860
And if you can't get there,
then focus on the things

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.750
you do appreciate
about yourself.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.910
You might love your
nose, or your hair,

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:25.360
or the way you're positive
and happy, or the way you're

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.080
trying to be positive and
show up for yourself one

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.350
step at a time.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.410
So it's about one step
at a time, which is

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.740
the process and the experiment.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:40.936
And then the third, if you're in
comparison, is to stand by you.

00:22:40.936 --> 00:22:43.210
And what I mean by this
is to give yourself what

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:45.760
it is you really need and want.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.160
So in this experience
of comparing myself

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.620
to other authors, I
recognized what I really

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.110
wanted, which was appreciation.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.310
I had a book come out.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.140
I wanted recognition.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.210
I wanted love.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:01.840
So the magic is to
give that to yourself.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.570
Here I was right before
I started my book tour,

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.000
seeing all these other
authors trending all over

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.060
on the New York Times
list, all this stuff,

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.990
and I said, wow, I haven't
even given myself appreciation.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.480
I haven't even shown myself
love because I've been

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.580
so busy the past couple weeks.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:22.060
So give yourself what it is
you need, and all of a sudden,

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.430
you will feel more empowered.

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.410
What I needed was
recognition so I said,

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:27.700
Shannon, you wrote a book.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.440
I hadn't told
myself that at all.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.400
So what can you
recognize yourself for?

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.310
What can you celebrate
yourself for?

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.360
What can you lift
yourself up for?

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.230
One step at a time
starts up here.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:45.700
And then the very next
day, my agent talked to me,

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.200
and I looked at
the numbers, and I

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.120
saw that my book, the
Self-Love Experiment,

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.230
was trending on Amazon.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:52.110
Number one in self-esteem.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:55.752
And I say this only because
I believe this process works.

00:23:55.752 --> 00:23:57.460
When you show up for
yourself and get out

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.580
of what's going on out
there and return to inside,

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.460
you're an empowered
person moving forward.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.970
You have the power to
control the outcome

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:11.572
by being in the space of love
and compassion for yourself.

00:24:11.572 --> 00:24:13.780
And so the second one--
actually, there's a principle

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.880
I'll share with you for this.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.710
It's number one, the
principle number one,

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.590
is to accept where you are.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:23.650
It's just a point in your
journey and everything about--

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:25.660
everything about it
offers possibility

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:29.025
for growth and expansion.

00:24:29.025 --> 00:24:31.150
So when it looks like
comparing yourself to others,

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:34.720
recognize where you are, accept
it, and then from that place,

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.490
you can move forward,
in that place

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:38.970
you'll feel more charged up.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.950
So what can you accept
in your life right now?

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.020
There's that famous
Chinese proverb.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.460
Accept what you can't change.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.590
Change what you can't accept.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:50.441
It really does start
with acceptance.

00:24:50.441 --> 00:24:50.940
OK.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.844
So the second one I'll
share with you today.

00:24:53.844 --> 00:24:55.260
This is the barrier
that blocks us

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.480
and when we know we're
out of self-love.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.510
It's when we feel
hopeless, or we

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.510
feel like self-love is
selfish, or we feel like,

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.787
how dare I care about myself.

00:25:05.787 --> 00:25:06.620
So here's the thing.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.540
There's so much going on
in the world right now--

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.550
disasters, political uproar.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.580
There's a lot of
fear, terrorists.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.640
It's crazy out there.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.330
And we can easily fall into
feeling depressed and feeling

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:22.830
hopeless.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:25.621
And I did this about two months
before my book was coming out.

00:25:25.621 --> 00:25:26.370
There was so much.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:27.922
I was watching
the news everyday,

00:25:27.922 --> 00:25:29.130
which I suggest you don't do.

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.180
It was crazy.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.940
I know we're in New
York, but like, ah!

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.300
It was crazy.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.320
And I said, who am I to
go talk about self-love?

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.090
I have a book about
loving yourself.

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:42.330
How dare anyone focus
on them when there's

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.380
the world that needs saving?

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.890
And I caught myself
right away because I

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:49.130
said something that
actually helped me

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:54.750
in my own self-love experiment
is that suddenly it made sense.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.850
To stop hating myself is
to raise the vibration

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:00.660
on the planet.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.110
To stop being
negative to myself is

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:07.830
to actually do my part to
uplift the entire world.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.840
Because that's one
less person hurting,

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.990
that's one less person in pain,
and that's one less person

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.240
stuck in negativity.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:19.050
So we owe it to ourselves
to show up for ourselves

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:22.290
because from that place we
can do so much more good.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:24.130
We can give more
time, more energy,

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.520
more love to those who need it.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.280
And that was a
revolutionary change for me,

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.300
and it turned into a principle
in the Self-Love Experiment,

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:37.930
which is when you heal yourself,
you help to heal the world.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:41.760
You can make the most profound
difference in the world

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:46.170
by focusing on yourself
first, to forgive yourself,

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.240
to honor yourself,
and love yourself.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.450
From that place, you make
really empowered choices.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:52.230
Guess what?

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:55.470
Hurt people hurt people.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:59.190
People who are in pain
affect other people.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.710
When I was depressed, I
wanted to help people.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.160
I started my life
coaching practice.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.050
And it's hard to show
up fully when you're

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:07.970
stuck in your stuck-ness.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:09.005
You just can't.

00:27:09.005 --> 00:27:10.832
We do it because
we have big hearts.

00:27:10.832 --> 00:27:12.290
All of us in here
have huge hearts.

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.300
You wouldn't be in a
Self-Love Experiment lunch

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.190
if you didn't have a big heart.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.900
And so we show up and
we say, you know what?

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.360
I want to be even
more empowered,

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.420
and we do that by first
being kind and compassionate

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.050
to ourselves.

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.300
So I want to invite you
guys to ask yourself,

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.720
where have you been
blowing yourself off?

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.870
Where have you been saying
this deserves more attention?

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:34.730
I'm not going to show up for me.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:36.050
This is more important.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.602
I will skip that thing that
is really important to me.

00:27:39.602 --> 00:27:40.560
My dreams don't matter.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.170
I'll just wait.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.630
Just ask yourself and maybe
go into the weekend thinking

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.000
about how can I show
up for myself more,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.120
how can I be more
present in my life,

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.420
and put more love into
the equation right now.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.900
So I get to move into the
third reason a lot of us

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:01.696
actually do not feel self-love
without even realizing it.

00:28:01.696 --> 00:28:02.570
Anyone want to guess?

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:07.810
No guesses.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:08.710
I'll just share.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.860
Self-doubt and fear, right?

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.907
When we're in self-doubt--

00:28:13.907 --> 00:28:15.490
and what this looks
like is we believe

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:17.230
our insecurities are real.

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:21.640
We believe the problems about
us are actually the problem.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.960
So Tony Robbins.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.570
Do you guys know Tony
Robbins, America's life coach?

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:29.480
Huge motivational speaker,
that's what he calls himself.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.060
He says problems
need energy to grow.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.140
If you do not give your problems
energy, then guess what?

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:38.410
They won't manifest bigger and
take up so much time and space

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:39.800
in our life.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.500
What problem are
you focusing on?

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.630
Now there's a difference
between a problem

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.340
that you look for
the solution, right?

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.780
In your work, especially
with what you guys do here,

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.020
there's a part of showing
up but going immediately

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.690
to the solution
is the key instead

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:56.410
of festering in the problem
and letting it overcome you.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:29:00.820
So the problems that we have in
our life, the insecurities we

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:05.399
have, the fears we have,
often look like self-doubt.

00:29:05.399 --> 00:29:06.440
I don't feel good enough.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.565
I don't feel worthy enough.

00:29:07.565 --> 00:29:09.210
For me, I didn't feel lovable.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:12.130
And so ask yourself, what
self-doubt in your life

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.020
is blocking you
from moving forward?

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.860
So self-doubt-- here's
the thing about it.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.840
It shows up in every
layer of our life.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.630
So I am up here, and I
truly do love myself,

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:25.280
and I'm excited about
the possibilities.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.220
But self-doubt, a couple
of weeks ago before I

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.235
left for my tour,
came roaring in.

00:29:30.235 --> 00:29:33.152
A lot of what was
going on in the world.

00:29:33.152 --> 00:29:34.360
And I sat there for a moment.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.640
I said, what's going on?

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.700
This is like
crippling self-doubt.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.620
And for a couple
minutes, I sat there.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.150
Before my self-love
experiment, I

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.310
would have let it
control my outcome.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.410
I may have even
canceled some events.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.510
I may have just like
hidden in my bed

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:51.490
and covered up or eaten
lots of ice cream.

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.250
All these things we do--
overwork, overspend, overeat,

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:59.140
eat over-exercise-- we
"over" the situation.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.880
I invite you guys to
feel what comes up.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.849
So I sat there
with my self-doubt.

00:30:03.849 --> 00:30:05.890
And I'm going to invite
you guys to do this, too.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.560
Put your hand on your heart
if you want, the right hand.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.420
Any time you feel self-doubt
just return to yourself

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.200
in the moment.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.830
Put your hand here,
and you say, hello.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.360
Hello, you.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.290
And you can say, what
are you here to show me?

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.180
The same way that I
asked my depression

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.010
what are you here to show me.

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:32.180
And my self-doubt came through,
and it said, are you sure?

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.710
Are you sure you don't
want to stay small?

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:38.980
Because self-doubt
wants us to stay small.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.990
Fear and our
negative voice wants

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:44.410
us to retreat back to what is
comfortable and what we know.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:45.250
It's predictable.

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:46.880
It's manageable.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.120
It's something we know.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:53.350
Whereas any time you're growing,
any time you're dreaming,

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.570
and any time you're
stepping into the next level

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:59.350
of your life, your
self-doubt will get louder.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:02.860
And I said-- in that moment
with my hand on my heart--

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:07.260
quickly, it said, are you
sure you want to stay small?

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.480
And my heart roared through
and said, are you kidding?

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.070
You were born for this.

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:16.970
Every single one of
you was born for this,

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:21.110
to work through that self-doubt,
to step forward, and be

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:24.680
empowered and choose you.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:28.760
Your life is your masterpiece.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:29.629
We hear this, right?

00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:30.170
We hear this.

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.630
But I want you to
really feel this.

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:37.015
Any time you fall into fear,
insecurity, lack of self-worth,

00:31:37.015 --> 00:31:38.390
where I'm not good
enough, where,

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:42.410
gosh, that person has what I
want, return to right here.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.120
Put your hand on your heart.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:48.140
Say, I love me, or I'm doing
the best I can each day.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.880
And that is enough.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.040
One step at a time,
we can get there.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.770
And so what I offer to you
guys with this principle,

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:59.630
the Self-Love Experiment
principle number three,

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:02.590
is we get what we focus on.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.000
So are you focusing on how
it's not going to work?

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.890
How everything you've tried
before is not moving forward?

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:10.890
Then that's going to keep
creating what we want.

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:12.810
Are you focusing on the problem?

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:13.675
It's growing.

00:32:13.675 --> 00:32:15.300
Take your attention
off of it and focus

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.920
on what you truly want--

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.470
love, empowerment,
acceptance-- and you'll

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:22.480
start to see the results in
your life much more clear.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.420
So I'm going to
offer to you guys,

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:28.200
as we close out the little
speech here, my wish for you

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.560
is that next time someone
asks you who empowers you,

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.900
you immediately
say, you know what?

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.210
I'm empowered by me.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:40.120
And I'm not shy from that,
and I'm not unapologetic

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.390
because you guys are amazing.

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:44.620
You work really hard, and
you show up every day,

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.660
and you're doing
the best you can.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.520
So start telling yourself that.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.290
Start to really feel that.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:54.165
Because that's how we can move
and help and change the world.

00:32:54.165 --> 00:32:54.790
I believe that.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.860
So I welcome you and
invite you to dive

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.326
into the Self-Love Experiment.

00:32:59.326 --> 00:33:00.262
That's it.

00:33:00.262 --> 00:33:01.635
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:02.134 --> 00:33:03.070
Yeah!

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.006
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:33:04.006 --> 00:33:04.890
I like it.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.264
She's like ah!

00:33:07.264 --> 00:33:08.930
SPEAKER 1: That with
fantastic, Shannon.

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:10.550
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:11.400
What a great speech.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.650
What a great book, by the way.

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:16.590
If you guys haven't read
it, do yourself a favor.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:19.235
You talk a lot about
the inner critic,

00:33:19.235 --> 00:33:23.970
and I think that we can all
relate, especially being here.

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:26.940
We're very much, sometimes,
under a lot of pressure,

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:33.080
and there's a lot of production,
I think, that needs to happen.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.390
And you also talk a little
bit about how inner critic,

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.142
especially for you, led
to a lot of self-sabotage

00:33:38.142 --> 00:33:39.100
and so on and so forth.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.260
How do you think that
we, just in general

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:45.690
as a culture, or even
yourself, just sort

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.420
of experience self-sabotage?

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.269
And how does that come
through in our lives?

00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:51.310
SHANNON KAISER: I think--

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.810
yeah.

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:55.530
So self-sabotage
happens in so many ways.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:59.137
It happens by us shying away
from what we really want.

00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:00.720
Like I've mentioned
a couple of times,

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.070
I'm just a sweaty person.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:04.260
I could not-- I could have
chosen not to be a public

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:07.860
speaker, but I am so passionate
about my message that I let

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:09.101
that--

00:34:09.101 --> 00:34:10.690
it is what it is.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.139
So you get to a point
where you accept what is .

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:15.389
And when we shy
away from what it

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:18.810
is we really want
because of a part of us

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:20.760
that we feel isn't
good enough, it's

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.100
really us not honoring
or living our potential.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.580
And so it also looks like
overspending, like I said,

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.340
overeating, "over" anything
because a lot of times

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:32.070
we're afraid to feel
what's really there.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.570
So I would ask
also-- sometimes when

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.190
we wake up in the
morning, what do you

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:37.380
say to yourself about yourself?

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.429
If you don't do as good in
the meeting or if you don't--

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:42.179
you go home, and you
didn't get everything

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:44.850
on your list done, how are
you talking to yourself?

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:49.030
I think it does come back to
being a friend to yourself,

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.932
first and foremost, and that's
how we can step forward.

00:34:51.932 --> 00:34:52.845
SPEAKER 1: Excellent.

00:34:52.845 --> 00:34:53.720
SHANNON KAISER: Yeah.

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.636
SPEAKER 1: You state--

00:34:54.636 --> 00:34:56.750
and I'm going to read
a quote from the book--

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:59.300
"learning how to love me has
been the most difficult thing

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.997
I've ever had to do,
not because loving

00:35:01.997 --> 00:35:03.830
yourself is particularly
hard, but because I

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.140
had to unlearn all the
things I was conditioned

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.307
to believe about self-love."

00:35:07.307 --> 00:35:09.473
I think it goes back to
what you were saying earlier

00:35:09.473 --> 00:35:11.900
about narcissism or sort
of that label sometimes

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:15.650
when you think that self-love
is sort of a little bit

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.330
self-righteous.

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:18.350
How are those gr--

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.040
how those beliefs
sort of ingrained?

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.135
And how does that
reflect on what self-love

00:35:23.135 --> 00:35:25.424
or self-care means for us?

00:35:25.424 --> 00:35:26.340
SHANNON KAISER: Right.

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:28.640
I think that's key.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.810
It's like so many of us are kind
of like chasing the-- let me

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:33.650
see the--

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:34.790
this one, right?

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:35.420
Yeah.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:39.200
So we're chasing this
feeling, and that's really

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.150
what I was talking
about in the book.

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:43.280
Learning how to
love myself was hard

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:46.430
because if your parents
didn't love yourself,

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:48.200
they did the best they could.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.510
If society and the
media is always

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:52.760
telling us to change
ourselves, everyone's just

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.500
doing what they know how to do.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.602
But I had to
unlearn all of that.

00:35:57.602 --> 00:35:59.060
From a very young
age, we're taught

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.059
we have to look a certain
way, be a certain way,

00:36:01.059 --> 00:36:04.130
talk a certain way, in
our family or in society.

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:09.770
And so self-love is often about
being who you are as you are.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:11.470
And that is the most--

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.510
self-love is freedom.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.980
What we're chasing, what
we really want, is freedom.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.950
In that happiness, in
that paradise, in that job

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.230
that more money, in that
soul mate relationship,

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:24.780
what we really want is to
be seen for who we are.

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.600
So for me personally, I was--

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.620
so much of my life I was trying
to be seen, I was like looking,

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.960
I was like comparing
myself-- see me, see me--

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.617
but I wasn't seeing myself.

00:36:34.617 --> 00:36:36.200
And so I think we
have to really allow

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.690
ourselves to be
honest about who we

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:40.800
are and celebrate who we are.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.530
SPEAKER 1: Excellent Do
you regret your earlier

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:47.105
life of drug addiction or
eating disorders or depression?

00:36:47.105 --> 00:36:47.710
That's kind of a heavy question.

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:48.590
SHANNON KAISER: That's
a good question.

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:49.540
It's a heavy question, but--

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.380
SPEAKER 1: It's not a
good question for a work

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:51.500
environment, but you
know, it's Friday.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.161
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.190
SHANNON KAISER: I don't regret
any phase of my life at all.

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:56.770
In fact, I'm so thankful for it.

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:58.450
While I was in it,
it was very hard

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:00.850
and very depressing
and dark, but I

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:02.470
think we all have
phases in our life

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.550
that are hard,
depressing, and dark.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:06.490
And when we can be
aware while we're in it,

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.764
say that this is part of
maybe something bigger.

00:37:08.764 --> 00:37:10.180
Because looking
back I wouldn't be

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.710
able to write a
book about self-love

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.280
if I didn't hate myself.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.430
I wouldn't be able
to do what I love

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:17.020
if I didn't experience those.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.300
So I think it's
really about allowing

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:23.134
yourself to go through
each phase of life Yeah.

00:37:23.134 --> 00:37:25.330
SPEAKER 1: Does anybody
want to ask any questions

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:26.770
from the audience?

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.530
SHANNON KAISER: Q and A time.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.450
About anything in the world.

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:32.710
SPEAKER 1: Anything.

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:35.030
What are your plans
for the weekend?

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:37.727
SHANNON KAISER: How
are you doing joy?

00:37:37.727 --> 00:37:39.310
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:42.760
Thank you so much for sharing
your self-love experience.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:47.660
So the question is, you said,
accept yourself as you are.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:51.520
But to improve in anything
you do or as a person,

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.890
you need to constantly analyze
yourself or [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:57.010
your own critique.

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.060
How do you improve?

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.644
So how do you balance
both the things?

00:37:59.644 --> 00:38:01.518
SHANNON KAISER: That's
such a great question.

00:38:01.518 --> 00:38:03.160
I'm so glad you
asked that because I

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.280
think what we have to
ask ourselves is, where

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.860
is our point of attraction?

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:10.031
So from before, I was trying to
reach that number on the scale

00:38:10.031 --> 00:38:11.530
or we're trying to
improve ourselves

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:13.730
from a place of
self-hate, or desperation,

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:15.400
or I'm not good enough.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.200
But once I found
self-love, and when

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.210
you're in an
empowered place, that

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:21.989
means you can make the changes
from an empowered place.

00:38:21.989 --> 00:38:23.280
It doesn't mean we just settle.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.960
It doesn't mean we just
say, oh, forget it.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.700
I'm healthier and
happier than I've ever

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.920
been today making the
best choices for me,

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.340
even though society may say
an overweight person isn't

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:33.840
that way.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.640
So for you, and anyone
who's trying to improve,

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.450
it's about saying, I'm going to
do this because I love myself,

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:42.910
and I care about myself, and
I'm going to honor myself.

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:43.870
And then watch.

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.229
Your results come a lot faster.

00:38:46.229 --> 00:38:48.020
AUDIENCE: So in essence,
what you're saying

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.560
is anything that you do
should be inner driven and not

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.350
externally driven.

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:54.290
Somebody else shouldn't
be telling you.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:54.950
SHANNON KAISER: Absolutely.

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:55.449
Yeah.

00:38:55.449 --> 00:38:58.190
And I get that we have bosses
that need stuff from us.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:59.370
So you guys all walk out.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.411
You're like, Shannon says
that we don't have to--

00:39:01.411 --> 00:39:02.088
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:03.950
Don't do that.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:06.590
No, but I believe that
the internal-- the reason

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:08.089
we feel this anxiety
and this pain

00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:10.130
and, we go home feeling
like something's missing,

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:12.135
is because we're still
looking out there.

00:39:12.135 --> 00:39:14.510
Once we turn inward-- and
there's a process I take people

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:16.550
through in the book
to really align--

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:18.370
then yes, that's
exactly what I'm saying.

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:18.640
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:18.910
Thank you.

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:20.300
SHANNON KAISER: Yeah,
thank you for the question.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.091
I feel like we should
clap because of that.

00:39:22.091 --> 00:39:22.954
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:23.865 --> 00:39:24.740
Just for standing up.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.360
That takes courage.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.996
Any other questions?

00:39:28.996 --> 00:39:30.120
AUDIENCE: Hello, thank you.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:30.820
You did great.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.560
SHANNON KAISER: Thank you.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:36.700
AUDIENCE: So my
question is, as a child,

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.740
what did you see around
you that made you

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:42.782
start to lack that confidence?

00:39:42.782 --> 00:39:44.740
Like what were the
reinforcements in your life,

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.160
if it's not too personal?

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.400
Because I think sometimes
we pick up things children.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.410
I know you talked a
little bit about rejection

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:51.470
from the basketball team.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:57.396
But like at home was your
family not encouraging you?

00:39:57.396 --> 00:39:59.020
Your siblings, your
aunts, your uncles?

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.820
And I ask that because
I know that that's

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.350
been an experience
for me where it's

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:05.650
like I didn't get that
love reinforcement at home.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:06.900
And then I found out later--

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.970
well, the last few
years it dawned on me

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:11.680
like, yeah, my mom
didn't have it.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.212
Her parents weren't around.

00:40:13.212 --> 00:40:14.170
My aunt didn't have it.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:15.040
Her parents aren't around.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.600
You know, so was that
something you saw?

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.890
SHANNON KAISER: I think
it's a beautiful question.

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:18.440
Absolutely.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.189
And actually in the
book, I talk about it.

00:40:20.189 --> 00:40:21.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:21.990
SHANNON KAISER:
Yeah, if you want.

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:23.770
I talk about it,
too, because there's

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:25.252
a principle in the book.

00:40:25.252 --> 00:40:26.710
In order to find
self-love, we have

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:29.242
to be who we needed to
be when we were younger.

00:40:29.242 --> 00:40:30.200
Because for all of us--

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.840
I'm going to answer
this in a layered way--

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.881
if we get really clear
and honest with ourselves,

00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:36.190
from age like maybe
seven to nine,

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:38.170
usually something
happens, something

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:41.860
happens in every person's
life, where we are ourself,

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.290
we do what we feel is
natural, but the world

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:46.060
tells us that's wrong.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.960
So for me, I really
love ice cream.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.450
I loved it as a kid.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:52.330
It was fun, and it was part
of how I related to my dad

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:53.560
because he loved sweet stuff.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:56.170
But my mom would say, no,
don't eat the ice cream.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:57.070
Like, really bad.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:58.653
And so I saw the way
she looked at me,

00:40:58.653 --> 00:41:01.270
I saw the way she treated me
when I did what felt natural--

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:02.650
like I'm just
talking about food,

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:05.590
but there's other
situations in our life--

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:06.910
an I shied away.

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:09.340
So it turned into an eating
disorder at a very young age

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.830
where I'd have to hide
something that felt natural.

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:13.870
Now if she would have
said, OK, maybe you

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:15.860
can have a couple
bites, or something,

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:17.860
then maybe it wouldn't've
turned into me feeling

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.820
bad about doing what I want.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.120
So instead of
blaming our parents--

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.620
they do the best they could--

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.539
we, as adults, still feel
like there's a piece of us.

00:41:26.539 --> 00:41:28.580
Now there could-- maybe
it wasn't eating for you,

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:30.880
but maybe you wanted
to be a dancer,

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.280
and your parents wanted
you to be an athlete.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.990
Or maybe you wanted
to be an artist.

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:36.840
All these things that
we shy away from.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:40.150
So the point is as an
adult give yourself

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:43.174
what you needed as a
child that was missing.

00:41:43.174 --> 00:41:45.340
And there's a process I
take you through in the book

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.650
as well, which is
really healing.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:50.500
Because I realized I had a
great childhood very loving,

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:54.100
but I was bullied because I
was the new kid all the time,

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.520
and I would eat, and
overweight child.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.920
So wherever you were, go
back to your childhood.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.540
Go back to that point where
you first realized, oh my gosh,

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:04.248
I was just being me,
and the world said--

00:42:04.248 --> 00:42:06.400
I got made fun of for being me.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.850
And then give yourself, as an
adult, that love, that respect,

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:10.870
and attention.

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:12.700
And then forgive your
parents because they

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.940
do the best they can, and
they don't even know better.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.170
And we can do better for us.

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:18.670
Thank you.

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:19.180
Good question.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:19.700
Did that answer it?

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:20.325
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:20.325 --> 00:42:22.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:23.584 --> 00:42:25.250
SHANNON KAISER: Any
the other questions?

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:26.791
SPEAKER 1: Can you
give a bad answer?

00:42:26.791 --> 00:42:27.321
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.890
SHANNON KAISER: I can try.

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:33.229
SPEAKER 1: I just have
one more question.

00:42:33.229 --> 00:42:34.770
You talk a lot about
the tools, and I

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:38.150
love that you actually just
added more tools to what

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.640
you already talked about.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.390
What are your favorite
tools when it comes

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:42.765
to self-love or self-care?

00:42:42.765 --> 00:42:43.640
SHANNON KAISER: Yeah.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.348
That's beautiful.

00:42:44.348 --> 00:42:47.157
So I like the hand on the heart,
which I shared with you guys.

00:42:47.157 --> 00:42:49.490
But actually, one of the
beautiful things about the book

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:53.150
is I am really big
believer on asking yourself

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:55.760
questions and then giving your
time yourself time to answer.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.670
So I've put all the questions
I asked in the book in the back

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:00.830
in like a format so you
could do a joy journal

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:02.120
or free write on it.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.480
But one of my favorite favorites
is letters to yourself.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.950
So letters to your future self.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:10.447
When I was stuck in
depression, I had no idea

00:43:10.447 --> 00:43:12.530
that there was such thing
as a happy life, someone

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:14.400
who enjoyed their career.

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.580
And I was like,
dear future Shannon,

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:18.324
what message do you have for me?

00:43:18.324 --> 00:43:20.990
And so I encourage you guys to--
the one who has it figured out,

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:22.550
the one who's not suffering.

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:25.034
And then there's also a
letter to your past self.

00:43:25.034 --> 00:43:26.450
So now I write a
letter to the one

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.100
who was depressed
and stuck, and like,

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.300
oh, it's going to work out.

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.620
Just stay with it.

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.030
Don't give up.

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:35.570
Or the most challenging one
is letter to the part of you

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:36.920
that is struggling.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.070
So I said, dear overweight
body, why are you here?

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:41.750
What do you have to teach me?

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:45.110
And it's said, you are here to
love yourself no matter what.

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:47.660
I'm here to show you that
how you look-- self-love

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:48.540
is not how you look.

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:50.030
It's about how you live.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.550
So we can get profound answers
when we just allow ourselves

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:54.720
the space and time to go inward.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:55.220
Yeah.

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:56.534
Thank you.

00:43:56.534 --> 00:43:58.700
SPEAKER 1: Do you ever mail
the letters to yourself?

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.050
SHANNON KAISER: I should,
but I haven't yet.

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:01.490
That would be really fun.

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:03.980
I have crazy journals
piled up all over.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.094
SPEAKER 1: I did something
similar a few years ago

00:44:06.094 --> 00:44:08.510
when I was a yoga teacher, and
I had the whole class write

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:10.100
letters to their future selves.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:13.010
And they gave them to me, and
I held onto them for two years.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:15.100
And then I ended up
sending them the letters.

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:15.410
So it's fantastic.

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:16.380
SHANNON KAISER: That's special.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.350
You should all go home
today, write a letter,

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:19.235
and then mail it to yourself.

00:44:19.235 --> 00:44:19.620
Or give it to us.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.610
SPEAKER 1: Or give it to
someone you that you trust

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:23.540
and then have them mail
it to you at a later time.

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:23.660
SHANNON KAISER: It's really fun.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.650
SPEAKER 1: It's
actually fantastic.

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:25.970
SHANNON KAISER: And it's
about celebrating you,

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:27.053
and saying, you know what?

00:44:27.053 --> 00:44:29.660
Start saying you're
doing a good job.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.160
I appreciate you.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.630
We did good today.

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:34.730
We need to be our
own cheerleaders.

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:36.410
SPEAKER 1: Love it.

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:39.427
Any last questions
from the audience?

00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:40.760
SHANNON KAISER: Yes, come on up.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.502
Hi.

00:44:42.502 --> 00:44:44.460
AUDIENCE: I guess my
question is regarding your

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:46.620
if you touch on the book
at all on external love

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:50.190
and when that, I guess,
came back into your life,

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:53.126
or where you feel like
that balance comes.

00:44:53.126 --> 00:44:54.000
SHANNON KAISER: Yeah.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.800
Actually, that's beautiful.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.870
So a lot of the
work that I do is

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:00.142
about learning how to be
your own hero a lot of the--

00:45:00.142 --> 00:45:02.100
are you talking about
like maybe romantic love?

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:02.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:03.450
SHANNON KAISER: So for--

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:03.950
yes.

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:06.810
So there is a part in there, and
there's-- it's actually layered

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:08.100
throughout.

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:10.050
I don't have one
specific tool, but I

00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:13.240
will say that it's conducive on
when you truly love yourself,

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.480
you can bring the love into
your life that is really

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:17.520
long lasting and who
loves themselves, too.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.489
So I also think that
every relationship

00:45:19.489 --> 00:45:21.030
we're in, at every
stage of our life,

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:24.000
is an opportunity and
a teacher and a lesson.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.730
So every relationship
leading up to the soul mate

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:29.400
has become a profound
kind of helping me become

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.690
more of who I need to be.

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:32.340
And I think for
all of us as well.

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:34.380
But it is very much--

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.330
you come to relationships
from a place

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:40.680
of not needing them to fill
you up whereas you are full

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.810
and saying, I accept
myself and love myself,

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:44.395
and you are adding
to my life, and we

00:45:44.395 --> 00:45:46.390
are in this glorious
adventure together,

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:49.750
which is a beautiful
place to be.

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:50.830
Yeah.

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:52.510
I have a lot of
articles, too, on that.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:54.509
I write for Huffington
Post and Mind Body Green.

00:45:54.509 --> 00:45:56.722
So just type in
relationship Shannon Kaiser.
