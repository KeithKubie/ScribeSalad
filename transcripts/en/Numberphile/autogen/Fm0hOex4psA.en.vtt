your great-great great-great grandmother
 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.080
your great-great great-great grandmother
in more than one way which means you

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
in more than one way which means you
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.040
in more than one way which means you
don't have

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050
don't have
 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.100

that itself doesn't show that we're all
 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.170
that itself doesn't show that we're all
descended from royalty so we're going to

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180
descended from royalty so we're going to
 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.450
descended from royalty so we're going to
do a little experiment to show you the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460
do a little experiment to show you the
 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.070
do a little experiment to show you the
kind of idea because you could argue

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080
kind of idea because you could argue
 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.410

strand coming let's have a look at how
 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.820
strand coming let's have a look at how
we are all connected what I'm going to

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830
we are all connected what I'm going to
 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.580
we are all connected what I'm going to
do let's do a little experiment and I'm

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590
do let's do a little experiment and I'm
 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.570
do let's do a little experiment and I'm
gonna have a population of let's do a

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580
gonna have a population of let's do a
 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.300
gonna have a population of let's do a
simple thing six people now we're gonna

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310
simple thing six people now we're gonna
 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.640

work out who their parents are going to
be we're going to go back a generation

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360
be we're going to go back a generation
 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.300
be we're going to go back a generation
so we might go back a generation like

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310
so we might go back a generation like
 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.430
so we might go back a generation like
this three four five six fact I know I'm

that is nice let's go a few more
 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.439
that is nice let's go a few more
generations back so we've got five and

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:38.449
generations back so we've got five and
 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:40.510

six now this is the person here over

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520

the identical ancestors generation so

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930
the identical ancestors generation so
 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.960
the identical ancestors generation so
what happens at this point is either

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:33.970
what happens at this point is either
 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.879

you're related to everyone in the

what's going to happen so if we keep
 

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.390
what's going to happen so if we keep
going back we get to a point with the

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400
going back we get to a point with the
 

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.510
going back we get to a point with the
first common ancestor and then that kind

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.520
first common ancestor and then that kind
 

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.820
first common ancestor and then that kind
of increases as we go back and we get to

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:50.830
of increases as we go back and we get to
 

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.400

what I'm trying to illustrate here is to

00:08:27.659 --> 00:08:27.669
what I'm trying to illustrate here is to
 

00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:29.610
what I'm trying to illustrate here is to
show you that there will be a point

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:29.620
show you that there will be a point
 

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.710
show you that there will be a point
where we have identical ancestors and

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:31.720
where we have identical ancestors and
 

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.899
where we have identical ancestors and
also I think it's kind of surprisingly

00:08:33.899 --> 00:08:33.909
also I think it's kind of surprisingly
 

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:37.170
also I think it's kind of surprisingly
recent I mean we only had to go back one

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:37.180
recent I mean we only had to go back one
 

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.690
recent I mean we only had to go back one
to three generations to get our most

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:39.700
to three generations to get our most
 

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.240
to three generations to get our most
color our most recent common ancestor

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:42.250
color our most recent common ancestor
 

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.060
color our most recent common ancestor
and then I went back another four

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:45.070
and then I went back another four
 

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.430
and then I went back another four
generations and everyone was related to

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440
generations and everyone was related to
 

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:47.850
generations and everyone was related to
me

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:47.860
me
 

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.800
me
so the point I'm trying to make here is

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:49.810
so the point I'm trying to make here is
 

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.760
so the point I'm trying to make here is
it doesn't take a very long time for us

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:53.770
it doesn't take a very long time for us
 

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.030
it doesn't take a very long time for us
to be all related to the same ancestors

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040
to be all related to the same ancestors
 

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.970
to be all related to the same ancestors
now you were saying this is not true to

00:08:59.970 --> 00:08:59.980
now you were saying this is not true to
 

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.710
now you were saying this is not true to
life and I agree this is not true to

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:01.720
life and I agree this is not true to
 

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.610
life and I agree this is not true to
life because in this example I'm just as

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:05.620
life because in this example I'm just as
 

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.340
life because in this example I'm just as
likely to have two parents who are from

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:08.350
likely to have two parents who are from
 

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.559
likely to have two parents who are from
power

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:09.569
power
 

00:09:09.569 --> 00:09:11.689
power
as to have one parent from Iceland and

00:09:11.689 --> 00:09:11.699
as to have one parent from Iceland and
 

00:09:11.699 --> 00:09:14.419
as to have one parent from Iceland and
one parent from Australia which is not

00:09:14.419 --> 00:09:14.429
one parent from Australia which is not
 

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:16.910
one parent from Australia which is not
real life at all and there are other

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920
real life at all and there are other
 

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.009
real life at all and there are other
problems with this model we've got a

00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:19.019
problems with this model we've got a
 

00:09:19.019 --> 00:09:21.470
problems with this model we've got a
constant population as well we can talk

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:21.480
constant population as well we can talk
 

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.419
constant population as well we can talk
about that so it's not a growing

00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:23.429
about that so it's not a growing
 

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:25.400
about that so it's not a growing
population and also we had this strange

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:25.410
population and also we had this strange
 

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.040
population and also we had this strange
problem we had the virgin birth it came

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:28.050
problem we had the virgin birth it came
 

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.949
problem we had the virgin birth it came
up a few times well we've got we've got

00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959
up a few times well we've got we've got
 

00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:32.600
up a few times well we've got we've got
small numbers here if we were talking

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:32.610
small numbers here if we were talking
 

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.269
small numbers here if we were talking
about a population of millions then that

00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279
about a population of millions then that
 

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:36.980
about a population of millions then that
mean that's not going to happen so maybe

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:36.990
mean that's not going to happen so maybe
 

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.579
mean that's not going to happen so maybe
that would be more accurate

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:39.589
that would be more accurate
 

00:09:39.589 --> 00:09:42.650
that would be more accurate
yeah yeah if we just play with the model

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660
yeah yeah if we just play with the model
 

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.689
yeah yeah if we just play with the model
first there was a mathematician from

00:09:44.689 --> 00:09:44.699
first there was a mathematician from
 

00:09:44.699 --> 00:09:45.169
first there was a mathematician from
Yale

00:09:45.169 --> 00:09:45.179
Yale
 

00:09:45.179 --> 00:09:47.449
Yale
Joseph Chan who looked at this model and

00:09:47.449 --> 00:09:47.459
Joseph Chan who looked at this model and
 

00:09:47.459 --> 00:09:49.669
Joseph Chan who looked at this model and
he came up with a way to estimate when

00:09:49.669 --> 00:09:49.679
he came up with a way to estimate when
 

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:52.160
he came up with a way to estimate when
the most common recent ancestor would

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:52.170
the most common recent ancestor would
 

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.100
the most common recent ancestor would
turn up and then the identical ancestors

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.110
turn up and then the identical ancestors
 

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.009
turn up and then the identical ancestors
so our most recent common ancestor so

00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:58.019
so our most recent common ancestor so
 

00:09:58.019 --> 00:09:59.660
so our most recent common ancestor so
the estimate for working out that he

00:09:59.660 --> 00:09:59.670
the estimate for working out that he
 

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.879
the estimate for working out that he
called this TN so it's the number of

00:10:01.879 --> 00:10:01.889
called this TN so it's the number of
 

00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:04.100
called this TN so it's the number of
generations you need to go back based on

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:04.110
generations you need to go back based on
 

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.319
generations you need to go back based on
the population which is the end part of

00:10:06.319 --> 00:10:06.329
the population which is the end part of
 

00:10:06.329 --> 00:10:08.749
the population which is the end part of
this and he wrote it out to be when it's

00:10:08.749 --> 00:10:08.759
this and he wrote it out to be when it's
 

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:10.879
this and he wrote it out to be when it's
the solution to this formula 2 to the

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:10.889
the solution to this formula 2 to the
 

00:10:10.889 --> 00:10:14.480
the solution to this formula 2 to the
power TN equal to N and if you're

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:14.490
power TN equal to N and if you're
 

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.429
power TN equal to N and if you're
familiar with logarithms that's not too

00:10:16.429 --> 00:10:16.439
familiar with logarithms that's not too
 

00:10:16.439 --> 00:10:18.350
familiar with logarithms that's not too
hard then if you're happy with that kind

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360
hard then if you're happy with that kind
 

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.049
hard then if you're happy with that kind
of thing it would be this the logarithm

00:10:21.049 --> 00:10:21.059
of thing it would be this the logarithm
 

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:27.439
of thing it would be this the logarithm
to base 2 of n is the most recent common

00:10:27.439 --> 00:10:27.449
to base 2 of n is the most recent common
 

00:10:27.449 --> 00:10:31.340
to base 2 of n is the most recent common
ancestor generation in my example n was

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:31.350
ancestor generation in my example n was
 

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.739
ancestor generation in my example n was
6 it was to the population of 6 people

00:10:33.739 --> 00:10:33.749
6 it was to the population of 6 people
 

00:10:33.749 --> 00:10:36.710
6 it was to the population of 6 people
and so if I did that it would be log

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720
and so if I did that it would be log
 

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.889
and so if I did that it would be log
base 2 of 6 which is 2 point 5 8 so I'm

00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:42.899
base 2 of 6 which is 2 point 5 8 so I'm
 

00:10:42.899 --> 00:10:45.019
base 2 of 6 which is 2 point 5 8 so I'm
expecting this to happen three

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:45.029
expecting this to happen three
 

00:10:45.029 --> 00:10:46.789
expecting this to happen three
generations back I think that's exactly

00:10:46.789 --> 00:10:46.799
generations back I think that's exactly
 

00:10:46.799 --> 00:10:49.220
generations back I think that's exactly
what we got in our experiment three

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:49.230
what we got in our experiment three
 

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.230
what we got in our experiment three
generations back was the most recent

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240
generations back was the most recent
 

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.879
generations back was the most recent
common ancestor for the identical

00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:52.889
common ancestor for the identical
 

00:10:52.889 --> 00:10:55.340
common ancestor for the identical
ancestor generation Joseph Chang called

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:55.350
ancestor generation Joseph Chang called
 

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.280
ancestor generation Joseph Chang called
this U n and to work that out it's gonna

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:58.290
this U n and to work that out it's gonna
 

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.910
this U n and to work that out it's gonna
be equal to one point seven seven times

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920
be equal to one point seven seven times
 

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:07.730
be equal to one point seven seven times
TN my example then I know what TN is so

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:07.740
TN my example then I know what TN is so
 

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.579
TN my example then I know what TN is so
it's just one point seven seven x that

00:11:10.579 --> 00:11:10.589
it's just one point seven seven x that
 

00:11:10.589 --> 00:11:13.460
it's just one point seven seven x that
figure for what you've got which is four

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:13.470
figure for what you've got which is four
 

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.829
figure for what you've got which is four
point five eight so I think I was a bit

00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839
point five eight so I think I was a bit
 

00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:17.989
point five eight so I think I was a bit
unlucky with the example I did I think

00:11:17.989 --> 00:11:17.999
unlucky with the example I did I think
 

00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:20.360
unlucky with the example I did I think
it happened seven generations back but

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:20.370
it happened seven generations back but
 

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.680
it happened seven generations back but
you can see it was roundabout right

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:22.690
you can see it was roundabout right
 

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:25.590
you can see it was roundabout right
now you know what I'm going to ask you

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600
now you know what I'm going to ask you
 

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.900
now you know what I'm going to ask you
to do plug it in the population of the

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:27.910
to do plug it in the population of the
 

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.420
to do plug it in the population of the
world perfect exactly know we've talked

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:30.430
world perfect exactly know we've talked
 

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.360
world perfect exactly know we've talked
about the limits of this model right so

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:33.370
about the limits of this model right so
 

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.090
about the limits of this model right so
you need a freedom of movement or

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:36.100
you need a freedom of movement or
 

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.269
you need a freedom of movement or
freedom to move between social status so

00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279
freedom to move between social status so
 

00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:40.559
freedom to move between social status so
I'm just going to work on something a

00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:40.569
I'm just going to work on something a
 

00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:42.329
I'm just going to work on something a
bit smaller to start with we'll go up to

00:11:42.329 --> 00:11:42.339
bit smaller to start with we'll go up to
 

00:11:42.339 --> 00:11:44.730
bit smaller to start with we'll go up to
the world I'm coming to that and I'm

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:44.740
the world I'm coming to that and I'm
 

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.249
the world I'm coming to that and I'm
gonna work on the population of Europe

00:11:47.249 --> 00:11:47.259
gonna work on the population of Europe
 

00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:49.319
gonna work on the population of Europe
and maybe this is going too big itself

00:11:49.319 --> 00:11:49.329
and maybe this is going too big itself
 

00:11:49.329 --> 00:11:51.509
and maybe this is going too big itself
but let's say population of Europe let's

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519
but let's say population of Europe let's
 

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:53.069
but let's say population of Europe let's
imagine there was free movement in

00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:53.079
imagine there was free movement in
 

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:59.280
imagine there was free movement in
Europe so so what is the population of

00:11:59.280 --> 00:11:59.290
Europe so so what is the population of
 

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.980
Europe so so what is the population of
Europe I know this it's seven hundred

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:01.990
Europe I know this it's seven hundred
 

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.619
Europe I know this it's seven hundred
and forty million as the current

00:12:04.619 --> 00:12:04.629
and forty million as the current
 

00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:07.019
and forty million as the current
population okay let's go back to our

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:07.029
population okay let's go back to our
 

00:12:07.029 --> 00:12:09.929
population okay let's go back to our
most recent common ancestor well just

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:09.939
most recent common ancestor well just
 

00:12:09.939 --> 00:12:13.280
most recent common ancestor well just
put in that figure it's going to be

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:13.290
put in that figure it's going to be
 

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.189
put in that figure it's going to be
twenty nine point five generations I

00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199
twenty nine point five generations I
 

00:12:17.199 --> 00:12:20.400
twenty nine point five generations I
used and the current population of

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:20.410
used and the current population of
 

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.509
used and the current population of
Europe to work on out yeah thirty

00:12:24.509 --> 00:12:24.519
Europe to work on out yeah thirty
 

00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:26.340
Europe to work on out yeah thirty
generations back yeah I reckon that's

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:26.350
generations back yeah I reckon that's
 

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.530
generations back yeah I reckon that's
about nine hundred thousand years ago I

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:28.540
about nine hundred thousand years ago I
 

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.670
about nine hundred thousand years ago I
think we can have a more accurate answer

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680
think we can have a more accurate answer
 

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.309
think we can have a more accurate answer
for this because remember my model had a

00:12:32.309 --> 00:12:32.319
for this because remember my model had a
 

00:12:32.319 --> 00:12:35.280
for this because remember my model had a
stable population it wasn't a growing

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:35.290
stable population it wasn't a growing
 

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.639
stable population it wasn't a growing
population if we want to study a growing

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:38.649
population if we want to study a growing
 

00:12:38.649 --> 00:12:42.389
population if we want to study a growing
population we should use a figure for

00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399
population we should use a figure for
 

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:44.850
population we should use a figure for
the population at the time of the most

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:44.860
the population at the time of the most
 

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.009
the population at the time of the most
recent common ancestor know what that

00:12:47.009 --> 00:12:47.019
recent common ancestor know what that
 

00:12:47.019 --> 00:12:49.470
recent common ancestor know what that
would do it now I know it's going to be

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:49.480
would do it now I know it's going to be
 

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.600
would do it now I know it's going to be
about a thousand years ago so now I can

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:51.610
about a thousand years ago so now I can
 

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.490
about a thousand years ago so now I can
sort of use that figure and get a

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:53.500
sort of use that figure and get a
 

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.139
sort of use that figure and get a
slightly more accurate answer for this

00:12:55.139 --> 00:12:55.149
slightly more accurate answer for this
 

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:57.629
slightly more accurate answer for this
so I'm going to do that go a thousand

00:12:57.629 --> 00:12:57.639
so I'm going to do that go a thousand
 

00:12:57.639 --> 00:13:00.329
so I'm going to do that go a thousand
years back and the population of Europe

00:13:00.329 --> 00:13:00.339
years back and the population of Europe
 

00:13:00.339 --> 00:13:02.850
years back and the population of Europe
was about 65 million so it's log base

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:02.860
was about 65 million so it's log base
 

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.990
was about 65 million so it's log base
two of 65 million this is the sword of

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.000
two of 65 million this is the sword of
 

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.809
two of 65 million this is the sword of
and so I'm expecting and that would be

00:13:09.809 --> 00:13:09.819
and so I'm expecting and that would be
 

00:13:09.819 --> 00:13:13.199
and so I'm expecting and that would be
about twenty five point nine generations

00:13:13.199 --> 00:13:13.209
about twenty five point nine generations
 

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.179
about twenty five point nine generations
about so twenty six generations back

00:13:15.179 --> 00:13:15.189
about so twenty six generations back
 

00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:17.220
about so twenty six generations back
yeah nine hundred years ago something

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:17.230
yeah nine hundred years ago something
 

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.079
yeah nine hundred years ago something
eight hundred years ago something like

00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:19.089
eight hundred years ago something like
 

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:22.710
eight hundred years ago something like
that and then our identical ancestors

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720
that and then our identical ancestors
 

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.019
that and then our identical ancestors
how far do we have to go back this means

00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:25.029
how far do we have to go back this means
 

00:13:25.029 --> 00:13:28.290
how far do we have to go back this means
everyone in Europe Oh No there are

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:28.300
everyone in Europe Oh No there are
 

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.699
everyone in Europe Oh No there are
things you can argue about this we're

00:13:29.699 --> 00:13:29.709
things you can argue about this we're
 

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:31.769
things you can argue about this we're
doing this for fun everyone in Europe

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:31.779
doing this for fun everyone in Europe
 

00:13:31.779 --> 00:13:34.679
doing this for fun everyone in Europe
would be descended from this generation

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:34.689
would be descended from this generation
 

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:36.360
would be descended from this generation
from everyone who was alive

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:36.370
from everyone who was alive
 

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.040
from everyone who was alive
at this generation if they survived at

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.050
at this generation if they survived at
 

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.740
at this generation if they survived at
all if there's if their family tree did

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:40.750
all if there's if their family tree did
 

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.690
all if there's if their family tree did
not die out so presumably that would

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:42.700
not die out so presumably that would
 

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.850
not die out so presumably that would
include your Royals and including the

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:44.860
include your Royals and including the
 

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.460
include your Royals and including the
Royals exactly so the royal families

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:47.470
Royals exactly so the royal families
 

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.920
Royals exactly so the royal families
survive because we can trace their tree

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:49.930
survive because we can trace their tree
 

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.320
survive because we can trace their tree
we can trace their family tree back so

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:52.330
we can trace their family tree back so
 

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.600
we can trace their family tree back so
therefore any royal family should be

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:54.610
therefore any royal family should be
 

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.880
therefore any royal family should be
related to all of us and what generation

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:56.890
related to all of us and what generation
 

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:01.380
related to all of us and what generation
is that and so it was UN in this system

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:01.390
is that and so it was UN in this system
 

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.380
is that and so it was UN in this system
which was one point seven seven times

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:04.390
which was one point seven seven times
 

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.329
which was one point seven seven times
I'm gonna use that figure

00:14:06.329 --> 00:14:06.339
I'm gonna use that figure
 

00:14:06.339 --> 00:14:08.519
I'm gonna use that figure
twenty six isn't it really twenty five

00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:08.529
twenty six isn't it really twenty five
 

00:14:08.529 --> 00:14:12.269
twenty six isn't it really twenty five
point nine and that generation forty

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:12.279
point nine and that generation forty
 

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:14.460
point nine and that generation forty
five point nine so about forty six

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:14.470
five point nine so about forty six
 

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.130
five point nine so about forty six
generations ago so I'm thinking that's

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:17.140
generations ago so I'm thinking that's
 

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.280
generations ago so I'm thinking that's
about one thousand three hundred years

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:20.290
about one thousand three hundred years
 

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.829
about one thousand three hundred years
ago something like that so who was King

00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:22.839
ago something like that so who was King
 

00:14:22.839 --> 00:14:24.840
ago something like that so who was King
one thousand three hundred years ago it

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:24.850
one thousand three hundred years ago it
 

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.210
one thousand three hundred years ago it
was Charles the great or Charlemagne

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:27.220
was Charles the great or Charlemagne
 

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.100
was Charles the great or Charlemagne
he's those are known as he ruled over

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.110
he's those are known as he ruled over
 

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.620
he's those are known as he ruled over
what remained of the Roman Empire and

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:31.630
what remained of the Roman Empire and
 

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.920
what remained of the Roman Empire and
then his kids kind of broke up Europe to

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:34.930
then his kids kind of broke up Europe to
 

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.470
then his kids kind of broke up Europe to
become the current royal families of

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:37.480
become the current royal families of
 

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.930
become the current royal families of
Europe and we can chase that trace that

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:39.940
Europe and we can chase that trace that
 

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.270
Europe and we can chase that trace that
family tree down to the current royal

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:42.280
family tree down to the current royal
 

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:47.060
family tree down to the current royal
family that means that everyone who has

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:47.070
family that means that everyone who has
 

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.370
family that means that everyone who has
European ancestry alive in the present

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:50.380
European ancestry alive in the present
 

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.450
European ancestry alive in the present
day is a direct descendant of

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:53.460
day is a direct descendant of
 

00:14:53.460 --> 00:15:00.240
day is a direct descendant of
Charlemagne no nice not necessarily

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:00.250
Charlemagne no nice not necessarily
 

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.460
Charlemagne no nice not necessarily
Edward the third so if we went back to

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:02.470
Edward the third so if we went back to
 

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.320
Edward the third so if we went back to
our most recent common ancestor well

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:04.330
our most recent common ancestor well
 

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:05.970
our most recent common ancestor well
that's nine hundred years ago something

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:05.980
that's nine hundred years ago something
 

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.510
that's nine hundred years ago something
like that and we don't know who that is

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:08.520
like that and we don't know who that is
 

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.970
like that and we don't know who that is
you know that could be a peasant or

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:10.980
you know that could be a peasant or
 

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.800
you know that could be a peasant or
royalty or so unknown in between we

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:13.810
royalty or so unknown in between we
 

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.690
royalty or so unknown in between we
don't know who that person is but we do

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:15.700
don't know who that person is but we do
 

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.610
don't know who that person is but we do
know that there is a point where we

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:17.620
know that there is a point where we
 

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.520
know that there is a point where we
related to everyone about 1300 years ago

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:20.530
related to everyone about 1300 years ago
 

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.170
related to everyone about 1300 years ago
wouldn't it be great to go back in time

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:22.180
wouldn't it be great to go back in time
 

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.880
wouldn't it be great to go back in time
and tell that person of their special

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:23.890
and tell that person of their special
 

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.460
and tell that person of their special
role so we'll think of it this way play

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:26.470
role so we'll think of it this way play
 

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.520
role so we'll think of it this way play
this forwards everyone alive today if

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:29.530
this forwards everyone alive today if
 

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:32.490
this forwards everyone alive today if
their family tree survives will be

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:32.500
their family tree survives will be
 

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.660
their family tree survives will be
related to that generation in 1,000

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:36.670
related to that generation in 1,000
 

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.750
related to that generation in 1,000
years time and a direct descendant or

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:39.760
years time and a direct descendant or
 

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.850
years time and a direct descendant or
there's a direct ancestor to that

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:41.860
there's a direct ancestor to that
 

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.280
there's a direct ancestor to that
generation and now I was talking about

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:44.290
generation and now I was talking about
 

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:45.780
generation and now I was talking about
Europe there because just to keep it

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:45.790
Europe there because just to keep it
 

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.400
Europe there because just to keep it
kind of contained so you could do this

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:47.410
kind of contained so you could do this
 

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.370
kind of contained so you could do this
for Asia and Africa and you'd have the

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:50.380
for Asia and Africa and you'd have the
 

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.260
for Asia and Africa and you'd have the
pablor me you'd have the equivalent of a

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:52.270
pablor me you'd have the equivalent of a
 

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.329
pablor me you'd have the equivalent of a
royal family you asked me about the

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:54.339
royal family you asked me about the
 

00:15:54.339 --> 00:15:56.760
royal family you asked me about the
world and that becomes more complicated

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:56.770
world and that becomes more complicated
 

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.620
world and that becomes more complicated
because that's not free movement and so

00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:58.630
because that's not free movement and so
 

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.150
because that's not free movement and so
this is what they did they broke up the

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160
this is what they did they broke up the
 

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.670
this is what they did they broke up the
world into continents into countries

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:02.680
world into continents into countries
 

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:07.290
world into continents into countries
into towns they looked at historical

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:07.300
into towns they looked at historical
 

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.519
into towns they looked at historical
data so they could look at the

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:08.529
data so they could look at the
 

00:16:08.529 --> 00:16:11.060
data so they could look at the
populations based on historical records

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:11.070
populations based on historical records
 

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.579
populations based on historical records
they looked at migration rates from

00:16:14.579 --> 00:16:14.589
they looked at migration rates from
 

00:16:14.589 --> 00:16:16.560
they looked at migration rates from

continent and then to see what is the
 

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.220

generation that contains our most recent

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:23.230
generation that contains our most recent
 

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.410
generation that contains our most recent
common ancestor what is the identical

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:25.420
common ancestor what is the identical
 

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.570
common ancestor what is the identical
ancestor generation now the problem with

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:27.580
ancestor generation now the problem with
 

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.700
ancestor generation now the problem with
this model is the migration rates and

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:29.710
this model is the migration rates and
 

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.130
this model is the migration rates and
the populations our historical record

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:32.140
the populations our historical record
 

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.990
the populations our historical record
we've got things for that and the

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000
we've got things for that and the
 

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.760
we've got things for that and the
migration rates we don't have figures

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:35.770
migration rates we don't have figures
 

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.829
migration rates we don't have figures
for that so you kind of have to guess

00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839
for that so you kind of have to guess
 

00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:39.630
for that so you kind of have to guess
and see what happened our most recent

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:39.640
and see what happened our most recent
 

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.910
and see what happened our most recent
common ancestor could be anywhere from

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920
common ancestor could be anywhere from
 

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.740
common ancestor could be anywhere from
five hundred years ago

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:43.750
five hundred years ago

this for the world to three thousand

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:46.450
this for the world to three thousand
 

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.840
this for the world to three thousand
years ago so somewhere between that it

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:48.850
years ago so somewhere between that it
 

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:50.519
years ago so somewhere between that it
turns out in their model that person

00:16:50.519 --> 00:16:50.529
turns out in their model that person
 

00:16:50.529 --> 00:16:53.970
turns out in their model that person

the way East Asia is connected to the
 

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.350
the way East Asia is connected to the
rest of the world and then the identical

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:58.360
rest of the world and then the identical
 

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.019
rest of the world and then the identical
ancestor population was somewhere

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:01.029
ancestor population was somewhere
 

00:17:01.029 --> 00:17:03.510
ancestor population was somewhere
between four thousand years ago and

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:03.520
between four thousand years ago and
 

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.919
between four thousand years ago and
seven thousand years ago which is

00:17:06.919 --> 00:17:06.929
seven thousand years ago which is
 

00:17:06.929 --> 00:17:10.290
seven thousand years ago which is
relatively recent if we consider this

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:10.300
