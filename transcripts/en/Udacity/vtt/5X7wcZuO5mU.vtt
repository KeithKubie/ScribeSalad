00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.360
OK so we had a request line that looks something like

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.606
this. It is followed by a number of headers. Headers have

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:11.930
this format, Name: space value. Let's add some headers. When you

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.750
make a request, all of this is sent at once, the request

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.544
line followed by a number of headers. These aren't the only

00:00:17.544 --> 00:00:19.798
headers that are sent but these are some of the more popular

00:00:19.798 --> 00:00:22.290
ones. The first one is called Host, and this is from

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.720
the URL. This is the host part of the URL. It's required

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.760
in HTTP/1.1. It's not strictly required in 1.0. But why

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.080
is this useful? We're already connecting to the machine. So

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.270
why do we need to say what the host is again? It would be like if you came up to

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.700
me and said, Steve, what is your name? Obviously, you

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.580
already know my name. So why are you asking? Well,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.680
it's because web servers may have multiple names. One, one

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.150
machine, one web server, can host the website for many websites.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.140
For example, with udacity.com, which is hosted on

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.600
Google's app engine, each of those machines host many

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.890
websites. So, we need to say which website we're

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.360
requesting a document for. The next header, this one

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.320
is called User-Agent. This describes basically what, who

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.270
is making the request. This is generally your browser.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.532
Your browser put its name in there and there's

00:01:13.532 --> 00:01:16.920
also some, some version info and things like that.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.360
And this is really helpful for the servers so

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.140
they know what type of machine is making a request.
