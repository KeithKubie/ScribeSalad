00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:15.471
- Our next speaker

00:00:16.674 --> 00:00:21.240
is gonna talk about Complementary
and Integrative Therapies

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.758
for autism and this is Dr. Robert Hendren.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:27.141
Dr. Hendren has been a
speaker at the conference

00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:28.930
in the past and

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.362
always

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:31.387
does a great job.

00:00:31.387 --> 00:00:34.416
He's a professor of psychiatry
and behavioral science,

00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:37.077
the division of child
and adolescent psychiatry

00:00:37.077 --> 00:00:41.778
and co-director of the UCSF
Dyslexia and Director of Program

00:00:41.778 --> 00:00:44.872
of Research on
Neurodevelopmental, Translational,

00:00:44.872 --> 00:00:48.970
Outcomes Research program, called PRONTO.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.043
He is currently applying a
targeted outcomes research

00:00:52.043 --> 00:00:53.787
approach and collaborative projects

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:57.298
with the Oak Hill School
for Youth with Severe Autism

00:00:57.298 --> 00:00:59.720
and Neurodevelopmental Spectrum Disorders

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.597
in San Anselmo, California

00:01:02.597 --> 00:01:05.774
and at the Charles Armstrong
School for Youth with Dyslexia

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:07.199
in Belmont, California,

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:09.921
and we're very happy to
have him here with us today.

00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:11.601
Dr. Hendren.

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:14.601
(audience applause)

00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:16.379
- Thank you.

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:17.470
Thanks.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.472
It's a

00:01:18.472 --> 00:01:20.366
you know, the highest
complement you can get

00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:23.195
is to be invited back and I
think this is my third or fourth

00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:27.345
time and it's a great
conference to be a part of.

00:01:27.345 --> 00:01:29.363
I think I first came here
many, many years ago when I was

00:01:29.363 --> 00:01:33.079
at the MIND Institute, and now
at UCSF, and it's been nice

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.558
to follow the progress

00:01:34.558 --> 00:01:36.526
of this as we go along.

00:01:36.526 --> 00:01:37.359
I

00:01:38.748 --> 00:01:40.998
I'm going to go, follow the

00:01:41.858 --> 00:01:45.087
the style of Dr. Sherr and
Dr. Leventhal, which is to go

00:01:45.087 --> 00:01:46.254
fairly quickly.

00:01:46.254 --> 00:01:49.652
You have slides in your books,
and for some of the things

00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:50.864
that

00:01:50.864 --> 00:01:53.416
have a lot of material, you could

00:01:53.416 --> 00:01:56.197
look at that in more detail, so that we'll

00:01:56.197 --> 00:01:58.976
cover a fair amount of
material as we go along.

00:01:58.976 --> 00:01:59.809
I

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.565
do a number of studies,

00:02:02.565 --> 00:02:04.855
I'm the consultant for different places,

00:02:04.855 --> 00:02:07.182
most of those are not
things that we'll be talking

00:02:07.182 --> 00:02:08.864
about today, but just to be sure

00:02:08.864 --> 00:02:10.609
that I've disclosed everything.

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:11.609
There it is.

00:02:13.056 --> 00:02:15.634
We're gonna talk a bit
about the definitions of

00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:18.148
what is now increasingly
called complementary

00:02:18.148 --> 00:02:21.361
and integrative medicine, but
historically has been called

00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:24.536
CAM or complementary and
alternative medicine.

00:02:24.536 --> 00:02:27.111
Talk about models for understanding this,

00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:30.345
in terms of a potential
mechanism of action,

00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:34.189
review several promising
biomedical or CAM treatments

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.994
that seem relevant and
the evidence for those

00:02:36.994 --> 00:02:38.015
and

00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:41.598
when we might consider using them.

00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:45.044
Key points that I hope you'll
come away with are that

00:02:45.044 --> 00:02:48.225
families commonly seek
complementary and integrative

00:02:48.225 --> 00:02:52.261
medicine treatments, whether
you know about it or not.

00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:53.428
Families often

00:02:54.277 --> 00:02:56.574
will see two different practitioners,

00:02:56.574 --> 00:02:59.409
one traditional, one more

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.487
integrative or complimentary

00:03:01.487 --> 00:03:03.242
and they may not tell each other

00:03:03.242 --> 00:03:06.299
for fear that there would be

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.027
criticism of their doing that and then

00:03:09.027 --> 00:03:11.976
you don't know fully what's
happening with your patient.

00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:14.075
So it's important to

00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:16.876
be open and we'll talk
about some brief guidelines

00:03:16.876 --> 00:03:18.126
for doing that.

00:03:19.582 --> 00:03:22.177
We'll talk a bit about the
rationale for some of these

00:03:22.177 --> 00:03:25.173
treatments and their
potential benefits and that's

00:03:25.173 --> 00:03:27.138
what really is most important for me.

00:03:27.138 --> 00:03:29.900
There's a number of different ideas that

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.205
range from really wild to having some

00:03:32.205 --> 00:03:33.909
good rationale.

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.844
While there may not be good evidence,

00:03:35.844 --> 00:03:37.316
if there's rationale I think it's worth

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:40.882
thinking about and considering
and working with parents

00:03:40.882 --> 00:03:43.634
to think in those same ways.

00:03:43.634 --> 00:03:48.229
Actually, four agents, 'cause
I added one just last week.

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.050
That have a rationale for
use with neurodevelopmental

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.968
disorders and at least one
randomized control trial showing

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:59.587
efficacy and safety include
melatonin, Omega-3s,

00:03:59.587 --> 00:04:01.209
folate and folate was the one that

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.369
was added a couple weeks ago,

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:05.241
and micronutrients.

00:04:05.241 --> 00:04:06.295
Those that

00:04:06.295 --> 00:04:09.563
seem to show some promise
are things like NAC,

00:04:09.563 --> 00:04:12.513
methylcobalamin, and digestive
enzymes and we'll talk

00:04:12.513 --> 00:04:16.047
about all of those as we
get toward the latter part

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.547
of the talk today.

00:04:19.502 --> 00:04:22.865
CAM has been defined as a
group of diverse medical

00:04:22.865 --> 00:04:25.611
and health care systems,
practices, and product that are not

00:04:25.611 --> 00:04:29.858
generally considered to be
part of conventional medicine.

00:04:29.858 --> 00:04:32.812
I think that's gradually changing.

00:04:32.812 --> 00:04:36.214
We used to think that CAM was
something that people would do

00:04:36.214 --> 00:04:38.463
when they didn't want to
do what really worked,

00:04:38.463 --> 00:04:40.940
or when they wanted to avoid things

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.031
that might have side-effects
but there wasn't

00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:45.311
a good rationale for using them.

00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:48.371
But increasingly, there's
starting to be a rationale

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:51.792
and people are starting to say
"maybe there's ways that we

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:55.332
"can improve the body's
resilience, that we can improve

00:04:55.332 --> 00:04:58.437
"the epigenetic processes"
and we'll talk about those

00:04:58.437 --> 00:04:59.654
as we go through it.

00:04:59.654 --> 00:05:02.290
Those ways that we can help

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.648
the body be healthier, rather
than trying to just stomp

00:05:05.648 --> 00:05:07.133
out the side,

00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:09.128
the associated symptom

00:05:09.128 --> 00:05:11.276
that we want to get rid of.

00:05:11.276 --> 00:05:14.071
12% of children in the
U.S. use complementary

00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:18.016
and alternative medicines;
up to 74% of those recently

00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:21.009
diagnosed with autism use CAM.

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.917
The reason, the main reason, are for

00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:27.471
concerns about safety,
side effects, and those

00:05:27.471 --> 00:05:30.304
from prescribed medications.

00:05:32.053 --> 00:05:32.886
The

00:05:34.388 --> 00:05:35.221
wrong way

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.940
In talking with families
about biomedical treatments,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.368
it's important to try
to maintain an open mind

00:05:43.368 --> 00:05:46.318
and to say to people, tell me,
what else are you considering

00:05:46.318 --> 00:05:47.213
using?

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:48.880
What else do you do?

00:05:49.772 --> 00:05:53.160
And, without necessarily
being critical, use that

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.012
as an opportunity to instruct them

00:05:55.012 --> 00:05:57.647
in how to review the
literature, how to think

00:05:57.647 --> 00:05:59.897
about mechanisms of action.

00:06:01.114 --> 00:06:02.972
And when they still stay

00:06:02.972 --> 00:06:06.811
really pretty serious about
saying they want to try this,

00:06:06.811 --> 00:06:09.233
try to have a way that you

00:06:09.233 --> 00:06:11.482
at least make sure they're
seeing somebody that you think

00:06:11.482 --> 00:06:15.021
is reputable and that you
can have some kind of a

00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:16.521
relationship with.

00:06:17.447 --> 00:06:19.780
A number of years ago, a guy

00:06:20.788 --> 00:06:24.639
who is a neurologist trained
at Hopkins, who has daughter

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:25.889
who had autism,

00:06:27.464 --> 00:06:31.244
came to visit me at the MIND
Institute and we talked.

00:06:31.244 --> 00:06:33.079
Talked about what things has he tried?

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:35.294
And we tried all the conventional things,

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:37.417
we went through those, then
we started going through

00:06:37.417 --> 00:06:40.252
alternative things and then
I said have you ever tried

00:06:40.252 --> 00:06:41.798
chelation?

00:06:41.798 --> 00:06:43.215
He said, yes.

00:06:43.215 --> 00:06:45.753
And I said, I don't believe
that, Jonathan, how could you

00:06:45.753 --> 00:06:48.037
try chelation for your daughter?

00:06:48.037 --> 00:06:52.662
And he said to me, in a way
that I'll just never forget,

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:57.242
he said, "You know, Bob, my
little girl, Hannah, has autism

00:06:57.242 --> 00:06:59.908
"and nothing that I've used is working.

00:06:59.908 --> 00:07:02.940
"So I'm gonna try everything
that might be able to work

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.555
"so that I'm sure that
I didn't miss something.

00:07:05.555 --> 00:07:08.861
"And I'm doing it in a thoughtful
way, and in a careful way,

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:12.428
"but I want to be sure I
haven't missed anything."

00:07:12.428 --> 00:07:16.030
You might know Hannah by her
name, because she was the one

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.530
child that first won in vaccine court, for

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:24.633
her father, Jonathan, having taken her,

00:07:24.633 --> 00:07:26.250
saying that she had

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.826
11 vaccines at one time and
developed autism afterwards

00:07:29.826 --> 00:07:32.770
and the vaccine court gave
him a couple million dollars.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.937
Not that that makes a point,
except the point is that

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:41.329
this man, Jonathan, was out
to try everything that might

00:07:41.329 --> 00:07:43.815
help his daughter and wanted
to be sure that that was

00:07:43.815 --> 00:07:46.927
being done and so I think
if we can understand that

00:07:46.927 --> 00:07:50.159
for parents and try and help
them learn to think wisely,

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:52.428
we can make a difference in helping them

00:07:52.428 --> 00:07:54.209
make good decisions.

00:07:54.209 --> 00:07:56.781
I'm gonna go through a whole
series of all the things

00:07:56.781 --> 00:08:00.399
that are listed as complementary
and integrative treatments.

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:03.326
There's a website that is on ARI,

00:08:03.326 --> 00:08:07.828
the Autism Research Institute,
and if you just Google that,

00:08:07.828 --> 00:08:11.209
ARI or Autism Research Institute,
you'll find that they have

00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:13.504
a survey that parents have filled out

00:08:13.504 --> 00:08:16.604
with a whole series of
things that they've tried

00:08:16.604 --> 00:08:19.293
and they go through rating what
things they thought helped,

00:08:19.293 --> 00:08:21.412
what things they thought didn't help,

00:08:21.412 --> 00:08:24.052
and it includes conventional medications

00:08:24.052 --> 00:08:26.305
and it includes these

00:08:26.305 --> 00:08:29.574
more complementary and
alternative or integrated kinds

00:08:29.574 --> 00:08:30.778
of treatments.

00:08:30.778 --> 00:08:34.382
But you can see the
medications go from things like

00:08:34.382 --> 00:08:38.949
diabetic agents, some that
affect purine metabolism,

00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:42.414
there are things that will affect fungus,

00:08:42.414 --> 00:08:44.747
viral, antivirals,

00:08:45.635 --> 00:08:49.916
a variety of non-biologic
treatments as well

00:08:49.916 --> 00:08:53.419
that can affect the way the
body functions or works.

00:08:53.419 --> 00:08:57.518
Co-Q10, that might be helpful
for mitochondrial function.

00:08:57.518 --> 00:09:00.101
Craniosacral therapy, curcumin,

00:09:01.718 --> 00:09:04.641
digestive enzymes and we'll
talk about some of these,

00:09:04.641 --> 00:09:08.481
but many of them have no
evidence other than anecdotal

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:12.108
evidence that parents filled
out on this form saying

00:09:12.108 --> 00:09:13.578
that they thought that
it made a difference

00:09:13.578 --> 00:09:14.911
for their child.

00:09:15.921 --> 00:09:16.754
And

00:09:16.754 --> 00:09:18.389
the list does go on

00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:20.292
with things that have

00:09:20.292 --> 00:09:23.453
not shown good evidence,
like hyperbaric oxygen,

00:09:23.453 --> 00:09:25.453
some that have shown

00:09:25.453 --> 00:09:28.808
evidence in certain
cases like L-carnosine,

00:09:28.808 --> 00:09:32.058
methyl B12, NAC, naltrexone,

00:09:34.423 --> 00:09:36.840
low oxalate diet, probiotics,

00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:43.444
and going through a variety of vitamins.

00:09:43.444 --> 00:09:47.014
When I started, when I was
first being interviewed to be

00:09:47.014 --> 00:09:49.241
the executive director
at the MIND Institute,

00:09:49.241 --> 00:09:51.562
I was interviewed by four
parents who had started

00:09:51.562 --> 00:09:54.501
the MIND Institute and raised,
over the time that we were

00:09:54.501 --> 00:09:57.153
together, at the beginning, $100 million.

00:09:57.153 --> 00:09:59.916
They said, we want somebody
to direct the institute

00:09:59.916 --> 00:10:01.919
that has an open mind.

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:04.634
We want you to do good
science, but leave no stone

00:10:04.634 --> 00:10:07.265
unturned about what might
make a difference for people

00:10:07.265 --> 00:10:08.850
who have autism.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.942
And they encouraged me to go
to some meetings that were then

00:10:11.942 --> 00:10:15.075
called DAN meetings, and learn about

00:10:15.075 --> 00:10:17.901
these things that people were doing.

00:10:17.901 --> 00:10:20.142
The first one I went to
was in Portland and I left

00:10:20.142 --> 00:10:21.258
in the middle of it.

00:10:21.258 --> 00:10:24.016
I just thought, you know,
there is no rationale for this,

00:10:24.016 --> 00:10:26.063
this doesn't make any sense at all.

00:10:26.063 --> 00:10:29.163
I don't see why I should even
spend my time trying to learn

00:10:29.163 --> 00:10:33.064
about it, but I went away and
I started thinking, you know,

00:10:33.064 --> 00:10:35.152
these people are thinking out of the box.

00:10:35.152 --> 00:10:36.954
They're trying to find something

00:10:36.954 --> 00:10:38.972
that might have some rationale.

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:42.503
They're not researchers,
they didn't do good research,

00:10:42.503 --> 00:10:45.589
they didn't know how to
study those things, but

00:10:45.589 --> 00:10:46.902
they were trying.

00:10:46.902 --> 00:10:48.812
And they were looking for
other ways of thinking,

00:10:48.812 --> 00:10:51.654
and we'll talk about some
of the studies that resulted

00:10:51.654 --> 00:10:54.834
from that and where they've
gone and I think how

00:10:54.834 --> 00:10:58.941
keeping an open mind is a
worthy thing to do in this field

00:10:58.941 --> 00:11:02.081
in trying to figure out how
people might think about

00:11:02.081 --> 00:11:03.671
what's happening.

00:11:03.671 --> 00:11:06.060
Well, as Dr. Sherr said
he was going to tell you

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.872
in a half an hour what causes autism,

00:11:08.872 --> 00:11:11.849
I'd say here it is quickly for you.

00:11:11.849 --> 00:11:13.682
The first is a genetic

00:11:14.787 --> 00:11:18.271
neurodevelopmental vulnerability,
the kind of first hit.

00:11:18.271 --> 00:11:20.721
And then the way that that
interacts with environmental

00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:23.944
stressors and the interaction
between the two of those,

00:11:23.944 --> 00:11:27.716
so that's not so simple,
and all the ways that genes

00:11:27.716 --> 00:11:30.348
interact with each others,
and genes interact with the

00:11:30.348 --> 00:11:33.706
environment, are then what
leads to that process called

00:11:33.706 --> 00:11:37.424
autism, but it also suggests
that maybe there are things

00:11:37.424 --> 00:11:40.398
that we can do for the second
hit that it can improve

00:11:40.398 --> 00:11:43.620
the outcome of the
interaction between the two.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.993
The third hit, though,
comes when we say autism

00:11:45.993 --> 00:11:48.287
is a hopeless disorder and
there's nothing we can do

00:11:48.287 --> 00:11:49.389
to make it better.

00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:52.226
And, sure enough, if those
people are put in institutions

00:11:52.226 --> 00:11:55.211
or taken away from the
opportunity to learn

00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:58.074
from others or other
typically developing kids,

00:11:58.074 --> 00:11:59.910
they don't tend to do as well.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:00.864
And so

00:12:00.864 --> 00:12:03.623
that restricted development
is the other thing

00:12:03.623 --> 00:12:06.990
that seems to create the bigger problem.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.357
In thinking about this
model, you could say

00:12:09.357 --> 00:12:12.843
if we were to think about
autism as being a slice

00:12:12.843 --> 00:12:16.797
through the earth, and the
center of the earth is the DNA,

00:12:16.797 --> 00:12:18.685
that's the core of the earth,

00:12:18.685 --> 00:12:21.395
and the symptoms are what
we see on the surface

00:12:21.395 --> 00:12:25.559
of the earth, you could say,
as we have, historically

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:28.316
we first started out
looking at symptoms saying

00:12:28.316 --> 00:12:29.799
oh we can say we can understand disorders

00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:33.662
by understanding symptoms
and we created DSM.

00:12:33.662 --> 00:12:36.376
Then we said, hopefully, that
we can understand disorders

00:12:36.376 --> 00:12:39.696
by understanding genes
and we'll find the DNA

00:12:39.696 --> 00:12:42.274
and we'll be able to fix the problem.

00:12:42.274 --> 00:12:44.837
That hasn't worked
either, and increasingly,

00:12:44.837 --> 00:12:47.029
what we're talking about,

00:12:47.029 --> 00:12:50.163
is trying to understand
the epigenetic process,

00:12:50.163 --> 00:12:52.411
the endophenotype, what's happening

00:12:52.411 --> 00:12:54.311
in the center of the earth.

00:12:54.311 --> 00:12:57.592
As we say, how can we
affect the metabolic process

00:12:57.592 --> 00:12:59.506
that comes from these genes and the way

00:12:59.506 --> 00:13:01.609
they express themselves and then

00:13:01.609 --> 00:13:04.338
how they work themselves
up to the symptoms.

00:13:04.338 --> 00:13:07.464
I will tell you that when
I first did this model,

00:13:07.464 --> 00:13:09.456
I was at the MIND Institute and I

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:12.560
said in, I thought a nice
way, to Sally Rogers.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.291
I said, you know, Sally, the
problem with what you're doing

00:13:15.291 --> 00:13:17.645
is you're working with
behaviorial treatments

00:13:17.645 --> 00:13:19.687
and you're only working on the symptoms,

00:13:19.687 --> 00:13:21.342
on the surface of the earth.

00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:24.995
Sally said, in her inimitable
way, "You're wrong, Bob."

00:13:24.995 --> 00:13:29.343
She said "If I get these
kids early enough, and I can

00:13:29.343 --> 00:13:33.219
"do the right treatments, I
can re-sculpt their neurons.

00:13:33.219 --> 00:13:36.369
"I can make their neurons
different by what I'm doing."

00:13:36.369 --> 00:13:40.121
And she's shown that in her
Early Start Denver Model work,

00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:43.042
and the whole team has done looking at

00:13:43.042 --> 00:13:45.007
MRIs and EEGs

00:13:45.007 --> 00:13:46.710
and other

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.173
measures that can say
yep, you are re-sculpting

00:13:49.173 --> 00:13:51.713
neurons in that way that
you're doing these things.

00:13:51.713 --> 00:13:53.334
But as we think about what's happening

00:13:53.334 --> 00:13:55.358
in the center of the earth

00:13:55.358 --> 00:13:58.058
I thought of it as
somewhat like the terroir,

00:13:58.058 --> 00:14:01.848
that you think of with
a wine, where you say

00:14:01.848 --> 00:14:04.641
you know, how much clay, how much sand,

00:14:04.641 --> 00:14:07.572
how much rain, how much sunshine,

00:14:07.572 --> 00:14:10.968
but I was visiting a
close friend of our family

00:14:10.968 --> 00:14:13.669
in Alsace and the people
there were talking

00:14:13.669 --> 00:14:16.712
about their terroir and
said it's not only that.

00:14:16.712 --> 00:14:19.295
But it's also the souls of the people

00:14:19.295 --> 00:14:21.115
that are tilling the soil

00:14:21.115 --> 00:14:24.745
that make the terroir,
and make great cepage

00:14:24.745 --> 00:14:26.118
or great grapes.

00:14:26.118 --> 00:14:28.617
And I think that was an apt metaphor,

00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:31.667
I thought, for me in the
way kids grow brains.

00:14:31.667 --> 00:14:32.667
There's this

00:14:33.708 --> 00:14:34.870
kind of soil

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.379
that what's happening here
in the center of the earth

00:14:37.379 --> 00:14:39.817
and there are ways we
can make that healthier

00:14:39.817 --> 00:14:41.490
and make that work better for kids

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.612
and I think some of the
things that we're doing

00:14:43.612 --> 00:14:45.534
with some of these integrative treatments

00:14:45.534 --> 00:14:47.969
can make it effort for that to happen.

00:14:47.969 --> 00:14:50.824
So we might think of
level four interventions

00:14:50.824 --> 00:14:52.708
being more behavioral,

00:14:52.708 --> 00:14:55.520
level one genetic, which we're doing

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.780
a little bit more of this
Dr. Sherr mentioned earlier,

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.583
but what I'm gonna spend my time

00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:04.553
talking about is this area in the center,

00:15:04.553 --> 00:15:06.786
the metabolic processes and how

00:15:06.786 --> 00:15:10.703
can we make those healthier
and more resilient.

00:15:11.978 --> 00:15:14.406
Those kinds of processes are things like

00:15:14.406 --> 00:15:17.240
immune abnormalities and inflammation

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.620
or oxidative stress or
disturbed methylation.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.579
Mitochondrial function,
free fatty acid metabolism,

00:15:24.579 --> 00:15:27.374
excitatory and inhibitory balances,

00:15:27.374 --> 00:15:29.885
hormonal effects in the microglia,

00:15:29.885 --> 00:15:32.607
which we're increasingly appreciating

00:15:32.607 --> 00:15:34.679
in a kinda gut-brain way,

00:15:34.679 --> 00:15:37.467
have an important role
in the way that the brain

00:15:37.467 --> 00:15:39.134
functions and works.

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:40.905
The

00:15:41.972 --> 00:15:42.956
problem

00:15:42.956 --> 00:15:45.498
in much of this research is that these are

00:15:45.498 --> 00:15:49.226
processes that are going
on at various times.

00:15:49.226 --> 00:15:53.367
They may be in sequence, they
may be active at one time,

00:15:53.367 --> 00:15:55.219
so when we try a treatments that is going

00:15:55.219 --> 00:15:58.826
to work well for immune
function but there isn't

00:15:58.826 --> 00:16:01.402
an immune activity going
on because it's moved

00:16:01.402 --> 00:16:04.390
into another process, further downstream,

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.992
like say mitochondrial function,
we may get a negative study

00:16:07.992 --> 00:16:11.134
unless we have a way
of finding a biomarker

00:16:11.134 --> 00:16:14.108
that will make a difference
in our making sure

00:16:14.108 --> 00:16:18.111
we've selected the right group
to try this intervention.

00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:20.744
And I'll tell you about a
study that we just completed,

00:16:20.744 --> 00:16:23.421
when I get towards the
end, which is our effort

00:16:23.421 --> 00:16:25.219
to try to do that.

00:16:25.219 --> 00:16:26.843
But we need to have a way to know that

00:16:26.843 --> 00:16:29.987
this process is what's
active now if we're trying

00:16:29.987 --> 00:16:32.434
to use an intervention that's target it,

00:16:32.434 --> 00:16:34.869
otherwise we're just shotgunning and maybe

00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:37.444
not fully making a difference.

00:16:37.444 --> 00:16:40.676
But this kind of thinking, this way of

00:16:40.676 --> 00:16:43.810
looking at these metabolic processes

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.781
is a kind of paradigm shift.

00:16:45.781 --> 00:16:48.355
It's another way of
understanding a disorder

00:16:48.355 --> 00:16:51.011
that's not so much based either on genes

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:54.912
or symptoms or even brain
structure and function,

00:16:54.912 --> 00:16:56.875
up at the surface of the earth,

00:16:56.875 --> 00:16:58.656
but what's this metabolic process

00:16:58.656 --> 00:17:01.706
and how can we affect a change with it?

00:17:01.706 --> 00:17:04.893
There are people that have
intestinal inflammation,

00:17:04.893 --> 00:17:08.915
digestive enzyme abnormalities,
metabolic impairments.

00:17:08.915 --> 00:17:12.194
People with autism that show
signs of oxidative stress,

00:17:12.194 --> 00:17:16.047
mitochondrial dysfunction,
immune problems, and that

00:17:16.047 --> 00:17:16.880
range

00:17:18.135 --> 00:17:21.703
have a whole variety of
ranges that we might see

00:17:21.703 --> 00:17:24.825
improvements by a
combination of nutritional

00:17:24.825 --> 00:17:28.994
recommendations, prescription
medications and addressing

00:17:28.994 --> 00:17:32.318
the underlying medical
conditions that we see

00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:33.817
and that's what we're gonna spend our time

00:17:33.817 --> 00:17:36.351
talking about as we move ahead.

00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:38.717
First, though, I want
to spend a little time

00:17:38.717 --> 00:17:40.634
applying this to saying

00:17:41.653 --> 00:17:43.272
is there anything that we could do

00:17:43.272 --> 00:17:46.170
to help that process
that we're talking about

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.299
from going awry?

00:17:48.299 --> 00:17:50.953
If someone has a genetic vulnerability,

00:17:50.953 --> 00:17:52.728
is there a way that we could create

00:17:52.728 --> 00:17:54.830
the healthiest kind of environment

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.130
so that those genes
don't express themselves

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:01.483
or don't start lining
up and having this plant

00:18:01.483 --> 00:18:05.692
who might be growing towards
the light over here going off,

00:18:05.692 --> 00:18:07.926
rather than growing straight in a way

00:18:07.926 --> 00:18:09.644
that could make it healthier.

00:18:09.644 --> 00:18:11.998
And there are a number
of websites and places

00:18:11.998 --> 00:18:14.546
that have started talking about this,

00:18:14.546 --> 00:18:17.765
including ARI, and that's
where Maureen McDonnell's

00:18:17.765 --> 00:18:19.484
recommendations are.

00:18:19.484 --> 00:18:21.305
We'll talk about some of those people

00:18:21.305 --> 00:18:22.687
are saying but,

00:18:22.687 --> 00:18:25.096
you know, some people

00:18:25.096 --> 00:18:27.828
are saying things that don't
have very much evidence.

00:18:27.828 --> 00:18:30.238
And there are a growing
body of people, though,

00:18:30.238 --> 00:18:32.501
trying to see what can be done.

00:18:32.501 --> 00:18:35.168
Looking at the prenatal history,

00:18:36.171 --> 00:18:38.488
the epigenetic information

00:18:38.488 --> 00:18:40.905
that's not contained in the DNA sequence,

00:18:40.905 --> 00:18:45.580
and how could we think
about that first level out,

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.453
which is the chromatin patterning and the

00:18:49.453 --> 00:18:51.416
methylation and how can we then

00:18:51.416 --> 00:18:55.256
go on to other places where
we can make a difference.

00:18:55.256 --> 00:18:58.884
Some people even say this
kind of thing gets carried on

00:18:58.884 --> 00:19:00.881
from generation to generation

00:19:00.881 --> 00:19:04.261
and might express itself
even at some point later.

00:19:04.261 --> 00:19:07.593
If you recall the studies
of smoking grandmothers

00:19:07.593 --> 00:19:11.424
who have grandchildren that
show that same evidence

00:19:11.424 --> 00:19:15.960
or mouse models that can
actually show seven generations

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.891
of skipping that makes a
difference before it finally

00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:21.053
expresses itself in that

00:19:21.053 --> 00:19:23.720
small embryo and then the fetus.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.727
There are things we know affect risk,

00:19:27.727 --> 00:19:30.320
like older women who are deficient in iron

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.289
have five times a greater risk
of having a baby with autism.

00:19:34.289 --> 00:19:37.159
Prenatal steroid perturbations,

00:19:37.159 --> 00:19:40.821
even in a skipped generation
may increase risk.

00:19:40.821 --> 00:19:43.396
Preterm birth, small for gestational age,

00:19:43.396 --> 00:19:47.450
C-section are all associated
with increased risk but

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:49.874
it's not just those
processes by themselves,

00:19:49.874 --> 00:19:51.067
it's what might have led

00:19:51.067 --> 00:19:54.154
to the reason for a C-section.

00:19:54.154 --> 00:19:58.005
Diabetes, being overweight,
autoimmunity, infection,

00:19:58.005 --> 00:19:59.630
and age all play a role.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.665
Higher maternal intakes
of certain nutrients,

00:20:03.665 --> 00:20:07.111
seemed, especially folic
acid and to some extent

00:20:07.111 --> 00:20:11.541
Omega-3, vitamin D, antioxidants,
iron and breastfeeding

00:20:11.541 --> 00:20:13.803
are all associated with better outcomes.

00:20:13.803 --> 00:20:15.816
Those have been shown in isolation

00:20:15.816 --> 00:20:18.557
but so far somebody
hasn't done one, large,

00:20:18.557 --> 00:20:21.808
population based study saying
this could make a difference

00:20:21.808 --> 00:20:25.575
if we took high risk moms,
but there's one study,

00:20:25.575 --> 00:20:29.133
that we'll talk about in a
minute, that took high-risk moms,

00:20:29.133 --> 00:20:33.085
gave them high doses of
Vitamin D and the incidents

00:20:33.085 --> 00:20:34.884
of those that took the vitamin D

00:20:34.884 --> 00:20:37.700
compared to those that
didn't, was far lower

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.197
than in those that

00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:42.801
were not taking that extra supplement.

00:20:42.801 --> 00:20:45.344
That's been shown for a
few other things as well

00:20:45.344 --> 00:20:49.067
and at least suggest,
maybe we could do things,

00:20:49.067 --> 00:20:51.244
especially in high-risk pregnancies,

00:20:51.244 --> 00:20:54.031
to say that autism could be prevented.

00:20:54.031 --> 00:20:57.375
A pediatrician, Liz Mumper,
has a practice mostly

00:20:57.375 --> 00:21:00.792
filled with kids with autism and she took

00:21:01.685 --> 00:21:02.852
mothers, 290--

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:07.960
mothers of 294 patients, that were wanting

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.493
to have a second child and she said

00:21:11.493 --> 00:21:13.665
try these things.

00:21:13.665 --> 00:21:15.525
Make sure you're not exposing yourself

00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:17.455
to environmental toxicants,

00:21:17.455 --> 00:21:20.368
breastfeeding for a long period of time,

00:21:20.368 --> 00:21:22.183
at least a year and a half,

00:21:22.183 --> 00:21:24.998
think about your gut flora composition,

00:21:24.998 --> 00:21:27.061
look at your nutritional status,

00:21:27.061 --> 00:21:29.362
she advised against acetaminophen use,

00:21:29.362 --> 00:21:31.514
even before the recent studies,

00:21:31.514 --> 00:21:34.264
and used antibiotics

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.130
sparingly

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.842
and tried to do what she could

00:21:38.842 --> 00:21:41.675
to support people with infections.

00:21:43.532 --> 00:21:45.966
Out of these 294 patients
that she'd followed

00:21:45.966 --> 00:21:50.098
from 2005 until 2013

00:21:50.098 --> 00:21:55.017
none of those kids that
were born came with autism

00:21:55.017 --> 00:21:57.593
and yet the average rate

00:21:57.593 --> 00:22:00.304
is somewhere between 17% and 20%.

00:22:00.304 --> 00:22:02.905
So it's an anecdotal
study, it wasn't published

00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:06.172
in a peer reviewed journal, but it was

00:22:06.172 --> 00:22:07.385
someone's practice

00:22:07.385 --> 00:22:10.168
and there's one other study
that's somewhat similar,

00:22:10.168 --> 00:22:13.229
talking about using
those kinds of strategies

00:22:13.229 --> 00:22:15.105
to make a difference.

00:22:15.105 --> 00:22:19.877
There a group that's called
Preconception to Infancy, P2i,

00:22:19.877 --> 00:22:21.893
and the website for that is at the bottom,

00:22:21.893 --> 00:22:24.677
that's now trying to operationalize this

00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:28.760
in a much larger way using
step-by-step guidance,

00:22:29.721 --> 00:22:32.854
based on hard science, that
might increase the odds

00:22:32.854 --> 00:22:36.187
of delivering a full-term
baby who won't suffer

00:22:36.187 --> 00:22:40.354
from chronic illnesses like
those that are listed there.

00:22:41.448 --> 00:22:45.615
And their goal is to do this
with one million babies.

00:22:46.541 --> 00:22:48.347
There's been a new center that's developed

00:22:48.347 --> 00:22:52.680
at the University of Georgia,
headed by Jose Cordero.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.950
Jose was at the CDC for
quite a number of years,

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.229
and was a professor both at Emory

00:22:58.229 --> 00:23:01.062
and the University of Puerto Rico.

00:23:02.224 --> 00:23:03.894
It's just getting started and if you want

00:23:03.894 --> 00:23:06.421
to read more about it in
the things you're are doing,

00:23:06.421 --> 00:23:09.653
that's something to at least
think that this is beginning

00:23:09.653 --> 00:23:12.013
to move into an area of seriousness

00:23:12.013 --> 00:23:15.239
that might be able to make a difference.

00:23:15.239 --> 00:23:19.291
I'm gonna shift and
talk just a little about

00:23:19.291 --> 00:23:22.291
some of the labs that might be used.

00:23:23.513 --> 00:23:26.331
Dr. Sherr went through the
ones that are the main ones.

00:23:26.331 --> 00:23:29.343
The things that are standards,
like a metabolic panel

00:23:29.343 --> 00:23:32.048
a variety of other
things are the standards,

00:23:32.048 --> 00:23:34.396
and I see I'm losing my time

00:23:34.396 --> 00:23:36.253
so I'll go fast through these,

00:23:36.253 --> 00:23:37.893
and you can read them if you want,

00:23:37.893 --> 00:23:41.151
but the latter ones are ones that are

00:23:41.151 --> 00:23:46.046
somehow though of when a
person has a reason for that.

00:23:46.046 --> 00:23:49.365
Some of the others, and I guess
I didn't show all of them,

00:23:49.365 --> 00:23:52.334
fortunately, so I will go faster.

00:23:52.334 --> 00:23:54.213
There are a number of other
tests that you'll find

00:23:54.213 --> 00:23:57.313
some doctors are doing that
don't have good evidence

00:23:57.313 --> 00:23:59.941
and we've spent a lot of
time trying to find evidence

00:23:59.941 --> 00:24:02.853
for some of those tests that
have become fairly expensive,

00:24:02.853 --> 00:24:03.686
but

00:24:05.227 --> 00:24:07.314
many of those doctors have a rationale

00:24:07.314 --> 00:24:09.835
and feel like there's a
reason that they're doing it,

00:24:09.835 --> 00:24:12.143
but you'll sometimes
see patients that have

00:24:12.143 --> 00:24:15.424
sheet after sheet after
sheet of a number of tests

00:24:15.424 --> 00:24:18.280
that they say are, have an abnormal values

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.409
and that one might do this to treat.

00:24:20.409 --> 00:24:22.866
That's not saying that they're not

00:24:22.866 --> 00:24:25.736
having good value but they don't have

00:24:25.736 --> 00:24:28.804
strong evidence in the
ways that they work.

00:24:28.804 --> 00:24:30.875
I'm gonna go through this
last part of the talk

00:24:30.875 --> 00:24:34.282
talking about several
complementary integrative

00:24:34.282 --> 00:24:36.795
medicine treatments and I
think have some evidence

00:24:36.795 --> 00:24:38.286
for their working.

00:24:38.286 --> 00:24:41.502
Melatonin, there was a good
review and meta-analysis

00:24:41.502 --> 00:24:45.221
of 35 studies saying, and
five of them were randomized

00:24:45.221 --> 00:24:48.374
control trials, showing that

00:24:48.374 --> 00:24:51.211
sleep duration was increased

00:24:51.211 --> 00:24:54.760
and the sleep onset latency was decreased

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.372
and the night-time
awakenings were unchanged.

00:24:58.372 --> 00:25:01.600
The adverse effects were minimal to none

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.126
and I

00:25:03.126 --> 00:25:05.218
use a fair amount of melatonin for sleep,

00:25:05.218 --> 00:25:07.919
usually between and three
and nine milligrams.

00:25:07.919 --> 00:25:11.180
That makes a difference and
doesn't seem to have harmful

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.682
side effects, either
short term or long term.

00:25:14.682 --> 00:25:17.711
Vitamin D became popular when
people first started think,

00:25:17.711 --> 00:25:21.355
as an ideology for autism
when people said, you know,

00:25:21.355 --> 00:25:24.323
maybe some of these people
that are developing autism

00:25:24.323 --> 00:25:28.129
are dark-skinned people that
move into low-light climates

00:25:28.129 --> 00:25:31.240
and there was a large number
of people from Somalia

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.599
that seemed to be developing
autism when they moved

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:35.610
to the Scandinavian countries.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:37.736
There've been also studies
showing that if you live in a

00:25:37.736 --> 00:25:40.415
rainier environment, there
might be a higher incidence

00:25:40.415 --> 00:25:44.003
of autism, perhaps because
kids stay inside more.

00:25:44.003 --> 00:25:47.718
All kind of anecdotal evidence, but

00:25:47.718 --> 00:25:49.368
we did a small study

00:25:49.368 --> 00:25:53.632
showing that we could
give doses of Vitamin D

00:25:53.632 --> 00:25:55.002
and it could,

00:25:55.002 --> 00:25:57.994
even at high doses, that we had
some trouble getting through

00:25:57.994 --> 00:26:02.161
the IRB but was, were given
safely and effectively.

00:26:03.365 --> 00:26:06.868
And there have been two recent,
randomized control trials

00:26:06.868 --> 00:26:08.951
suggesting that Vitamin D

00:26:09.848 --> 00:26:13.010
makes a difference in
symptoms for kids with autism,

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.269
at doses usually between
2,000 International Units

00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:19.452
and 5,000 International Units.

00:26:19.452 --> 00:26:22.839
The study that I mentioned
is not up there, but it was

00:26:22.839 --> 00:26:24.099
done of

00:26:24.099 --> 00:26:27.431
pregnant moms at high risk taking

00:26:27.431 --> 00:26:29.632
2,000 IUs at the beginning,

00:26:29.632 --> 00:26:31.426
5,000 through the pregnancy

00:26:31.426 --> 00:26:35.371
and 7,000 International Units
when they were breastfeeding,

00:26:35.371 --> 00:26:39.304
finding a much lower incidence
of autism in those offspring.

00:26:39.304 --> 00:26:41.843
It was an open-label trial, however,

00:26:41.843 --> 00:26:42.676
and

00:26:43.887 --> 00:26:47.959
there're reasons to say maybe
that isn't fully working.

00:26:47.959 --> 00:26:50.847
The first study that we thought of doing

00:26:50.847 --> 00:26:53.671
when the parents gave me this
challenge and I went to talk

00:26:53.671 --> 00:26:55.671
to these people was

00:26:57.607 --> 00:26:59.962
they said, I said, what study
do you think we should do

00:26:59.962 --> 00:27:03.441
that's a double blind, randomized,
placebo controlled trial.

00:27:03.441 --> 00:27:05.082
They said chelation.

00:27:05.082 --> 00:27:07.573
I said, no I don't want to do
chelation for our first study.

00:27:07.573 --> 00:27:08.766
That's just
(audience laughter)

00:27:08.766 --> 00:27:10.441
too controversial and,

00:27:10.441 --> 00:27:11.608
it's too complicated.

00:27:11.608 --> 00:27:14.673
They say you need to be on a
casein-gluten free diet first,

00:27:14.673 --> 00:27:17.162
and then there's all these
things that you're taking out,

00:27:17.162 --> 00:27:19.911
as Bennet pointed out, all
these heavy metals and so

00:27:19.911 --> 00:27:22.011
you have to supplement them
with other heavy metals

00:27:22.011 --> 00:27:23.479
if you're gonna do it right.

00:27:23.479 --> 00:27:25.460
So, I said what's second?

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.537
And they said Methyl B12.

00:27:27.537 --> 00:27:30.262
So we did a study at the MIND Institute

00:27:30.262 --> 00:27:33.964
of Methyl B12 and I have to
tell you, it was the second

00:27:33.964 --> 00:27:36.918
kid that we saw in that study that made me

00:27:36.918 --> 00:27:39.495
passionate about doing this kind of work.

00:27:39.495 --> 00:27:41.578
This little boy that was,

00:27:42.463 --> 00:27:43.835
fogged, kind of,

00:27:43.835 --> 00:27:45.976
looked like there was a veil over him.

00:27:45.976 --> 00:27:47.779
You didn't really get a response.

00:27:47.779 --> 00:27:50.536
He was in another world,
and I think we all see

00:27:50.536 --> 00:27:53.157
a fair number of kids with
autism, not all of them,

00:27:53.157 --> 00:27:54.974
but a fair number like that.

00:27:54.974 --> 00:27:58.208
And he came in and he
started in the methyl B12,

00:27:58.208 --> 00:28:00.202
and he came in after a month

00:28:00.202 --> 00:28:02.155
and it was like he'd been awakened.

00:28:02.155 --> 00:28:03.454
He looked at me

00:28:03.454 --> 00:28:06.680
and it was as though
he'd just discovered me.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.546
And his parents said he's
more engaged, he's seeming to,

00:28:10.546 --> 00:28:13.347
it's like this veil has been lifted.

00:28:13.347 --> 00:28:15.183
Now, his autism wasn't cured

00:28:15.183 --> 00:28:17.563
but he seemed to do a fair amount better.

00:28:17.563 --> 00:28:19.730
We finished that study and

00:28:20.951 --> 00:28:24.593
our biomarker group that
showed oxidative stress

00:28:24.593 --> 00:28:27.578
were the ones with the most
impaired oxidative stress

00:28:27.578 --> 00:28:30.148
were the ones that showed
the most improvement.

00:28:30.148 --> 00:28:33.207
Based on that we got a
grant from Autism Speaks

00:28:33.207 --> 00:28:36.441
and we did a second study,
which is down at the bottom,

00:28:36.441 --> 00:28:38.514
that has recently been published

00:28:38.514 --> 00:28:40.105
that shows,

00:28:40.105 --> 00:28:42.002
it's not in press any more.

00:28:42.002 --> 00:28:45.059
Showing that the active
did separate from placebo

00:28:45.059 --> 00:28:46.961
in a randomized control trial

00:28:46.961 --> 00:28:49.717
and the oxidative stress
biomarkers were the ones

00:28:49.717 --> 00:28:53.221
that were the most predictive
of whether these kids

00:28:53.221 --> 00:28:56.113
would respond or wouldn't.

00:28:56.113 --> 00:29:00.851
Antonio Hardan did a study
of NAC for kids with autism.

00:29:00.851 --> 00:29:03.377
Randomized control trial
showing that actors separated

00:29:03.377 --> 00:29:04.741
from placebo.

00:29:04.741 --> 00:29:07.185
Other groups have done
similar studies with NAC,

00:29:07.185 --> 00:29:11.191
looking at self-injurious
behavior, OCD-type behaviors,

00:29:11.191 --> 00:29:13.274
all showing some benefit.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:17.499
We did a study of Omega-3s,
one that was a small study,

00:29:17.499 --> 00:29:19.790
another that was an internet-based study,

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.752
so we could enroll people on the internet.

00:29:21.752 --> 00:29:24.773
We sent them placebo or Omega-3s.

00:29:24.773 --> 00:29:27.709
While active didn't separate,
there was a strong trend

00:29:27.709 --> 00:29:30.976
to Omega-3s making a difference,
and we were giving one

00:29:30.976 --> 00:29:34.634
gram a day and there are several
randomized control trials

00:29:34.634 --> 00:29:38.801
done in Europe that show benefits
from Omega-3s for autism.

00:29:39.668 --> 00:29:43.015
Jim Adams has done number
studies of vitamin and mineral

00:29:43.015 --> 00:29:46.722
supplements, some of them
randomized control trials,

00:29:46.722 --> 00:29:50.782
again showing that these
high-doses of micronutrients

00:29:50.782 --> 00:29:53.029
made a difference in a number of

00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:56.946
the scales that you can
see on the last bullet,

00:29:57.876 --> 00:30:00.140
suggesting benefits from

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.603
high-dose micronutrient supplement.

00:30:02.603 --> 00:30:05.742
He was using something that
was somewhat like Empower

00:30:05.742 --> 00:30:08.995
but it was not Empower, but
it was that kind of high-dose

00:30:08.995 --> 00:30:10.162
micronutrient.

00:30:11.332 --> 00:30:13.748
Diet has been inconsistent.

00:30:13.748 --> 00:30:15.059
The studies of

00:30:15.059 --> 00:30:17.386
casein-gluten-free diet,
there was one early study

00:30:17.386 --> 00:30:18.880
suggesting benefit

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.799
but later ones,

00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:22.602
it's a hard study to design,

00:30:22.602 --> 00:30:24.674
have not shown clear benefit.

00:30:24.674 --> 00:30:28.789
Looking at the microbiome,
studies of mice have shown

00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:32.407
that creating a mouse model of autism,

00:30:32.407 --> 00:30:36.431
reversed the autism when given probiotics

00:30:36.431 --> 00:30:37.349
and there have been several

00:30:37.349 --> 00:30:40.861
other studies looking at
the value of probiotics.

00:30:40.861 --> 00:30:42.821
Pancreatic digestive enzymes.

00:30:42.821 --> 00:30:46.988
A company called Curemark,
who we're doing a study for,

00:30:47.825 --> 00:30:51.343
and it's our second study with
them of a multi-site study

00:30:51.343 --> 00:30:52.569
saying,

00:30:52.569 --> 00:30:53.540
I guess,

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.143
that this caused improvement because

00:30:56.143 --> 00:31:00.556
the FDA is encouraging them to
go back and do a second study

00:31:00.556 --> 00:31:03.535
so the FDA reviewed that
data, although it's not

00:31:03.535 --> 00:31:05.118
been published yet.

00:31:06.223 --> 00:31:08.818
And they used as a biomarker
in the first study,

00:31:08.818 --> 00:31:11.182
fecal chymotrypsin had to be low.

00:31:11.182 --> 00:31:12.853
The FDA said, how do you know

00:31:12.853 --> 00:31:15.059
fecal chymotrypsin is a marker,

00:31:15.059 --> 00:31:17.975
you need to go back and
do the study for all kids.

00:31:17.975 --> 00:31:20.482
If anybody has an interest in

00:31:20.482 --> 00:31:23.334
pancreatic digestive enzymes,
we do have a study ongoing

00:31:23.334 --> 00:31:27.501
at the MIND, one is at the
MIND Institute and one is here.

00:31:29.988 --> 00:31:32.115
There have been studies,
as was mentioned earlier,

00:31:32.115 --> 00:31:33.477
vasopressin.

00:31:33.477 --> 00:31:37.317
Those results haven't been
produced or published yet either,

00:31:37.317 --> 00:31:39.375
except that the company,

00:31:39.375 --> 00:31:41.450
Roche Genentech,

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:42.668
went to the FDA

00:31:42.668 --> 00:31:45.301
and the FDA told them
they wanted more data.

00:31:45.301 --> 00:31:49.218
So, there's an ongoing
study of vasopressin for

00:31:50.252 --> 00:31:51.252
autism that,

00:31:52.127 --> 00:31:54.472
I guess the FDA thought
it was worth going back

00:31:54.472 --> 00:31:56.491
and trying again, suggesting maybe

00:31:56.491 --> 00:31:59.237
that it made a difference.

00:31:59.237 --> 00:32:02.690
We just finished a study
at the Oak Hill School of

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.128
sulforaphane, which is a concentrated

00:32:05.128 --> 00:32:08.365
broccoli sprout extract that
was developed for treating

00:32:08.365 --> 00:32:10.615
oxidative stress in cancer.

00:32:12.396 --> 00:32:15.273
It seemed to have an effect
on heat shock protein

00:32:15.273 --> 00:32:16.440
and a kind of,

00:32:17.736 --> 00:32:18.653
thoughtful,

00:32:20.883 --> 00:32:21.880
physician,

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.365
thought about heat shock and
kids with autism who tend

00:32:25.365 --> 00:32:28.896
to do better with fever
and he thought maybe

00:32:28.896 --> 00:32:31.453
sulforaphane could make a
difference for these kids.

00:32:31.453 --> 00:32:34.325
Did a randomized control
trial and active separated

00:32:34.325 --> 00:32:35.606
from placebo.

00:32:35.606 --> 00:32:38.543
We did the study at the Oak Hill school.

00:32:38.543 --> 00:32:42.682
Used metabolomics as a
biomarker of outcome.

00:32:42.682 --> 00:32:45.623
The study showed eight
out of seven kids got

00:32:45.623 --> 00:32:48.546
significantly better, but
it was an open-label trial

00:32:48.546 --> 00:32:52.471
and we're now just analyzing
our metabolomic data.

00:32:52.471 --> 00:32:54.735
And again, oxytocin showing a difference.

00:32:54.735 --> 00:32:56.985
I'm near my last slide, so,

00:32:58.896 --> 00:33:01.256
there are things that suggest
mitochondrial function

00:33:01.256 --> 00:33:05.266
might make a difference,
giving Co-Q10, no good studies

00:33:05.266 --> 00:33:06.986
showing that benefit.

00:33:06.986 --> 00:33:10.362
Medical marijuana, not good
studies but I'd have to say

00:33:10.362 --> 00:33:13.612
I have maybe 20 kids that I've tried on

00:33:15.073 --> 00:33:19.500
first medical marijuana,
then THC and CBD, together,

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.730
or first separately and then together.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:23.178
I don't think it's a miracle drug.

00:33:23.178 --> 00:33:25.601
You maybe saw the article
in the New York Times,

00:33:25.601 --> 00:33:28.348
there've been one in Atlantic
Monthly, several others.

00:33:28.348 --> 00:33:30.545
I think it makes a difference
for some kids where I've

00:33:30.545 --> 00:33:33.116
tried absolutely everything and

00:33:33.116 --> 00:33:34.468
it seems to work.

00:33:34.468 --> 00:33:35.692
I have one

00:33:35.692 --> 00:33:36.525
family

00:33:36.525 --> 00:33:37.923
where I'm sure it's the
grandfather that's taking

00:33:37.923 --> 00:33:39.897
the medical marijuana and (laughing)

00:33:39.897 --> 00:33:40.779
(audience laughter)

00:33:40.779 --> 00:33:43.294
he says his kid's doing a lot,
his grandkid's doing a lot

00:33:43.294 --> 00:33:44.127
better

00:33:44.127 --> 00:33:46.245
(audience laughter)

00:33:46.245 --> 00:33:48.843
but, you know, I reviewed
a grant awhile ago that was

00:33:48.843 --> 00:33:51.134
looking at the endocannabinoid system

00:33:51.134 --> 00:33:53.555
and treating people with

00:33:53.555 --> 00:33:56.090
with cannaboi- cannabidiol

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:58.651
and I thought that was the
craziest idea I'd ever heard of

00:33:58.651 --> 00:34:01.385
and now it's becoming something
seriously talked about

00:34:01.385 --> 00:34:04.158
in terms of things that
might make a difference.

00:34:04.158 --> 00:34:07.006
Looking at other things
like GABA-A and vitamins

00:34:07.006 --> 00:34:10.902
and minerals, I would
encourage you to think about

00:34:10.902 --> 00:34:13.538
doing everything that you
can to help these kids.

00:34:13.538 --> 00:34:15.882
The medical workup that
you heard about earlier.

00:34:15.882 --> 00:34:19.341
Speech and OT, behavioral,
treating associated symptoms

00:34:19.341 --> 00:34:22.698
with pharmacology, but thinking
about things like melatonin,

00:34:22.698 --> 00:34:26.926
Omega-3, vitamin D3, probiotics,
and digestive enzymes

00:34:26.926 --> 00:34:28.742
that can make a difference.

00:34:28.742 --> 00:34:30.696
For those of you who've known
me for awhile, you'll know

00:34:30.696 --> 00:34:33.110
this slide because I show it at the end.

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.582
It was

00:34:34.582 --> 00:34:37.800
we did an art contest
at the MIND Institute

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.818
and we selected

00:34:39.818 --> 00:34:42.430
about 75 things that were shown.

00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:45.664
This is from a boy who
actually lives in Marin

00:34:45.664 --> 00:34:48.676
and I continue to see even
though he's a young man now.

00:34:48.676 --> 00:34:51.066
But his mom said that he

00:34:51.066 --> 00:34:52.659
would always

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:55.226
he would show an uncomfortable
situation and this,

00:34:55.226 --> 00:34:57.538
this piece is called The Haircut.

00:34:57.538 --> 00:35:00.009
You can see how he's feeling
about getting a haircut

00:35:00.009 --> 00:35:02.478
and that bee is probably
the buzz of a razor.

00:35:02.478 --> 00:35:05.389
But she said when he had
an uncomfortable situation

00:35:05.389 --> 00:35:08.447
he always showed a way out,
and you can see the door

00:35:08.447 --> 00:35:09.760
on the side there.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.036
That was his way out.

00:35:11.036 --> 00:35:13.475
I hope that by our shifting our thinking,

00:35:13.475 --> 00:35:16.298
and thinking about ways to
help the body be more resilient

00:35:16.298 --> 00:35:18.760
and work and function
better, we might have kids,

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:22.563
help kids with autism
find a way out of the

00:35:22.563 --> 00:35:25.172
sometimes challenging
disorder that they're in.

00:35:25.172 --> 00:35:26.005
Thank you.

00:35:26.005 --> 00:35:29.088
(audience applause)
