00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.990
At moments of sorrow and exhaustion, it is
only too easy to look back over the years

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.620
and feel that our lives have, in essence,
been meaningless. We take stock of just how

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.490
much has gone wrong: how many errors there
have been; how many unfulfilled plans and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.820
frustrated dreams we’ve had. We may feel
like the distraught, damned Macbeth who, on

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.270
learning of his wife’s death, exclaims at
a pitch of agony that man is a cursed creature

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.910
who: …struts and frets his hour upon the
stage, And then is heard no more. [Life] is

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:49.800
a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and
fury, Signifying nothing. No life can avoid

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.410
an intermittently high degree of ‘sound
and fury.’ The question is whether it must

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.579
also, ultimately, signify nothing. As Macbeth’s
lines hint, this will depend on who is telling

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.010
it. In the hands of Shakespeare’s (bracingly
termed) ‘idiot’, the story of a life may

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.860
well turn into unintelligible and dispiriting
gibberish. But with sufficient compassion

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.891
and insight, we may equally be able to make
something different and a great deal more

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:23.021
meaningful and redemptive out of the same
material.  The

00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:28.930
difference between despair and hope is just
a different way of telling stories from the

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.680
same set of facts. Only a small number of
us ever self-consciously write our autobiographies.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.030
It is a task we associate with celebrities
and the very old – but it is, in the background,

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.719
a universal activity. We may not be publishing
our stories, but we are writing them in our

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:54.079
minds nevertheless. Every day finds us weaving
a story about who we are, where we are going

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:00.630
and why events happened as they did. Many
of us are strikingly harsh narrators of these

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.290
life stories. We hint to ourselves that we’ve
been morons from the beginning. We’ve stuffed

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.730
up big time. It’s been one disaster after
another. That’s how we go about narrating,

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.140
especially late at night, when our reserves
of optimism run dry and the demons return.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.440
Yet there is nothing necessary about our self-flagellating
methods of narration. There could always be

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.780
ways of telling very different, far kinder,
and more balanced stories from the very same

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.630
sets of facts. You could give your life story
to Dostoevsky, Proust or Jesus and come out

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.120
with a rather bearable, moving, tender and
noble story. Good – by which is meant fair-minded

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.260
and judicious – narrators know that lives
can be meaningful even when they involve a

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.040
lot of failure and humiliation. Mistakes do
not have to be absurd; they can be signs of

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.319
how little information we have on which to
base the most consequential decisions. Messing

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.380
up isn’t a sign of evil; it’s evidence
of what we’re up against. Not all the disasters

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.760
were wasted anyway. Maybe we spent a decade
not quite knowing what we wanted to do with

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.680
ourselves professionally. Maybe we went through
a succession of failed relationships that

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.890
left us confused and hurt a lot of people.
But these experiences weren’t meaningless

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.560
because they were necessary to later development
and maturity. We needed the career crisis

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.930
to understand our working identities; we had
to fail at love to fathom our hearts. No one

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.090
gets anywhere important in one go. We can
forgive ourselves the horrors of our first

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.090
drafts. The good storyteller recognises – contrary
to certain impressions – that the central

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.780
character of the story isn’t always responsible
for every calamity or triumph. We are never

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.810
the sole authors of anything that happens
to us. Sometimes, it really will be the economy,

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:01.030
our parents, the government, our enemies or
simply the tragic dimensions of human existence.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:08.230
Good narrators don’t over-personalise. Every
day, we are induced to narrate a bit our life

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.180
story to ourselves: we explain why there was
pain, why we forgot to seize a chance and

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.660
why we’re in an unhappy situation. It does
not need to be a tale told by an idiot signifying

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.380
nothing. It can be a tale told by a kind,
intelligent soul signifying rather a lot:

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.300
like almost every life story, it is in truth
a tale of a well-intentioned, flawed, partially

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.780
blind, self-deceived but ultimately dignified
and good human struggling against enormous

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.560
odds and, sometimes, on a good day, succeeding
just a little in a few areas.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.320
At The School of Life we believe in developing emotional intelligence.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.440
To that end we have also created a whole range of products to support that growth.
