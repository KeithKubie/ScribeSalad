00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.150
My colleague Liz Dunn at University of British
Columbia and I have been studying the relationship

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.160
with between money and happiness.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.500
And it seems like a simple relationship, which
is: we want more money and we want more happiness,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.400
so maybe if we get more money we’ll get
more happiness.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.970
And it turns out that the relationship is
really a lot more complicated than that.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.540
It’s not too surprising to say that money
can’t buy you happiness, we’ve heard that

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.820
phrase a lot.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.579
But that doesn’t help us understand then
what kind of spending will actually make us

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.390
happy and what kind won’t.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.470
What we tend to find when we look at the data
is that the biggest category of things that

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.320
people spend on is stuff for themselves.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.000
Of course we need to pay rent or our mortgage,
we need to have a car, we need to have food

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.829
and clothes, but it seems as though people
are spending an inordinate amount of their

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.400
money on stuff for themselves, and the biggest
problem from our standpoint as psychologists

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.240
is the percent of money that you spend on
stuff for yourself is completely uncorrelated

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.450
with how happy you are with your life.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.809
It doesn’t make you unhappy, it’s not
like if you buy a lot of stuff you’re miserable,

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.149
which sometimes we think is the case—it’s
just the case that it’s flat.

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.700
No matter how much it seems you buy for yourself,
nothing really seems to happen.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.740
And so in our research, and other researchers
as well, we’ve tried to look at, well, if

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.710
stuff for yourself doesn’t pay off are there
other things that you can spend your money

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.200
on that actually do pay off in more happiness?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.429
And what Liz and I have focused on the most
is this idea that instead of focusing on yourself

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.520
all the time, which doesn’t seem to pay
off in happiness, when you focus on other

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.490
people you sort of reverse the arrow from
me to you, it seems that on average when people

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.590
give to others—which can be giving to charity,
it can be treating a friend to lunch, it can

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.409
be buying people gifts—that those actions
of giving rather than keeping seem to be associated

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.039
with more happiness.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.619
And when we send people out and give them
money and tell them to spend it on themselves

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.529
or spend it on somebody else, people who spend
it on themselves kind of have the same day

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:59.329
they would’ve had anyway, but people who
spend on other people actually have a happier

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:00.329
day.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.539
So, if you think about the idea that stuff
for yourself doesn’t make you happy you

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.669
can think of two opposites of that.

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:10.539
One is stuff for other people, so that’s
kind of giving makes you happier than keeping,

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.700
but another opposite of stuff for yourself
is to think about: you can still spend on

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.209
yourself but change from stuff to something
else.

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.020
And lots of research over the last decade
has shown that on average when people buy

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.330
experiences it tends to pay off in more happiness
than buying stuff for themselves.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.450
And if you think about it there’s a lot
of reasons for that.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.660
One of them, which is really critical, is
often when we buy stuff for ourselves we end

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.610
up by ourselves with our stuff.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.610
Think of yourself on your phone playing a
video game or whatever else it might be, you’re

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.349
often alone with your stuff.

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.799
Whereas experiences, yes we do some experiences
solo, but many, many experiences have built

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.780
into them that they’re social.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.239
If we go out to dinner or go see a movie or
go on a hike or whatever else it might be,

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.170
now we’re with other people and even though
people sometimes annoy us a lot it turns out

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.950
that talking to other people makes us happy,
even casual interactions with other people

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.299
make us happier than sitting by ourselves
in a room.

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.450
So experiences are more interesting and all
those things, but they also actually kind

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.920
of serve to commit us to spending time with
other people, and that’s partly why experiences

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.859
pay off in so much more happiness.
