1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,850
You discuss leading and maneuvering
up and down the chain of command.

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,900
But what about laterally within your
own peer group where the competition for

3
00:00:07,901 --> 00:00:12,550
advancement is fiercest and your ability
to to set team objectives and implement

4
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:17,080
some of the tools you
discuss is limited. Okay,

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,490
so you absolutely do have to lead
laterally amongst your peers.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,080
And since you don't have rank or position,

7
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:30,750
you have to do it another
way. But wait a second,

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,220
since you shouldn't use rank or position
to lead people below you in the chain

9
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:39,420
of command and since you don't want to
be led by someone that's throwing their

10
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:41,580
rank and position around, then guess what?

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,560
You need to do the same type of leadership
that you would use up and down the

12
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:50,280
chain of command to lead your
peers. So what does that mean?

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,710
That means you help them when you can

14
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,320
or you support what they're doing. You
try and build a relationship with them.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,000
That's what you try and do. Now this,

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,180
this part of this that where we're
talking about the competitiveness.

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,890
Like if they want to maneuver and try
and make you look bad and jump in the

18
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:12,270
spotlight and try and get all the
credit, guess what? That's fine.

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,060
That's fine. Let them do it.

20
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,210
And everyone is gonna
see what they're doing.

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,520
And they might not see it immediately,
but they will eventually be found out.

22
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:25,530
So do your best to support them.

23
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,580
Do your best to help them do your
best to build the relationship.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,570
Make the mission the most important thing,

25
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:36,780
not the little politics that you're
about to dive into and get involved.

26
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,550
And don't make that the primary thing.

27
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:40,140
Make the primary thing
accomplishing the mission.

28
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,523
Hmm.

29
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,500
Thinking about this, if you
start fighting with them,

30
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,270
you're expending energy on fighting
your own team. That's what you're doing.

31
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,420
Instead of fighting the enemy, it's,
this is a blue on blue situation.

32
00:01:52,421 --> 00:01:55,600
This is a friendly fire. It's
fratricide don't do that.

33
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,040
Disengaged from the friendly fire and
focus on how to make the team win.

34
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,383
Hmm.

35
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,740
Take the high ground,

36
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,600
take the high ground or the
high ground. We'll take you.

37
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,200
Yeah. Okay.

38
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,690
Another one of those
points that we always say,

39
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,800
I know I do and I always think this
where people are watching, man,

40
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,320
they see that and they see
that you see all that stuff,

41
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,280
but let's play this game too. You
know the game where I play with it.

42
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,240
Like who would you hire? Who would
you rather have working for you?

43
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,120
Who would you rather have working
for you? If the guy, the guy,

44
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,290
oh you got four guys.

45
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,610
One guy is helping the other guys out
trying to help them with their mission.

46
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,283
One Guy,

47
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,250
the other end of the spectrum
is undermining people and
trying to make himself

48
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:43,610
look good. Which guy are you going
to promote? Yeah. All Day long.

49
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:44,960
You know who you're
going to promote. Yeah.

50
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,080
You're going to promote the guy that's
trying to help the team win and not just

51
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:51,200
look out for himself. Yup. Yeah. Fully.

52
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,350
And then sit and consider that with not
just your boss but like your peers as

53
00:02:56,721 --> 00:03:00,020
well. You know, even if
there's competition, let's
say everyone's competing for,

54
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,690
yeah, and you're the guy who's jumping
in the spotlight always, whatever.

55
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:07,780
Versus the other guy who's
always helping everyone. Right.

56
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,960
Even even if they're competing with
you, for sure. I'm in the spotlight,

57
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:15,490
he's going to get ostracized if
anything is, you know, so man. Yeah,

58
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,280
they see that stuff, man, that goes
socially. You know what? No, no, no.

59
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,290
Answer me this.

60
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,550
When someone sees the world this way,

61
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,010
that means there have a tendency
to think that way. That means they,

62
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:29,500
I might have a tendency to act this way,

63
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,470
so they are going to be
especially cautious if you're
looking at everyone like,

64
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,760
well, I'm trying to compete with that guy.

65
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,120
I might be getting screwed
over if I don't, if I let him,

66
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,790
you don't get the spotlight right now.
If that's the way you're thinking,

67
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,010
that's the way you're acting
and if you're acting that way,

68
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,800
everybody can see it. Yeah. Don't
act that way. Don't act that way.

69
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,140
Be a good team member. Yeah. The
enemy is outside the wire. Yeah.

70
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:50,980
That's a good one too.

71
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:55,540
Where the good news about that is like
let's say you are active in that way,

72
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,580
as long as you can admit it to yourself,

73
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,580
even if you do have those feelings
inside, but you're like, hey,

74
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:02,440
I don't want to act like
that. And you start,

75
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,720
even if you know it's kind
of against her feelings,

76
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,080
and then you start acting
that way slowly and slowly.

77
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,200
Your feelings can accommodate where
you don't feel that way anymore.

78
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,220
You'll start to feel that way.

79
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:16,180
Let's start to realize how you should
act as a human being, as a team member,

80
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:19,720
as a leader, as a follower,
you'll grow up, your mature,

81
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:20,554
you'll be a good person.

82
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,150
Feel the benefits as opposed
to just looking out for
yourself at school and over

83
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,010
the other team. The ones against
me, check, kill or be killed.
