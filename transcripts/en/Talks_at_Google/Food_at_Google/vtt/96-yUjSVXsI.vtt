[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.746 --> 00:00:07.870
JENNA TAYLOR: So today,
we're super excited to have

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.170
Mary-Frances Heck with us.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.211
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Hello.

00:00:11.857 --> 00:00:13.190
JENNA TAYLOR: Welcome to Google.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.170
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Thank you so much.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.430
JENNA TAYLOR: Do you want to
talk about sweet potatoes?

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.865
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Do I?

00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:17.305
JENNA TAYLOR: I mean, all day?

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:18.430
MARY-FRANCES HECK: All day.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.350
And in fact, for
the last 18 months--

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.830
JENNA TAYLOR: Literally.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.480
MARY-FRANCES HECK: --I
went down a rabbit hole

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.188
and learned everything,
I think, there is

00:00:24.188 --> 00:00:25.720
to know about sweet potatoes.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.640
JENNA TAYLOR: So I've
been dying to ask,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.850
and I want to, two things.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.350
One--

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.308
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Yep?

00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:31.630
JENNA TAYLOR: --why?

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.714
And two, like, what are
we going to do here today?

00:00:33.714 --> 00:00:35.630
I'm going to start with
that, but then please,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.645
please, I must know why.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:38.020
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
So we're going

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.170
to do a little cooking demo
today of two savory dishes that

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.630
use really different flavor
profiles from one another

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.119
that hopefully give you a new
way to look at how to season

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:47.410
and how to cook sweet potatoes.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.150
JENNA TAYLOR: So
marshmallows, brown sugar.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.620
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Tons
of marshmallows, as much

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.524
cinnamon as possible,
just pumpkin pie spice.

00:00:52.524 --> 00:00:54.440
JENNA TAYLOR: No, that's
short cutting, right?

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.648
That's right to pumpkin pies.

00:00:55.648 --> 00:00:57.700
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Totally.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.294
May there never be a
sweet potato latte.

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:02.460
Although I guess, you know--

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.400
MARY-FRANCES HECK: If
Starbucks heard you say that,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.959
it's already on the menu.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.240
JENNA TAYLOR: It might
be healthy, though.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.250
Which leads me to why
I get really excited

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.140
about sweet potatoes, enough
to write a book about them.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.260
So one thing is
that sweet potatoes

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.850
are incredibly nutritious.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.430
They're even consider
a super food.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.400
They're high in fiber,
high in vitamins.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.110
The purple guys-- here, I'll
actually pass these around,

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.150
if you'd like.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.000
The ones that have
purple flesh and or skin

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.170
are very high in an
antioxidant called

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.059
anthocyanins, which is the
same thing as in blueberries.

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:37.600
You know how
blueberries are supposed

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.742
to make you live forever?

00:01:38.742 --> 00:01:40.450
So we have lots of
different colors here.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.162
And I can cut more open,
but just so you can see.

00:01:43.162 --> 00:01:44.620
And then the orange
ones have a lot

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.050
of beta carotene, which help
you see in the dark, obviously.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.440
And the white ones are
for those who are just

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.870
entering into sweet
potato love, like

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.685
a good, gateway sweet potato.

00:01:54.685 --> 00:01:55.810
JENNA TAYLOR: Gateway drug?

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.700
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.007
And then from there--
so sweet potatoes,

00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:02.340
and I'm sure you're all going
to fact check me on this--

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.790
in 2015, sweet potatoes were
the number two Googled recipe.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.330
JENNA TAYLOR: Somebody,
please, know that that's true.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.190
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
And two notable things

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.660
about that, the number
one thing was pepitas.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.490
And it is believed
in the food community

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.590
that that was because people
don't know what pepitas are.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.381
JENNA TAYLOR: True.

00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:22.870
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
OK, and chicken

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.180
has always been the number
one searched for recipe.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.720
Just, chicken recipes has
always been number one.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.790
So chicken dropped to three
in 2015, as far as I know.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.130
JENNA TAYLOR: What happened?

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.220
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
OK, so people perceive

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.765
that sweet potatoes are
healthier, because they are.

00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:39.970
But also diets like--

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.950
JENNA TAYLOR: Everybody knows
white potatoes are the devil.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.460
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Well, right, and we'll

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.900
get to that in a minute.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.616
So sweet potatoes are allowed
by diets like Whole30 and Paleo.

00:02:48.616 --> 00:02:49.990
And for those who
aren't actually

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.970
subscribing to those
diets, they hear things,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.670
and then think they're going
to be doing good by doing

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.290
part of whatever, anyway.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.360
So you have that one
component with diets.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.070
The other component you have
is the sweet potato fry.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.910
JENNA TAYLOR: Ah.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.110
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Which
has swept the nation.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.526
JENNA TAYLOR:
Available at Burger,

00:03:04.526 --> 00:03:05.850
if you're ever in Sunnyvale.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.225
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Yeah, exactly.

00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:09.630
So sweet potato
fries are elusive,

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.820
because they are never
going to be crispy, OK?

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.350
I tried.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.110
We have a few recipes in the
book for sweet potato fries.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.610
And you have to
actually-- whatever,

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.651
I'll get into that later.

00:03:18.651 --> 00:03:21.120
But that's why they
were so searched for.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.730
Because people are
trying to chase

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.320
a ghost of a crispy
sweet potato fry

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.115
that they will never be able
to recreate at home until now.

00:03:28.115 --> 00:03:29.300
JENNA TAYLOR: Uh oh.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.844
Sounds like you've solved it?

00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:32.760
MARY-FRANCES HECK: There's
one solution, yeah.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.300
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh, I love it.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.520
Can't wait.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.120
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
I have a few steps,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.500
but yeah, you can get there.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.410
So I think that's
why people got really

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.200
excited about sweet potatoes
and started Googling them.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.980
And here we all are today.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.855
And so my publisher--

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:43.410
JENNA TAYLOR: I love it.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.920
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
--we were talking

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.170
about a cool, single
subject cookbook.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.660
And even though it's
now two years later,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.200
it takes a little longer to make
a book than it does a website,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.315
but so here we are.

00:03:56.315 --> 00:03:57.690
And people are
still passionately

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.749
filling a room to learn
about sweet potatoes.

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:00.790
JENNA TAYLOR: Well, yeah.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.410
You didn't miss the wave.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.385
It's still going.

00:04:02.385 --> 00:04:03.420
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Oh, going strong.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.750
JENNA TAYLOR: I love it.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.740
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Got a bit bigger.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.910
JENNA TAYLOR: So what are
we going to make today?

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.326
MARY-FRANCES HECK: OK, so we're
going to make two recipes.

00:04:08.326 --> 00:04:09.930
One is healthier
than the other, just

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.410
because of the amount
of butter in it.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.470
JENNA TAYLOR: And that's totally
appropriate from a Google food

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.970
perspective.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.450
We believe in the 80/20 balance.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.380
So we'll give you
something good.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.620
Give you something bad for you.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.180
You need both in life.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.555
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
You don't have

00:04:19.555 --> 00:04:22.320
to put these in, like, Skittle
jars, or opaque or something?

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.810
JENNA TAYLOR: No, we'll allow
the sweet potatoes to exist

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.340
outside of the frosted window.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.360
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Thanks, guys.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.910
JENNA TAYLOR: OK, so--

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.790
JENNA TAYLOR: White
potatoes, frosted.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.330
MARY-FRANCES HECK: I'm going
to explain what I'm doing here.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.880
So this is a sweet potato.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.100
It is not a yam, first of all.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.030
JENNA TAYLOR: Anybody
know the difference?

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.220
MARY-FRANCES HECK: If
you know the difference--

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.960
JENNA TAYLOR: She has prizes.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.790
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
--you'll win a prize.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.695
AUDIENCE: Yams are only
from a certain state.

00:04:43.695 --> 00:04:46.320
JENNA TAYLOR: Yams are only from
a certain state, like bourbon?

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.903
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:04:46.903 --> 00:04:48.936
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
You are incorrect.

00:04:48.936 --> 00:04:49.477
AUDIENCE: Ah!

00:04:49.477 --> 00:04:50.610
JENNA TAYLOR: Ow!

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.730
MARY-FRANCES HECK: But you
are on the right track.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.914
JENNA TAYLOR: Anybody
else want to wager?

00:04:55.914 --> 00:04:57.363
AUDIENCE: Are yams from Asia?

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:58.870
JENNA TAYLOR: Yams
are from Asia?

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.390
MARY-FRANCES HECK: They are not.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.430
But they are in Asia.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.842
They're not
originally from Asia.

00:05:03.842 --> 00:05:04.550
JENNA TAYLOR: OK.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.040
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Anybody?

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.370
Anybody?

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.030
JENNA TAYLOR: Anybody else?

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.140
MARY-FRANCES HECK: This
is really a hard question.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.447
OK, so when I bought these--

00:05:08.447 --> 00:05:10.530
not these sweet potatoes,
but some sweet potatoes,

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.946
those sweet potatoes
at the store,

00:05:11.946 --> 00:05:14.640
they were all labeled as
yams, which is incorrect.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.420
OK, so in the 1930s, this
is where you are right,

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.550
the Louisiana sweet
potato growers

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.760
decided they wanted to market
the Beauregard sweet potato

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.030
different from their competitors
in Mississippi, North Carolina,

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.720
you know, elsewhere that
sweet potatoes are grown.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.720
So they started calling them
yams, OK, just as, like,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.680
a marketing idea.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.550
Yams are a thing
that grow elsewhere,

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.010
they're not sweet potatoes.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.635
So they just started calling
them yams, and it stuck.

00:05:40.635 --> 00:05:41.760
JENNA TAYLOR: What's a yam?

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.968
MARY-FRANCES HECK: So a yam--

00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:44.909
so what a sweet potato
is is a root vegetable.

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:45.700
JENNA TAYLOR: Sure.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.780
MARY-FRANCES HECK: OK, and
root vegetables carry fiber,

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.535
vitamins, sugar.

00:05:51.535 --> 00:05:53.410
JENNA TAYLOR: You tell
me yams grow on trees,

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.100
I'm going to fall over.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.600
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Yeah, so
yams also grow under the ground.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.110
They're something
called a tuber.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.510
You guys might be familiar
with another kind of tuber,

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.540
like a regular potato?

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.940
Solanaceous potatoes, I call
them, just for the distinction.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.840
So sweet potatoes--
so yams are--

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.684
OK, so tubers
carry white starch.

00:06:10.684 --> 00:06:12.100
That's an easy way
to remember it.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.020
So white starch is
metabolized straight to sugar,

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.040
not good for you.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.500
And in fact, once you
metabolize a potato,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.710
it's a little bit more sugar
than a sweet potato ever

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.580
would be.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.455
So you can taste the
sugar in a sweet potato.

00:06:25.455 --> 00:06:28.140
You can't taste the sugar
in a potato or in a yam

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.254
until you metabolize it.

00:06:29.254 --> 00:06:30.420
It's not converted to sugar.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.211
JENNA TAYLOR: Sure.

00:06:31.211 --> 00:06:33.870
MARY-FRANCES HECK: OK, so
a yam has a really dark

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.750
brown, bumpy, thick skin.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.820
And it is creamy
white on the inside.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.480
And it tastes, like, starchy,
like a regular potato or yucca,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.393
kind of.

00:06:43.393 --> 00:06:45.570
It's in the yucca, like,
not technically the family,

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.950
but whatever.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.190
Anyway, so they are
not related at all.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.780
And they're, in fact, different
anatomical parts of the plant.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.030
They do both grow underground.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.210
JENNA TAYLOR: Fascinating!

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.040
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
So there you go.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.150
So this sweet potato--

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.608
JENNA TAYLOR: My
takeaway from that

00:06:58.608 --> 00:07:01.240
is that sweet
potatoes are bourbon.

what I had last week was a sweet

potato vodka produced in--

MARY-FRANCES HECK: Right?

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.897
Come on, guys.

00:07:19.897 --> 00:07:21.480
OK, so what we're
going to make today,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.550
the first recipe is a galette,
which is kind of like a tart.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.502
And it's really easy
if you have a mandolin.

00:07:30.502 --> 00:07:32.460
JENNA TAYLOR: And you
don't cut your finger off

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.540
with your mandolin.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.560
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Yes, you definitely

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.150
should use a guard when you're
doing this unless you're

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.230
a trained professional.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.350
So basically, what you do is
set it to about a quarter inch,

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.389
and then you take your sweet
potato, and you just slice it.

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:45.930
This is a really great tool for
cutting any kind of vegetable

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:50.040
into attractive and delicious
small slices, thin slices.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.780
OK, so you have
your sweet potato.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.580
And then we have
some puff pastry.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.170
And this puff pastry is
about a one foot square,

00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:59.850
about a 12 inch square.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.520
And it is thawed,
because it comes

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.670
from the freezer, and
France, and from butter,

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.260
and a few other places.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.009

JENNA TAYLOR: It's baby

MARY-FRANCES HECK:
It's delicious.

00:08:12.864 --> 00:08:14.280
It is not the same
as a croissant,

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.930
but it's kind of close.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.510
So what you're going to do is
take your little sweet potato

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:22.240
slices and shingle them like so.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.240
This would be a great
time for another question,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.323
because it takes a minute.

00:08:25.323 --> 00:08:26.321
JENNA TAYLOR: Anybody?

00:08:26.321 --> 00:08:29.270

sweet potato that large before.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.560
MARY-FRANCES HECK: It's
a huge sweet potato.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.010
JENNA TAYLOR: That sweet potato
reminds you of a football,

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.480
and you're wondering why.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.289
Where does one find
football-sized sweet potatoes?

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:40.260
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Usually in food service.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.524
JENNA TAYLOR: Ah, we
get big everything here.

00:08:42.524 --> 00:08:44.440
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Yeah,
big old bags of rice.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:44.700
Bigger.

sweet potatoes.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.440
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Bigger.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.240
So these are some more
grocery store friendly size

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.110
of sweet potatoes.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.860
JENNA TAYLOR: Actually, more--

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.830
MARY-FRANCES HECK: It's a baby!

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:53.930
JENNA TAYLOR: It's
a baby sweet potato.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.638
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
But you will find that

00:08:55.638 --> 00:08:58.220
despite their different
sizes that they're

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.487
pretty much all the same.

00:08:59.487 --> 00:09:01.070
If they're small,
or if they're large,

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.230
they're going to taste
pretty much the same.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.438
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah, that
was what I was going to ask,

00:09:05.438 --> 00:09:08.090
is their flavor kind
of profiles differing

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.489
from variety to variety?

00:09:09.489 --> 00:09:11.780
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Definitely
from variety to variety--

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.556
I like to classify
potatoes by color.

00:09:14.556 --> 00:09:16.430
I think that's just the
easiest way to do it.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.221
JENNA TAYLOR: Sure.

00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:20.390
MARY-FRANCES HECK: And by color,
I mean the color of the flesh.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:20.900
JENNA TAYLOR: The insides.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.441
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Yeah, the insides.

00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:24.714
Because the skin can
be a little bit tricky.

00:09:24.714 --> 00:09:26.380
And I'll cut some
more open in a minute.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.670
But sometimes they can
be orange on the inside,

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.780
purple, or white.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.790
And that's just easy to
not go further than that.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.090
JENNA TAYLOR: So if the
grocery store mislabels them,

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.950
and the skin isn't
an indicator, how

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.000
does one divine the flesh
color of a sweet potato?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.500
MARY-FRANCES HECK: OK, I'm not
officially recommending this,

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.362
but, like, scratch a tiny
little bit of the skin

00:09:45.362 --> 00:09:47.570
off with your fingernail or
something in the grocery,

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.750
like, nick it.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:48.970
JENNA TAYLOR:

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.386
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
And you'll see.

00:09:50.386 --> 00:09:53.330
So thank you, Mallory, for
displaying how to do that.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.560

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:14.610
Well, I mean, you don't buy an
actual lemon, but beyond that.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.485
MARY-FRANCES HECK: That's
a different section

00:10:16.485 --> 00:10:17.830
of the produce department.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.150
OK, so a good sweet
potato will not

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.051
have any nicks or bumps
on the skin at all.

00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:24.050
JENNA TAYLOR: So no one
should have scratched it

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.670
to see what the flesh color is.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:26.870

I didn't recommend that.

MARY-FRANCES HECK: I officially
do not recommend this.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.800
So what you want to
do is just make sure

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.240
that the skin is pristine.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.070
It also should be
heavy for size,

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.290
which if you think about--

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.520
I think of water as
being heavy for size.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.510
I don't think of, like, chilies
as being heavy for size.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.560
You want make sure that--

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.351
occasionally, you'll
see that down the core

00:10:47.351 --> 00:10:49.280
of the sweet potato,
it's a little spongy.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.050
And what you don't want is that.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.420
So if they feel lighter than
that you think they should,

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.510
don't buy them.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:58.621

about the color thing,

pretty explicit about that.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.780
JENNA TAYLOR: OK.

Like, purple sweet potato,
orange sweet potato.

MARY-FRANCES HECK: It's gonna
be purple on the inside.

That's what they're
talking about, OK?

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.590
So white potatoes-- they
might be tan on the outside,

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.835
but they're going to
be white on the inside.

MARY-FRANCES HECK: Another
thing that's helpful

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.220
is if you're in a
Japanese grocery store

and you see a sweet potato that
has this white skin like this,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.010
and you see a sweet potato that
has this purple skin like this,

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.670
they're opposite on the inside.

JENNA TAYLOR: Only
in a Japanese market?

MARY-FRANCES HECK: Typically--
no definitive things

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.320

know what's going to happen.

they decide which things should

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:00.720

said that sentence in my life.

[BEEPING]

MARY-FRANCES HECK: Oh, stop it.

00:12:20.469 --> 00:12:22.010
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah,
the oven is mean.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:22.790
It doesn't care for me.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:23.373
But that's OK.

00:12:26.962 --> 00:12:28.670
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
OK, so about a quarter

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:34.620
of a little onion or a
shallot, little allium action.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.850
Sprinkle it over, just like
in the picture in the book.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.220
You can do it.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.277
OK.

00:12:46.277 --> 00:12:46.860
And what else?

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.735
We'll put some thyme.

00:12:52.384 --> 00:12:53.800
And with thyme,
don't worry if you

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.175
get little baby stems in there,
because it doesn't really

00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:56.840
matter.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.280
JENNA TAYLOR: I'm so glad you
said that, because picking--

00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.290
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Picking thyme's horrible.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.540
JENNA TAYLOR: Thyme is maybe
my least favorite kitchen

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.032
task of all time.

Every time anybody
wants to help me cook,

that's what they get to do.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.880
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Pick herbs.

JENNA TAYLOR: And
then they never ask me

00:13:08.546 --> 00:13:11.150
if they can help me ever again.

OK, sorry I'm moving
around so much.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:18.040
So one handy thing to do with
bacon, and it worked really

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.470
well this time,
is if you're going

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:26.010
to cut bacon into little
pieces that we call lardons--

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.870
they're French-- put
it in the freezer

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:33.449
for, like, 15 minutes
before you try to cut it.

00:13:33.449 --> 00:13:34.990
Because otherwise
it can be very soft

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.440
and your knife can
slip on the bacon,

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.940
and you can cut
yourself pretty badly.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.440
See?

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.180
It worked great.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.500
It's super firm.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.090
And so once the bacon is
a little bit firmed up,

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.509
just cut it into
these little pieces,

00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:54.050
and they're much
easier to cut, then.

00:13:58.523 --> 00:14:00.520
AUDIENCE: Does that
affect cooking time?

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.990
JENNA TAYLOR: Does that
affect cooking time?

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.310
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Cutting the bacon?

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.300
JENNA TAYLOR: No,
freezing the bacon.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.350
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Freezing the bacon-- not

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:06.050
for something like this.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.210
JENNA TAYLOR: Par
freezing, really.

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.350
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Yeah, I mean, you

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:09.974
can feel that if you
want to get gross.

But it's still kind of, I mean,
it's probably at 31 degrees.

use onion or shallot?

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.340

would use whatever I already

have in my kitchen.

It has a mild sweet flavor.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.221
They have a mild, sweet flavor.

00:14:54.221 --> 00:14:56.016
But they can be a
little trickier to find.

00:14:56.016 --> 00:14:57.640
And red onion, for
something like this,

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.260
is a pretty comparable flavor.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:14:59.874
OK.

00:14:59.874 --> 00:15:02.290
So I think we have everything
on this-- ooh, a little salt

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:03.970
and pepper.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.350

call cracked sweet potatoes

I liked you so much.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:05.170
MARY-FRANCES HECK: This is how
this dish actually came to be.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:08.859
I had been working on a
book about sweet potatoes.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:09.960
And I had a lot of--

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.339
JENNA TAYLOR: A bunch of
sweet potatoes, I bet.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:13.420
MARY-FRANCES HECK: I had
a lot of roasted-- like,

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.253
I had been roasting
sweet potatoes all week.

00:17:15.253 --> 00:17:16.650
And just till they were--

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:17.558
JENNA TAYLOR: Right.

00:17:17.558 --> 00:17:19.599
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Until
that recipe was correct.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:20.770
When you're working with
purple sweet potatoes,

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.020
you might want to wear gloves.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.609
Just because they're going
to turn your hands purple.

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:25.750
They could.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.659
OK, so I opened my fridge.

00:17:27.659 --> 00:17:29.200
I think I might have
had some friends

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.640
over for brunch or something.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.890
And I think everyone was
feeling pretty much like they

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.210
were hungry.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:38.210
And so I was, like,
what to feed people?

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.480
And there were the
sweet potatoes.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.550
And I had a bunch of
herbs and some chilies

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.470
and then some pantry stuff.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.300
And so that's where
this came from.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.952
And this is a
technique that when

00:17:49.952 --> 00:17:51.910
you have cold, leftover
roasted sweet potatoes.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.930
They're not great for
anything except this.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:57.130
They kind of crack.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:01.030
They're not going to
turn into a nice mash.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.040
But what they do
do well is crack,

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.289
and they're a little dry.

00:18:04.289 --> 00:18:05.830
And they're, like,
you take something

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.960
that's kind of unappetizing,
and make it really appetizing.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.470
JENNA TAYLOR: Are we making
sweet potato nachos right now?

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.678
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Basically.

00:18:11.678 --> 00:18:13.330
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh my
god, so exciting.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.091
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
With Thai flavors.

00:18:15.091 --> 00:18:17.340
JENNA TAYLOR: Could not be
happier about that outcome.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:17.805
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:18.346
There you go.

00:18:18.346 --> 00:18:19.900
OK, so one cool
thing about getting

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.730
a few colors of
sweet potatoes is

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:23.860
that they'll do all the
work for you in making

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.990
the plate look pretty.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:30.545
So you just have to remember to
wake up, put them on a plate.

00:18:30.545 --> 00:18:32.920
So, like I said, this is a
good breakfast or brunch dish.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.520
But also it's great for
dinner, like next to a roast.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.970
Or for your vegetarian
and or vegan friends

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:43.960
who are always hungry,
but never satisfied.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:44.890
Am I right?

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.640
JENNA TAYLOR: Write
that one down, please.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.260
It's going in.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:47.760
Yeah.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.897
That's a good one.

00:18:48.897 --> 00:18:50.980
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Yeah,
I live with a vegetarian.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.447
So it's OK that I said that.

00:18:53.447 --> 00:18:55.780
JENNA TAYLOR: We feed many
vegans and vegetarians daily.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.490
MARY-FRANCES HECK: And I think
it's a really nice choice

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:58.240
for your life.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.520
But I think that they're left--

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.970
those who are not partaking
in the meat stuff--

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:07.210
can get really hungry and never
feel like they've had enough.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.992
JENNA TAYLOR: Truer
words never spoken.

00:19:08.992 --> 00:19:10.960
AUDIENCE: So I saw
you were [INAUDIBLE]??

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.360
MARY-FRANCES HECK: So how
to peel a sweet potato--

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.280
once it's roasted,
oftentimes the skin

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.105
will be loose on the outside.

00:19:17.105 --> 00:19:18.730
And you can just peel
it off like that.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:19.600
You might want to wear gloves.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.370
They can be a little
sticky, and like I

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.442
said, for the purple
ones, especially.

00:19:23.442 --> 00:19:25.150
That said, if you just
had a paring knife

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.250
and you wanted to peel it off,
it usually comes off in strips.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.390
It's pretty clean.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.250
And if they've been
roasted correctly,

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.740
the flesh should have
dehydrated a little bit,

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.750
and therefore shrunk
away from the skin.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.057
And so you're left
with a loose skin.

00:19:38.057 --> 00:19:40.640
If you were to peel-- we didn't
actually peel the sweet potato

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.660
in front of you all.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.910
But I would just recommend
a regular vegetable peeler.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.950
And you could go
around once or twice,

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.590
depending on how many of
these little bumps and eyes

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:49.400
that you get.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.310
You can also totally
eat sweet potato skins.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.570
Some people just don't
love the texture.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.130
And we could have the
skin in this dish as well.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.860
I just don't love the texture.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.320
Sorry, YouTube.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:06.030
OK, so then you made a little
vinaigrette kind of a thing.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.520
So far, this is what we've done.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.230
JENNA TAYLOR: Beautiful.

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.271
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Put
sweet potatoes on a plate.

00:20:10.271 --> 00:20:11.500
Anyone can do this.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.080
I hope.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.580
I hope.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.710
OK, so get our
pan a little warm.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:19.370
And we are going to melt--
this is coconut oil.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.450
And once it melts, it's
going to smell really good.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.204
JENNA TAYLOR: So tell me,
I was wondering earlier.

00:20:30.204 --> 00:20:31.161
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Yes?

00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:33.169
JENNA TAYLOR: Sweet
potatoes, are they seasonal

00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:34.960
or can you really eat
them all year around?

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.270
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
You can definitely

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.992
get them all year round.

00:20:38.992 --> 00:20:40.200
And because of the way that--

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.590
JENNA TAYLOR: I know
you can, but should you?

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.180
MARY-FRANCES HECK: You should.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.130
I think you should.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.460
JENNA TAYLOR: Great.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.530
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Yeah.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.580
You should eat them every day.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.570
You will find- OK-- so
they're harvested, truly,

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:50.830
let's say in October.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:54.050
That's relatively true
for most of this country.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.110
They are also harvested
in other parts

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.240
of the world at
different times of year,

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.640
just depending on
their growing calendar.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.110
And so it is possible to find
relatively fresh sweet potatoes

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:06.080
all year round.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.920
You also can find sweet potatoes
that are like a year old

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.510
and have that weird spongy
thing going on in the middle.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.010
And so what I
recommend is if you're

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:16.570
between the months of like
July and that fresh season

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.145
of October, soon as you
get home with your bag

00:21:19.145 --> 00:21:21.250
of sweet potatoes,
cut one in half.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:21.940
And you'll see.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.560
And if they're
lousy, return them.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.570
Or you can eat
them, they're just

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.340
not going to be as delicious.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.290
They are super shelf stable.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.480
They are held in
storage facilities

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.844
that are going to keep them
fresh until they get to market.

00:21:34.844 --> 00:21:37.510
I recommend not buying them more
than about two weeks before you

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.370
want to use them, because
they will have been out

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.800
of that storage facility and
sitting in a grocery store.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.667
So also, when you get them
home, store them in a basket.

00:21:44.667 --> 00:21:46.750
I think that's the perfect
thing to store them in.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.250
They need to have
a little air flow.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:53.490
You never want to let them
get wet or cold or too hot.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.860
JENNA TAYLOR: Right in the
middle, not wet, not cold,

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.844
not hot, air flow.

00:21:57.844 --> 00:21:59.010
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Air flow.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:21:59.670
JENNA TAYLOR: It's
totally doable.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:00.470
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Just like a person,

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:01.890
like where a person wants to be.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:02.320
JENNA TAYLOR: That's
what I was thinking.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.470
I was like that's
pretty much how I feel.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.070
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
So we have melted--

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.570
JENNA TAYLOR: Our
six minutes is up.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:09.490
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
--thank you very much.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:14.880
Melted coconut oil that's
not quite hot enough,

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.680
it should sizzle
when it hits the pan.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.221
So I just threw some
ginger in there.

00:22:18.221 --> 00:22:20.470
We'll give it a second,
and just like that.

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:25.480
I think we need one more minute,
one more minute on the egg.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.100
OK, great, so it's sizzling.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:33.550
And we'll add some
little rings of chilies.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.390
And if you don't
like spicy food,

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:39.290
I recommend you don't
put chilies in this.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:40.839
And we have some
scallion whites.

00:22:40.839 --> 00:22:43.380
That's a cool thing you can do
when you're chopping scallions

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.520
is chop the white bulb,
essentially like the first four

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.660
inches near the root, take the
root off, slice that white.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.650
Separate it from the green.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.990
Use the white when
you're cooking,

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.850
and then use the
green as a garnish.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:58.290
It's kind of a
simple thing to do

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.120
that can elevate your
food a little bit

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.520
at home, simple touch.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.580
JENNA TAYLOR: Love it.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:03.920
MARY-FRANCES HECK: OK.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.294
JENNA TAYLOR:
Smells like heaven.

00:23:05.294 --> 00:23:07.710
MARY-FRANCES HECK: So we've
got our ginger, our chilies,

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:10.700
and our scallion whites
cooking in this oil.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.280
And what you want to look
for is when they start,

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.810
the chilies and
the ginger, start

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.160
to become sort of translucent.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.370
We don't really want
to brown anything.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.790
We're just looking for them
to be soft, and really,

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.830
for all of their
beautiful aroma to have

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:29.080
been released into the room.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.180
OK, and then you turn off
the stove because we're done.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.860
See, that was super easy.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.300
So for today's demo, we're
going to do it vegan style.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.967
Ordinarily, I would use a little
bit of fish sauce in this dish.

00:23:41.967 --> 00:23:43.924
Today we're going to a
little bit of soy sauce.

00:23:43.924 --> 00:23:44.970
It's just a splash.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.678
If you don't like
either of those things,

00:23:46.678 --> 00:23:49.370
you can also just use
a large pinch of salt.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:53.260
But it's value added
salt, basically.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.590
And then we have some
brown sugar, again,

00:23:55.590 --> 00:24:00.810
so that the dish remains
vegan, we could also use honey.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:04.730
And once the sugar sort
of starts to dissolve,

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.990
we're going to add lime juice.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:09.690
And that's what makes it
a citronette as opposed

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:10.842
to a vinaigrette.

00:24:13.139 --> 00:24:14.430
And just give it a little stir.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.070
And taste it.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:33.090
You want this to be savory,
which means salt as opposed

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:36.080
to a lot of sugar.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:36.780
OK.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.440
So now we have our citronette
that has everything in it.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.255
We're going to spoon it over
the sweet potatoes like so.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.710
For a total of 30
seconds of cook time,

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.889
people might be impressed.

00:24:51.889 --> 00:24:53.430
JENNA TAYLOR: It's
visually stunning.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.359
It smells amazing.

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:55.900
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Hope it tastes OK.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.369
JENNA TAYLOR: Hitting on
several important components.

00:24:58.369 --> 00:24:59.910
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
OK, so once you're

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:01.920
warm citronette
is on there, we're

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:09.200
going to dress it up
with some toasted coconut

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.780
and those scallion greens
that we kept separate

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.941
so they stay vibrant and
delicious and crunchy.

00:25:14.941 --> 00:25:16.940
And then we're going to
tear a little mint over.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:22.147
You could also use basil or Thai
basil, or any soft tender herb

00:25:22.147 --> 00:25:22.730
that you have.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:26.030
Cilantro would be
awesome in this, whatever

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:27.020
you have in the fridge.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.270
JENNA TAYLOR: Truly,
truly beautiful,

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.520
I mean that's a stunning dish.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.780
Especially, as you were saying,
for the vegan who might feel

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:33.570
neglected.

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.929
MARY-FRANCES HECK: The
sweet potatoes did, you saw,

00:25:35.929 --> 00:25:36.470
all the work.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.800
JENNA TAYLOR: All the work.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.870
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Yeah.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:38.810
OK, so there you go.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:41.107
Great side dish, great any
time of day when you're--

00:25:41.107 --> 00:25:42.065
JENNA TAYLOR: Gorgeous.

00:25:42.065 --> 00:25:42.860
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
--ripping it out

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.825
of the fridge because
you're starving.

00:25:44.825 --> 00:25:46.040
JENNA TAYLOR: What do
you think about that egg?

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:46.875
Maybe done?

00:25:46.875 --> 00:25:50.000
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Hm, I
think you might be right.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:50.690
Oh, yeah, OK.

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.720
So this is actually perfect, It
took a little bit longer than--

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.220
woo!

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.100
I need goggles.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.412
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:56.412 --> 00:25:57.620
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Wow, guys.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.930
OK, so what you want to see--

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:04.730
so our egg is now, essentially,
over easy, OK, from the oven.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.760
What you want to see is the
white is still a little jiggly.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.370
As it sits here and kind of
cools, it's going to firm up.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:13.690
But your yolk will
still be runny.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:15.680
JENNA TAYLOR: Well,
that's perfect.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.704
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Anybody
here not like eggs?

00:26:17.704 --> 00:26:18.370
Just a question.

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.161
JENNA TAYLOR: I couldn't
tell by your face.

00:26:20.161 --> 00:26:21.950
You looked like you
were super into it.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.470
MARY-FRANCES HECK: So
what's really appetizing

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:28.910
for many people is this thing.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:32.037
When you have the egg yolk, and
it runs all over the place--

00:26:32.037 --> 00:26:34.370
JENNA TAYLOR: You could, like,
take some on that pastry.

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.700
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
--on to your tart.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:35.210
JENNA TAYLOR: And dunk
it right in there.

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:35.990
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Exactly, exactly.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:38.702
JENNA TAYLOR: Looks like
a really fantastic option.

00:26:38.702 --> 00:26:40.410
MARY-FRANCES HECK: So
there you have it--

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.249
two sweet potato dishes
that you know how to make.

00:26:43.249 --> 00:26:45.040
JENNA TAYLOR: They're
gorgeous and amazing.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.670
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Set this up here.

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:48.086
JENNA TAYLOR: Did
you guys realize

00:26:48.086 --> 00:26:51.980
that you get to eat some of
it, which makes it even better?

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.990
Super impressive-- I
think we're getting

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:55.210
close to being able to serve.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:56.334
Do you guys have questions?

00:26:56.334 --> 00:26:58.180
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Yeah, more questions.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:58.680
Yes?

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.375
AUDIENCE: So for
the nacho thing?

00:27:01.375 --> 00:27:02.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.120
JENNA TAYLOR: I'm sorry.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.065
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
That's exactly, yeah.

00:27:05.065 --> 00:27:07.490
AUDIENCE: Did you heat up the
sweet potatoes for it, or--

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:08.600
JENNA TAYLOR: Did you
heat the sweet potatoes?

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:08.768
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
These sweet potatoes

00:27:08.768 --> 00:27:10.640
are room temperature,
which I like.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.080
But you could use this thing
called a microwave to heat them

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.890
up for about 30 seconds.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:18.975
You can also like to
toss them in a pan.

00:27:18.975 --> 00:27:21.350
It's just the pretty colors
will start to bleed together.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:23.510
So it's nice to warm them
up separately, if possible.

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:24.020
Yes?

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:24.812
JENNA TAYLOR: Sure.

00:27:24.812 --> 00:27:26.311
AUDIENCE: Adding
onto that question,

00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:27.620
you said that those were baked.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:29.650
Would you ever foil
a sweet potato?

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.150
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:32.300
JENNA TAYLOR: Would you
foil a sweet potato?

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.633
MARY-FRANCES HECK: If you'll
turn to the first chapter--

00:27:34.633 --> 00:27:36.040
JENNA TAYLOR: [LAUGHS]

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.706
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
So the first chapter,

00:27:37.706 --> 00:27:41.480
I sort of tried to address how
to cook sweet potatoes when

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:45.300
you want to cook them with no
other ingredients, for example.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.820
It's called In The
Rough, which just

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.980
means all you're going
to use is a sweet potato

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.940
and occasionally, a
little bit of oil.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:55.190
And so it overviews recipes
for how to roast them,

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.430
how to roast them in coals,
which I highly recommend.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:00.997
Really, really delicious,
it kind of has that, like,

00:28:00.997 --> 00:28:03.080
toasted marshmallow thing
without the marshmallow.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:03.920
JENNA TAYLOR: Without
the marshmallows.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.640
MARY-FRANCES HECK: No
marshmallows allowed.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.360
JENNA TAYLOR: Because
you don't need them.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.401
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Mm hm.

00:28:06.401 --> 00:28:09.080
But the caramel will start to
bubble out of the sweet potato

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.200
and char, oh, so good.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.310
JENNA TAYLOR: I'm sold.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:14.726
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
And then boiled

00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:17.570
potatoes, which you can then
turn into a sweet potato puree.

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:21.530
It's fine, also, to make sweet
potato puree roasting them

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.280
in the microwave,
which can be quick.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.300
And some people don't
like microwaves.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.920
I'm not one of those people.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.610
I think that they
really make life easy,

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.443
especially when you're
cooking for a family.

00:28:31.443 --> 00:28:33.410
So you roast them
in the microwave

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:37.010
for approximately five
minute increments,

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.714
for two or three increments, so
anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes,

00:28:39.714 --> 00:28:40.880
depending on your microwave.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.130
Then you scoop them
open, take the flesh out.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:47.395
And then use the sweet potato
puree for eating or baking,

00:28:47.395 --> 00:28:48.770
which we'll get
into in a second.

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.414
Are we OK on time?

00:28:50.414 --> 00:28:51.830
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah,
I don't really

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.030
know because I'm
having a good time.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:55.100
And Laura, Laura will tell
me if we're good on time.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:55.690
Yeah, we're good.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:56.731
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Flash.

00:28:56.731 --> 00:28:58.330
OK, so then sweet potato fries.

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:01.480
And we kind of outline the
easy way and the hard way.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.040
And the easy way is
just oven roasting, OK?

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.030
It's really easy.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:05.510
JENNA TAYLOR: Not crispy?

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.890
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
You can do it.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.350
Sort of crispy for the
first five minutes, ish.

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:10.730
Yeah, it's very satisfying.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:11.510
JENNA TAYLOR: Crispy adjacent.

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:13.770
MARY-FRANCES HECK: A quick
side dish, I highly recommend.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:14.000
JENNA TAYLOR: Fair enough.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.900
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
I highly recommend.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.370
JENNA TAYLOR: And
then the hard way?

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:18.036
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
The hard way involves

00:29:18.036 --> 00:29:20.480
cutting them, freezing
them, and then dipping them

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.820
into a cornstarch slurry, which
is a dissolved, modified food

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:26.630
starch.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:29.900
And what that does, where sweet
potato fries or sweet potatoes

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.090
don't have the same
amount of starch

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.670
as white potatoes or
Solanaceous potatoes,

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:36.830
it provides the
starch on the outside

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.960
of the fry to get that crunch.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.000
It's essentially sort of
like a tempura batter,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.969
but it's really thin, and
it just coats the outside.

00:29:44.969 --> 00:29:46.760
They also will stay
crispy for like an hour

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:47.730
after they're cooked.

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:48.980
JENNA TAYLOR: That is amazing.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:49.700
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
You have to fry.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:50.908
Get over your fear of frying.

00:29:50.908 --> 00:29:51.740
You can do it.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.036
Open a window, though, if
you're in an apartment.

00:29:54.036 --> 00:29:55.327
JENNA TAYLOR: Put on a fan.

00:29:55.327 --> 00:29:55.910
Open a window.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:57.260
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Yeah.

00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:01.002
Which brings me next to chips,
which are very tasty as well.

00:30:01.002 --> 00:30:02.960
Very easy to make, and
way better than anything

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.897
you can buy.

00:30:03.897 --> 00:30:04.730
JENNA TAYLOR: Noted.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:06.270
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Yeah, way better.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.525
You soak them in
water, ice water,

00:30:08.525 --> 00:30:12.610
which helps to sort of equalize
every slice of sweet potato,

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:14.390
washes off any surface starch.

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:18.560
And then dry them and deep fry
them, and they're really great.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.922
JENNA TAYLOR: So many thoughts.

00:30:19.922 --> 00:30:21.580
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
I could go on.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:22.370
JENNA TAYLOR: You could go on.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:23.900
MARY-FRANCES HECK: OK,
so purple potatoes,

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.900
something about chips
with purple sweet potatoes

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.110
is that they're
also really good.

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:31.490
But the pigment that makes
sweet potatoes purple

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:32.792
is water soluble.

00:30:32.792 --> 00:30:33.500
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.850
MARY-FRANCES HECK: So
we're talking about--

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.080
JENNA TAYLOR: You can
wash away the purple?

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.288
MARY-FRANCES HECK: You can
wash away the purple, yes.

00:30:38.288 --> 00:30:40.310
And it's not cute
while it happens.

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:42.800
It's kind of a gray
purple thing that happens.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:43.580
It's really gross.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.830
So if you tried to just
boil purple sweet potatoes.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:47.180
The water would turn purple.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.477
The sweet potatoes would
bleed out some of their color.

00:30:50.477 --> 00:30:51.560
And it's just kind of sad.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.640
You have this
beautiful vegetable.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.131
Showcase it the
best way possible.

00:30:54.131 --> 00:30:55.130
JENNA TAYLOR: Seriously.

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.790
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
You can roast them

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:57.920
whole like this, where they're
just cooked in their jackets,

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.720
and they're not in
contact with any water.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.250
JENNA TAYLOR: I really like
that you just said jackets.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.975
Sweet potato got a
cute pea coat for fall.

00:31:05.975 --> 00:31:08.100
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Actually,
if you go to Ireland--

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.640
or one time, I went to
Ireland, and I ordered potatoes

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.420
in their jackets.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.271
And they were just boiled
little baby new potatoes.

00:31:14.271 --> 00:31:15.770
JENNA TAYLOR: Cutest
menu item ever.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:17.519
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Great way to call them.

00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:20.330
So but deep frying-- so if
you slice the sweet potatoes,

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:22.050
even though you're
soaking them in water,

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:23.610
they'll still have
enough pigment.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.193
And then you fry
them, you have these,

00:31:25.193 --> 00:31:27.650
like, incredible purple chips.

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:29.990
So fun, so easy to
make for a party.

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:32.240
You can dust them with
curry powder or something,

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.650
really, really tasty.

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:35.660
JENNA TAYLOR:
Mentally taking notes.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.260
MARY-FRANCES HECK: So after
you've boiled your orange sweet

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:44.590
potatoes or white ones,
sometimes, you can mash them,

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.580
and take the resulting puree--

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:52.380
and if you'll turn
with me to page 105,

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.800
there's a whole chapter
on how to make bread

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.400
with sweet potatoes,
Breads and Baked Goods.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.679
So you have biscuits,
babka, waffles, I mean--

00:32:01.679 --> 00:32:02.470
JENNA TAYLOR: Stop.

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:03.180
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
--you could go on.

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:04.380
JENNA TAYLOR: I mean.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.490
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Sticky
buns, cinnamon rolls,

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:10.410
dinner rolls, highly
recommend for Thanksgiving,

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:11.980
yeah, like this.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.682
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh, pull
apart and everything.

00:32:14.682 --> 00:32:16.140
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
So yeah, you can

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.348
do a lot with sweet potatoes.

00:32:17.348 --> 00:32:20.550
JENNA TAYLOR: Clearly, I mean,
I think you've proven that.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.290
How is it, delicious?

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:22.740
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
[WHISPERING] Is it OK?

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.060
JENNA TAYLOR: Everybody
got super quiet,

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.470
and that's always the best
sign when the food's around.

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:27.636
And does anybody else, yeah?

00:32:27.636 --> 00:32:28.200
Question?

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:32.132
How do you avoid the
misbranding yam scam?

00:32:32.132 --> 00:32:33.090
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Yep.

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:34.810
That's exactly what it is.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:35.640
It's a yam scam.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.660
JENNA TAYLOR: See
what I did there?

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.035
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
So today I was

00:32:38.035 --> 00:32:41.130
going to bring you a yam so that
we could look at them together

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:42.840
and realize that they
are, in fact, not

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.270
at all related visually.

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:46.800
I couldn't find one.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.550
JENNA TAYLOR: That's
what I was going to say.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.470
Are they really present
in most grocery stores?

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:51.120
MARY-FRANCES HECK: I went to
six grocery stores yesterday.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.260
JENNA TAYLOR: So,
no is the answer.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.426
MARY-FRANCES HECK: I went
to everything from Safeway

00:32:54.426 --> 00:32:58.660
to a Japanese grocery store
to a Latino grocery store.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.660
You could maybe find them
in a Caribbean grocery

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.940
store, which I didn't find
a Caribbean grocery store.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:03.540
JENNA TAYLOR: The
only place I've

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.647
seen a true yam is
the Berkeley Bowl.

00:33:05.647 --> 00:33:06.980
MARY-FRANCES HECK: There you go.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:07.290
Yeah.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:07.650
Or maybe--

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:09.650
JENNA TAYLOR: But they have
all of the things, so--

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:10.649
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Yeah.

00:33:10.649 --> 00:33:14.280
I found yucca and a couple
other sort of similar tubers.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.780
JENNA TAYLOR: So risk is low.

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:16.110
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Risk is low.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:17.070
JENNA TAYLOR: Of
getting yam scammed.

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:18.300
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Point being, when

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.383
you go to the grocery store
and sweet potatoes are

00:33:20.383 --> 00:33:22.830
labeled as yams, don't worry.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.265
You have not purchased a yam.

00:33:25.265 --> 00:33:26.640
JENNA TAYLOR: I
feel pretty safe.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:26.790
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Yeah.

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:27.550
JENNA TAYLOR: I
think it'll be OK.

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:30.175
MARY-FRANCES HECK: They'll never
be in a typical grocery store,

00:33:30.175 --> 00:33:32.414
or not yet, maybe in the future.

00:33:32.414 --> 00:33:33.580
JENNA TAYLOR: Anything else?

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:34.080
Anybody?

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.990
JENNA TAYLOR: Are
different sweet potatoes

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:38.670
better for different
applications?

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:40.128
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Yes, absolutely.

00:33:40.128 --> 00:33:41.460
So that's a great question.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.640
And I'd point your attention
to the introduction

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.770
for a little bit more
further explanation.

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:48.870
But I had mentioned
before that I typically

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:52.620
think of sweet potatoes by
color, color of their flesh.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.560
And you'll find that orange
sweet potatoes typically

00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:00.210
have more moisture inherent
than white sweet potatoes

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:01.714
or purple sweet potatoes.

00:34:01.714 --> 00:34:02.880
And so they're really great.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.820
So when you think of a high
moisture or a low moisture

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.964
item, you want to cook
it the opposite way.

00:34:07.964 --> 00:34:09.630
So you want something
to be-- especially

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.639
if you want something to
be moist and toothsome

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:13.839
and have a great texture
when it's done cooking,

00:34:13.839 --> 00:34:15.880
unless you're frying,
which is a different thing.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:21.420
But I really love to roast
whole orange sweet potatoes just

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.699
to have as a side dish.

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:26.340
If you roast a
purple sweet potato,

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.620
you'll actually get more of what
you're eating right now, which

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:29.580
is a little bit dry.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.413
It's almost-- I think
it's almost the flavor

00:34:31.413 --> 00:34:33.449
and the texture of a chestnut.

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:37.830
It's leaning more in that
really toothsome, almost dry,

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.239
but not unpleasantly.

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:42.850
So I think that I love
purple sweet potatoes

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:46.300
baked in their jackets for
this type of application.

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.850
But if you wanted
to get a puree,

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.310
I'd suggest cooking them
in tiny little bit of water

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:51.659
with a lid jammed on it.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:53.909
And they'll essentially
steam, and that's a great way

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:57.150
to do it, so steaming them.

00:34:57.150 --> 00:35:00.240
And then white sweet
potatoes are awesome.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.350
They're quite dry.

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:02.933
We don't actually
have one here today.

00:35:02.933 --> 00:35:05.042
We have a sample of one.

00:35:05.042 --> 00:35:08.220
I'm going to cut these open
so you can see the insides.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.920
White sweet potatoes
tend to be quite dry.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.580
And I really love
them in braises.

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.350
This is a sweet potato.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:19.620
And this is a variety
called Hannah.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.350
And it's a palindrome,
H-A-N-N-A-H.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:26.520
And the variety you'll find
on the East Coast is usually

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.745
O'Henry.

00:35:28.745 --> 00:35:31.120
There are a hundred varieties
of sweet potatoes at least.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.350
So don't worry if you don't
know their exact names.

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:37.540
This is a garnet.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:41.010
And so you'll find the
rusty red typically

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:44.370
leads to orange flesh,
except for in the case

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:45.922
of the Japanese sweet potato.

00:35:45.922 --> 00:35:47.880
So as you can see, the
flesh is really similar,

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.453
but the skins are very
different from one another.

00:35:51.453 --> 00:35:53.786
I'm just going to keep walking
around time to kill time,

00:35:53.786 --> 00:35:54.285
you know.

00:35:54.285 --> 00:35:55.470
There you go.

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:59.580
And then, yes, so
white sweet potatoes

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.740
and Japanese sweet potatoes
are wonderful braised.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.530
So I love cooking them with--

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:07.462
I think our first tart's done.

00:36:07.462 --> 00:36:08.450
Look at that.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:15.060
So you can cook them
in a flavorful liquid.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.350
I love cooking them
with sausage and beans.

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:20.490
And a braise would mean
about that much liquid

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:23.050
in the bottom of a pot with
other flavorful things.

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:26.160
And the white sweet potatoes
absorb the flavor beautifully.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:30.030
And you'll find that if
you try to substitute

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.620
orange sweet potatoes
in that recipe,

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.322
there's a recipe for
braised sausage and lentils,

00:36:34.322 --> 00:36:36.780
that the orange sweet potatoes
are going to absolutely fall

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:37.950
apart in a braise.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.870
White sweet potatoes
will keep their shape,

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.775
and they'll become almost
silky, really nice.

00:36:42.775 --> 00:36:44.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.230
JENNA TAYLOR: Is the
canned yam a yam?

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:48.225
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:48.225 --> 00:36:49.350
I'm going to guess no.

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:50.790
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
So a fun fact,

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.430
as someone who's
now written a book

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:56.310
about sweet potatoes, the
first sweet potato I ever ate

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:57.150
was from a can.

00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:57.859
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh!

00:36:57.859 --> 00:36:59.691
MARY-FRANCES HECK: And
I strong armed my dad

00:36:59.691 --> 00:37:01.240
into buying them
for Thanksgiving.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.340
He was, like, we don't--

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.230
like, it's not part of
their family lexicon

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.630
to have sweet
potatoes, or foodicon--

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:07.440
JENNA TAYLOR: OK.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.610
MARY-FRANCES HECK: --to have
sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving,

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:10.276
because my family is
not from the South.

00:37:10.276 --> 00:37:12.390
So it's one of those
typical recipes

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:15.345
that you find that's like an
heirloom recipe for casseroles

00:37:15.345 --> 00:37:15.975
and pies.

00:37:15.975 --> 00:37:16.320
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.380
MARY-FRANCES HECK: And so,
yes, my first sweet potato

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.520
was a canned yam.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.127
But my recipes are not
Southern based recipes.

00:37:24.127 --> 00:37:25.710
They're really how
to incorporate them

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.529
into the way we eat now.

00:37:27.529 --> 00:37:29.070
And they're not--
you could certainly

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:31.028
serve some of these dishes
during the holidays.

00:37:31.028 --> 00:37:33.000
But the intention
is not that they

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.414
are for the holidays--
for every day.

00:37:35.414 --> 00:37:36.330
JENNA TAYLOR: Awesome.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:39.090
So the canned yam, not a yam?

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.719
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Sweet potato,
not a yam, a sweet potato.

00:37:41.719 --> 00:37:43.260
JENNA TAYLOR: The
yam scam continues.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.475
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:44.475 --> 00:37:46.890
Even in canned products.

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:47.880
Any other questions?

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] butter?

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:49.530
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Butter.

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:52.260
JENNA TAYLOR: What's the best
fat to make them super creamy?

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.130
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
I love butter.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:53.700
JENNA TAYLOR: Every
bit of the butter.

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.680
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Sweet
potatoes love butter.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.130
JENNA TAYLOR: They told me.

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:56.760
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
There's a sidebar

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.710
in there somewhere
that literally

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.930
is, like, sweet
potato hearts butter.

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:05.280
And it's wonderful with
coconut oil, I think.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:08.066
And anything else that
has inherent flavor.

00:38:08.066 --> 00:38:10.440
I'm not the craziest about
olive oil with sweet potatoes.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.189
Like a really good
extra virgin olive oil,

00:38:12.189 --> 00:38:13.990
save that for regular potatoes.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.840
I think sweet potatoes
have a lot of--

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.520
JENNA TAYLOR: Or don't eat
regular potatoes, either way.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.550
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Oh, I
mean, whatever you want.

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:18.810
Oh, here's a good one, too.

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:22.140
So regular potatoes
are often grown using

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.620
a large quantity of chemicals.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.740
They're part of
conventional farming,

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.319
so they have either
herbicides or pesticides.

00:38:29.319 --> 00:38:31.110
There are a couple of
bugs that really love

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:33.930
to eat Solanaceous potatoes.

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.930
And you know, just in order
for there to be a crop,

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:40.140
it needs to have some chemical
intervention, which I mean,

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.060
sometimes we all do.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.350
JENNA TAYLOR: I mean.

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:45.183
MARY-FRANCES HECK: So
it's not a great habit

00:38:45.183 --> 00:38:48.749
to be in to eat,
particularly like russet.

00:38:48.749 --> 00:38:50.290
And I'm not downing
any kind of food.

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:51.292
I love potatoes.

00:38:51.292 --> 00:38:53.250
I wrote a whole column
about potatoes, obsessed

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:54.180
with potatoes personally.

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:54.980
JENNA TAYLOR: Do
sweet potatoes know

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.646
you cheated on them
with white potatoes?

00:38:56.646 --> 00:38:57.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:59.331
MARY-FRANCES HECK: White
potatoes came first, OK?

00:38:59.331 --> 00:39:00.060
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh!

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.830
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
But sweet potatoes

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:04.140
can be grown without much
chemical intervention.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:08.729
They don't have a ton of natural
pests in the wild, so to speak.

00:39:08.729 --> 00:39:10.770
That is changing a little
bit due to monoculture.

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:13.710
But if you look at these lists,
like the Clean 15 and the Dirty

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:16.980
Dozen, typically, potatoes
tend to be on the Dirty Dozen

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.320
and sweet potatoes tend
to be a Clean 15 product.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.290
Which is great for a
socioeconomic approach

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:25.080
to good eating, because
you don't have to seek out

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.190
organic sweet potatoes.

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:29.220
You can just buy regular sweet
potatoes and save the buck.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.140
JENNA TAYLOR: So
they're a superfood

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:34.230
that is naturally low
in a type of pesticides

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:35.970
and really affordable
for everybody.

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:37.150
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Really
affordable for everybody.

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.872
And so I think it's one of
the superfoods that, you know,

00:39:39.872 --> 00:39:41.580
we hear about all
these different things.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.538
But they're really
expensive for the most part.

00:39:43.538 --> 00:39:46.050
It's really hard to
incorporate super foods

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:46.967
in your everyday diet.

00:39:46.967 --> 00:39:49.008
And so that's why I feel
very passionately, also,

00:39:49.008 --> 00:39:51.270
about people eating sweet
potatoes, learning about how

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:54.400
nutritious they are, and then
being able to incorporate them

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:54.900
every day.

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.610
JENNA TAYLOR: Can we call in
the sweet potatoes' publicist

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:59.040
and have them, like, hype the
superfood angle a bit more?

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.360
Because I feel like
this is the first time

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.160
I've actually heard that.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:01.670
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Really, yeah.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:02.640
I mean, and I think,
in particular,

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.515
the purple sweet potatoes
are one of the most

00:40:04.515 --> 00:40:06.270
nutritious things you can eat.

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:09.720
I mean, of all the things
that come right out of a plant

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:12.060
or out of the ground,
they're super nutritious.

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:13.360
JENNA TAYLOR: Well, that's
great piece of information.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.830
I really do hope that that
gets more widely understood.

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:16.330
Because--

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:18.496
MARY-FRANCES HECK: And one
more cool thing about why

00:40:18.496 --> 00:40:19.380
they're so healthy--

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:22.720
so sweet potatoes are
really high in fiber,

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.260
which is great for
diets that are for folks

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:29.850
who have diabetic diets or
maybe high cholesterol or heart

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:30.670
issues.

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:33.414
So they're trying to eat
more fiber, which helps to--

00:40:33.414 --> 00:40:34.830
the best way to
describe it, like,

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:36.204
everyone's, like,
eat more fiber.

00:40:36.204 --> 00:40:37.350
You're, like, why?

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:41.080
Because it kind of slows
down and evens out digestion.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.080
So when you eat a bunch
of food, 'cause you only

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.140
have a little time to grab
lunch, delicious as it may be,

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.580
your insulin will spike, right?

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:51.410
But the more good stuff that
you eat that has fiber in it,

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:52.920
and I'm not talking
about Metamucil,

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.200
I'm talking about
foods with fiber--

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.180
JENNA TAYLOR: Naturally
occurring, organic fiber, yeah.

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:58.638
MARY-FRANCES HECK: --although
get it, get it where you can.

00:40:58.638 --> 00:41:00.240
But sweet potatoes
have the ability

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.220
to kind of even out digestion.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.230
And so you're not
having an insulin spike,

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:05.527
and then a crash later on.

00:41:05.527 --> 00:41:07.860
You'll find that after having
a meal with a sweet potato

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.990
as a side dish, or any of
these 60 recipes in this book,

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:14.109
that you kind of feel
even keeled afterwards.

00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:15.400
JENNA TAYLOR: Sustained energy.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:15.800
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Exactly.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:16.260
JENNA TAYLOR:
Yeah, that's great.

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:16.460
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Yeah.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:17.790
JENNA TAYLOR: That's
important, I think, especially.

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:19.880
We think about that a lot
here, because we feed you lunch

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.260
and then need you
to go be geniuses

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:22.220
for the second half of the day.

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:24.460
So sustained energy is
really, really important.

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:25.430
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Yeah,
yeah, they're great for that.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:26.346
JENNA TAYLOR: Awesome.

00:41:26.346 --> 00:41:27.830
Any more questions?

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:29.850
I feel like I learned a
shocking amount today.

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:31.427
I don't know if you guys agree?

00:41:31.427 --> 00:41:32.260
Oh, well, thank you.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:32.760
Yeah?

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:33.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:35.640
JENNA TAYLOR: Do you
have a favorite kid?

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.556
MARY-FRANCES HECK: OK.

00:41:36.556 --> 00:41:38.420
So as most parents
will tell you, yes.

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.800
JENNA TAYLOR: Ah ha, we
won't tell you which one,

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.874
but we will admit we have one.

00:41:42.874 --> 00:41:45.290
MARY-FRANCES HECK: I think one
of the cool recipes in this

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:47.540
book that just-- sort of,
I learned a lot while I was

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:49.610
cooking through the recipes--

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.110
is some of the baked goods.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:53.060
It's really
interesting to see what

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:56.090
mashed sweet potato or grated
sweet potato can add to a dish

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:59.090
without overtly
being sweet potatoey.

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.130
So you can add it
to the bread dough,

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:03.470
for example, make the
rolls, or a sandwich loaf.

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:05.960
It'll stay fresh for three
or four days just sitting

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.850
on your counter top.

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:09.740
It's a beautiful orange color.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.510
It's very appetizing looking.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:14.950
It tastes and feels like
a Martin's potato roll,

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:17.507
so it has that squish factor.

00:42:17.507 --> 00:42:19.340
And the sweet potato
naturally works sort of

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.720
like a dough conditioner.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.847
And so you have this really
nice texture that normally you'd

00:42:23.847 --> 00:42:26.180
only get from a commercial
bakery where they have access

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.420
to some of the ingredients
that they might add,

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.830
or specialized flours with
different levels of protein.

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:32.640
So it just does
this magical thing.

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.360
And so there's
like a sponge cake,

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.080
gingerbread, all these
different baked goods that use

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.430
mashed sweet potato in them.

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:38.971
I really encourage
you to try it out.

00:42:38.971 --> 00:42:42.470
It's kind of akin to how
applesauce or zucchini could,

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:45.350
for a quick bread, anyway,
could increase the moisture

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:46.650
while reducing the fat.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:49.140
But sweet potatoes also
have a little bit of starch,

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.120
so you can also reduce the white
flour in some of the recipes.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.350
- It's like a win-win-win.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:55.850
Well, I want to know, what was
the most surprising thing you

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:58.391
learned writing this book, all
the way down your sweet potato

00:42:58.391 --> 00:42:59.429
rabbit hole?

00:42:59.429 --> 00:43:01.220
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
George Washington Carver

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.530
had almost as mini
sweet potato inventions

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:05.060
as he did peanut inventions.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.740
JENNA TAYLOR:
[LAUGHS] Sweet potato?

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.909
Give me an example of a
sweet potato invention.

00:43:08.909 --> 00:43:10.950
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Oh, my
gosh, on the spot now--

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:14.482
like, in the dozens of
uses for sweet potatoes.

00:43:14.482 --> 00:43:15.190
Everything from--

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:16.220
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh, use, OK.

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:17.870
I thought you were talking
about, like, a machine-- that

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:18.890
runs on sweet potatoes.

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:22.149
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Well, I guess
you could get energy from them.

00:43:22.149 --> 00:43:23.190
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh, really?

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:24.740
Yeah, plug in, run your clock.

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:25.850
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
He tried it, anyway.

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:28.130
You know, we're not running
our cars on sweet potatoes yet.

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:30.088
Actually, it's way better
to probably eat them.

00:43:30.088 --> 00:43:31.000
Run yourself on them.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:31.670
JENNA TAYLOR: To your body.

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.950
MARY-FRANCES HECK: Yeah.

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:33.200
JENNA TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.330
Thank you so much.

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:35.871
MARY-FRANCES HECK:
Thanks for coming.

00:43:35.871 --> 00:43:37.750
[APPLAUSE]
