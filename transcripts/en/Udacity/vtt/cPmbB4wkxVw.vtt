00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.487
Since you're now an expert on using the
distributive property, see if you can use

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:09.920
it to multiply these two polynomials
together. We have x+2, the whole thing,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.057
times x+3, the whole thing. I know that
this probably looks a little bit tricky

00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:18.801
because it looks different from anything
you've done before, but it actually uses

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:22.349
the same distributive property concept
that we been talking about. A, here, just

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:26.212
happens to have two terms in it. So, just
give it a try. See if you can use the

00:00:26.224 --> 00:00:30.699
distributive property to solve this
problem. Remember, simplify your answer

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:31.684
as much as you can.
