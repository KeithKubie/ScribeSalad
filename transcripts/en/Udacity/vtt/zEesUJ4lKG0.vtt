00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
So an additional help in thinking about your value proposition

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.680
comes from a great VC, Ann Miura-Ko, at Floodgate.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.220
Ann said, "We can think of startups' value propositions of having 2 forms."

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.980
"Do they have technology insight, or are they market insights?"

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.640
And typically, technology insights come for technology-driven products.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.820
Are you building chips that follow Moore's Law--

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.230
that is, they're now doubling in density every year

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.750
and therefore new functions can be embedded in them?

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.310
Are these based on new scientific discoveries or new algorithms?

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.580
Typically, this applies to hardware or clean tech and biotech,

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.250
but it also could be big data algorithms, etc.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.670
Do you have some insight about technology

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.140
and, again, the gains and pains that that will provide for customers?

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.290
Or do you have some insight about the market or consumer behavior?

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.400
Are you going to disrupt the value chain

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.630
because you now understand how to do something overseas

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.910
where you could slash the cost by 80%?

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.380
Is there something that government regulation or deregulation is going to change

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.910
and now make an entire industry available in a way it never was before?

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.380
So these are about changes in how people work and live and interact

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.310
and what they expect, and these are very different than technology insights.

00:01:15.310 --> 99:59:59.000
But remember they both need to solve pains and gains for your customer.
