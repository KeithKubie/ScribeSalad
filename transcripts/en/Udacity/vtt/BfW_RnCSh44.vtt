00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to the first unit on how debuggers work.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this unit, I'm going to introduce you to the scientific method of debugging,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which is a process by which through a systematic experiment,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
you'll slowly get guided towards the cause of the problem.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.569
We're also going to see why talking to a teddy bear can be an effective method

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:25.239
of finding out what's going wrong, and in the end, we're going to build an interactive debugger.

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:26.546
Enjoy.
