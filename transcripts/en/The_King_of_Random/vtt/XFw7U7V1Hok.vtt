00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.830
If a small magnifying glass will burn things
with sunlight, how much power could you get

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.330
from a lens as big as you? In this project
we're hacking open a rear projection TV, because

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.550
that's where you can find one of these amazing
solar scorchers, for free.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.430
To get started, the first thing I'm gonna do is log online to my local classifieds

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.600
and search for a free big screen TV. These
TV's are way outdated and usually cost more

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.739
to repair than they're worth so loads of people
are trying to get rid of them. I can already

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.489
see one here. It's a 50" Toshiba and it looks
like it's about 13 years old. Everything works

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.339
except the color and that's ok because I don't
really intend to watch TV with it. These TV's

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:07.170
are humongous and very heavy, so I'm gonna need a truck and a little help. Now heres

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.090
my brother with his truck. He's gonna help
me out today. It 's about lunch time, and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.159
he's on his break. We've just arrived at this
ladies house, and stepped inside to thank

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.659
her for donating her free TV. The price was
certainly right and I'm a happy customer.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.840
Now you gotta watch out these TV's can be
a couple hundred pounds so I don't recommend

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.229
lifting them on your own. Luckily this TV
has rollers so we'll roll it over to the truck

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.340
and load it with the screen facing up. We
don't really care too much about the condition

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.299
that this travels in, as long as the screen
is protected.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.119
Now it's time to head back home and start
hacking this TV apart.

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.020
I'll unload the TV from the back of the truck.
It is VERY heavy and unfortunately my brother

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.259
is back at work, so I'm unloading it by myself.
But it's down now, there's some success. The

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.590
TV is now in my back yard and I can get to
work.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.049
First thing I'm going to do is remove this
speaker guard to expose the speakers, and

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.609
I can take these and remove them for a future
project. These are 8 Ohm speakers and I'm

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:04.009
sure I can find a good use for them. Now just
above the speakers I found a couple of tabs

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.450
holding the screen in place. After removing
the 2 screws on each side, the screen lifts

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.030
straight up and pops off exposing the inside
of the TV.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.280
You can see at the bottom, the Red Green and
Blue cathode ray tubes with their respective

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.540
lens casings, as well as a nice big mirror.
Now since this mirror is used for projection,

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.099
it's super reflective so I'm going to remove
the screws holding that in place, and save

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.000
it for a different project.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.200
This TV screen has 3 separate layers. It's
hard to see, but the front layer is a large

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.709
piece of plexiglass, that could be useful.
The middle layer is a vertical lined plastic.

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.029
And this back piece is a giant virgin Fresnel
lens. This is the piece that I'm after.

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:45.649
 I got lucky because this one happens to be a crystal clear lens that focuses to a point.

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:48.049
And that's the best that I know of.

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.769
It may not look like much but this is a giant
4 foot magnifying lens! The amount of energy

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.930
these lenses can generate is outstanding!
Producing temperatures over 2000 degrees fahrenheit.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.849
They can be used for heating, cooking, purifying
water, and burning almost anything

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.000
you can imagine.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.439
Amazingly, they do all that just off sunlight.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.569
Now that I got the lens I was after, I'm going to play

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.390
around with some of these other pieces on
theTV.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.920
These projection lenses, the caster wheels
and the power cord can all be saved, and just

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.500
for fun I'm going to take one of these lens
cases and hack it open to see what's inside.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.620
I'm gonna save these nuts and bolts and
then cut down the side of the casing here.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.430
And when it's cracked open, you can see about
5 different optical lenses. Now these are

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.430
really neat because they're in perfect condition,
and I may be able to use them in future light

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.189
experiments. Most of the them are plastic,
but this focusing lens right here is pure

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:44.349
glass. It's quite heavy, and the optics on
it are amazing. If I focus it on my table

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.980
as if I'm trying to burn the table, you can
see it brings into focus the Compact Fluorescent

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.319
Lights that I'm using to light the room. I
thought that was kind of interesting.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.879
Ok, I've got the giant Fresnel lens, separated
from the frame now. You can see it's quite

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.890
flimsy and awkward so to hold it I think I'm
going to need to build some kind of a frame

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.150
so I can use it hands free. Look for that
in a different project.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.609
Well there you have it. Now you know the secret
to finding a giant Fresnel lens absolutely

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:08.980
free!

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.129
Now, a word of caution, these lenses generate
a lot of power. They can concentrate the sun

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.720
to a point that gets dangerously hot. It will
start fires instantly, melt concrete, and

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.520
can certainly cook you, so be please careful.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.320
That's it for now. If you liked this project,
perhaps you'll like some of my others. Check
