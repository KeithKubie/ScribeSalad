00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.625
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:12.900
Hello.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.770
Welcome to the fourth
episode of our

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.820
"Women Techmakers" series.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.500
This is the series to share the
stories of women who are

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.750
luminaries in the tech world,
and to inspire more women to

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.750
enter technology.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.050
And there's lots of resources
in our Google Developer

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.540
network to learn how
to do just that.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.479
Today, I'm thrilled to be here
with a very special guest, and

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.100
a great co-host.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.610
But our guest is Diane Green, a
Google board member and the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.450
founder of a couple of
companies, but more recently,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.030
founder and former
CEO of VMware.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.640
So we'll have Diane introduce
herself in a minute.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.030
I'm Claire Hughes Johnson.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.870
I lead our Google
Offers product.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.070
I've been at Google for
almost nine years.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.180
And I've worked on a variety
of products, on both the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.350
consumer and the business
product side, in both sales

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.190
and product.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.230
So, I have a little bit of
a different background.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.270
I live in Menlo Park and I have
two lovely children and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.430
husband named Jesse.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.160
Which is interesting,
because my co-host

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.530
today is named Jessie.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.570
And I would love Jessie Jiang
to introduce herself.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.750
[JESSIE JIANG]

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.930
Great.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.260
Thank you, Claire.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.260
My name is Jessie Jiang.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.460
I'm a product management
director in

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.240
Google Cloud Platform.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.820
Google Cloud Platform provide
a set of services for

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.820
developers to build
and run their

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.200
applications in Google's Cloud.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.860
Some of our products include
Google App Engine, Google

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.380
Compute Engine, storage, Cloud
SQL, and BigQuery.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.420
I've been at Google for
about seven years,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.850
not as long as Claire.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.710
It's always been very
exciting to be here.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.600
I have a daughter.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.090
She is four years old.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.080
I actually think your
son and my daughter

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.210
go to the same school.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.600
Anyway, I'm very excited to be
here today and to be part of

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.740
this interview with Diane.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.720
I'm sure she has some really
inspiring stories to share

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.910
with all of us.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.045
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:01:55.045 --> 00:01:57.530
So with that, let's hear from
Diane Greene, a little bit of

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.860
your background would
be great.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.095
[DIANE GREENE]

00:01:59.095 --> 00:01:59.330
OK.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.600
Hello, I'm Diane Greene, and
it's great to be here.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.300
And I actually started
as an engineer.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.050
I have a degree in mechanical
engineering and Naval

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.009
architecture.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.360
And I worked in the oil and
shipping industry for a while,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.460
before I decided to go back to
school and study computer

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.560
science, and have a computer
science degree.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.630
And then moved in the tech,
probably 25 years ago.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.352
And worked in the industry
in the database and

00:02:29.352 --> 00:02:33.660
a little bit hardware.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.540
And in, let's see, 1995 I
started doing start-ups.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.940
and I've done three start-ups.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.740
The first was a low-bandwidth
video streaming start-up, that

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.640
Microsoft bought and
became the basis

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.290
for their Movie Player.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.280
And another one was in internet
ad serving, a company

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.790
called AdForce.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.130
And then the last one was
VMware, which I started the

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.990
same year Google was founded.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.825
And co-founded with
four other people.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.850
And stayed with VMware
for 11 years.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.990
Got it to about $2 billion
and about 7,000 people.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.890
And it's a virtualization
company.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.945
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:03:16.945 --> 00:03:18.270
And were you the CEO for the--

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.475
[DIANE GREENE]

00:03:18.475 --> 00:03:19.560
Yes, I was the CEO--

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.030
founding CEO of VMware and built
the company as the CEO.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.400
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.130
Wow.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.880
We're very lucky to
have Diane here.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.020
We thought we'd start with
a little bit about the

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.470
innovation and the technology
that was behind VMware.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.680
And I would love to have Jessie
lead this section,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.690
since she works on this type
of work at Google.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.810
[JESSIE JIANG]

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.920
Yeah, this is why I'm so excited
to be here today.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.180
Cloud computing is one
of the biggest trends

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.300
in technology today.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.510
And virtualization is
in the center of it.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.820
VMware obviously is a pioneer
in virtualization.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.710
You co-founded the company and
were the CEO for many years.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.870
So maybe we can start by having
you tell us a little

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.850
bit about your story there.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.050
[DIANE GREENE]

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.910
Well, we had this insight.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.350
There was research going on at
Stanford by my co-founder and

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.770
husband, Mendel Rosenblum,
around revisiting the idea of

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.000
virtualization.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.700
IBM had done it in the '60s for
different reasons, when

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.060
computers were extraordinarily
expensive

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.130
and a precious resource.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.140
And we had the idea that it
would be useful for all kinds

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.130
of compartmentalization and
providing levels of

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.750
indirection--

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.880
and we can go more into that.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.260
But if we brought it to
mainstream processors, to the

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.580
Intel processor, and so
we decided to do that.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.760
It was difficult, because
virtualization had died out.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.710
The Intel processor had no
hardware support for

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.810
virtualization because people
thought it was a

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.950
thing of the past.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.580
But we got it working on the
Intel processor, and were able

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.970
to bring it to market.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.170
And it did become the basis of
the large virtualization

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.646
industry, that's right.

00:05:06.646 --> 00:05:06.819
[JESSIE JIANG]

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:07.990
That's great.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.080
So, I actually heard a little
bit about this story.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.770
But I think that one of very
interesting things about

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.120
VMware, is, it's actually
started as a company that much

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.040
more focused on the
client side.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.140
And I think I also heard that
you have always known that the

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.600
server side is where the
future of VMware

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.690
was going to be.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.050
So maybe you can delve a little
bit more into that

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.790
story, and see how you decided
your first step.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.300
And then how you lead the
company to become successful

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.460
on the server side.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.610
[DIANE GREENE]

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.160
Sure.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.820
We thought this virtualization
was incredibly useful.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.320
And we thought, from day one,
that it was really needed on

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.530
the servers as a way to
provide isolation.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.290
The operating systems were only
running one application

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.160
per operating system
at the time.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.260
And that was wasting.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.700
Machines were running
about 5% to 10%.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.950
And there were security and
fault isolation problems, and

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.730
all kinds of resource
isolation problems.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.520
But we knew we couldn't go into
the enterprise with a

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.440
product that ran everybody's
software.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.290
And have people trust
us, and to play us.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.120
And we had to get a lot
of credibility.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.470
So we came up with an
architecture where we would

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.900
take advantage of the Windows
operating system on the

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.380
desktop for all its
device drivers.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.920
And we decided to
introduce it.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.500
Right then, LINUX was getting
a lot of attraction.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.510
And we knew that all the
developers running LINUX

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.880
needed a way to run their
Windows applications, this is

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.500
back in '98, '99.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.970
And so we introduced it as
a way to run Windows

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.300
applications, while you
were running LINUX.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.020
And be able to run them
side by side.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.120
With the idea that these
developers would give us great

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.890
bug reports.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:03.125
[JESSIE JIANG]

00:07:03.125 --> 00:07:04.630
That's a good idea.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:04.770
[DIANE GREENE]

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.790
And so we launched
it as a desktop.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.780
But I have to say that we did
a vision statement when we

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.860
founded the company.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.320
And in it we said,
oh, this will be

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.410
ubiquitous by the year 2000.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.120
We were off by a few years.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.700
But it did become ubiquitous.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:20.815
[JESSIE JIANG]

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:21.860
That's great.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.090
So, we were actually talking
about some of the other

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.710
virtualization technology right
before this started,

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.020
like XEN and KVM,
and all that.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.010
And cloud computing, in general,
is really, in many

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.030
ways, are changing how people
are doing things.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.120
So what do you feel
like the cloud

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.750
computing trend is going?

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.750
What do you think are
some of the--

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.980
predicting what the next set of
new innovations that might

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.190
come up, either in the field
of cloud computing, or as a

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.070
result of the cloud computing?

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.245
[DIANE GREENE]

00:07:53.245 --> 00:07:57.580
Well, there's a lot of major
changes going on, as I think

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.500
we all know.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.510
We're all involved in a
very exciting time.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.560
In the infrastructure,
in the hardware

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.000
space, there's all kinds.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.340
People are rebuilding the
hardware to be optimized for

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.190
virtualization--

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.810
virtualized storage, virtualized
networking.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.430
And that's all very active.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:19.740
And at the system level, ways to
manage a data center where

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.760
it looks like one big compute
resource using, and

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.093
oftentimes, the virtualization.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:32.950
But the cloud, part of what's
making this cloud, so exciting

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:38.350
is that all of a sudden, all the
data and compute is in a

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.409
place where you can access
it from anywhere--

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.280
from any device.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.500
And the devices have
a lot of sensors.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.510
And so human-computer
interaction is becoming much

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.090
more human-like.

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:54.330
And the cloud, with the
mobile devices,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.940
is making it possible.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.610
And there's some big
trends there.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:00.735
[JESSIE JIANG]

00:09:00.735 --> 00:09:01.340
That's right.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.110
So let me just ask one more
cloud computing question.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.960
And then I'm going to turn
this to Claire, because I

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.240
think that a lot of people are
probably eager to hear about

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.330
your stories on being
entrepreneur, leadership and

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:12.740
management.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.930
So, VMware is a very, very
successful enterprise company.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.900
And you have a lot of experience
in terms of working

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.390
enterprises.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.370
Given the trend in cloud
computing, and some of the

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.420
other technology innovations,
how do you think that

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.670
enterprise should approach their
technology these days?

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.665
Are there things you feel like
they should do differently?

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:34.570
[DIANE GREENE]

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:39.250
Well, enterprises are trying to
build data centers that are

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.860
cost effective.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.700
And they're trying to centralize
all their services.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:52.720
So it's easier to administer and
have single sign-on, have

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.610
a single view of all the
data, and so forth.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:04.900
And the support to build a
data center with the cost

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.540
effectiveness of the big
services like Google, like

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.270
Amazon, and so forth,
is not there yet.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:15.020
But that is what enterprises
are trying to do.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.180
And more and more, they're going
to be able to get these

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:22.080
services from external hosting
providers, external providers.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.080
And some of the challenges of
running these hosting centers,

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.550
around security, around
up-time and cost

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.420
effectiveness, I think, are
going to push people to using

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.620
external providers.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.690
Because that's where the
expertise in how to do this,

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.680
is going to be the highest.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.610
I think it's getting to the
point where security is such a

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.510
tough problem.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.520
That unless you let the experts,
each company can't

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.990
have enough expertise to
protect themselves.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.005
And it needs to get more
sophisticated.

00:10:54.005 --> 00:10:58.240
And it will when the talent's
centralized, I think.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:58.330
[JESSIE JIANG]

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.380
That's a great point.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.750
Very exciting.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.970
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:02.190
Great.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.460
Well, let's come back to this.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.500
But let's talk a little bit
about one thing you mentioned,

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.870
which is the decision to go back
to school and to work in

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.470
computer science.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.410
So, what led you to
that decision?

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:14.585
[DIANE GREENE]

00:11:14.585 --> 00:11:15.600
Well, it was interesting.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.680
I was working.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.280
I love adventures and I
love being outside.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.970
And I had gone into
the oil industry.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:29.800
and I was wanting to go to these
offshore oil platforms

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.250
in the North Rankin sea, off
the coast of Australia.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:33.305
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:11:33.305 --> 00:11:36.580
Those platforms that
catch on fire?

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:36.660
[DIANE GREENE]

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.200
I actually got to work on
[INAUDIBLE] their mooring

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.890
system for putting an oil rig
out from a semi-submersible

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:45.610
oil platform.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.120
At one point.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.130
It was very interesting.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:52.060
But anyhow, they had no quarters
for women at the

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.790
time, out on these platforms.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:57.890
And I was stuck doing all
the computer analysis.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:01.470
Which I thought, well there's
more interesting things to do

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.640
with computers than
hydro-dynamics analysis.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.560
And so I decided.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.690
When I had been studying Naval
architecture, I'd hung out at

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.520
MIT with a lot of artificial
intelligence people.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.630
And I'd been really
interested in it.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.260
And I decide to go back to
school and study it.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.730
So I went back to Berkeley and
studied computer science.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:23.785
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:25.430
Because you thought there could
be more than just the

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.180
data analysis piece.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.130
You to do more and--

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:28.240
[DIANE GREENE]

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.030
Well, it just seemed like
computers were starting to get

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:36.810
so capable that it was clearly
revolutionizing our lives.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.050
And I wanted to be a
part of it, yeah.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:39.145
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:12:39.145 --> 00:12:42.230
And then when you co-founded
VMware with your husband, he

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.090
was a professor?

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:44.195
[DIANE GREENE]

00:12:44.195 --> 00:12:45.240
No, we were both--

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.560
oh yeah, well yes.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.330
I met my husband at Berkeley
where we were

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.070
both graduate students.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.070
And then we co-founded the
company when he was a

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:54.780
professor at Stanford, right.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:54.810
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.090
I think you've told
this story--

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.154
[DIANE GREENE]

00:12:56.154 --> 00:12:56.410
And he still is.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:56.560
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.220
--About how you stepped
in and said, well

00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.220
I'll help run things.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.340
And then you ended
up being CEO.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.590
What do you think?

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.640
How do it go from, well, I'll
help out, to realizing you

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.760
were the best person
to be the CEO?

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:07.940
[DIANE GREENE]

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:13.920
Yeah, well, I had already been
the CEO of a start-up, and I'd

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.930
been involved in two.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.530
And I felt very comfortable
getting them going.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:18.480
And I said OK.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.940
And I really thought
this was something

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.070
worth bringing to market.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.130
I actually pushed.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:24.610
I said, let's bring
this to market.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.250
This is really valuable.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.920
But then I discovered
I was pregnant.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.920
And so I said, well I
will help you get

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.720
this out the door.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.560
I know how to build
a start-up.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.690
And then we'll have to find
someone, because I'm about to

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.810
have my second kid.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:44.270
And what it turned out was, it
was very easy to have my

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.070
second kid and build
the company.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.330
All in--

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:48.475
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:13:48.475 --> 00:13:52.040
Because you were the boss.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.103
[DIANE GREENE]

00:13:52.103 --> 00:13:52.840
Yeah, so it worked out.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.570
And I always said, if I didn't
think I was adding value, I

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:56.230
would leave.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.300
But it just went really well.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.480
We all liked each other.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.280
We were all making lots of
progress all the time.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.120
And so I--

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:04.300
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.300
So your daughter's the
same age as VMware?

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:06.480
[DIANE GREENE]

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:06.670
Exactly.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.800
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.830
And you would bring her into
work occasionally, or when she

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:12.670
was little?

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.795
[DIANE GREENE]

00:14:12.795 --> 00:14:14.710
She came into work a lot.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.730
I brought her all over
the world with me.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.980
I would always hire a
really good nanny in

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.440
whatever city I went to.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.180
So that she would have more fun
than me sometimes, getting

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.980
to go out and see the city.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.600
She learned origami in Japan
from her nannies.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.310
It was really a great
experience for her.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:40.570
And both of my kids
are pretty savvy.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.950
They always surprise us with how
much they know about how a

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.060
tech company might be built.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:46.245
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:14:46.245 --> 00:14:48.260
Well, they saw it from
the ground up.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:48.435
[DIANE GREENE]

00:14:48.435 --> 00:14:50.819
Well, they just heard about
nothing else since the day

00:14:50.819 --> 00:14:51.428
they were born.

00:14:51.428 --> 00:14:51.631
[JESSIE JIANG]

00:14:51.631 --> 00:14:53.090
That's probably what
happened,yes.

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:53.410
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:56.900
So, when you think about your
leadership style, and really

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:01.050
scaling with VMware, right, from
start-up world to a much

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:02.480
larger company--

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.890
an enterprise.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.910
Maybe you can talk about, what
were some of the lessons you

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:12.080
learned, or how you had to flex
and adapt as a leader.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:12.265
[DIANE GREENE]

00:15:12.265 --> 00:15:12.450
Yeah.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.710
It was really a nice way to
scale up as a leader, because

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.610
it was so incremental with
the people that we hired.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.980
And one of the things I did was,
we had a lunch we brought

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:24.920
in once a week.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.980
And talked to everybody
about what was

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.320
going on in the company.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.700
And I wasn't that comfortable
speaking in public when we

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.510
started the company.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.160
But it got bigger by a few
people every week, and pretty

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.030
soon it was a 1,000 people.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.160
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:39.880
At lunch?

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:40.170
[DIANE GREENE]

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.700
Yeah, well.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:41.855
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:15:41.855 --> 00:15:42.470
Probably evolved.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.670
[DIANE GREENE]

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.820
Probably about 500.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.310
We couldn't have everybody
in one place.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:48.760
But that really scaled up.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.450
And then certainly, when you're
doing something like

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:55.910
that, it's a constant process of
figuring out what you don't

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.440
need to do anymore and hiring
someone else to do it.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.370
And constantly shedding
responsibilities.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:02.445
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:16:02.445 --> 00:16:05.415
And how much did you stay
involved in the technology and

00:16:05.415 --> 00:16:08.495
the thinking about what the
product was going to be and

00:16:08.495 --> 00:16:10.220
how it was going to evolve?

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:10.360
[DIANE GREENE]

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.290
Well, I always, all
the way through,

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.180
attended product meanings.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:20.840
And I felt like I couldn't run
the company if I didn't really

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.440
have a very grounded
understanding of

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.190
what we were doing.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.290
And I felt like I was helpful
in the product review.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.310
Not every product meeting, but
the major product reviews

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.730
about a new product or
a new direction.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.590
Because I was out
in the field.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.600
I was seeing all aspects
of how I was

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.760
working with the partners.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.880
And so that was a valuable
perspective for

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.760
those product meetings.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:44.925
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:16:44.925 --> 00:16:47.270
Because as CEO, you were
particularly external and

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.960
probably talking to
a lot of large

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.440
partners, or large customers?

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:50.510
[DIANE GREENE]

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:54.420
I was very focused really
internally on the culture.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.010
I cared a great deal
about that.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:17:00.590
But I also thought partners were
so key to our being able

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:01.730
to build the business.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:06.180
And I really enjoyed working
with other companies, and both

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.119
of us winning together.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:12.849
And so I stayed very active with
our hardware partners.

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:13.130
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:14.420
Got it.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.869
And when you think about whether
it was-- maybe it was

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:19.410
a partner or a mentor--

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:23.069
but somebody who guided you as
you went through this process.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:26.750
Were there particular types of
people that you turned to?

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.200
I often hear that women
feel they don't

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.880
have a lot of examples.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.630
And I don't think the example
or the mentor has to be a

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:33.860
woman, necessarily.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.570
But I don't know if you had
any people that played an

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:38.820
important role.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:42.055
[DIANE GREENE]

00:17:42.055 --> 00:17:43.850
I watched everywhere.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.340
When we were playing with the
hardware companies, I got to

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.680
work with a lot of senior
executives.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.750
And I would say, particularly
at IBM, I learned a lot from

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.100
being with those executives.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:18:00.320
They were very sophisticated,
and really had a very

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.400
360-degree view of what
they were doing.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.750
And so I, in particular, tried
to spend more time with some

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.430
of those executives sometimes.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.645
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:18:11.645 --> 00:18:13.500
That's a great idea.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.710
Was there any woman in
particular who looked to, or

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.050
did you just have to
just pave the way?

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:19.110
[DIANE GREENE]

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.050
I was going to say no.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.710
But then I remembered
that Sue Whitney

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.120
was running the hardware--

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:30.630
all the server stuff, the X86
server stuff-- at IBM.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.910
And I got to be friends
with her.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.400
That was good.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:36.530
[JESSIE JIANG]

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.920
So, VMware was the second
company that you started.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.720
You had another one
before that.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.250
Do you like comparing the first
one and then VMware.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.366
Do you feel like there was a
difference between doing it a

00:18:47.366 --> 00:18:49.635
first time, versus doing
it a second time?

00:18:49.635 --> 00:18:49.812
[DIANE GREENE]

00:18:49.812 --> 00:18:51.850
Yeah, there was a huge
difference doing

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:53.480
it the second time.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.380
The first time was great..

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:04.650
But we had a vague idea, and we
all started working on it.

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:08.410
And as we got into the company,
it became clear that

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.500
we all-- our vague idea--
everybody had internalized a

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.860
little bit differently.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.560
And it caused for a little bit
of dysfunction in the company.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.820
And so the first thing I did
when we started VMware was

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.890
write our mission and vision.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.780
And have everybody edit
it and sign off on it

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.280
before we kept going.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.030
So I knew we were all on the
same page, and I found that

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.640
very helpful.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:30.725
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:19:30.725 --> 00:19:32.100
That's a good tip.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:32.160
[JESSIE JIANG]

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.130
Yeah, I assume you also made a
lot of effort to make sure

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:38.450
those visions are communicated
to all the people in VMware as

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.160
the company becomes
bigger and bigger.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:40.266
[DIANE GREENE]

00:19:40.266 --> 00:19:43.270
Yeah, someone once told me you
can never over-communicate,

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.400
and I've really taken
that to heart.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.250
You can say things over and over
again, and people don't

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:50.760
seem to get tired
of hearing it.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.360
You get tired of listening.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.750
You just worry about boring
them, but it turns out that

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:01.120
important things can be said in
many, many different ways,

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.310
over and over again.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:08.950
And so, we did work very hard on
keeping everybody in sync.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.520
In fact one thing I used to
always like to do is to be the

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.060
last on an interview schedule.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.270
And ask the person, well what
did everybody tell you about

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.510
our strategy.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.170
And find out--

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:20.360
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:20.840
Another good tip.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:20.936
[DIANE GREENE]

00:20:20.936 --> 00:20:21.690
--that we were all in sync.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:21.785
[JESSIE JIANG]

00:20:21.785 --> 00:20:23.690
That's a good tip.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:23.835
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:20:23.835 --> 00:20:27.632
I often ask people at Google,
what do you think this job is,

00:20:27.632 --> 00:20:29.120
after they've met
a few people.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.270
Because sometimes they're not
sure what they're interviewing

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.250
for, because we have such a
diverse set of things in our

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:35.290
roles at the company.

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:35.590
[JESSIE JIANG]

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:36.750
That's true.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:36.885
[DIANE GREENE]

00:20:36.885 --> 00:20:40.360
Yeah, that outside perspective
gives you a lot of clues.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:40.450
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:44.290
When you think about young
people or developers just

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.410
starting out-- interested in
their skill sets, and what

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.190
experiences they
might have had.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.000
Is there any particular point in
your career you would say,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.670
that was when I really learned
the most, or realized this was

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.600
my passion.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:20:59.860
[DIANE GREENE]

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.030
Well, I think for me, my passion
was always seeing

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:06.110
opportunities and
pursuing them.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.390
When I would see, oh, this
could be done way better.

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.590
Or something new could be done
that would be really valuable.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.240
That's what I've always
gravitated towards.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.070
When I started working in the
tech industry, I found out

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:24.340
that it was really easy
to see something and

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.670
just run with it.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.730
Because you could go build
something, without it costing

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.090
any money, particularly.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.550
And if it solved their problem,
people would be

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:35.490
really happy.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.280
Or if it produced something
that would be

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.370
valuable to the company.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:47.630
So I got very excited about what
was possible in terms of

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:51.370
making a difference, without
having it to be highly

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.010
structured.

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:53.900
I think that's a huge

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.350
advantage of the tech industry.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:22:01.300
And it just makes it much more
a meritocracy, merit based.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:01.415
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:22:01.415 --> 00:22:03.020
But fast moving.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:03.430
[DIANE GREENE]

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.310
Yes.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:10.550
Actually, many years ago I was
on the board of a company in

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.130
the retail space--

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.410
and a very good company.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:18.840
But it was amazing, the
difference in the pace between

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.740
the tech industry and
this company.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:22.025
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:22:22.025 --> 00:22:22.310
Yeah.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.400
I think that has upsides
and downsides, right?

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.340
It's amazing to be in tech.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.320
I don't think I would
go the other way.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.020
But we can work in very short
cycles, and sometimes we get

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.080
short-sighted because we're just
trying to get the next

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:35.540
thing done.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.000
When there are big tectonic
shifts happening.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.330
And it's important to be
aware of both of those.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:44.270
Do you have any tips for when
we're cycling really hard?

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:47.305
I'm sure you had this at VMware,
but at Google, in

00:22:47.305 --> 00:22:49.420
particular, we sometimes feel
like we're running a hundred

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.980
miles an hour.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.750
And it's important
to step back.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:53.045
[DIANE GREENE]

00:22:53.045 --> 00:22:53.720
Yeah.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.300
Yeah.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:23:01.490
I always tried to put in rituals
that periodically let

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.570
me, and some of the people
I work with, step back.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:09.730
And so we had a once-a-week,
where once a month that

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.690
once-a-week would be a
little more on the

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.110
long-term than the immediate.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:17.870
And then we had [? a cadence ?]
to some

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.400
off-sites we would do.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:25.920
And also, one thing I really
liked about travel was when I

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.330
got on a plane, nobody would
be asking me for anything.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.650
And I would really clarify my
long-term thoughts whenever I

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.740
traveled in a long flight.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:36.010
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:36.490
Yeah.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:37.390
Don't tell my husband that.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.820
Sometimes I really actually
like traveling.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.890
Even though that means I'm not
helping out at home as much.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:44.682
Jessie, do you have any?

00:23:44.682 --> 00:23:45.070
[JESSIE JIANG]

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:45.240
Yeah.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.580
One of the things I love-- this
has actually come from

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.150
some of my team members.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.560
And I was telling them, I'm
interviewing Diane--

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.470
I'm so excited.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.810
And then, what are some things
you'd love to know about it?

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:56.020
And some of these are women.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.820
And they said, they'd love to
know, what are some of the

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.400
things that you learned earlier
in your career, which

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.030

helpful for your

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.600
career, many years after?

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.200
Because I think many of the
people here at Google, we're

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.920
very young, just starting.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.830

things from you.

advise us, at this

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:22.180

[DIANE GREENE]

00:24:22.285 --> 00:24:22.970
Oh, gee.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.170
I sometimes feel like,
how can I give advice

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:26.060
to people like Google?

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.020
They're so talented.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:35.230
But if I were myself giving
myself advice, when I started

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.190
out, what would I have
liked to have known?

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:46.790
What turned out to be true, is
when you produce quality

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.240
advancement on whatever
you're working

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.840
on, good things happen.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:59.710
And to be reassured it that
is really the case.

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:03.350
And to just have confidence
to focus on doing very

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:07.230
high-quality, high-value work--
not just high-quality,

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:09.180
but also high-value work.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:15.120
And to test out your ideas
about what's valuable.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.450
I was worried that
things might not

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:23.320
get appreciated sometimes.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:27.510
And they actually
did, always--

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:29.280
pretty much.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:29.860
Or, I would leave.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.400
And that is a piece of advice.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.010
Is, if you're doing things and
they're not having the effect

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:36.590
that they should have.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.440

reason that doesn't make

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.150

You just should go somewhere
else, where that's

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.110
not going to happen.

where you're frustrated.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.200
Well, I can remember a job I
had in a database company

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:11.470
where I was building some tools
that were doing some

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:15.970
really useful things for the
people in customer support.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:19.860
And the customer support
people loved it.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.500
But there were people that were
worried about the use of

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.600
these tools.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:29.410
Or when I was a Naval architect,
I remember doing a

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.700
program to do the hydrostatic
analysis.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.800
And the Naval architect I
was working for didn't--

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.150
this is very extreme-- didn't
quite trust computers yet, and

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:40.900
thought I should check
it by hand.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.460

said, OK, I think I'll go

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.890
somewhere else where I can.

a matter of--

to have more women--

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:28.300

did we get so lucky?

besides being founded at the

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.860
same time, that made
you interested?

[DIANE GREENE]

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:39.480
Well, I feel very fortunate
to be on Google's board.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.450
And I think boards are looking
for people that have

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:47.770
technology background.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:48.790

They're looking for qualified
financial experts.

three, it puts you in a

position to get board seats.

interested in this, which is,

technical as you moved up the

I think, especially in

about this.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.330
Did you keep yourself
as technical?

[DIANE GREENE]

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.150
Well, I have to say I
haven't written any

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:17.910
code in a little while--

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:19.700
more than a little while.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:24.580
I do find it really important
to be able to--

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:25.840
I would check myself.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.160
I would pick up technical
specs every now and

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:28.990
then, and read them.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:30.890
And make sure I could
understand them.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.140
And when I was finding
myself--

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.300
maybe I didn't know the
acronyms, or maybe there was

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.650
an underlying mechanism
that I didn't

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:40.280
understand how it worked.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.330
I would go find technical people
to explain it to me.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.720
Because it was a huge advantage,
particularly in the

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.340
partnering, to have
technical depth.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:52.370
And then when you're negotiating
with people about

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:56.680
how something might work, if you
have technical depth, you

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.020
can negotiate it in a way
that it's likely to

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.630
have a lot more success.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:04.210
And plus, it's more fun
to understand what

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:06.260
you're talking about.

on that?

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:13.500
I guess another question
I have is two

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.910
questions but related.

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:19.940
One is for people who are new
to management roles and

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.750
leadership roles, and especially
for women.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:26.690
I wonder about what advice you
would give them when they take

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:28.870
a pretty important
career change?

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.560
Then there is a flip side
of the question is.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.420
For companies who want to grow
women as a leader and

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:40.265
management, as a [? talent ?]
pool for the company, what do

00:30:40.265 --> 00:30:43.540
you think the company can do
to help grow the women

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.620
talents, both in leadership
as well as in

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:46.870
the management rolls.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:50.040
[DIANE GREENE]

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.350
This isn't exactly answering
your question, but you just

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:56.620
reminded me of something
I always did at VMware.

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.480
When I was in a room, in a
meeting, and there would be

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.460
women in the meeting.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.730
And they knew they didn't have
to stay there, but I found

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.190
that they would always
enjoy it.

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:12.550
And once they'd experienced it,
they would realize it was

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:16.190
fun and rewarding to take
the lead on some things.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:20.860
So that was something I used
to try and do consciously.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:25.760
I was always very interested
in any women that were in

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.360
leadership roles or
in engineering.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.660
Just checking in with them.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:38.610
Because you just naturally feel
an alliance with them.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:44.500
But in terms of going into
management, I think in

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.660
management--

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.280
I've always thought of myself
as, when I'm in management--

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.550
my job is to make everybody
successful.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:53.610
I'm there to serve them.

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:54.840
They're the lucky ones.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:59.290
I'm working like a dog to
make them successful.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:02.320
And so I have to communicate a
lot to them, so they can do

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.180
their jobs well.

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:07.740
I have to coordinate, and
facilitate, and really lay the

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.230
infrastructure, so that they
can be successful.

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:14.740
And I think that's advice for
any manager, of course, not

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.540
just women.

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:22.130
But I think the biggest thing
is to just focus on what

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:23.590
you're trying to accomplish.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:27.890
And don't let those nagging
confidence or fear things

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:28.750
creep in there.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:32.230

you're trying to accomplish.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.130
Which is, how do
you do it all?

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:52.680
How did you found a very
successful company and raise

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.570
two children?

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:56.480
And sounds like you and your
husband were both working.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.170
So, that's challenging.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:01.220
I think the answer is different
for everybody.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.340
But it is possible, is the first
thing, because you're

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:05.540
proof of that.

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.550
But any learnings
or tips, or--

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:10.020
[DIANE GREENE]

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:10.310
Yeah.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:14.260
I think you're consciously
making compromises when you're

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.000
trying to work full-time and
raise your children.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.610
And as long as you accept
that there's going to be

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:24.300
compromises, you can optimize
for what's important to you.

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.760
So being home for dinner
with my kids was really

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:28.770
important to me.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:31.740
And that was how I set the
culture of VMware.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.950
And being at special school
things was very important, so

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:39.610
I'd make a big show of that--

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:41.820
If I had to leave to go--

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.040
if I wanted to leave and
go and visit the

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.280
school for some reason.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.430
But, at the same time,
after my kids were in

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:53.050
bed, I was on email.

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:55.200
To the point where people would
say, could you just not

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.480
send emails in the middle
of the night, Diane.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:01.030
And I was like, OK,
I don't know.

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:04.490
I'd all save it up till
the next day starts.

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:14.270
But I threw a lot of energy into
being able to do things

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:18.440
across the entire day,
unless I was asleep.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.580
But I did prioritize.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:26.239
It's arbitrary how many hours
are in a day, so you have to

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:31.050
make a decision about which
hours you're going to put into

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:33.219
things that are not
work related.

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:34.480
And how you balance those.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:34.680
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.800
But the technology is actually
a great field, in terms of

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.960
some of that flexibility.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:44.650
Many people at Google, men and
women, do get online at

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:45.659
different times.

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:49.440
And maybe leave early if their
child has something at school.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.449
And then get back online.

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:51.940
I feel lucky I can do.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:52.030
[DIANE GREENE]

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.219
Yeah, that's absolutely right.

00:34:53.219 --> 00:34:59.440
And then, where you can, if
you can use your salary to

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.650
have food that's already made,
so that you're not having to.

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:07.350
You'd rather be with your kids
interacting, than cooking

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:10.030
dinner or cleaning the house.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:14.680
So I definitely used my salary
to leverage my time.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:14.780
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:17.400
So you were only doing the
high-valued things that you

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.500
wanted to do.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.630
That certainly resonates
a lot with me.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.768
[JESSIE JIANG]

00:35:20.768 --> 00:35:23.400
That's true, Definitely, yes.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:23.485
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:35:23.485 --> 00:35:25.820
I think the thing is that,
this is for parents,

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.450
not just for women.

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:29.900
The president makes a point
of going to all his school

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.000
meetings, right, for
his children.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.970
I think if leadership sends a
message that hey, you have

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.150
priorities at work, you have
priorities at home.

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:40.260
And being public about the
fact that, when you make

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.260
choices to go and be
with your kids.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.190
is a good example.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.365
[DIANE GREENE]

00:35:44.365 --> 00:35:46.950
People are unhappy if
they're giving short

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:48.990
shrift to their family.

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:51.590
And you're not productive
if you're not happy.

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:55.280
So I think it's actually
a good trade-off.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:55.446
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:35:55.446 --> 00:35:57.260
I think it's a good trend.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.260
I'd like to see more of it.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:03.090
I think we only have time for
one or two more questions.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:05.050
Do we have any final industry
or technology?

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:05.160
[JESSIE JIANG]

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.098
Maybe I'll ask another
technology question.

00:36:07.098 --> 00:36:09.340
Yay.

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:13.160
So, cloud, that's something dear
and very dear and close

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.000
to my heart.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.470
But clearly there are many other
technologies that are

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:20.680
changing people's
lives every day.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.710
In addition to cloud computing,
what are some of

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.520
the other technologies
are you really

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.770
excited about these days?

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.335
[DIANE GREENE]

00:36:28.335 --> 00:36:30.830
The other--

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:34.020
I don't want to be a Google ad,
but I sure enjoyed driving

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.520
in the Google Driverless
Car recently.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.035
I can't wait to get one.

00:36:38.035 --> 00:36:38.162
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:36:38.162 --> 00:36:40.850
Isn't it surprisingly normal?

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:43.040
You're just in a car and
it's driving itself.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:43.177
[DIANE GREENE]

00:36:43.177 --> 00:36:48.460
But in terms of just taking
it back to technology.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:52.120
I do think human-computer
interaction.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:56.650
I think having the use of
computers be human-centered,

00:36:56.650 --> 00:37:00.950
rather than how it's been-- a
top down from the application.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:04.770
It's a major shift, facilitated
by cloud,

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:08.160
facilitated by mobile,
facilitated by the sensors,

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.820
facilitated by being able to
integrate the processors.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:20.240
In ways we haven't done before,
is just radically

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.820
improving what we're going to
be able to do as humans.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.920
And it's really exciting
to be part of that.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:25.985
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:37:25.985 --> 00:37:28.040
Are you working on
new projects?

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:28.155
[DIANE GREENE]

00:37:28.155 --> 00:37:30.860
Well, I have a new project.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:30.943
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:37:30.943 --> 00:37:32.390
Is it secret?

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.520
[DIANE GREENE]

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.750
Well, we'll see where it goes.

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:36.410
It's pretty junior.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:36.590
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:39.250
But you're basically a
serial entrepreneur.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:39.420
[DIANE GREENE]

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:42.820
Well, I basically like
creating things

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.870
and building things.

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.900
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.250
Were you like that when
you were young?

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:46.390
[DIANE GREENE]

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:51.200
Yeah, I was always putting on a
play, or starting a team, or

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.880
making a kayak.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.590
Or, yes.

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:54.700
I was always.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:58.820
Build a dark room, yeah I was
always doing things, yeah.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:37:58.907
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:37:58.907 --> 00:37:59.500
So you just--

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.850
that's what gets you going?

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:01.015
[DIANE GREENE]

00:38:01.015 --> 00:38:01.820
Yeah.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:02.060
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.195
And when you think about
embarking on a new project,

00:38:04.195 --> 00:38:07.680
does it feel like, I can't
believe I'm doing this again?

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.230
Or you just get new
energy, new ideas?

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.545
[DIANE GREENE]

00:38:11.545 --> 00:38:15.510
I'm really happy to be doing it
again, but it's difficult.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:20.270
Because I've got myself
committed to a

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:21.730
lot of other things.

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:25.780
And in the past, when I've
started a new project, it was

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:28.750
something new that I was going
to do next without, anything

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:30.040
else going on.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.770
So this is an interesting
challenge for me.

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:31.912
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:38:31.912 --> 00:38:34.190
So every time, it's different.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:35.320
Do you have a team?

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.960
Are you recruiting people?

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.146
I'm not looking, just
to be clear, Google.

00:38:41.146 --> 00:38:41.353
[DIANE GREENE]

00:38:41.353 --> 00:38:44.370
I have a few people that I'm
working with on some ideas.

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:44.520
[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:45.265

00:38:45.457 --> 00:38:45.960
But it's fun.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.210
But we'll see.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.200
I also think it's just wonderful
to have a group of

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:56.010
people that you have a long-term
relationship with.

developing and building

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:00.310
something new.

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:02.860
I think that's just extremely
rewarding.

[CLAIRE JOHNSON]

00:39:03.075 --> 00:39:04.050

that it's
