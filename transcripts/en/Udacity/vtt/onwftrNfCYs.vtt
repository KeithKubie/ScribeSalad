00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.160
So in this case the mutation, the variation, occurred here in the third codon

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.770
from TCT to TAT. And then using the genetic code, you would see that this

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.290
changes from a serine to a tyrosine which would be a missense mutation.
