00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.460
BRIAN DRUKER: Well
thank you, Vic.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.780
And thank you for hosting me to
visit my first visit to Google.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.190
And I hope it's not my last.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.800
What I want to do in my talk
is not really focus on science.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.580
And what I really
want to talk about

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.970
is, how did I get
to do what I did?

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.170
And it wasn't like I woke
up some day and said,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.190
I'm going to cure cancer.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.800
The reality is,
is that there were

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.220
lots of steps and lots
of processes and lots

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.710
of things had to
fall into place.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.050
And as I look back,
I can try and dissect

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.110
some of those things.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.870
And you can apply
success in any field

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.130
to success in any other field.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.460
And so I hope what I'm
talking about are, maybe,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.350
some life lessons,
maybe some things

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.900
that you probably already know.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.440
And I'm just telling you
what you already know.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.190
So I'm just going to
take you through some

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.630
of those steps, step by
step, of some of the things

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.670
that I've learned about what
had to come together for me

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.570
to go from a laboratory
to a clinical project

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.629
and, ultimately,
success in patients.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.900
So the first lesson is,
breakthroughs take time.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.750
As I said, you don't wake
up some morning and some aha

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.460
moment and you're all done.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.600
And there's oftentimes a
very, very lengthy process.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.660
And the best way
I can convince you

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.790
that breakthroughs take time
is to try to transport you

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.720
back 100 years.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.160
Let's go back 100 years.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.200
Early 1900s-- life expectancy
in the United States

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.610
is about 47 years.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.000
And the leading cause of
death in the United States

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.630
are infections.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.610
Pneumonia, tuberculosis,
diarrheal diseases--

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.820
infectious diseases
are the leading cause

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.100
of death in our country.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.200
But you go forward a
century, and pneumonia,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.590
influenza-- they make
headlines now when

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.000
a new infection comes along.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.950
When Ebola comes along,
it makes headlines.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.130
HIV, in the '80s,
made headlines,

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.690
because these are
new infections.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.250
And they were frightening.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.530
But by and large, we don't
worry in our daily lives

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.910
about infectious diseases.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.660
We worry about heart
disease, cancer.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.784
You know, when you think about
interactions with your doctor,

00:02:11.784 --> 00:02:12.950
it's, you go to your doctor.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.700
You've got cancer.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.850
Will I ever get cured?

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.840
And those are the kinds of
interactions that we have.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.340
So what happened over the
course of the last century?

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.150
What breakthroughs
occurred to lead

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.110
to the state of affairs we have
with infectious disease, where

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.920
we think of many of them
eradicated, many of them

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.900
treatable?

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.570
And I think it's, like,
1903-- we actually

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.720
started doing sewage treatment,
chlorination of water,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.120
pasteurization of milk.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.892
In the 1940s, we put
refrigerators in our houses.

00:02:45.892 --> 00:02:48.100
So these are the things we
take for granted that make

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.480
our food and water supply safe.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.350
1940s-- antibiotics.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.370
If you had said to somebody,
I'm going to specifically target

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.152
bacterial infections,
in 1900, they

00:03:01.152 --> 00:03:02.860
would have thought
you were crazy or came

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.910
from a different planet.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.740
So it wasn't until the 1940s
that penicillin came along.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.220
And then the 1950s-- vaccines.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.110
Polio vaccine was 1955.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.370
Smallpox was eradicated.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.270
And now in the news, it's people
aren't getting vaccinated.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.130
It's in the news.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.980
So we know vaccines work.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.390
But if you recast that,
that's prevention.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.760
That's specific treatments.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.469
And that's modulating
the immune system.

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:33.510
So I could go through all
of these breakthroughs.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.760
But again, this is a
century of progress

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.980
against infectious disease.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.990
So breakthroughs
certainly take time.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.000
Now the disease I
worked on-- called

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.480
chronic myeloid
leukemia-- started

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.890
with its first
description in 1845.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.150
We understood the
cause by about 1985.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.380
And by 2001, we had
a specific therapy.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.569
So that's the timeline for
the disease I worked on.

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.360
The other thing that's
important about this

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.590
is, this is what I call my
translational research slide.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.420
You describe a clinical entity.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.330
You understand it.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.490
And then you can actually
do something about it.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.339
So clinical description of CML.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:24.440
1845, two pathologists--
Bennett and Virchow--

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.690
describe the autopsy findings
of patients with leukemia.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.630
Now, let's go back to 1845.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.630
No microscopes.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.420
They did this based
on autopsy findings.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.420
And then they submitted these
articles for publication.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.950
And thereafter ensued
a rancorous debate

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.190
about who was really
first, because these

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.840
were published within
six weeks of one another.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.290
So debates about
priority-- nothing new.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.594
But think about
publishing in 1845.

00:04:58.594 --> 00:05:00.510
And some of you in this
audience have probably

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.030
grown up in a generation where
there haven't been computers.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.630
In 1845, there weren't
even typewriters.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.250
And just to give you an idea of
what the current generation is

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.140
growing up with-- my
daughter is eight years old,

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.740
my youngest daughter.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.520
And she just recently achieved
a black belt in taekwondo.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.540
And as a reward, she wanted
me to buy her a typewriter

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.350
so she could type out old
fashioned Google Docs.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.120
That was her impression
of the world.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.010
She has not lived in a
world without Google.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.170
But 1845, these
two were typeset,

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.260
submitted somehow to some
central place for review,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.960
and ultimately
they got published.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.170
And in a public
lecture, Virchow said

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.510
that Bennett had described
his case six weeks before.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.490
So Bennett gets
credit for first.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.120
So fast forward about 150 years.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.496
And the disease I worked on
called chronic myeloid leukemia

00:05:54.496 --> 00:05:57.770
is one of the four
common types of leukemia,

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.890
making up about 15% to
20% of all leukemias.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.100
There are about one to two
cases per 100,000 per year.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.510
That translates roughly to
about 5,000 new patients

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.290
per year in the United States.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.070
And that number 5,000 will
be important in a little bit.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.180
The disease can
affect any age group.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.250
But the average age of onset
is somewhere between 50 to 60.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.400
And historically, people lived
about three to five years.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.210
You got diagnosed.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.168
You went to the doctor.

00:06:25.168 --> 00:06:27.560
The doctor said, you've
got three to five years.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.920
And that was pretty much it.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.910
OK.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.630
So now, back to lessons learned.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.960
If we're going to do
anything about this disease,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.760
we need to understand it.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.135
So breakthroughs
require knowledge.

00:06:41.135 --> 00:06:42.510
You have to
actually-- hopefully,

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.210
you have to understand
what you need to do.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.750
Breakthroughs require knowledge.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.850
So if we're going to intervene
on chronic myeloid leukemia,

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.360
we need to understand
what drives

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.220
the growth of this leukemia.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.010
And here, we have two
pathologists again.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.130
Peter Nowell, David Hungerford--
working in Philadelphia

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.680
in 1960-- described
an abnormal chromosome

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.870
in the blood and bone
marrow of patients with CML.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.000
And they published
this landmark article

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.360
in the journal "Science"
which, for those of you not

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.570
in the science field, this is
the most prestigious journal

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.570
in all of scientific literature.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:25.470
This is the entire article--
three paragraphs long.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.090
That's right.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.340
Quality and quantity
do not equate.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.990
But when you publish
a scientific article,

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.490
in your last paragraph you
get to wax philosophically

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.360
about the broad implications
of your findings.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.620
And what they said
were, "The findings--"

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.570
this abnormal
chromosome-- "suggest

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.080
a causal relationship between
the chromosome abnormality

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.870
observed and [INAUDIBLE]
it was called

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.890
chronic granulocytic leukemia.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.290
Now, turns out they
were absolutely right.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.700
But in 1960, nobody
believed them.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.785
The general view was, this is
some associated abnormality.

00:07:57.785 --> 00:08:00.040
It has nothing to
do with the cause.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.190
But they were absolutely right.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.760
So next lesson--
breakthroughs often

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.780
occur when different fields
of investigation converge.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.260
And currently, there's a
lot of emphasis on what's

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.230
called conversion science.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.700
But you also have
to realize you have

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.050
to apply the right technology
to the right problem

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.594
at the right time.

00:08:23.594 --> 00:08:25.010
Now when I started
out in the lab,

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:29.120
if you could sequence an
entire gene, that was huge.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.020
And it would take you
weeks, if not months,

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.650
to do one whole gene sequence.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.890
Today we talk about,
how many genomes can we

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.820
sequence in how short
a period of time?

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.419
So if I wanted to talk about
whole genome sequencing

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.530
20 years ago, that
would have been crazy.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.310
So the reality
is, you have to do

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.270
the right technology
at the right time

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.910
based on where you are.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:54.730
And that's part of the reason
breakthroughs take time.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:59.370
In the case of CML,
there were three threads

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.120
that came together-- three
critically important threads.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.060
The field of tumor
virology was started

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.440
in and around the early
1900s with Peyton Rous

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.330
at Rockefeller University.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:14.270
Led to the oncogene field,
broke open by Bishop and Varmus

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.620
at UCSF.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.410
And that led to
the molecular cause

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.790
of chronic myeloid
leukemia, this fusion gene

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:23.700
called BCR-ABL.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.800
Abel

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.370
There was an entire field
of chromosome analysis

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.410
that identified this short
chromosome in the patients

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:37.410
with CML that lets you map genes
to chromosome locations that

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.390
allowed people to realize that
two genes had broke apart,

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:46.410
joined together, and created
this abnormal fusion gene.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.340
And this entire field of
protein phosphorylation--

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.610
a post-translational
modification of proteins--

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.350
that put phosphate onto
specific residues--

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.880
tyrosine kinase--
putting phosphate

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.250
onto tyrosine residuee-- allowed
you to begin to think about,

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.230
could you develop
a specific therapy

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.190
for this molecular abnormality?

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.660
So I got into this
field right around '85,

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.390
when all these things
were coming together.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.100
And I looked at-- I was
working on kinase at the time

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.670
and thought, here's a disease
I know is caused by kinase.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.260
I should be working on it.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.168
And maybe I can move
us this direction.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.620
So another thing I
want to talk about

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.480
is, breakthroughs require
seeing things differently.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.230
Now, everyone says, oh.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.110
You've got to think
outside the box.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.990
Well, I want to
get you to think,

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:43.100
sometimes the answer is
staring you right in the face.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.510
And you can't see it.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.870
So I'm going to an audience
participation exercise.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.530
So get ready.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.560
I'm going to put a sentence up.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.240
And the rules are, I want you
to read this sentence from start

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.180
to finish, once through.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.940
And as you're reading
this sentence,

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.890
count the number of Fs.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:01.470
OK?

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.325
Everybody ready?

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.410
OK.

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.440
Let's see how we did.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.190
How many people didn't--
raise your hands.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.960
How many people
didn't see any Fs?

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.470
How many people saw one?

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.350
How many people saw two?

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.460
How many people saw three?

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.330
How many people saw four?

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.280
How many people saw five?

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.920
How many people saw six?

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.530
How many people saw seven?

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.440
How many people saw
more than seven?

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.540
OK.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.460
Same rules.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.036
Read it through one more
time, start to finish.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:11:59.890
OK.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:05.160
Since I've-- how many
people saw one F. Two?

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.330
Three?

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.450
Four?

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.350
Five?

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.060
Six?

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.150
Seven?

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.975
OK.

00:12:16.975 --> 00:12:17.766
Go ahead and count.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.730
Six.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.710
We all read the same sentence.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.214
And the answer was
right in front of us.

00:12:33.214 --> 00:12:34.630
Now, there are
lots of reasons why

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.030
this occurs this way,
because lots of people

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.715
drop the Fs in of.

00:12:39.715 --> 00:12:41.960
But the reality is,
sometimes the answer

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.390
is right in front of you.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.540
And you just have to
see it for what it is.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.120
I'm going to give you a couple
of real life examples of where

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.585
that has happened-- one
non-medical and one medical.

00:12:54.585 --> 00:12:57.360
I'm going to start with Velcro.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.470
So Velcro-- really
useful invention.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:04.830
Turns out this guy, George de
Mestral-- a Swiss engineer--

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.400
was hiking through the woods
one day with his velvet vest on

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.490
and his dog, and comes back.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.550
And his velvet vest--
just covered with burrs.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:17.960
Now, how many millions of
people have gone on hikes,

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.940
come back with their
clothes covered with burrs,

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.890
picked the things
off their clothes,

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.320
had some choice words
for it, and then

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.350
went on with their business?

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:31.180
Well, George said, why
do these things stick

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.795
so tightly to my velvet vest?

00:13:32.795 --> 00:13:36.660
He asked the critical
question-- why?

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.380
Turns out he had a microscope
down in his basement.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.060
So he went down.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.970
And he saw that
his vest had loops.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.460
The burrs had hooks.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.840
And he said, I bet I could
make a fastener out of that.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.540
So again, something that
anybody could have seen

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.470
was right in front of him.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:57.236
And he made it into
something useful.

00:13:57.236 --> 00:13:59.610
Alexander Fleming-- a lot of
people have heard the story.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:05.275
He walks into a lab, sees
that his plate of bacteria

00:14:05.275 --> 00:14:08.890
are contaminated with yeast,
and instead of throwing it out

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.490
like millions of people
have done, including myself,

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.180
he looks at it a little bit
more carefully and says, oh.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.960
Isn't that interesting.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.290
The bacteria aren't
growing very well

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:21.230
around the yeast contamination.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.820
Maybe I should track that down.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.500
Well, the back story
of Alexander Fleming

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.070
is that he is or was a surgeon.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.150
He had spent a fair
bit of his time

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.930
during World War I
growing frustrated

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.260
at taking bullets out
of wounded soldiers,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.840
only to have them die of
infections several weeks later.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.870
So he dedicated his career
to identifying specific ways

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.010
of killing bacteria.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.860
And about 12 years after he
had started in the laboratory,

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.730
was the fateful day that he
walked into the laboratory

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.260
and saw that contaminated
plate of bacteria.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.430
So again, the answer was
right in front of somebody.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.390
But they needed to
see what was there.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:09.410
So I got into the field
around 1988, 1990.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.420
And here is where the field was.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.167
For CML, we had this
abnormal chromosome

00:15:15.167 --> 00:15:17.250
called the Philadelphia
chromosome, because that's

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.570
Nowell and Hungerford worked.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:24.200
It's present in virtually
every single patient with CML.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.000
We knew from animal models
if you put this oncogene

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.630
into mice, they get leukemia.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:33.420
And we know that it functions
as an activated intracellular

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.489
kinase.

00:15:34.489 --> 00:15:36.780
And one of the first laboratory
experiments I did was I

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.690
made a mutation in this kinase--
made it kinase inactive--

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.650
and it didn't work.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.700
So I saw this as pretty
simple, straightforward.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.260
Shut this thing down.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.354
Specific therapy.

00:15:48.354 --> 00:15:49.770
The rest of the
world thought, oh.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.220
It's a much more
complicated disease.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.040
It's not a simple disease
caused by one gene.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.380
And targeting this
probably won't work.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.010
So the way I looked at it
was, this is how kinases

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:03.330
work, over there on the left.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.510
Kinases bind ATP.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.430
They transfer phosphate in
a case of tyrosine kinases

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.430
to tyrosine residues
on proteins.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:13.770
And it's these tyrosine
phosphorylated proteins

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.830
that cause white cells
to grow uncontrollably.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.340
So I thought, you
shut that down and you

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.990
have a specific,
targeted therapy for CML.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.250
It turns out that there
were a couple of companies.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.675
One was Novartis.

00:16:29.675 --> 00:16:31.450
It used to be Ciba-Geigy.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.700
And Nick Lydon was
my colleague there.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.620
We had worked together.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.020
His company's group at
Novartis had synthesized

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.790
a handful of drugs that
seemed to shut down

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.750
a variety of kinases.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:47.570
And in 1993, they sent me a
handful of their compounds

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:48.980
for testing.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.990
And my lab showed that this
one, which ultimately turned

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.720
into Imatinib or Gleevec,
was the best of the drugs

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.910
that they had sent
me at, specifically,

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:01.040
killing CML cells.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.950
Now, it should have
been really simple.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:03.680
We had a drug.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.810
We had laboratory data.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.560
But there were lots and lots
of reasons this drug never

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.040
should have been developed.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.940
First of all, the
prevailing view

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.430
was you could never make
a drug against a kinase.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.470
The prevailing view in the
world was, I just showed you

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.750
something that binds ATP.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:25.579
Well, in the genome, there are
at least 500 to 1,000 proteins

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.630
that bind ATP.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.300
And the view was, ATP is ATP.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.050
You shut down one, you're
going to shut down all of them.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.310
And why would you ever
try to make a drug

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.690
to hit one or two or three
of these family of proteins.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.880
So the view was, its just never
going to be a viable target.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.470
So don't even bother.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.060
The next was we're oncologists.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:51.460
And oncologists, notoriously,
are a pretty pessimistic bunch.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.830
And the view was, when has
a single drug in oncology

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:55.750
ever worked?

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:00.390
So why would you ever go after
a single target in oncology?

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.800
And then even biochemists
looked at this and said,

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.940
well, you're never
going to swamp out ATP.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.899
So why bother with
that, as well.

00:18:06.899 --> 00:18:09.440
So we had all the oncologists
against and all the biochemists

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.750
against us.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:15.530
And then, we had the
problem of toxicity.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:20.200
So even if we could get a drug
against a couple of kinases,

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:25.450
the view was the early knockout
mice of individual kinases

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.460
were embryonic lethal.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.120
So even if you shut
down one kinase,

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.480
the view was, you're
going to kill people.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.680
And that's not a drug we
ever want to take a risk on.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.650
But the biggest hurdle
from the drug industry--

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.630
5,000 patients a year.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.450
How will you ever
make enough money

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.620
to justify its development?

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.600
So if you think about
this, the prevailing wisdom

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.340
is it costs somewhere between
$500 million to $1 billion

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.570
to develop a drug
from pre-clinical

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.580
on through marketing.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:01.150
And one in 10 drugs succeed.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.650
So if your market
size is 5,000 a year,

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:08.420
market projections were about
$100 million a year and a 1

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.600
in 10 chance of success.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:15.080
So if anyone wants to invest
a billion dollars for a return

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.470
on investment of
$100 million a year

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:21.370
and a one in 10 chance of
success, please let me know.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:25.320
We have lots of ideas for how
you can invest those funds.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.080
But the view was, this
would just not make enough.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:33.130
Now, it turns out everything
was wrong on this slide.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.380
And it said, we need to
develop a successful drug.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.640
You just need one patient
to develop till you've

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.380
got a successful drug.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.860
And this was my one patient.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.320
And this is a before
and after picture.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.470
Now, this is Imatinib and after.

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.900
Now, the reason I have these
numbers is the patient's wife

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.160
was an accountant.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.010
She likes numbers.

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:55.905
She likes charts and graphs.

00:19:55.905 --> 00:19:58.530
She'd come into clinic when her
husband's white count was high.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.510
And she said, Dr.
Drukar, you're not

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.910
doing very well at controlling
my husband's blood counts,

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.290
are you?

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.650
And I'd say, sheepishly, Ma'am,
I'm doing the very best I can.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.930
And I'd change his dose
of meditation around.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.430
And I'd usually overshoot.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:12.290
He'd bottom out.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.060
We'd back down.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.620
His counts would go up.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.290
And we had this seesawing
pattern of his blood counts.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:22.280
In April of '99, we started him
on Imatinib at 300 milligrams

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.340
per day.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.080
And by December of
that year, she said,

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.996
Dr. Drukar, you're
actually doing pretty well.

00:20:26.996 --> 00:20:30.680
I'm going to stop
checking up on you.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.830
Now, the FDA doesn't
like anecdotes.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:37.070
And nor do I. But the reality
is, in 2 and 1/2 years

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:41.210
from the first patient
on our clinical trial,

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.160
we got FDA approval.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.090
And it was one of the
fastest FDA approvals

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.680
in the history of
the FDA, and still

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.650
is the fastest from the
time the drug company

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:53.760
submitted the portfolio to
the approval of this drug.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:21:01.410
And in 2001, it appeared on the
cover of Time magazine with,

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.010
is this the breakthrough
we've been waiting for?

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.370
So where are we now?

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:10.250
So fast forward eight years.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:13.140
We do a very large
randomized trial.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.530
And I'm just showing you
the Imatinib or Gleevec arm.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.760
Now remember--
three to five year

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.080
life expectancy was
historical, here.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:27.470
Now, with Imatinib,
95% five year survival.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:31.370
And these curves are holding up
out to 10 years and 11 years,

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:35.220
still running about a
90% 10 year survival.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:40.050
So, completely changed the
course of this leukemia.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.920
And as Vic said, we
have taken what was once

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.730
a fatal or lethal
leukemia and turned it

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.740
into a manageable condition.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.120
But the reality
is, there are lots

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.810
of people who are benefiting.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.350
And let me just share
one story with you.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:56.496
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:56.496 --> 00:21:58.220
-Hello, everyone.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:58.987
My name is Katie.

00:21:58.987 --> 00:22:01.322
And I'm very excited
to be here tonight.

00:22:01.322 --> 00:22:03.200
I'm going to start
out by telling you

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.260
all a little bit about myself.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.586
I'm 18 years old.

00:22:06.586 --> 00:22:09.780
I'm a nursing student at
University of Portland.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.721
I graduated in the top 8%
of my high school class.

00:22:13.721 --> 00:22:14.220
I was--

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.110
Thank you.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.210
I was part of the Royal
Crowns Dance Team,

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:23.710
where I was team captain,
all state athlete, and state

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:24.900
champion.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.930
I love my dogs, Italian
food, and "Gray's Anatomy."

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.030
And when I was six years
old, I was diagnosed

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.020
with chronic myeloid leukemia.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.520
We all know what happens in a
treatment for cancer-- chemo

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.650
and radiation, hair
loss and nausea.

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.590
But would you like
to know a secret?

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.880
I never had any of that.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.890
I had Gleevec.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:54.430
Because of Brian Druker, my life
is as I described it to you.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.450
Dr. Druker began
developing Gleevec

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.060
the same year that I was born.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:02.400
And it was FDA approved just one
month before I was diagnosed.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.430
And if you want to
talk about timing,

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:07.610
that's some of the best
that I've ever heard.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.770
It's because of the
Knight Cancer Institute

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:12.000
that this timing is possible.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.300
It's because of the
Knight Cancer Institute

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.270
that Dr. Druker
was able to develop

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.002
this groundbreaking new drug.

00:23:18.002 --> 00:23:20.840
It's because of Brian that I got
to carry a first-place trophy

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.488
back to my dance team at state.

00:23:23.488 --> 00:23:25.760
And it's because of the
Knight Cancer Institute

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.310
that I'm going to school
to become a nurse.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:32.973
Can you imagine a world where
cancer is merely a memory?

00:23:32.973 --> 00:23:36.276
Brian Druker, Phil
Knight, and you together

00:23:36.276 --> 00:23:38.170
are making this a reality.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.001
And I personally thank you.

00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:42.830
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.420
BRIAN DRUKER: So
there are hundreds

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:48.320
of other stories, thousands
of other stories like this.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.800
And it's certainly
extremely gratifying

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.440
to see these things happening.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:58.610
But the reality is that
this served very much

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.720
as the groundwork for
all of what we're hearing

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.930
in personalized cancer therapy.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:06.400
It's about matching patients
with the right therapy

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.200
at the right time.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.390
And it started with Herceptin.

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:11.390
It started with Gleevec.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:13.940
It started with many of
these other drugs that

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.530
showed oncologists
that we actually

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:19.920
can develop successful
treatments based

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.660
on the knowledge of what
drives the growth of cancer.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.650
So where else has
Gleevec worked?

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.890
And it's worked in about a
dozen different diseases Vic

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:31.990
mentioned, the most
prominent of which

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:34.690
are gastrointestinal
stromal tumor, a relatively

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.720
uncommon intestinal tumor.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.950
About 2 or 3% of melanomas
have a target for Gleevec,

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:46.930
and a couple of other rare
skin and blood diseases.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.380
So what lessons have we
learned that we can now

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.560
apply to other drugs?

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.769
And I hope I've convinced
you a little bit that you

00:24:54.769 --> 00:24:56.310
have to understand
what you're doing.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.520
You need to have a good target.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.910
And if you have a good
target and a good drug,

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:05.680
you really can get good results.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.290
Now, I've used this slide
for many, many years.

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.670
And as you can tell, I've put a
lot of emphasis on the target.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:15.240
But recently, I've been reminded
by a couple of near drug

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.600
failures that you
also need a good drug.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.840
And there have been a couple
of examples, recently,

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.280
where there are some
really good targets.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.140
And the one example I'd
use is BRAF and melanoma.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.250
There are a couple of
drugs that came out

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.810
that were called RAF inhibitors.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.760
But they weren't very good.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.769
They didn't work in
metastatic melanoma.

00:25:34.769 --> 00:25:35.810
And then people said, oh.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:37.900
It must be the target.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.910
When other companies
came in with really good

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:45.500
mutant BRAF drugs, 60% to 80%
response rate and some pretty

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.090
good durability.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.510
So bad drugs almost
killed good targets.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.200
So I have to balance
this equation.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.910
Need both sides-- good
drugs, good targets.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:59.630
And you can get good results.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.710
So if we're going to translate
the success of Gleevec

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.370
to other cancers,
we have to start

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:06.990
by getting the right targets.

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:12.230
These are going to be the early
changes that cause the tumor.

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:15.090
But we have to treat early
in the course of the disease.

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:17.820
If we use Gleevec for
early stage disease,

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:18.960
it works really well.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.830
If we get patients at much more
advanced disease, it works.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:26.070
But people more likely
become resistant.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:29.120
So to do that, we have to
develop reliable techniques

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.492
for early detection.

00:26:30.492 --> 00:26:32.950
And these aren't going to be
things that will detect things

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:34.170
that don't need treatment.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:36.560
These are things that
actually need treatment

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:41.020
because we may deploy
some toxic therapies.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.510
And we have to smart
about what we're doing,

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:46.440
getting the right
patient the right drug.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.710
So if you have the
right drug like Gleevec,

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.310
we know what disease
it will work for.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.260
We know what diseases it won't.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:58.740
We can be smarter about
patient stratification.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.770
So where are we now?

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:03.580
We're still, in cancer, in
this kind of empirical world

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.910
where we treat cancer because
it's breast cancer, lung

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:09.310
cancer, colon cancer.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:11.340
We use a lot of
empiric treatments.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.840
And a lot of them
are pretty toxic.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.020
And we never know who's going
to respond and who won't.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:20.310
And we just can't predict
what's going to happen.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.580
But that's changing.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.240
And with precision
medicine, we're

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.840
headed toward an era
where we understand what's

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.600
driving the growth of
each and every cancer

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.330
and we treat based
on that knowledge.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:34.740
And it doesn't matter if you
have prostate cancer, breast

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.010
cancer, or lung cancer.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:38.325
We treat based on the target.

00:27:38.325 --> 00:27:41.990
It's much like a mechanic
lifting up the hood of a car

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:45.230
and seeing there's an engine in
whatever kind of car you drive.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.300
And the same parts will break.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.460
And we base the treatments
on knowledge-- information.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.390
And the treatments can and
will work the first time.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:28:01.410
They're going to be far more
effective and far less toxic.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:06.200
And if you look at the spectrum
of lung cancer, at least

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:10.820
over half of the mutations in
lung cancer are already known.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.690
And 10 years ago, my
colleagues in lung cancer

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:15.930
were the most pessimistic bunch.

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:18.840
But now, lung cancer
is the poster child

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.420
for precision medicine in
all of oncology because

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.640
of this knowledge
driving the way

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.761
that treatments are deployed.

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:32.750
But in addition, as I said,
deploying the right technology

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:36.170
at the right time, what
an amazing opportunity

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.540
we have with the ability
to interrogate tumors.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.840
We can do whole
genome sequencing.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.610
We can do expression profiles.

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:47.040
We can understand
metabolomics, proteomics.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.640
And you guys here can put
all this together and tell us

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.020
in the clinic what
to do about it.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.650
That's really exciting to me
because this is all happening.

00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:58.300
And it's happening now.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:02.720
And it's allowing us to use
precision treatments based

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.170
on knowledge, not
just empiricism.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.360
So I talked to you about
where we were a century ago.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.130
And what do I see
for this century?

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:19.150
And I see us taking a very
similar broad-based approach

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.080
to cancer, as we did
for infectious diseases

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.720
in the last century.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.850
And although I've
focused a lot of my talk

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:30.320
on specific therapies
directed at critical targets,

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.400
that's sort of like
saying antibiotics

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.810
are going to be all we
need for infections.

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:37.310
We know we need more.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.350
We know we need to
understand and harness

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.660
the power of the immune system.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.094
And I'm really pleased
with what's happening here.

00:29:44.094 --> 00:29:46.260
Despite the fact that I've
had this slide in my deck

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.710
for over a decade
and it's been really

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.600
hard to point to any success
in the immune therapy,

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.810
now there are real successes.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:56.330
There are half a
dozen different drugs

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:58.620
targeting the ability
of the immune system

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:01.110
to kill cancer that are working.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:04.520
And they're working
incredibly well.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.240
But in addition, we have
to think about prevention

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.980
and early diagnosis.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:16.170
Now the reality is
that, for every $1,000

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:20.060
we spend on the first two,
we're spending about $1

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:23.230
on these last-- prevention,
early detection.

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:26.370
And in my view, even
though my own institution

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:30.310
is doing a lot of work in the
specific therapies because

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.950
of our leadership
position-- I worry a lot

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:34.825
that we're not doing
enough in the prevention

00:30:34.825 --> 00:30:36.840
and early detection.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:43.010
So because of that, I started
to put together a plan.

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.040
And I started to seek investors.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.670
And if you know the
landscape of Oregon,

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:50.490
there's one real
billionaire-- Phil Knight,

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.380
co-founder of Nike.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.480
And my institution,
cancer institution,

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.870
bears his name because
of a $100 million

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:01.950
donation he gave us about
six or seven years ago.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:03.780
So we began to put
together a plan.

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.200
We went back to Mr.
Knight and his family

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.250
and talked about what
we might want to do.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.880
And to set this up,
about a year and a half

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.180
ago we held an event.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.045
He and his wife were
the honorary co-chairs.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:21.260
For those of you that know Phil
Knight, he's incredibly shy.

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.770
He doesn't like public speaking.

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:24.644
The only way I got him
to show up was to say,

00:31:24.644 --> 00:31:26.630
you don't have to say a word.

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.340
A week in advance, he
called me and said,

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.030
is it OK if I introduce you?

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:32.985
Well, of course it's
OK if you introduce me.

00:31:32.985 --> 00:31:34.360
Is anything I can
do to help you?

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.130
Do you need my bio?

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:35.630
No, no, no.

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.680
I'll just say a few things.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.080
So nobody in the
audience had any clue

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.650
what he was going to
say, including me.

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:45.723
But this is what he said.

00:31:45.723 --> 00:31:46.590
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:53.020
-As I speak, there is a
grandfather, a mother,

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.500
a child who hugs
a loved one, hugs

00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:01.200
a loved one he or she
would not be able to hug

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.000
if it were not for Brian Druker.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.420
It is incumbent on
everyone in this room

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:13.400
to do what he can to
keep the miracles coming.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:20.020
And I speak to myself, as well
as to all of the rest of you.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:25.690
Accordingly, I make
the following pledge.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:31.395
Penny and I will
donate $500 million

00:32:31.395 --> 00:32:36.370
to OHSU if it is
matched in pledges

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:39.190
within two years in a
fundraising campaign.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:56.270
If the campaign
raises 499 million,

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:58.110
we are relieved of our pledge.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:04.626
If it raises 500
million or 10 billion,

00:33:04.626 --> 00:33:08.500
our donation will
be 500 million.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:13.160
Is there a higher calling
than curing cancer?

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.510
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:20.160
BRIAN DRUKER: So, two years,
500 million, all or nothing.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.080
To give you a little
bit of context here,

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:26.290
my cancer center has raised five
or 10 million in a good year.

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:30.610
So, seemingly impossible feat.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:34.250
But here's where we are
with about 10 months

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:40.310
to go-- 482 million raised,
including 200 from the state.

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:43.540
This 200 from the state
for buildings counts.

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.150
Over time, we'll replace that.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:48.678
So it's about a $1.2
billion investment.

00:33:48.678 --> 00:33:52.360
Now what's remarkable
about the state was,

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:56.190
when we went to the state it
was, isn't this what you wanted

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:57.670
your state to be known for?

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:00.340
Aren't these the kinds
of job that you want?

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.780
And it was passed 85 to five.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.680
Republicans, Democrats
agreed on something.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.520
We've gone out to the
business community.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.850
They've gotten behind it.

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:11.669
We've gone to the
labor community.

00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:12.710
They've gotten behind it.

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:16.340
They had a campaign called
Unite for the Knight.

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.120
We've had donors
from all 50 states.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.810
We've had bake sales.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.139
We've had $50 donors.

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:26.120
We've had hundred
million dollar donors.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.120
But people have
rallied behind this.

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.590
And they have put us close.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:35.520
But as Mr. knight said, 499,
we don't get anything from him.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.300
So we have to get
to that finish line.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.949
So you know, and I'm
talking to Google.

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:43.350
And a billion dollars
might seem like not a lot.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:47.920
But for academics, a
billion dollars is a ton.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.450
And so what we
want to do, though,

00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:51.100
is we want to do
something differently.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.139
We want to stop being
a bunch of academics

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:56.060
working on disparate projects.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.330
We want to make an impact.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.790
And so we want to
think about, how

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:04.810
can we make an impact by putting
together a team of people

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:07.190
and focus them on a problem?

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:13.940
So in a very short order,
we want to assemble a team.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.160
We want to focus them.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.250
We don't want them spending
all their time writing grants.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.340
We want them to focus
on solving a problem.

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:26.980
We want to equip them well,
get them the right tools

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.180
so they can actually
focus on the work.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.840
We want them to work as a team.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.690
And I know, again, at
a place like Google,

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:36.340
teamwork seems so obvious.

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:39.960
But in academics, we
don't incentivize it.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.910
We incentivize people to do
individual parts of a puzzle

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:46.630
and hope it works out some day.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:49.710
Why don't we work as a
team, focus on a problem,

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:52.050
and solve the problem instead
of making the problem,

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.008
how are you going to get
your next grant or how

00:35:54.008 --> 00:35:56.490
or what are you
going to publish?

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.509
And we want to be
open and sharing.

00:35:58.509 --> 00:36:00.050
If there are people
around the world,

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:02.020
around the country
that can help us,

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.617
we want to work with
people that can help us.

00:36:04.617 --> 00:36:06.700
If some of the money needs
to go outside of Oregon

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.500
because somebody doesn't want
to move there, we can do that.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.360
We want to solve a problem.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.256
And in addition,
we're going to have

00:36:14.256 --> 00:36:15.910
to train a whole
bunch of people,

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:17.990
because we don't think
the workforce exists

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:20.040
to do this work today.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.050
But we want this
work to be sustained.

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:25.930
So it's an ambitious plan.

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:28.040
We're just getting
started on that.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.280
We're planning our buildings.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.920
Were beginning to recruit people
as we close in on our goal.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:35.730
But along the way, we've
actually had some fun.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:40.890
So this is Gert Boyle,
Columbia Sportswear.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:43.530
And she had this ad
campaign several decades ago

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:48.530
where she put her son
under ice or throw snow

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:51.420
at him with a snow bulldozer.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.240
And she was called
one tough mother.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.360
Gert-- actually, I
worked with her sister

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.300
as an undergraduate
at UC San Diego.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.940
And Gert donated $100
million to our campaign.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:05.830
So we put together this
thank you campaign with her.

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:07.510
But more importantly,
what Gert did was

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:10.486
she inspired our most
important people.

00:37:10.486 --> 00:37:12.290
And that's our patients.

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:14.480
This is a patient who's
going through a bone marrow

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.480
transplant for her lymphoma.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.230
And she wanted to get
on the action, too.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:21.580
So she's got her one
tough patient tattoo.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.320
So we have a lot of work to do.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.640
We have a lot of promise.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:26.860
We have a lot of potential.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.560
We need to live up to that.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.720
But I'm confident
we can do that.

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.270
And in closing, the people
I really want to thank

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:37.582
are the patients who went
on this journey with me.

00:37:37.582 --> 00:37:39.040
These are people
who had been told,

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.880
get your affairs in order.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.060
You may have less than
six months to live.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.350
And they found their way
to our clinical trials.

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.600
And they're still here today,
doing things they enjoy.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:52.930
This is a picture of the longest
continuous patient on Gleevec.

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:57.140
She is now 16 and a half years
from taking her last family

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.670
trip because she
thought she wasn't

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:01.740
going to be around much longer.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.160
First patient from Italy
doing things he loves,

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.680
which is dancing.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.580
Patients spending time
with their grandchildren.

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:14.390
And this is actually
a 14-year-old picture.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:16.430
She now has two
great-grandchildren

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:19.860
from the two older
children on this picture.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:23.830
Lots of people who traveled to
Oregon for our clinical trials.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:26.360
And some people doing some
absolutely remarkable things.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:30.440
This is a photo of a woman
who came to Oregon in 2000,

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.830
was the first patient from
Australia treated with Gleevec.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:35.670
She went back to
Sydney and was one

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:39.460
of the torch bearers for the
Sydney Olympic games in 2000.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:44.360
So individual people,
individual success.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.730
But it all starts to add up.

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:49.550
And so, we can take
one disease at a time,

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:51.090
one person at a time.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:53.310
And it all starts to add up.

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:57.160
And this is my picture of
hope, my hope for the future

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.990
that we see lots more
pictures like this of people

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:03.720
surviving and thriving
despite a diagnosis of cancer.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.645
Thank you very much.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:14.160
MALE SPEAKER: And Brian,
maybe first I can ask,

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.590
every generation--
every 10 years

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:18.755
or so-- there is
a war on cancer,

00:39:18.755 --> 00:39:21.290
a battle declared on cancer.

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:23.390
Each generation
has its own reasons

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:27.170
to be optimistic about new
scientific developments, things

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:28.660
that happen in allied fields.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.480
And I know you mentioned
a bit about this.

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.100
But perhaps you
could tell us why

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.920
you are particularly
optimistic this time

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.790
that, not a cure for
cancer, but at least

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:39.910
management of cancer
as a chronic condition

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:40.577
is within reach.

00:39:40.577 --> 00:39:42.159
BRIAN DRUKER: So I
don't know how much

00:39:42.159 --> 00:39:44.560
of "The Emperor of All
Maladies" you'll show

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.830
or you people have watched.

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:51.310
But it's so different than
it was 20, 30 years ago

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:52.250
when I started out.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:55.370
And we had no knowledge
of what we were doing.

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:57.380
It was all empiric.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:01.620
And when we think about hope,
to me this is real hope.

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:04.670
And when you see rapid,
dramatic responses because

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:08.790
of an understanding of a
cancer, as opposed to something

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:12.610
that you have no clue what,
how, or why it will work,

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.400
and we really-- to
me, it's a matter

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.050
of unraveling this puzzle.

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:19.180
And so I think that, actually,
it's a very different feel.

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.280
When I have lung
cancer doctors who

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.110
are optimistic about
what they can do

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:26.500
or melanoma doctors
or the New York Times

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.080
has an article about kidney
cancer doctors having

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:34.110
five drugs they can use, when
five years ago they had none,

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:37.250
and oncologists are even
becoming optimistic--

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:41.560
when that happens, there
has to be some real hope.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.190
And again, I just think we're
taking a completely different

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:47.980
approach by understanding
sort of these three pillars.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.335
In the past it's always
been, we've got to kill it.

00:40:50.335 --> 00:40:51.210
We've got to kill it.

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:52.432
We've got to kill it.

00:40:52.432 --> 00:40:54.640
And now it's, we've got to--
yes, we have to kill it.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.860
But we have to kill
it more intelligently.

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.310
We have to bring in
the immune system.

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:02.470
And then we have to think
about moving up more early.

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.080
And so it's always knowledge
driving it as opposed

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.070
to this empiric, maybe we'll
just combine the right drugs

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:09.159
and get lucky.

00:41:09.159 --> 00:41:09.950
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:11.980
And I do think,
in this audience,

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.680
most people will be familiar
with the new tools that

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.720
are generating new information
about the molecular basis

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:21.210
of cancer and the new ontology
of the diseases resulting.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:23.630
Let's talk about the other
two things that you mentioned.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:27.514
One-- you called it the
other side of the equation.

00:41:27.514 --> 00:41:28.680
Let's start with that first.

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.763
I wonder if you could tell
us about some new tools

00:41:30.763 --> 00:41:34.120
and techniques for manipulating
cancer, manipulating the tumor

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.750
environment, including
the immunotherapies.

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:40.300
BRIAN DRUKER: So, one of the
things that we're understanding

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.730
about cancer is that cancer
isn't just this isolated tumor

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:44.930
that grows on its own.

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:46.970
And it's surrounded by
lots of immune cells.

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:49.590
It has a micro environment.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:51.680
But the best
analogy I ever heard

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.920
was, I was talking
about this to a guy

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.430
by the name of
Wayne Drinkward who

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:57.930
owns a construction company.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:59.270
And he's a really bright guy.

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:00.145
And he said, oh yeah.

00:42:00.145 --> 00:42:03.740
I got and I do accident
assessments at my site.

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:06.490
And sometimes it's a bad
worker, and sometimes

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:10.030
the bad environment that causes
all of my workplace accidents.

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.090
So cancer isn't any different.

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:14.729
Sometimes you'll get
a bad seed driving

00:42:14.729 --> 00:42:15.770
the growth of the cancer.

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:18.660
But sometimes it's the
soil around the cancer

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:22.510
or the inability of the immune
system to attack and target it.

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:25.390
And understanding cancer's
three dimensional system

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:30.290
using either organized, growing
in better, reproducible mouse

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:33.660
systems, allows us to
do better interrogation

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:36.660
of what's driving the growth of
the cancer and what might work

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.650
and what might not.

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:40.440
MALE SPEAKER: So,
a related question.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.190
I mean, we've known since
before the time of aims

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:48.350
that there are some
environmental factors which

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:50.300
cause cancer.

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:54.050
We also now know of many genetic
factors, many genetic lesions

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:56.000
which predispose one to cancer.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.920
Looking at an audience like
this, how would you say-- how

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.290
would you think about the
genetic risk for cancer?

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:02.730
What causes cancer?

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:04.800
And how do you think
about environmental risk?

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.210
How has that changed with
these new tools and techniques?

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.370
BRIAN DRUKER: Well, I
may give a longer answer.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:11.180
So bear with me.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.892
MALE SPEAKER: Please.

00:43:12.892 --> 00:43:14.850
BRIAN DRUKER: First I
want to make a pitch for,

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:18.910
we have to continue to recognize
that we need to get people not

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:20.980
to start smoking or to stop.

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.790
It's still the number one
cause of cancer deaths

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:25.090
in our country.

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:28.100
But why is smoking so lethal?

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.270
And it's lethal for two reasons.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.810
First of all, it
directly damages DNA.

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:35.770
And second of all, it
injures lung tissue.

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:38.140
So it causes the cells to grow.

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.420
So it's a double hit.

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.670
It causes your cell to grow.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:43.029
And when they grow,
the DNA gets damaged.

00:43:43.029 --> 00:43:43.945
That causes mutations.

00:43:43.945 --> 00:43:46.250
They're going to drive cancer.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.760
But that gives you a window
into other environmental causes.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.140
Chronic inflammation that causes
cells to grow more predisposes

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.010
to cancer.

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:59.040
Things that damage DNA--
going to predispose to cancer.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:07.680
People born with BRCA defects
that can't repair DNA mutations

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.550
are more predisposed.

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:13.920
So we can begin to get an
insight into predispositions,

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.230
both genetically from--
clearly, all of us

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:19.880
carry some predispositions,
genetically.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.530
You overlay that upon
environmental factors,

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:26.770
either through exposure
to infections, exposure

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:29.190
to things that
cause inflammation.

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:31.140
We actually can take
the same paradigm

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:34.400
and move it back and
say, if we understand

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.300
what our predispositions
are, either genetically

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:41.200
or, at some point in time,
we see some reaction that

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:45.290
causes some inflammation, we
actually begin to get targets.

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:48.290
So instead of this
broad-based vitamin C,

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:50.600
vitamin E-- pick your
favorite vitamin,

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.895
or something is going to
lower your chance of cancer.

00:44:53.895 --> 00:44:56.270
We're going to be able to
actually go and target and say,

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:59.660
if you take this medication
for this period of time,

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.820
we'll lower your risk of cancer.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:04.530
And we'll do it in
a more precise way.

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:06.720
I don't think we're
quite ready for that,

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.649
other than in very
well-defined conditions.

00:45:08.649 --> 00:45:09.440
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.960
BRIAN DRUKER: But we have
the tools to understand that

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:16.760
by doing sequencing, doing
it again, and monitoring

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:20.250
large cohorts of people to
see what their outcomes are.

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:23.380
MALE SPEAKER: So you
evoked inflammation, again.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:25.280
And I want to return
to the question

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.650
about the immune response and
modulating the immune response.

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:31.190
But do you see the
modulation of inflammation,

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:35.980
in a generic sense, as a viable
chemo prevention strategy?

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:39.600
BRIAN DRUKER: I'm certainly
open to considering

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:44.350
general immune modulation as a
potential for decreasing cancer

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:45.190
risk.

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:48.780
Part of that's going to
mean, how safe are the drugs?

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.430
Or would you look at
high risk populations?

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:53.750
Given a window, if you
see some inflammation,

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.210
could you decrease that?

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:57.480
Or in people, certainly,
with chronic inflammatory

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:00.780
conditions-- we know that, for
example, chronic pancreatitis

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:04.080
is one of the highest risk
factors for pancreatic cancer.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.450
Now, there's a target
population where,

00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:09.390
if you wanted to decrease
the risk of a deadly disease,

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:11.510
that would be a population
where I would think

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:13.220
you could run a clinical trial.

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:16.250
And we know that ulcerative
colitis-- Crohn's disease--

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:18.129
very high risk of colon cancer.

00:46:18.129 --> 00:46:20.670
And depending on where you are
on the course of that disease,

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:24.410
a colectomy may be a
recommended course of treatment.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:25.985
I think we can do
better than that.

00:46:25.985 --> 00:46:26.430
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:28.420
BRIAN DRUKER: And similarly
with BRCA1, BRCA2,

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.695
we recommend some pretty
significant surgeries--

00:46:31.695 --> 00:46:34.350
mastectomies, oophorectomy.

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:36.640
Could we think of a
medical intervention?

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:39.220
And again, if you start
to extrapolate that all

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:43.240
on that spectrum, we'll get to,
still, high risk conditions.

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.490
If we come up with the right
genetic framework that say,

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:47.990
we might be able
to target somebody,

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:51.140
or if they have an inflammatory
condition on top of that,

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:53.020
maybe we intervene.

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:55.030
And I'll give you
one more example

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:59.010
of an investigator who's looking
at postpartum breast cancer.

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:02.934
Really, very highly lethal
form of breast cancer.

00:47:02.934 --> 00:47:05.100
And it has to do with the
change of the breasts that

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:07.610
occur when women are
pregnant and then either

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:10.570
breastfeed or don't, and
the changes occur there.

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:12.740
There may be a
window where you can

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.340
use an anti-inflammatory
that would

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:17.560
lower the risk of getting that
lethal form of breast cancer.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.747
So we have, already,
lots of clues there.

00:47:19.747 --> 00:47:20.830
MALE SPEAKER: Interesting.

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:24.350
And if there are any questions,
please just stand up.

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:25.060
Philip?

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:28.530
The slide which
showed four hurdles

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:30.860
in the development of
Gleevec, and he asks you

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:32.599
to dive deep into one of them.

00:47:32.599 --> 00:47:33.390
BRIAN DRUKER: Yeah.

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:37.090
So, one of the more
interesting stories

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:41.910
was there were some animal
toxicity with Gleevec

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:46.040
in the early animal
studies in rats and dogs.

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.680
And I looked at the way the
study was done and thought,

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.840
well, wait a second.

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.130
We give a therapy to people.

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:56.060
We give toxic
chemotherapy to people.

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:58.310
And as an oncologist, I'm
not afraid of a little bit

00:47:58.310 --> 00:47:59.820
of toxicity.

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:03.430
And if I see some liver enzymes
going up, we stop the drug.

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:05.580
That doesn't concern me.

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:08.840
But the people at the company
were really worried about that.

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.934
They didn't want to do anything.

00:48:10.934 --> 00:48:12.850
And because of the way
the company was set up,

00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:16.730
they couldn't go and talk to
the FDA to ask their advice.

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:18.460
So I called up the FDA.

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.130
And I said, here's
the toxicity package.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:20.880
What do you think?

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:21.770
Oh, my goodness.

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:23.260
That's more than we usually see.

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:24.977
Why don't you send it through?

00:48:24.977 --> 00:48:27.310
So I called the company back,
told them what I had done.

00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:29.020
And they were really
upset with me.

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:30.350
And nobody does this.

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:33.000
This is not the way
we do things here.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.130
But it was enough to get them
to consider that, maybe, we

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:38.600
could actually get
this through the FDA

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.870
to start a clinical trial.

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:45.080
And the other story
I'll tell is--

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.190
and how did I finally
convince the company?

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:50.854
And for years, I would
approach the company

00:48:50.854 --> 00:48:52.270
when one of my
patients would die.

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:55.690
And I'd say, why don't you
go into clinical trials?

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:59.320
And what I realize now, that--
I didn't have kids at the time.

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.000
And [INAUDIBLE] have kids.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.750
I still am struck by the
fact when I ask my kids, what

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:05.820
do you want for dinner?

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:06.410
I don't know.

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:08.030
What do we got?

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:10.540
And then I say, well, would
you like pizza or hamburger?

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:11.912
They'll make a decision.

00:49:11.912 --> 00:49:13.620
Or they may say, I
don't want either one.

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.161
But at least they'll
make a decision.

00:49:15.161 --> 00:49:16.590
They'll make a choice.

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:19.342
And when I say to the
drug-- what I learned was,

00:49:19.342 --> 00:49:21.300
people aren't actually
any different than kids.

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:23.100
They're just more grown up.

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.970
But they still make
decisions the same way.

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:26.330
And we give them an
open-ended question.

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:27.700
Why don't you develop this drug?

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:28.700
I don't know.

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.400
We don't want to.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.220
Then when I gave
them a choice, and I

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:34.890
worked with Nick Lydon, who
had actually now gone to a spin

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:37.590
out company-- and said,
would you develop this drug

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:40.340
in a limited phase one trial
or would you license it out

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:41.970
to Nick and me?

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:43.760
Now they've got a choice.

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.170
Now they can take it to a board.

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:48.460
And they can say, which
one do you want to do?

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:51.240
And they decided, we want to
run our own limited scale phase

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:54.370
one because if it works, we
want all the royalties and all

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:55.950
the income off the drug.

00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:57.720
So they made a choice.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:02.449
So a really simple sort of aha
moment that, 20 years later, I

00:50:02.449 --> 00:50:04.740
realized I did the right
thing by giving them a choice.

00:50:06.844 --> 00:50:09.260
MALE SPEAKER: It's interesting,
just to follow up on that.

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:11.610
I mean, you're of course
famous for your perseverance

00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:14.470
over these
bureaucratic obstacles.

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:18.100
Has the environment in oncology
drug development changed?

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:22.920
Or do we still face many
of the same obstacles?

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.640
BRIAN DRUKER: I sort of divide
the world into those that get

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:26.700
it and those that don't.

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:30.110
There are some companies
that are completely on board.

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:33.050
And some companies are still
stuck back 20 years ago

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:34.990
and are looking at
how much money we're

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:39.220
going to make as opposed to,
can we get this through quickly?

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.720
Can we get to the
market and then expand?

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:44.800
And Gleevec-- I don't get
any royalties on Gleevec.

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.800
It was already patented
when it came into my lab

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.050
against any tumor in
a warm blooded mammal.

00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:52.170
So there was nothing I was
going to add to that patent.

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:56.780
And Novartis's revenue was $4
billion last year on Gleevec.

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:59.890
So they completely
mis-estimated, underestimated

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:00.819
the market.

00:51:00.819 --> 00:51:02.860
And again, the point is,
if you can get something

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:06.430
to clinic quickly
and then expand

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:07.830
that's, to me, the way to go.

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:09.422
And some companies
really do get that.

00:51:09.422 --> 00:51:11.380
MALE SPEAKER: So, just
to repeat the question--

00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:15.560
Joseph's question is about the
idiosyncratic nature of Gleevec

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:19.020
with respect to other
targeted cancer therapies

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:22.150
and that the
response is durable.

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:23.650
BRIAN DRUKER: That's
why I say we've

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:25.608
got to treat early in
the course of the disease

00:51:25.608 --> 00:51:27.490
when the disease
are less complex.

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:32.300
I don't think we're going to win
by targeting advanced cancer.

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.390
We're going to win by
treating it more early when

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:36.790
it's less
heterogeneous, when it's

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:38.520
more treatable, more curable.

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:41.630
And that's why I'm moving
a significant effort

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:44.010
that direction, because
I'm tired of having

00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:47.060
to answer the question
like this, which is, yes.

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:49.440
We need to get-- I
think we might be OK

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.620
with triple,
quadruple combinations

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:55.490
of the right targets, shutting
down bypass mechanisms.

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:57.650
But it's going to
be really tough.

00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:59.860
And it's going to take
decades to do that.

00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:02.090
At that same point, I
want to move up earlier.

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:06.610
When the diseases looked
more like CML-- because CML,

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:10.270
in its earliest stage, is
kind of a pre-malignancy that,

00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:12.760
ultimately, will convert
to a fatal malignancy,

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.310
in three to five years.

00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:17.610
If I can move the clock
back for other diseases,

00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:20.162
we can have more
treatments like this.

00:52:20.162 --> 00:52:21.620
MALE SPEAKER: What
do you think are

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:24.840
the most impressive
new methods to study

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.440
the pre-malignant to malignant
transition in cancer?

00:52:29.696 --> 00:52:31.820
BRIAN DRUKER: I wish I had
a great answer for that.

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:35.290
I think it's going
to require studying

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:37.340
of the right
patient populations.

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.170
And by that, I
mean a large cohort

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:45.140
of people falling over
time to see what lesions,

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:49.020
what abnormalities
correlate with poor outcome.

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.790
I think we can accelerate that.

00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:53.690
And when I've talked about--
you know, Oregon, for example.

00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:55.970
Could we go and look at
every man or woman who

00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:58.670
has died of breast
or prostate cancer

00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:00.670
and ask the question why?

00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:02.830
Did we not detect their
cancer early enough?

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:03.700
OK.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.340
Maybe that's a reason.

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:09.330
But if we did detect it-- if
we didn't, what do we need?

00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:12.182
What could we have detected
early that would have said,

00:53:12.182 --> 00:53:13.640
this is what we
should be detecting

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:17.385
in these patients who are still
dying of their other cancers?

00:53:17.385 --> 00:53:18.760
And can we learn
from the people,

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:22.040
from samples that are
already out there, as to what

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.134
we should be detecting?

00:53:23.134 --> 00:53:25.050
So I think there are
certainly some early wins

00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:26.720
we might be able to get to.

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.190
But what to detect,
how to detect it--

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:31.010
that's our next decade of work.

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:35.100
MALE SPEAKER: Well, what
about new animal model systems

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:36.450
or in-vitro model systems?

00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:39.240
I know we were discussing
some of this at lunch.

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.830
What's your feeling about--

00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:43.180
BRIAN DRUKER: Oh, I may be a
little controversy on this.

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:43.610
But--

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:44.484
MALE SPEAKER: Please.

00:53:44.484 --> 00:53:48.360
BRIAN DRUKER: My view of the
best way to study human cancer

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:50.630
is to study humans.

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:53.200
And I don't think we
have great animal models.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.520
I think animal models
may be informative

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:59.006
for certain questions about
where in the micro environment

00:53:59.006 --> 00:54:00.880
because you can't do
those studies in people.

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:03.350
But if you want the
genetic lesions,

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:04.920
I think you've
got to get people,

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:07.220
because they're going to
tell you what's happening.

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:10.540
And we can artificially put them
into animal models and say, oh.

00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:13.500
We have a model of
pancreatic cancer.

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.580
But then you've got to go and
validate it in people anyway.

00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:19.090
So why not just skip
that intermediate

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:20.590
and go right to people?

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:22.910
MALE SPEAKER: So does
your skepticism also

00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:25.570
extend to patient-derived
xenografts,

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:28.890
organoid models, some
things that are hybrids

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:29.932
between these approaches?

00:54:29.932 --> 00:54:32.181
BRIAN DRUKER: Patient-derived
xenografts and organoids

00:54:32.181 --> 00:54:34.452
are the things that we are
moving to in our center.

00:54:34.452 --> 00:54:36.660
And I certainly believe in
them because they allow us

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.410
to recapitulate human cancer.

00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:42.000
But to come up with
an artificial model

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.560
that you say looks like,
smells like, but it still

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.970
isn't human cancer--
again, I think

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:51.375
our resources should be devoted
to study of human cancer.

00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:57.900
MALE SPEAKER: And this raises
another logical question

00:54:57.900 --> 00:54:59.929
about modeling the
immune system in animals,

00:54:59.929 --> 00:55:01.095
which of course is fraught--

00:55:01.095 --> 00:55:01.420
BRIAN DRUKER: Yeah.

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:01.700
Right.

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:03.170
MALE SPEAKER: So let's
go back to the question

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:04.340
of immunotherapies.

00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:07.500
What do you think is the
next step, beyond just

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.900
checkpoint inhibition
or combinations

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:11.730
of checkpoint inhibitors
with other things?

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:15.520
What's the next step in
immunomodulation and control

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:19.050
and re-engineering, if you
will, of the immune system?

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:21.080
BRIAN DRUKER: The
biggest issue to me is,

00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:24.000
we can't predict who will
respond to immunotherapeutics

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.500
and who won't.

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:28.620
And if we could
understand that, we

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:31.820
might be able to convert
non-responders into responders,

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:34.620
whether that be-- is
it mutational burden?

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:37.285
Is it the inability of the T
cells to infiltrate and then

00:55:37.285 --> 00:55:38.700
get activated?

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:42.070
What is it about certain tumor
types or certain patients?

00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:44.620
In melanoma, it's a 20%
to 30% response rate?

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:46.730
And some of them are
incredibly durable.

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:48.660
What about the other 60% to 70%?

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:51.330
Why aren't they
responding as well?

00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:54.320
So I think we need to
understand who's who.

00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.994
And if we understand why, then
we might be able to convert.

00:55:56.994 --> 00:55:59.410
And to me, that's the biggest
hurdle in immunotherapeutics

00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:00.382
right now.

00:56:00.382 --> 00:56:02.590
MALE SPEAKER: Just the
information and understanding.

00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:04.110
So, other questions?

00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:05.045
Stephanie, first.

00:56:05.045 --> 00:56:05.870
BRIAN DRUKER: I've
been trying to--

00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:07.950
MALE SPEAKER: Stephanie
asks you to contrast

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:11.520
the different response rates or
the durability of the response

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:13.170
rates in two tumors.

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:14.840
And she asks whether
it's a function

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:16.750
of the stage of diagnosis.

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:19.750
BRIAN DRUKER: So, for those
of you that don't know just

00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:23.860
as well as-- the
response rate to Imatinib

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:27.430
with CML is a quite
durable response.

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:31.020
And as I showed, their
survival curve 85, 90%.

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:32.990
With gastrointestinal
stromal tumors,

00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:35.720
responses last on a median
of two to three years.

00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:38.040
And then you'll see resistance.

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:43.270
So the reasons for that,
I'm not entirely clear.

00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:45.940
One possibility is
that imagine Imatinib

00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:48.960
isn't quite as potent
against the target in GIST

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:52.710
as it is against
the target in CML.

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:56.040
The other is, you typically are
getting the tumors a little bit

00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.850
later in GIST than
you do in CML.

00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:01.630
So that may kind
of tie into that.

00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:05.890
But it also comes back to
my comments about earlier.

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:09.780
If you use adjuvant Imatinib,
for three to five years

00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:11.740
we actually are seeing
survival benefits

00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:13.580
and significant
survival benefits.

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:17.140
So again, it may just be
the biological heterogeneity

00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:19.310
by a later detection.

00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:21.800
Or, as you catch
these tumors earlier,

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.950
we may have a bigger impact.

00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:26.920
MALE SPEAKER: The question
is that many cancers may

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:32.150
have a genetic profile that is
not targetable or even lacks

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:35.090
a clear target or a
known driver mutation.

00:57:35.090 --> 00:57:37.882
And how can we apply the
same strategy to them?

00:57:37.882 --> 00:57:39.340
BRIAN DRUKER: So
I think about most

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.930
of the common tumors that have
been sequenced in the cancer

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:42.770
genome atlas.

00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:45.200
Most have a target.

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.740
For something like
ovarian cancer,

00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:50.210
it's almost all P53,
which we can't target.

00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:52.390
So we may find targets.

00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:56.240
But we may not be able
to target them yet.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.385
So I can't think-- if you
know of, I can't think

00:57:58.385 --> 00:57:59.010
of an example--

00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:01.440
AUDIENCE: I was thinking on your
slide about the lung cancer,

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.774
for example, the unknown chunk--

00:58:02.774 --> 00:58:03.481
BRIAN DRUKER: Oh.

00:58:03.481 --> 00:58:04.010
Yes.

00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:04.510
Right.

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:08.610
So the unknown chunk on
my lung cancer slide--

00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:11.430
there's probably P53 in there.

00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:12.350
There's RB in there.

00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:15.960
But actually, I didn't-- what I
put were known targetable with

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:16.740
current drugs.

00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:19.015
I didn't put-- so
the reality is,

00:58:19.015 --> 00:58:22.410
we know a lot more than
what we can do today.

00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:25.250
But that's why I didn't--
I want to close the loop.

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:27.670
And thank you for
allowing me to do that.

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:31.480
20 years ago, kinases
weren't a druggable target.

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.640
So now there are hundreds
of kinase inhibitors

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:37.740
in trials-- dozens have
been FDA approved--

00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:39.170
for an un-druggable target.

00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:40.310
So P53?

00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:41.220
Not druggable.

00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:42.890
Well, that's today's technology.

00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:45.830
Maybe tomorrow, somebody will
figure out how to target it.

00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:48.090
There's a huge RAS
initiative, headed

00:58:48.090 --> 00:58:50.850
by Frank McCormick
formally of UCSF,

00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:53.130
looking at RAS, which is
one of the most commonly

00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:56.260
mutated targets across
all cancer types.

00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:58.472
We currently don't have
a good drug for it.

00:58:58.472 --> 00:59:00.430
So just because something
is un-druggable today

00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:04.990
doesn't mean we aren't trying
or we won't have one some day.

00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:08.160
MALE SPEAKER: And perhaps as we
apply more pathway-based tools

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.770
to analyzing these
key signalling--

00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:10.110
BRIAN DRUKER: Exactly.

00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:11.568
MALE SPEAKER:
--systems, there will

00:59:11.568 --> 00:59:14.970
be upstream regulators or other
regulators that are targetable.

00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:16.120
BRIAN DRUKER: Exactly.

00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:17.578
MALE SPEAKER: So
related question--

00:59:17.578 --> 00:59:21.690
do you think that
the TCGA data-- which

00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:23.474
is, I think, the most
comprehensive data

00:59:23.474 --> 00:59:24.890
set of its kind
available now-- do

00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:27.410
you think it's been
mined to the extent

00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:30.522
that it can be for new targets?

00:59:30.522 --> 00:59:32.730
BRIAN DRUKER: You know, it's
an interesting question.

00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:37.580
And a group that I've worked
with actually mined TCA data

00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:39.690
and identified
some new chromosome

00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:42.810
translocations that
were in that database

00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:45.490
but just not recognized
because of the algorithms.

00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:46.880
So I think the answer is yes.

00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:50.240
I suspect most of the low
hanging fruit's been mined.

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:53.590
But there may be more
with better, more

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:55.500
sophisticated analyses.

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:59.070
But I think what we're
lacking are more samples.

00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:00.590
And I think, as the
rich-- you know,

01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:03.320
the reality is we're going
to get hundreds of thousands

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:07.150
of cancer genome sequenced,
expression profiling.

01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:09.850
I think we just need a
richer data set to-- along

01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:12.270
with better algorithms.

01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:14.020
MALE SPEAKER: So
one thing that we

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:17.920
started to discuss is how
much information you think

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.550
is available just
by understanding

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:24.360
an ensemble, the
cells in a tumor,

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:28.390
and how much is lost
by not really having

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:30.260
analytical techniques
that resolve,

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.420
with spatial resolution,
the heterogeneity in all

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:35.020
these measurements
within the tumor?

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.360
Perhaps you can comment on that.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:36.495
BRIAN DRUKER: Yeah.

01:00:36.495 --> 01:00:38.555
So one of the things
that Joe Gray, who

01:00:38.555 --> 01:00:40.922
was recruited from
Lawrence Berkeley has,

01:00:40.922 --> 01:00:43.700
has a spatial systems
biomedicine initiative

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:46.890
where he really is trying to
understand cancer as a three

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:50.500
dimensional system-- where,
for example, Herceptin

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:53.620
lives in these filaments
on cancer cells

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.830
that talk to other cancer cells.

01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:58.590
That may open up a whole new
way of looking at breast cancer

01:00:58.590 --> 01:01:00.690
and how they communicate
one to another

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:02.642
or to their micro environment.

01:01:02.642 --> 01:01:04.850
And whether that is going
to turn into a therapeutic,

01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:05.440
I don't know.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:08.010
But it's just
fascinating new biology

01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:10.640
as we understand cancer as
a three dimensional system

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.929
as opposed to looking
at it in a Petri dish.

01:01:12.929 --> 01:01:13.720
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.040
I mean, it really seems,
as Weinberg suggests,

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.150
that the tumor has
all the complexity

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:19.689
of any other organ of the body.

01:01:19.689 --> 01:01:20.480
BRIAN DRUKER: Yeah.

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.182
Exactly right.

01:01:21.182 --> 01:01:23.140
MALE SPEAKER: So Mark's
question is about early

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:25.780
detection and, specifically,
the discordant funding

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:28.970
available for early
detection versus programs

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:32.890
that target later stages
in the cancer story.

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:35.710
BRIAN DRUKER: Well,
I blame two things

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:40.590
on why there's so much
funding for late stage cancer.

01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:42.900
The first goes back to
when I was in training

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:47.350
and Hodgkin's disease was cured
with four chemotherapy drugs.

01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:50.760
And the principles were
non-overlapping toxicity,

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.090
different mechanism action.

01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:55.410
Combine the right four
drugs and you cure a cancer.

01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:57.970
And everybody got
on board and said,

01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:01.910
we're going to cure cancer by
combining the right four drugs.

01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:04.150
And you got CHOP,
and you got ABBD.

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:07.740
And you got all these
quadruple combinations.

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:10.180
And it didn't happen.

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.740
But we had all
this funding going.

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:17.080
And then I come along, and I
introduce a drug for a target.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.160
And everyone says, we're
going to cure cancer

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.470
with these targeted drugs.

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:22.335
And then you get resistance.

01:02:22.335 --> 01:02:24.710
And now it's, maybe you've
got to do three or four drugs.

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:27.020
So I take some of the
blame for the fact

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:29.460
that we're funding so
much advanced cancer,

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:32.070
because people got optimistic.

01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:35.970
And we forgot that for
decades-- the 15 years

01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:40.110
I've been talking about targeted
therapies, immune modulation,

01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:41.700
and prevention, early detection.

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:44.690
You've got to have those
three pillars if you're

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:46.320
going to make an impact.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:50.257
But because of the way that our
funding has gone, it's been,

01:02:50.257 --> 01:02:51.840
here's something
right in front of us.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.520
This patient needs something.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.020
Here's a drug that worked.

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.570
And let's all get
on board for that.

01:02:56.570 --> 01:03:01.980
So it's been an interesting
evolution in my own thinking

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:04.470
that we have to do
things differently.

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:07.900
But it's really hard to
convince large funding agencies

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:09.815
that you need to move.

01:03:09.815 --> 01:03:11.690
MALE SPEAKER: Talking
about the whole subject

01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:16.680
of early detection in general--
I don't know if you'd agree.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.750
But it seems like the scientific
state of early detection

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:22.570
is abysmal right now,
except in a few cases.

01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:24.950
You have nonspecific
markers-- they may or may not

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:27.450
be actionable-- or
imaging modalities

01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:30.010
where they contrast with
respect to the pathology you're

01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:31.560
trying to observe is minimal.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.970
So how are we going to
change this, practically?

01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:37.110
BRIAN DRUKER: I absolutely
agree that the state

01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:39.880
of the art right now in
early detection is abysmal.

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:42.520
And there are certainly some
pockets-- Stanford Canary

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:45.560
Center just doing
some amazing work.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.140
There are a few
other places where

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.499
some things are happening.

01:03:48.499 --> 01:03:50.415
But that's why we want
to make this investment

01:03:50.415 --> 01:03:53.750
and put a stake in the ground
of, let's get a group together

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:55.471
and figure out how
to do this better.

01:03:55.471 --> 01:03:57.720
And if I had a blueprint for
how we're going to do it,

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.320
I'd tell you.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.100
But I don't.

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.720
I just know that we've
got to make an investment.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.610
We have other people
around the world.

01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:08.970
Cancer Research UK has done a
similar assessment and said,

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:10.687
we've got build this field.

01:04:10.687 --> 01:04:11.770
And we want to build this.

01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:12.930
We're going to
build this together.

01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:15.050
We'll build it with Canary,
with Cancer Research

01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:17.760
UK and a few other
like-minded partners

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.960
and train the next generation.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.070
They can actually
make an impact here.

01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:26.380
MALE SPEAKER: So let me ask a
proxy question, then, related

01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:26.880
to that.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:31.710
Is the holy grail for you
a multifactorial blood test

01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:34.900
or something from a
tumor biopsy sample

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:36.960
that would help you
stratify patients,

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:40.390
stage disease, maybe in the
blood test diagnose it earlier?

01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:43.570
Or is it a noninvasive
molecular imaging tool

01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:46.740
that could really be applied
at a population scale?

01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:48.790
Which is-- or do you not know?

01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:49.540
BRIAN DRUKER: Yes.

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:52.210
I think it's going to be a
combination of lots of things.

01:04:52.210 --> 01:04:55.840
And so if you look at
the most effective tool

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.720
for lowering the death
rate from cancer,

01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:59.750
it's been the pap smear.

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:00.540
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:02.930
BRIAN DRUKER: So
you know, you can

01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:06.110
imagine that, maybe
for some tumor types,

01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:07.704
you need a scraping
of, you know.

01:05:07.704 --> 01:05:12.800
Do you need a cheek swab
for head and neck cancers?

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.030
Your colonoscopies--
already quite effective,

01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:16.439
but pretty invasive.

01:05:16.439 --> 01:05:17.980
Could you imagine
a stool sample that

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.813
would allow you to
detect something that you

01:05:19.813 --> 01:05:22.232
might need to do a colonoscopy?

01:05:22.232 --> 01:05:23.690
Are there imaging
technologies that

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:25.692
will let you see a
pancreatic cancer?

01:05:25.692 --> 01:05:27.150
Or is there a blood
test you've got

01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:29.480
to do first to narrow
the bin of people that

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.100
would go through an
imaging procedure

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:33.320
so you're not spending all
of our healthcare dollars

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.920
on screening?

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.787
So I don't think it's going
to be a one size fits all.

01:05:37.787 --> 01:05:40.120
It's going to be lots of--
each different tumor type may

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.510
require a different technology.

01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:46.010
As a holy grail, maybe
there's something, you know,

01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:48.060
finding from the
baseline study that says,

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:51.400
here's the transition
from health to disease

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.870
that says you might need to
be more carefully screened.

01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:55.710
That would be a
holy grail, if you

01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:58.310
could have been a really
inexpensive screening

01:05:58.310 --> 01:06:00.360
technology that
would let you say,

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.980
this is the person
that should undergo

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:03.710
more intensive screening.

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:05.155
But I think that's
a long ways off

01:06:05.155 --> 01:06:07.280
because we're going to need
large numbers of people

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:10.110
and large long term follow up.

01:06:10.110 --> 01:06:12.670
MALE SPEAKER: And
perhaps large tumor

01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:15.064
samples or samples of the
pre-malignant state as well.

01:06:15.064 --> 01:06:15.980
BRIAN DRUKER: Exactly.

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:17.470
MALE SPEAKER: I think there
were some other questions.

01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.970
Yes?

01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:18.500
I'm sorry.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:19.740
I don't know your name.

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:22.610
Joanne's question is
about technologies

01:06:22.610 --> 01:06:25.200
that seek to interrogate,
non-specifically,

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.640
the immune system through
combinatorial arrays

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.279
of peptides and their
role in cancer diagnosis.

01:06:30.279 --> 01:06:31.070
BRIAN DRUKER: Yeah.

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.020
And I guess we talked
about this earlier.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:36.240
I'd even go beyond that to
what are called theranostics,

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.540
meaning, could you
attach something

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:43.650
to an immune peptide that
would recognize an early tumor

01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:46.380
and destroy it or allow the
immune system to destroy it?

01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:48.970
So then you can get away
from this conundrum of,

01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:50.380
is it going to be lethal?

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:50.920
Is it not?

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:51.910
Do I need to take it out?

01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:52.785
Should I leave it in?

01:06:52.785 --> 01:06:53.630
Can I watch it?

01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:56.210
You know, maybe you can
just let the immune system

01:06:56.210 --> 01:07:00.410
get activated, take it out at
the same time it's detecting.

01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:03.462
That would be another holy
grail of what we could identify.

01:07:03.462 --> 01:07:05.670
MALE SPEAKER: But I think
her question, specifically,

01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:10.040
is about using the immune system
as a tool for surveillance

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.500
and early diagnosis of disease.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.050
BRIAN DRUKER: Great.

01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:13.508
MALE SPEAKER: And
let me add to it.

01:07:13.508 --> 01:07:16.820
Do you think that that can
be done non-specifically,

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:19.460
in the sense that
you have a chip that

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:21.500
exposes random epitopes?

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.760
And then also, can it
be done specifically,

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:26.920
in the sense that, can we learn
enough about tumor antigens

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.770
to actually design a test
that uses the immune system

01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:30.895
to detect cancer?

01:07:30.895 --> 01:07:32.770
BRIAN DRUKER: I think
you've stated perfectly

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:34.190
what needs to be done.

01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:37.680
And I certainly believe
that that can be done.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.300
MALE SPEAKER: Does Gleevec have
a role in multiple myeloma?

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.530
And do you conduct
clinical trials

01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:45.880
for Gleevec or other
agents in that disease?

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:49.030
BRIAN DRUKER: So Gleevec was
tried very briefly in myeloma.

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:53.430
And unfortunately, it didn't
have much benefit there.

01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:55.890
Myeloma is another
field where things

01:07:55.890 --> 01:07:57.320
are changing very rapidly.

01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:01.230
And there are lots and lots
of new agents being developed.

01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:03.390
There's an antibody
against CD38,

01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:05.880
which is one of the cell
surface markers on myeloma

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:09.900
that's showing spectacular
results in clinical trials.

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:12.220
There are several new
agents for resistant myeloma

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:14.370
that are also showing
remarkable activity

01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:17.189
and are getting moved
up to earlier stages.

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:21.837
We aren't a huge myeloma center.

01:08:21.837 --> 01:08:23.920
But there are several
around the country that are,

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:27.420
if you're asking for a
specific person in your family,

01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:31.116
I'd be happy to help refer
it to some of these trials.

01:08:31.116 --> 01:08:32.490
MALE SPEAKER:
Let's speak briefly

01:08:32.490 --> 01:08:37.140
on a related subject about CARP
therapies-- Chimeric Antigen

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:40.080
Receptor T cell therapies--
which, you know,

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:43.279
has its antecedents
in Star Trek.

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:46.180
So it's something that
we like in this audience.

01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.609
But how do you feel, in
general, about the idea

01:08:48.609 --> 01:08:52.002
of re-engineering tools of the
immune system to fight cancer?

01:08:52.002 --> 01:08:53.960
BRIAN DRUKER: Well again,
the CAR-Ts are again,

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.609
another example when I talk
about immune modulation

01:08:56.609 --> 01:09:01.479
of the remarkable success
of immune modulation.

01:09:01.479 --> 01:09:04.140
The concern I have
with the CAR-Ts

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.689
is that there's still a fair
bit of toxicity to them.

01:09:07.689 --> 01:09:11.090
And we need to understand
how to better utilize them

01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:12.614
in a safer manner.

01:09:12.614 --> 01:09:15.244
You know, some of my colleagues
in bone marrow transplants

01:09:15.244 --> 01:09:17.660
say, well, you know, we're
used to bone marrow transplants

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:18.770
and rescuing people.

01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:20.359
And we can do these
cell therapies.

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:20.880
And I agree.

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.220
We can.

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:24.710
It's just that, having
started out from a perspective

01:09:24.710 --> 01:09:29.370
of, how can we treat cancer
in a simpler, less toxic, less

01:09:29.370 --> 01:09:33.240
invasive fashion, I see
the results from the CAR-Ts

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.939
and I like what's happening.

01:09:34.939 --> 01:09:37.130
But I also think, how can
we do better and get them

01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:40.625
to a safer place where we can
utilize them more effectively?

01:09:40.625 --> 01:09:42.000
MALE SPEAKER: It's
also one thing

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.720
if the CAR-T therapy is an
ablative therapy against B

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.399
cells, you know, where
there's a well-defined target.

01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:51.439
But how optimistic are
you that these things

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:53.630
can be extended to
solid tumors, where

01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:55.660
I guess it faces the
same problem that we're

01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:58.219
discussing in the
molecular imaging context?

01:09:58.219 --> 01:10:00.010
BRIAN DRUKER: Again,
those are my concerns.

01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:03.410
If you're taking out an
entire cell type-- B cells,

01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:05.540
you can kind of live without.

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:06.960
And you take out
some other cells

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.430
that you need for
heart, lung-- you know,

01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:10.780
these could be really toxic.

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:13.640
And even as we move to
myeloid malignancies,

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.850
some of my colleagues have
been unwilling to take out

01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:17.266
the myeloid lineage
because you're

01:10:17.266 --> 01:10:18.990
going to be predisposed
to infections.

01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:21.680
So we need to
understand how best

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.720
to target what the
good targets are

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:27.061
and, maybe, how to even dial
back on some of the toxicities.

01:10:27.061 --> 01:10:28.810
MALE SPEAKER: His
question, to paraphrase,

01:10:28.810 --> 01:10:31.020
is that some argue
that Gleevec is

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.040
curing the disease it treats.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.790
And then, at what point
do you stop treatment?

01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:37.590
And how do you, I
think, ethically

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:39.400
think about doing that?

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:43.570
BRIAN DRUKER: So about 20%,
maybe 30% of people on Gleevec

01:10:43.570 --> 01:10:48.230
will be molecularly undetectible
for the BCR-ABL transcripts.

01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:52.490
And if you stop therapy, 50%
will remain undetectable.

01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:55.270
And 50% will relapse and
need to be retreated.

01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:58.160
So it's 50 50 of the 20 or 30%.

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.910
So it's a small percent.

01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:03.160
And we don't know who's who.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:06.690
So there are some hints
that it's immunologic.

01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:08.230
And the hints are as follows.

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:11.150
We know that people
who previously received

01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:13.620
interferon, which is the
prior generation of treatment

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:17.330
for CML, have a little bit
higher chance of getting off

01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:18.760
therapy.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:22.390
And I've had patients who
I've taken off therapy.

01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:24.970
Their PCRs for the
BCR-ABL transcripts

01:11:24.970 --> 01:11:27.280
turned slightly positive.

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.070
I'll check again.

01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:29.444
And they're back
to undetectible.

01:11:29.444 --> 01:11:32.020
And they bounce around
at really low level.

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.230
And they've done that for years.

01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:38.270
So I can't imagine-- we haven't
eliminated the last CML cell.

01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:41.560
So to me, it means there's got
to be some immune recognition.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.510
Now, if we can take those
clues and say, what is it

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:48.800
about the immune system that's
being recognized on the CML

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.300
cells?

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:52.930
And can we convert
people from unable

01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:55.550
to discontinue to being
able to discontinue,

01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:58.100
then maybe we can actually get
more people to stop and get

01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.900
from control to cure.

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.760
And that's actually one
of the current areas

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:05.510
of focus in my lab.

01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:08.030
MALE SPEAKER: So
in several answers,

01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:09.990
several responses,
including this one,

01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:12.460
we kind of take for granted
as a thought experiment

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:14.710
that we'd be able to
recruit the cohorts to do

01:12:14.710 --> 01:12:17.930
these gigantic trials of
combination therapies.

01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:21.340
But the lamentable fact is
that only 3% of patients

01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:24.010
are in trials to begin
with in oncology.

01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:27.480
So how optimistic are you that
these questions can actually

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.642
be answered today?

01:12:28.642 --> 01:12:29.820
BRIAN DRUKER: Yeah.

01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:33.390
So it's lamentable that
we enroll so few people

01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:34.490
in our clinical trials.

01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:37.240
And in part, that's an
infrastructure issue,

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:39.390
meaning we just don't
have enough people

01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:42.610
in the healthcare industry
to put people on trials.

01:12:42.610 --> 01:12:44.310
I don't think it's
a lack of interest.

01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:48.960
I think it's just a lack of
enough manpower to do the work.

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:51.169
So I think that's going to
require some investments.

01:12:51.169 --> 01:12:52.710
And you know, I
didn't go through all

01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:53.890
of our billion dollar plan.

01:12:53.890 --> 01:12:55.264
But I'm putting
about 100 million

01:12:55.264 --> 01:12:57.480
into our clinical
trials infrastructure

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.542
so we can put more people on
trials at our institution.

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:02.750
But it's not going to get
us to the tens of thousands

01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:05.300
of people we need to actually
test with these combinations

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:06.980
and doing them quickly.

01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:09.300
But if we can show that it
can be done at one place,

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:11.356
maybe other places will follow.

01:13:11.356 --> 01:13:12.980
MALE SPEAKER: And
there, perhaps, there

01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:15.440
is some overlap in the
technologies one would develop

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:17.760
for early detection
and the ones you

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.540
would use for
stratification to design

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:24.840
better powered BSCR trials and
other trials, biomarker driven.

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.720
BRIAN DRUKER: And
certainly, in AMLS,

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.900
the other area we're
putting a lot of investment

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:33.270
is, we're doing a BSCR trial
where everybody gets screened.

01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:35.280
We have treatments
for everybody.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.610
So our idea is that
anyone with leukemia

01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:39.060
gets enrolled on
a clinical trial.

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:43.080
And it should be 80%
of people, not 3%.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.000
MALE SPEAKER: As it
is in the childhood

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.380
analog of these cases.

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:51.680
So the question asks about a
global perspective on cancer.

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.210
And how can some
of the, I assume,

01:13:53.210 --> 01:13:56.230
advanced technologies that
we've been discussing actually

01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:57.659
bear on the global problem?

01:13:57.659 --> 01:13:58.450
BRIAN DRUKER: Yeah.

01:13:58.450 --> 01:14:00.533
So I'm going to come back
to an earlier statement.

01:14:00.533 --> 01:14:03.180
First of all, one of the
things the US has done really

01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:05.540
well is export smoking.

01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:07.320
And so, a lot of
the cancer deaths

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.310
worldwide are smoking related.

01:14:09.310 --> 01:14:11.750
And it's not something we
should be terribly proud of.

01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:14.820
But we talk about
prevention, we have

01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:18.140
to think about how
we manage that part.

01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:22.460
As far as how we manage
advanced cancers, you know,

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:24.430
if you look at the
paradigm in HIV,

01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:26.790
it is a really
tough road to think

01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:31.360
about managing HIV in countries
that can barely afford--

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.440
they can't afford the drugs.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:34.940
And so, that's why
I think we've got

01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:38.430
to think about-- we have
to imagine, how do we

01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:42.220
do early detection
that's cost effective?

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:44.810
How we do pap smears
around the world?

01:14:44.810 --> 01:14:46.310
And there are
certainly technologies

01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:47.990
that can allow us
to do that, have

01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:51.330
them read at a central location,
and can lower the death

01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:52.670
rate from cervical cancer.

01:14:52.670 --> 01:14:55.230
So there are already
programs in place

01:14:55.230 --> 01:14:58.470
that can be a leading
edge, if you will.

01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:00.420
But I think the best
way is going to be

01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:02.900
prevention and early detection.

01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:07.170
If we're going to rely on
this safety net of treating

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:10.900
advanced cancer, we're going
to bankrupt entire countries

01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:11.680
by doing that.

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:15.200
So globally, we've really--
to my way of thinking,

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.880
this is where we
need to be moving.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.370
And it's the same as
you think about HIV.

01:15:20.370 --> 01:15:23.590
It's really vaccination
that's really

01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:26.910
going to be the best
technology at making

01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:28.520
a global impact on HIV.

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:32.350
Same with malaria
and other diseases.

01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:35.602
We've got to think about how
you do this cost effectively.

01:15:35.602 --> 01:15:37.310
MALE SPEAKER: So
speaking of vaccination,

01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:38.870
I think we'd be
remiss to not ask

01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:42.070
you to comment on HPV
vaccination and the controversy

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:45.040
it's caused, at least
in a few US states.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.680
What's your feeling?

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:49.600
BRIAN DRUKER: Well, my kids
have all been vaccinated, boys

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.570
and girls.

01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:54.445
So I hope that speaks for
what I think about it.

01:15:54.445 --> 01:15:56.820
You know, I'm acting
in a way that I think

01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:59.080
a responsible parent should.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.680
And it's not about, you
know-- you can make it

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:02.700
about whatever you want.

01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.060
But for me, it's about
preventing cancer.

01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:07.860
And early on, I had talked,
I had thought about,

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:10.610
do we put legislation
through in our state?

01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:13.250
And after seeing the
pushback from other states

01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:15.090
where it just didn't
happen, I just

01:16:15.090 --> 01:16:18.060
realized we're not going
to win this battle.

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:21.360
But you know, I can only
speak for my own family

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.579
and what my beliefs are.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:24.620
MALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:28.170
And I think, in that case,
it is such a clear example

01:16:28.170 --> 01:16:31.579
of chemo prevention, if
you will, that its amazing.

01:16:31.579 --> 01:16:33.870
BRIAN DRUKER: And before some
of the immunotherapeutics

01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:35.860
came along, that was
what I put in the check

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:38.410
box of immune
modulation, was a vaccine

01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:40.120
that can prevent cancer.

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.560
Now, don't we want more of them?

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.490
MALE SPEAKER: As we
develop new treatments--

01:16:44.490 --> 01:16:46.840
and I think it's true
broadly of any treatment,

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.446
including in HIV and
infectious diseases--

01:16:49.446 --> 01:16:50.820
there will be some
societies that

01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:54.480
find them objectionable
for cost or other reasons,

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.190
in the case of HPV.

01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:57.350
How do we deal with that?

01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.540
BRIAN DRUKER: Yeah.

01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:00.410
We've got to engage our social
science colleagues on this.

01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:03.140
And we have to figure
out these problems.

01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:06.080
Because you know, you look
at any societal problem--

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.510
it's often as much
behavioral modification

01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:10.970
as it is anything
we can do medically.

01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:13.920
And I don't have a
clear view on how

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.970
we accomplish that,
other than we're

01:17:15.970 --> 01:17:18.502
going to have to
face those issues.

01:17:18.502 --> 01:17:20.210
MALE SPEAKER: So in
the end, the solution

01:17:20.210 --> 01:17:22.201
might be web advertising.

01:17:22.201 --> 01:17:23.700
BRIAN DRUKER: It
very well could be.

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:26.160
Or it could, you know,
social pressures.

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:29.830
And you look at, you know,
how do you get people to vote?

01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:32.470
It's did you post it
on your Facebook page?

01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:34.020
And you know, I voted.

01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:37.430
And why don't I want
all my friends to vote?

01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:38.320
I stopped smoking.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.650
I want all my friends to stop?

01:17:39.650 --> 01:17:41.190
I got the HPV vaccine.

01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:42.750
I want all my friends to.

01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:46.490
There's incredible pressure
with social dynamics.

01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:47.890
And we need to harness that.

01:17:47.890 --> 01:17:48.900
MALE SPEAKER: So
one last question.

01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:51.080
I think, then, we have
to start the documentary.

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.010
But I know you were visiting
our colleagues at Facebook

01:17:54.010 --> 01:17:55.280
this morning.

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:59.480
So tell us what the
responsibility and the duty

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:03.350
of the Silicon Valley technology
industry is in this area,

01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:04.990
in early detection.

01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:07.570
And what, in your opinion,
are the unique tools, if any,

01:18:07.570 --> 01:18:11.840
that we've developed that could
help you with this problem?

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:16.490
BRIAN DRUKER: So I'm going
to take two points, there.

01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:20.130
First of all, I think everyone
saw the power of philanthropy.

01:18:20.130 --> 01:18:21.890
And the reality
is, is that there

01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:25.720
is a lot that can be done with
philanthropy in moving things

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.920
forward that need
to be moved forward.

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:30.570
So I think it's important to
recognize, you know, the people

01:18:30.570 --> 01:18:34.310
that run Google, the people that
run Facebook, are giving a lot.

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:36.510
And that needs to be
encouraged because there

01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:38.650
are societal problems
that-- and it's not just

01:18:38.650 --> 01:18:39.900
throwing money at problems.

01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:42.640
It's actually throwing money
at smart problems getting

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.190
to solutions.

01:18:44.190 --> 01:18:47.670
But the sorts of tools
that are being created

01:18:47.670 --> 01:18:52.680
at Google, particularly in the
ability to understand biology

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.480
by bringing large
amounts of data

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.710
together, aggregating
large amounts of data,

01:18:57.710 --> 01:18:59.650
and then helping
us understand what

01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:02.250
that data is trying
to tell us-- you know,

01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:07.892
when I started out in my
career, my first mentor said,

01:19:07.892 --> 01:19:09.350
you've got to let
the data tell you

01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:12.000
what it's trying to tell you.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.811
Let the data speak for itself.

01:19:13.811 --> 01:19:15.810
And I think that's what
Google is doing so well,

01:19:15.810 --> 01:19:19.160
is bringing all this data
together and letting it speak.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.040
And so, you can
identify patterns.

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.730
You can do so well at
identifying patterns and what

01:19:23.730 --> 01:19:25.940
is the most important
because we're

01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:28.320
going to be deluged with data.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:29.930
But we need to understand that.

01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:32.060
So it's not just as
much generating it.

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:36.600
It's helping us figure out,
sifting through mounds of data,

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.530
bringing it together,
identifying the patterns,

01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:42.940
and then saying, that's
where we need to go.

01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:44.600
And that's where the
tech industry can

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:47.350
help us, is bringing
computational biology,

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:49.260
is bringing pattern
recognition, is bringing

01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:51.550
computational algorithms.

01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:54.230
I don't think generation of data
is our limiting factor right

01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:54.420
now.

01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:56.750
I think it's understanding
what it's trying to tell us.

01:19:56.750 --> 01:20:00.050
MALE SPEAKER: And please
join me in thanking Brian.

01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:01.600
BRIAN DRUKER: Thank you.
