All those opposed,
let's get unpredictable.

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:03.870
As you know,
I encourage viewers to call in

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:05.304
and leave us voice mails,

00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:07.173
but I never have the time
to listen to them.

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:08.341
Our crew at<i> The Opposition</i>

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:09.976
has put some voice mails
together

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.310
that I've never heard before.

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:13.112
Now, obviously, I'm smart enough

00:00:13.145 --> 00:00:14.881
to think of the best things
on my own,

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:16.616
but sometimes it's nice

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:19.218
-to have someone help me find
the... -Find the right words.

00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:20.486
Just a min... Yeah, just a...

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.122
Just a...

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:27.026
It's nice to have someone help
me find the right words, yes.

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:30.463
Here with me is virtual expert
on everything, Kobi Libii.

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:32.465
-(cheering and applause)
-I, um...

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:35.968
I have a surface understanding
of lots of things, Jordan.

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.336
Well, that's all you need.

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:38.871
Chuck, let's fire up
the first call.

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:42.275
-(phone beeps) -Hi. My name
is Alex, and I'm from Illinois,

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:45.278
the state where the true
Republicans originated from.

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.881
And my question is what are
the tactics I should use

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:52.819
to get the deep state
out of my personal life

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:55.922
and out of the thoughts
that are in my head.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:58.524
Thank you. Your show
means a lot to me. Bye.

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:00.326
Clearly,
listening to that voice,

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.795
I'm assuming he lives
in his mother's basement.

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:05.164
It's pretty clear
from the context

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:06.599
that that's exactly
where he lives, Jordan.

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:08.501
You'd be surprised.
A lot of the deep state

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:10.736
exists in mothers' basements.

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:12.271
They go deep.

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:13.973
-It's... -It's not just how
they pervade the government.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:15.842
They go subterranean
in your mother's house.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.177
There's something about that.
I haven't put it all together,

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.846
but there's something
about this idea

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.582
that there's the type of person
who is alone,

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:25.418
-living in a basement
without any outside jobs. -Oh.

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:27.253
They're usually more attuned
to these--

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:29.122
what outsiders would call
"conspiracies"

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:31.424
-and we call "putting the pieces
together." -Absolutely.

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:33.226
I mean, you couldn't be
more right, Jordan.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.961
I mean, these people,
they live alone

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:37.029
with nothing
but their own thoughts

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:39.599
-rattling around in their head
day after day. -Yes.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:40.900
And for some reason,

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:43.035
the deep state
is targeting those people.

00:01:43.068 --> 00:01:44.837
Yes. This is what...

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.639
You have--
you have to be careful,

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:48.074
because if you let
other people's thoughts

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:49.375
-inside your head,
-(chuckles)

00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:50.743
that's when infection starts.

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:52.211
-That's where the trouble
begins, Jordan. -Yes.

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:53.946
When you start listening
to other people,

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.883
you can kiss
your real views good-bye.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.318
Yeah, yeah.
I'm definitely an anti-vaxxer

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:01.754
-when it comes to other ideas
in your mind. -(laughs)

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:03.089
I haven't been persuaded

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:04.757
by a thing another person said
in decades.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.925
(both laugh)

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.527
I guess long story short,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.830
keep the other people at bay
and just lock the doors

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:13.232
and hope your mom
doesn't come back downstairs.

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:15.067
-Chuck, let's hear another call.
-(phone beeps)

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.769
Hi, Jordan.
This is Liz from Newark,

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:17.970
and I have a question.

00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:19.672
I feel like everyone's
so obsessed

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:21.374
with political correctness
these days

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:23.142
that I don't know
what I can say anymore.

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:26.078
So what can I say
without getting in trouble?

00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:28.948
That's a...
it's a great question, right?

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:32.118
I feel like, you know,
I'm a bit of a man's man.

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:33.786
-(laughs) That's obvious,
Jordan. -Yeah.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.655
Thank you very much.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.657
(laughter)

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.425
I don't know what
the rules are anymore

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:41.294
when it comes to interacting
with women.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:42.528
Jordan,
you couldn't be more right.

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:44.397
I mean, how many times
have I been on a date,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.366
seen another woman walking by,
complimented that woman,

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:49.702
-then, all of a sudden,
my date's mad! -Yeah.

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:51.571
It's, like, what?

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:55.241
Do-do these feminists<i> want</i> us
to praise women, or do they not?

00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:57.643
I guess I should just never talk
to women, huh, Jordan?

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:59.478
-Huh. -Yeah.
I mean, you get up,

00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:01.614
you don't pay, you leave her
to pay the bill,

00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:03.015
-and suddenly, you're being
offensive? -Absolutely.

00:03:03.048 --> 00:03:04.517
Right? Yeah.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.919
You're empowering her to take
control of the situation.

00:03:06.952 --> 00:03:10.089
Absolutely! It's like
if you want to have equal pay,

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:12.858
then sometimes you have to pay
for my entire first-date meal.

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:15.695
Yeah. I don't know where
these lines are, snowflakes.

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:17.563
-We're...
-(laughs) Thanks for the call.

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:20.099
We're as lost
as you are, caller.

00:03:20.132 --> 00:03:22.101
Let's check out one more call.

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:24.570
-(beep) -Hey, Jordan,
Anthony Scaramucci.

00:03:24.603 --> 00:03:27.206
Having trouble sleeping tonight.
I'm a huge fan.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.343
-KLEPPER: Yup. -I love Donald J.
Trump, and I know you do, too.

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:32.545
You know what I love most
about Donald Trump,

00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:36.515
is he tweets after he watches
your show, Jordan, okay?

00:03:36.548 --> 00:03:39.385
And so, he listens to your show,
goes to sleep,

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:41.621
and in the morning,
he's firing out those tweets

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:43.389
because of you, babe.

00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:45.258
So, what do you love
about Donald Trump?

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:46.592
-That's what I'm dying to know.
-Oh.

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.094
You know what?
He brings out a good point.

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:50.229
Like, we do have a fan
in the commander-in-chief,

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:52.431
-um, and that's not lost on us.
-Mm.

00:03:52.464 --> 00:03:56.369
I think to-to know that somebody
on high watches television,

00:03:56.402 --> 00:04:00.439
uh, to perhaps a...
a dangerous amount, uh,

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:02.375
and comments directly
with it is, um...

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.843
Frankly, we know that...

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:06.612
that puts us in a position
where there's a lot of power.

00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:07.880
We don't want to abuse that.

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:09.382
-No. I mean...
-That would be uncouth for us.

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:10.916
Uh, it would be irresponsible,
you know?

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.485
We don't<i> want</i> 
to do those things, Jordan.

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:14.220
We<i> don't</i> want
to do those things.

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:17.490
-But do sometimes.
-We definitely do those things.

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:21.260
Because...
from another perspective,

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:23.095
-Mm-hmm.
-we can.

00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:25.097
(laughter)

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.565
When I...
I think that's something

00:04:26.598 --> 00:04:28.200
-the president understands...
-Mm-hmm.

00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:31.404
...is that, uh, people on TV
are on TV,

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.472
which must mean
they're important in some way.

00:04:33.505 --> 00:04:36.642
And so, even though
you're surrounded with advisers

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:38.878
-and people are who are experts
in policy... -Yeah.

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:40.513
...with a diverse knowledge

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:43.783
-and an awareness of what a...
what a cause is... -Mm-hmm.

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:45.351
...and what those actions
might be...

00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:47.053
-Aah! (mutters)
-Um, uh...

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:48.821
(laughter)

00:04:48.854 --> 00:04:50.523
But what he does understand is

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:52.425
that those people
don't have television shows.

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:53.993
No, no, they... they don't.

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:55.728
Uh, and, therefore, they don't
know what the (bleep)

00:04:55.761 --> 00:04:57.730
-they're talking about.
-Right?

00:04:57.763 --> 00:05:00.199
I mean, I for one
have been drunk on power

00:05:00.232 --> 00:05:02.535
since the first time someone
pointed a camera in my face.

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:03.869
-Exactly. Mm-hmm.
-You know?

00:05:03.902 --> 00:05:06.005
-And that gives me
a credibility... -Mm-hmm.

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:08.941
...that no senior policy adviser
can rival, Jordan.

00:05:08.974 --> 00:05:10.176
-Yes.
-You know?

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:12.111
And you--
your name is on the show,

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:13.713
so the cameras are pointing
at you,

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:15.114
<i> and</i> your name's on the show.

00:05:15.147 --> 00:05:17.583
So when you speak, you speak
with the weight of authority...

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:20.152
-Yeah. -...unmatched
by any PhD in the land.

00:05:20.185 --> 00:05:21.721
-Exactly.
-Mm-hmm.

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:23.756
-You know what? Yeah.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.726
(cheers and applause)

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.396
Do you want
some dumb Poindexter adviser

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:32.131
who<i> reads</i> all these articles,

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:34.700
or do you want somebody on TV
who just speaks over them?

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:36.135
(laughter)

00:05:36.168 --> 00:05:37.870
Thank you for watching,
President Trump,

00:05:37.903 --> 00:05:39.372
and thank you, Mooch.

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.073
(applause and cheering)

00:05:41.106 --> 00:05:42.641
All right, Kobi,
we're running out of time.

00:05:42.674 --> 00:05:44.910
But if you'd like to hear
your voice on television,

00:05:44.943 --> 00:05:47.046
the best way
to do it is work hard.

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:48.948
There are no shortcuts,
full stop.

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:50.816 line:0%
The one exception is...

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:54.653 line:0%
if you call and leave me
a message at:

00:05:54.686 --> 00:05:56.422 line:0%
Ask a question, we'll answer it.

00:05:56.455 --> 00:05:58.591 line:0%
Leave a thought, and
we'll tell you if you're right.
