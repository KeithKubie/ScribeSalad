we're going to do Victorian numberphile

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560
we're going to do Victorian numberphile
 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.579
we're going to do Victorian numberphile
today so I'm gonna be a Victorian and as

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589
today so I'm gonna be a Victorian and as
 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.980
today so I'm gonna be a Victorian and as
a Victorian I'm very concerned about the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990
a Victorian I'm very concerned about the
 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.040
a Victorian I'm very concerned about the
future of the nobility and I don't know

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050
future of the nobility and I don't know
 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.230
future of the nobility and I don't know
about you but I'm very concerned that

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240
about you but I'm very concerned that
 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.230
about you but I'm very concerned that
the aristocracy might die out that the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240
the aristocracy might die out that the
 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.900
the aristocracy might die out that the
family names might die out apparently

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
family names might die out apparently
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.370
family names might die out apparently
this was something that the Victorians

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
this was something that the Victorians
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.950
this was something that the Victorians
were concerned about so they wanted to

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960
were concerned about so they wanted to
 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.560
were concerned about so they wanted to
know the probability that a family name

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570
know the probability that a family name
 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.660
know the probability that a family name
might die out or to put it another way

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670
might die out or to put it another way
 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.040
might die out or to put it another way
they wanted to know the probability of

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050
they wanted to know the probability of
 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.220
they wanted to know the probability of
extinction it's kind of the same idea so

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230
extinction it's kind of the same idea so
 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.020
extinction it's kind of the same idea so
that some look at the math solved

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
that some look at the math solved
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.180
that some look at the math solved
extinction so let's have a guy appear at

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190
extinction so let's have a guy appear at
 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.220
extinction so let's have a guy appear at
the top of the family tree sir lemon of

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230
the top of the family tree sir lemon of
 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.350
the top of the family tree sir lemon of
the noble lemon family so he wants to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
the noble lemon family so he wants to
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.569
the noble lemon family so he wants to
know if he if his family name will

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579
know if he if his family name will
 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.639
know if he if his family name will
survive so I've got this die here which

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649
survive so I've got this die here which
 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.950
survive so I've got this die here which
is going to generate how many kids this

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960
is going to generate how many kids this
 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.830
is going to generate how many kids this
person has or if I'm more technical it's

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
person has or if I'm more technical it's
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.900
person has or if I'm more technical it's
going to generate how many sons

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910
going to generate how many sons
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.790
going to generate how many sons

this person has a retreat family names
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.189
this person has a retreat family names
in the traditional way which is not

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
in the traditional way which is not
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.139
in the traditional way which is not
necessarily true but the idea that a

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149
necessarily true but the idea that a
 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.060
necessarily true but the idea that a
family name is passed from father to son

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070
family name is passed from father to son
 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.729
family name is passed from father to son

next kid oh oh
 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.900
next kid oh oh
unfortunately now branch is now dead -

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910
unfortunately now branch is now dead -

two kids here zero here and all three
we're doing quite well zero that's a

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120
we're doing quite well zero that's a
 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.740
we're doing quite well zero that's a
dead end

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750
dead end
 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.100
dead end
Oh zero again I'm afraid that's a dead

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110
Oh zero again I'm afraid that's a dead
 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.280
Oh zero again I'm afraid that's a dead
end

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290
 
 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.350
 
zero again oh dear this generation is

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360
zero again oh dear this generation is
 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.059
zero again oh dear this generation is
not doing as well zero again so there's

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069
not doing as well zero again so there's
 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.670
not doing as well zero again so there's
all down to one last kid here to pass on

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680
all down to one last kid here to pass on
 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.330
all down to one last kid here to pass on
the family name

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340
the family name
 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.199
the family name
oh and they had no children so this

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209
oh and they had no children so this
 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.720
oh and they had no children so this
family has gone extinct well the family

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730
family has gone extinct well the family
 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.729
family has gone extinct well the family
name has gone extinct now I'm going to

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739
name has gone extinct now I'm going to
 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:05.630
name has gone extinct now I'm going to
use a different die

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640
use a different die
 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.970
use a different die
so on this die I've got yeah we could

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980
so on this die I've got yeah we could
 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.789
so on this die I've got yeah we could
have three kids we've got two kids here

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799
have three kids we've got two kids here
 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.949
have three kids we've got two kids here
two kids here one another one and A zero

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959
two kids here one another one and A zero
 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.420
two kids here one another one and A zero
so it's slightly different probabilities

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430
so it's slightly different probabilities
 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.870
so it's slightly different probabilities
for this one makes you feel optimistic

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880
for this one makes you feel optimistic
 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.940
for this one makes you feel optimistic
about the future the human race done it

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950
about the future the human race done it
 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.970
about the future the human race done it
17 so number let's see how it goes sir

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810
and let's do another one all three so
 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.259
and let's do another one all three so
not too bad at all so this is another

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269
not too bad at all so this is another
 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.589
not too bad at all so this is another
healthy generation so we can keep going

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599
healthy generation so we can keep going
 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:01.970
healthy generation so we can keep going
and keep going this seems like a bigger

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980
and keep going this seems like a bigger
 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.680
and keep going this seems like a bigger
family but is this family going to

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690
family but is this family going to
 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.440
family but is this family going to
survive I mean well I don't know yet I

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450
survive I mean well I don't know yet I
 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.880
survive I mean well I don't know yet I
mean I would have to do them out so I

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890
mean I would have to do them out so I
 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.800
mean I would have to do them out so I
would have to work out the probability

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810
would have to work out the probability
 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.710
would have to work out the probability
that this family is going to survive in

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720
that this family is going to survive in
 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.530
that this family is going to survive in
fact there is a nice way to work out if

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540
fact there is a nice way to work out if
 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.930
fact there is a nice way to work out if
a family is going to go extinct it's

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940
a family is going to go extinct it's
 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.699
a family is going to go extinct it's
actually quite simple and it's just

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709
actually quite simple and it's just
 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.960
actually quite simple and it's just
based on your average the average number

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970
based on your average the average number
 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.120
based on your average the average number
of kids will tell you when your family

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130
of kids will tell you when your family
 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.150
of kids will tell you when your family
will go extinct in fact if your average

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160
will go extinct in fact if your average
 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.460
will go extinct in fact if your average
number of kids is less than or equal to

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470
number of kids is less than or equal to
 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.700
number of kids is less than or equal to
one you are guaranteed to go extinct if

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710
one you are guaranteed to go extinct if
 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.520
one you are guaranteed to go extinct if
it's greater than one you may go extinct

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530
it's greater than one you may go extinct
 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.980
it's greater than one you may go extinct
it's not guaranteed but if it's less

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990
it's not guaranteed but if it's less
 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.870
it's not guaranteed but if it's less
than or equal to one absolutely

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880
than or equal to one absolutely
 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.879
than or equal to one absolutely
guaranteed to go extinct now and I think

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889
guaranteed to go extinct now and I think
 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.460
guaranteed to go extinct now and I think
this is slightly surprising when I tell

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470
this is slightly surprising when I tell
 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.090
this is slightly surprising when I tell
you that fact I think that feels

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100
you that fact I think that feels
 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.290
you that fact I think that feels
intuitively right actually I think that

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300
intuitively right actually I think that
 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.089
intuitively right actually I think that
feels like oh yeah that makes sense but

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099
feels like oh yeah that makes sense but
 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:54.920
feels like oh yeah that makes sense but
I don't think you would work that out

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930
I don't think you would work that out
 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.420
I don't think you would work that out
without having to go through the maths

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430
without having to go through the maths
 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.700
without having to go through the maths

years following his death okay let's

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430
years following his death okay let's
 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.279
years following his death okay let's
look at these dice I've been using this

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289
look at these dice I've been using this
 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.500
look at these dice I've been using this
last example which was the very healthy

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510
last example which was the very healthy
 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.940
last example which was the very healthy
family I had over here on the right

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950
family I had over here on the right
 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.770
family I had over here on the right
let's look at the probabilities so we

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780
let's look at the probabilities so we
 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.570
let's look at the probabilities so we
got the number of kids here let's have a

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580
got the number of kids here let's have a
 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.820
got the number of kids here let's have a
look he could have 0 kids you could have

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830
look he could have 0 kids you could have
 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.420
look he could have 0 kids you could have
1 2 3 in a divin experiment we could

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430
1 2 3 in a divin experiment we could
 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.610
1 2 3 in a divin experiment we could
have 4 5 so we could carry this on

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620
have 4 5 so we could carry this on
 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.140
have 4 5 so we could carry this on
further what was the probability of

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150
further what was the probability of
 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.020
further what was the probability of
having 0 kids it well it's just 1 out of

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030
having 0 kids it well it's just 1 out of
 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.529
having 0 kids it well it's just 1 out of
6

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539
6
 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.029
6
what's the probability of having one

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039
what's the probability of having one
 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.400
what's the probability of having one
well there was a 1 and a 1 it was 2 out

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410
well there was a 1 and a 1 it was 2 out
 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.189
well there was a 1 and a 1 it was 2 out
of 6 probability of having to where

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199
of 6 probability of having to where
 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.219
of 6 probability of having to where
there was a 2 and a 2 so 2 out of 6 and

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229
there was a 2 and a 2 so 2 out of 6 and
 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.589
there was a 2 and a 2 so 2 out of 6 and
the probability of having 3 it was just

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599
the probability of having 3 it was just
 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.050
the probability of having 3 it was just
1 1 out of 6 so the average number of

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060
1 1 out of 6 so the average number of
 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.779
1 1 out of 6 so the average number of
kids well I just add up the values here

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789
kids well I just add up the values here
 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.810
kids well I just add up the values here
and divide by 6 9 out of 6 would be the

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820
and divide by 6 9 out of 6 would be the
 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.689
and divide by 6 9 out of 6 would be the
average it's greater than 1 and this is

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699
average it's greater than 1 and this is
 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:55.070
average it's greater than 1 and this is
going to be a very healthy family I

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080
going to be a very healthy family I
 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.320
going to be a very healthy family I
think that makes sense if your average

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330
think that makes sense if your average
 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.570
think that makes sense if your average
is greater than 1 the population is

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580
is greater than 1 the population is
 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.650
is greater than 1 the population is
going to be growing

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660
going to be growing
 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.150
going to be growing
I think that makes sense so you could be

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160
I think that makes sense so you could be
 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.950
I think that makes sense so you could be
unlucky you could go extinct you could

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960
unlucky you could go extinct you could
 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.540
unlucky you could go extinct you could
have a generation where you have no kids

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550
have a generation where you have no kids
 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.510
have a generation where you have no kids
you could go extinct but generally you

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520
you could go extinct but generally you
 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.610
you could go extinct but generally you
expect your population to grow we

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620
expect your population to grow we
 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.560
expect your population to grow we
compare that to the other example

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570
compare that to the other example
 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.580
compare that to the other example
so 306 probability of having zero kids

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590
so 306 probability of having zero kids
 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.700
so 306 probability of having zero kids
one out of six for one kid one out of

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710
one out of six for one kid one out of
 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.860
one out of six for one kid one out of
six for having two kids one out of six

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870
six for having two kids one out of six
 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.780
six for having two kids one out of six
for having three kids so what's my

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790
for having three kids so what's my
 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.970
for having three kids so what's my
average this time I add up these values

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980
average this time I add up these values
 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.390
average this time I add up these values
six divided by six so the average is one

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400
six divided by six so the average is one
 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.270
six divided by six so the average is one
okay I don't know if that means my

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280
okay I don't know if that means my
 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.070
okay I don't know if that means my
population is going to be growing or not

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080
population is going to be growing or not
 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.810
population is going to be growing or not
growing I'm not sure about that at the

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820
growing I'm not sure about that at the
 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.720
growing I'm not sure about that at the
moment there is another example we could

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:38.730
moment there is another example we could
 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.690
moment there is another example we could
have done maybe worse example this is

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:41.700
have done maybe worse example this is
 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.790
have done maybe worse example this is
where the average is less than one just

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800
where the average is less than one just
 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.520
where the average is less than one just
to show you I've got so zero kids I've

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530
to show you I've got so zero kids I've
 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.460
to show you I've got so zero kids I've
got three out of six one kids yeah I've

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470
got three out of six one kids yeah I've
 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.500
got three out of six one kids yeah I've
got one and A one so that's two out of

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510
got one and A one so that's two out of
 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.440
got one and A one so that's two out of
six two kids I've got one of those

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.450
six two kids I've got one of those
 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.170
six two kids I've got one of those
that's one out of six I don't have a

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180
that's one out of six I don't have a
 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.270
that's one out of six I don't have a
three on this so that's so that's it so

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280
three on this so that's so that's it so
 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.700
three on this so that's so that's it so
the average is four divided by six which

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710
the average is four divided by six which
 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.740
the average is four divided by six which
is less than one I think it makes sense

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750
is less than one I think it makes sense
 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.720
is less than one I think it makes sense
that this would have a dwindling

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:05.730
that this would have a dwindling
 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.630
that this would have a dwindling
population over time the population

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:08.640
population over time the population
 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.540
population over time the population
begins smaller and you would go extinct

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550
begins smaller and you would go extinct
 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.300
begins smaller and you would go extinct
probably go extinct but it's guaranteed

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310
probably go extinct but it's guaranteed
 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.180
probably go extinct but it's guaranteed
that you go extinct that's the thing you

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.190
that you go extinct that's the thing you
 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.070
that you go extinct that's the thing you
are guaranteed to go extinct if your

turn these probabilities that I've
 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.990
turn these probabilities that I've
written out into a formula I'm going to

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000
written out into a formula I'm going to
 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.910
written out into a formula I'm going to

00:08:04.499 --> 00:08:04.509
see the formula I've made out of this
 

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:06.210
see the formula I've made out of this
I've made a formula and I've used the

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:06.220
I've made a formula and I've used the
 

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.210
I've made a formula and I've used the

extinction by generation n right some

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:27.430
extinction by generation n right some
 

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:32.209
extinction by generation n right some
time in the future this is equal to G of

00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:32.219
time in the future this is equal to G of
 

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:35.779

the probability of extinction by
 

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:40.680
the probability of extinction by
generation n minus 1 so slightly reduced

generation n minus 1 so slightly reduced
 

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:41.880
generation n minus 1 so slightly reduced
the problem and that's not an obvious

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:41.890
the problem and that's not an obvious
 

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:43.980
the problem and that's not an obvious
thing but I've slightly reduced the

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:43.990
thing but I've slightly reduced the
 

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.930
thing but I've slightly reduced the
problem by one generation you can see

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:45.940
problem by one generation you can see
 

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.079
problem by one generation you can see
that if I do have chance to I might be

00:08:49.079 --> 00:08:49.089
that if I do have chance to I might be
 

00:08:49.089 --> 00:08:51.210
that if I do have chance to I might be
able to justify this in a second but I

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:51.220
able to justify this in a second but I
 

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.620
able to justify this in a second but I
don't want to get caught up in this yet

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:52.630
don't want to get caught up in this yet
 

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.980
don't want to get caught up in this yet
this is the clever part is I'm gonna let

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:55.990
this is the clever part is I'm gonna let
 

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.670
this is the clever part is I'm gonna let
n tend to infinity so I'm going to go

00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680
n tend to infinity so I'm going to go
 

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.000
n tend to infinity so I'm going to go
far far into the future with either n

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.010
far far into the future with either n
 

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.390
far far into the future with either n
tend to infinity on the left hand side

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:05.400
tend to infinity on the left hand side
 

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.949
tend to infinity on the left hand side
this is going to be the probability of

00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959
this is going to be the probability of
 

00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:11.490
this is going to be the probability of
ultimate extinction at some point far in

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:11.500
ultimate extinction at some point far in
 

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.340
ultimate extinction at some point far in
the future I am going to go extinct as

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:14.350
the future I am going to go extinct as
 

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.769
the future I am going to go extinct as
the probability I'm interested in on the

00:09:16.769 --> 00:09:16.779
the probability I'm interested in on the
 

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:20.810
the probability I'm interested in on the
right hand side this becomes G of and

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:20.820
right hand side this becomes G of and
 

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.930
right hand side this becomes G of and
this expression here is also the

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:24.940
this expression here is also the
 

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.800
this expression here is also the
probability of ultimate extinction it's

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:28.810
probability of ultimate extinction it's
 

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.030
probability of ultimate extinction it's
the same thing

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.040
the same thing
 

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.579
the same thing
if we let n go to infinity or to put it

00:09:32.579 --> 00:09:32.589
if we let n go to infinity or to put it
 

00:09:32.589 --> 00:09:36.800
if we let n go to infinity or to put it
another way what we've got here is x

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:36.810
another way what we've got here is x
 

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:42.210
another way what we've got here is x
equals G of X if I can solve this for X

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:42.220
equals G of X if I can solve this for X
 

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.730
equals G of X if I can solve this for X
I will have the probability of ultimate

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:44.740
I will have the probability of ultimate
 

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:45.960
I will have the probability of ultimate
extinction

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:45.970

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.269
extinction
let's do that one of our examples and

00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:48.279
let's do that one of our examples and
 

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:49.579
let's do that one of our examples and
just to see how this works

00:09:49.579 --> 00:09:49.589
just to see how this works
 

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:54.090
just to see how this works
so my G of X in my first example was

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:54.100
so my G of X in my first example was
 

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.920
so my G of X in my first example was
this and I'm trying to solve this equal

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:55.930
this and I'm trying to solve this equal
 

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:59.639
this and I'm trying to solve this equal
to X well each of solve that I mean

00:09:59.639 --> 00:09:59.649
to X well each of solve that I mean
 

00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:01.920
to X well each of solve that I mean
there's lots of ways to solve this I

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:01.930
there's lots of ways to solve this I
 

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.600
there's lots of ways to solve this I
mean I won't go through the details of

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:03.610
mean I won't go through the details of
 

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.699
mean I won't go through the details of
solving it and you will get two

00:10:05.699 --> 00:10:05.709
solving it and you will get two
 

00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:08.530
solving it and you will get two
solutions I'll tell you what they are

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:08.540
solutions I'll tell you what they are
 

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.530
solutions I'll tell you what they are
they are x equals nought point three

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:11.540
they are x equals nought point three
 

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.290
they are x equals nought point three
zero and one but it's the smallest one

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:14.300
zero and one but it's the smallest one
 

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.320
zero and one but it's the smallest one
we want the smallest solution is the

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:17.330
we want the smallest solution is the
 

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.769
we want the smallest solution is the
probability of ultimate extinction so

00:10:20.769 --> 00:10:20.779
probability of ultimate extinction so
 

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:23.050
probability of ultimate extinction so
for this dice that I was using the

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:23.060
for this dice that I was using the
 

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.790
for this dice that I was using the
probability of ultimate extinction was

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800
probability of ultimate extinction was
 

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.430
probability of ultimate extinction was
about 30% if I did it for a really long

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440
about 30% if I did it for a really long
 

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.010
about 30% if I did it for a really long
time I'm not expecting to go extinct I

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:30.020
time I'm not expecting to go extinct I
 

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.769
time I'm not expecting to go extinct I
have a 30% probability that I will go

00:10:32.769 --> 00:10:32.779
have a 30% probability that I will go
 

00:10:32.779 --> 00:10:35.949
have a 30% probability that I will go
extinct let's have a look at when you

00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:35.959
extinct let's have a look at when you
 

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:37.480
extinct let's have a look at when you
are guaranteed to go extinct let's

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:37.490
are guaranteed to go extinct let's
 

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.190
are guaranteed to go extinct let's
compare that with the other dice so I

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200
compare that with the other dice so I
 

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.949
compare that with the other dice so I
had my G of X for my example and I'm

00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:41.959
had my G of X for my example and I'm
 

00:10:41.959 --> 00:10:43.750
had my G of X for my example and I'm
going to draw the graph for G of X so

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760
going to draw the graph for G of X so
 

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.990
going to draw the graph for G of X so
there's your y-axis there's your x-axis

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000
there's your y-axis there's your x-axis
 

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.790
there's your y-axis there's your x-axis
on this graph I'm going to join the y

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800
on this graph I'm going to join the y
 

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.180
on this graph I'm going to join the y
equals x line there dotted if X was

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:52.190
equals x line there dotted if X was
 

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.130
equals x line there dotted if X was
equal to 0

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:53.140
equal to 0
 

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.750
equal to 0
most of those terms cancelled out and

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760
most of those terms cancelled out and
 

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.420
most of those terms cancelled out and
the only term I had left was the

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:58.430
the only term I had left was the
 

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.570
the only term I had left was the
probability of no kids it was one sick

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:00.580
probability of no kids it was one sick
 

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.460
probability of no kids it was one sick
so when x is 0 you're crossing the y

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:03.470
so when x is 0 you're crossing the y
 

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.320
so when x is 0 you're crossing the y
axis at this point if X is equal to 1

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:07.330
axis at this point if X is equal to 1
 

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.660
axis at this point if X is equal to 1
then what happens is G of X just becomes

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:10.670
then what happens is G of X just becomes
 

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.940
then what happens is G of X just becomes
adding all the probabilities together if

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:12.950
adding all the probabilities together if
 

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:14.920
adding all the probabilities together if
you add all the probabilities together

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:14.930
you add all the probabilities together
 

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.069
you add all the probabilities together
you always get one that's always

00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079
you always get one that's always
 

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:21.639
you always get one that's always
guaranteed to happen so this point is

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:21.649
guaranteed to happen so this point is
 

00:11:21.649 --> 00:11:25.240
guaranteed to happen so this point is
always on my curve G this is the point 1

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:25.250
always on my curve G this is the point 1
 

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.130
always on my curve G this is the point 1
1 that's always going to be there

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:27.140
1 that's always going to be there
 

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.829
1 that's always going to be there
and then if I draw the graph of G it

00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839
and then if I draw the graph of G it
 

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:33.819
and then if I draw the graph of G it
looks like this it curves upwards like

00:11:33.819 --> 00:11:33.829
looks like this it curves upwards like
 

00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:39.040
looks like this it curves upwards like
this so this is my graph G of X and this

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:39.050
this so this is my graph G of X and this
 

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.240
this so this is my graph G of X and this
is true in general

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:40.250
is true in general
 

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:44.019
is true in general
when your average it's greater than 1

00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:44.029
when your average it's greater than 1
 

00:11:44.029 --> 00:11:46.329
when your average it's greater than 1
it's always going to curve up this way

00:11:46.329 --> 00:11:46.339
it's always going to curve up this way
 

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:48.880
it's always going to curve up this way
it's always going to cross the y equals

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:48.890
it's always going to cross the y equals
 

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.600
it's always going to cross the y equals
x line twice here at 1 because that

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:52.610
x line twice here at 1 because that
 

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.000
x line twice here at 1 because that
always happens and this one here the

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.010
always happens and this one here the
 

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:57.699
always happens and this one here the
smaller one was the probability of

00:11:57.699 --> 00:11:57.709
smaller one was the probability of
 

00:11:57.709 --> 00:12:00.519
smaller one was the probability of
extinction now let's compare that with

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:00.529
extinction now let's compare that with
 

00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:02.980
extinction now let's compare that with
the average equal to 1 or less than 1

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:02.990
the average equal to 1 or less than 1
 

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.990
the average equal to 1 or less than 1
let's look at the graphs the other death

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.000
let's look at the graphs the other death
 

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.960
let's look at the graphs the other death
yeah the other dice same thing there's

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:07.970
yeah the other dice same thing there's
 

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.019
yeah the other dice same thing there's
my y equals x line and I'm going to draw

00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:11.029
my y equals x line and I'm going to draw
 

00:12:11.029 --> 00:12:15.340
my y equals x line and I'm going to draw
what G looks like so if the average was

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:15.350
what G looks like so if the average was
 

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.610
what G looks like so if the average was
equal to 1 tends to look like this so

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:18.620
equal to 1 tends to look like this so
 

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:19.800
equal to 1 tends to look like this so
you'd have

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:19.810
you'd have
 

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.480
you'd have
a probability here you're always going

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:21.490
a probability here you're always going
 

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:22.920
a probability here you're always going
to have the probability you won one or

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:22.930
to have the probability you won one or
 

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.429
to have the probability you won one or
the point 1 1 and then the curve of G

00:12:26.429 --> 00:12:26.439
the point 1 1 and then the curve of G
 

00:12:26.439 --> 00:12:29.730
the point 1 1 and then the curve of G
comes up it's always increasing like

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:29.740
comes up it's always increasing like
 

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.769
comes up it's always increasing like
that just kind of touches that point

00:12:31.769 --> 00:12:31.779
that just kind of touches that point
 

00:12:31.779 --> 00:12:35.850
that just kind of touches that point
there and moves off now the probability

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:35.860
there and moves off now the probability
 

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.369
there and moves off now the probability
of extinction is when it crosses the y

00:12:38.369 --> 00:12:38.379
of extinction is when it crosses the y
 

00:12:38.379 --> 00:12:42.179
of extinction is when it crosses the y
equals x line in this example I had we

00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:42.189
equals x line in this example I had we
 

00:12:42.189 --> 00:12:44.249
equals x line in this example I had we
crossed twice I used I needed the

00:12:44.249 --> 00:12:44.259
crossed twice I used I needed the
 

00:12:44.259 --> 00:12:47.369
crossed twice I used I needed the
smaller one in this example it only ever

00:12:47.369 --> 00:12:47.379
smaller one in this example it only ever
 

00:12:47.379 --> 00:12:49.949
smaller one in this example it only ever
crosses once so it just touches the

00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:49.959
crosses once so it just touches the
 

00:12:49.959 --> 00:12:52.650
crosses once so it just touches the
point 1 1 which means that the

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:52.660
point 1 1 which means that the
 

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.829
point 1 1 which means that the
probability of extinction is 1 because

00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839
probability of extinction is 1 because
 

00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:57.360
probability of extinction is 1 because
it's the only time we crossed that line

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:57.370
it's the only time we crossed that line
 

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.579
it's the only time we crossed that line
and that's the thing we need to know the

00:12:59.579 --> 00:12:59.589
and that's the thing we need to know the
 

00:12:59.589 --> 00:13:01.799
and that's the thing we need to know the
probability of extinction it's equal to

00:13:01.799 --> 00:13:01.809
probability of extinction it's equal to
 

00:13:01.809 --> 00:13:04.049
probability of extinction it's equal to
1 which means you're guaranteed to go

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:04.059
1 which means you're guaranteed to go
 

00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:06.269
1 which means you're guaranteed to go
extinct and just to serve our third

00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:06.279
extinct and just to serve our third
 

00:13:06.279 --> 00:13:09.420
extinct and just to serve our third
example we got the y and x axis we've

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:09.430
example we got the y and x axis we've
 

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:14.879
example we got the y and x axis we've
got a y equals x line we're crossing the

00:13:14.879 --> 00:13:14.889
got a y equals x line we're crossing the
 

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:19.170
got a y equals x line we're crossing the
y axis somewhere we know we cross the

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:19.180
y axis somewhere we know we cross the
 

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.509
y axis somewhere we know we cross the
point 1 1 and I'm going to draw in the

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519
point 1 1 and I'm going to draw in the
 

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:25.110
point 1 1 and I'm going to draw in the
curve G and this is for the average less

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120
curve G and this is for the average less
 

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.780
curve G and this is for the average less
than 1 what happens here is we kind of

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:27.790
than 1 what happens here is we kind of
 

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.420
than 1 what happens here is we kind of
curving upwards again and we crossed

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:30.430
curving upwards again and we crossed
 

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.670
curving upwards again and we crossed
through that point which is the point x

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680
through that point which is the point x
 

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.799
through that point which is the point x
equals 1 which again is the probability

00:13:34.799 --> 00:13:34.809
equals 1 which again is the probability
 

00:13:34.809 --> 00:13:37.199
equals 1 which again is the probability
of extinction which means you're

00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:37.209
of extinction which means you're
 

00:13:37.209 --> 00:13:39.660
of extinction which means you're
guaranteed to go extinct this is all

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:39.670
guaranteed to go extinct this is all
 

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.420
guaranteed to go extinct this is all
true in general there's only one

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:42.430
true in general there's only one
 

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.069
true in general there's only one
exception to what I've said which is

00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079
exception to what I've said which is
 

00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:48.629
exception to what I've said which is
this dice and this is the one which has

00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639
this dice and this is the one which has
 

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:52.650
this dice and this is the one which has
a 1 on every side and if I roll this I

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:52.660
a 1 on every side and if I roll this I
 

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.600
a 1 on every side and if I roll this I
could roll it forever I would never go

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:54.610
could roll it forever I would never go
 

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.559
could roll it forever I would never go
extinct but the average for that die is

00:13:57.559 --> 00:13:57.569
extinct but the average for that die is
 

00:13:57.569 --> 00:14:00.929
extinct but the average for that die is
1 so that's our one exception to what I

00:14:00.929 --> 00:14:00.939
1 so that's our one exception to what I
 

00:14:00.939 --> 00:14:03.509
1 so that's our one exception to what I
told you so there was this thing that I

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519
told you so there was this thing that I
 

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:05.850
told you so there was this thing that I
said and I didn't quite justify it

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:05.860
said and I didn't quite justify it
 

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.069
said and I didn't quite justify it
straight away but it's trying to justify

00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079
straight away but it's trying to justify
 

00:14:08.079 --> 00:14:09.900
straight away but it's trying to justify
it so I had this this was the important

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:09.910
it so I had this this was the important
 

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:13.019
it so I had this this was the important
thing the probability of extinction they

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:13.029
thing the probability of extinction they
 

00:14:13.029 --> 00:14:17.639
thing the probability of extinction they
say by generation n
