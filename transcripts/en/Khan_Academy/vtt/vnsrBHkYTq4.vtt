00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.570
- [Instructor] What we have here is just

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:03.970
a small sample of the types of molecules

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.150
that you will see in a biological system.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.110
At the top left right over here,

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.730
you have an example of an amino acid.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.290
Amino acids are the
building blocks of proteins.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.530
And if we were to take a look

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.440
at what an amino acid is made up of,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.940
in this dark gray color,
those are carbon atoms,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.910
in the white, you see hydrogen atoms,

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.910
in the red you see oxygen
atoms, and this blue

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.420
right over here, that is a nitrogen atom.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.060
And as you can see, a
lot of these elements

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.970
keep showing up in
these various molecules,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.270
especially carbon and hydrogen,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.450
but also you see a lot
of oxygen and nitrogen,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.420
and as we're about to
see, phosphorous also

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.620
pops up a lot.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.280
Now this isn't a comprehensive list,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.080
you'll also see other elements,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.000
but these tend to show
up fairly frequently.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.360
For example, this is a model of ATP,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.320
adenosine triphosphate,
as we study biology,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.010
you'll see that it's often viewed

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.360
as the currency of energy,
the molecular currency

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.750
of energy in biological systems.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.030
And once again, we see a lot of carbons

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.610
in the dark gray, we see the hydrogens

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.250
in this off white color, or the light gray

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.350
I guess you could say, you
see your oxygens again,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.310
here the nitrogen is in
this light blue color,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.870
and then you see the
phosphoruses right over there

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.753
in that yellow color, phosphorus.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.030
This is a model of a triglyceride,

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.000
often known as a fat molecule,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.990
fat molecules are used for energy storage,

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.850
and once again, you see many
carbons in the dark gray,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.340
and then you see these hydrogens,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.250
and then a few oxygens.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.870
This is a model of DNA,
a small segment of DNA,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.930
and this is a much more complex molecule

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.763
than the other ones we've seen,

00:01:58.763 --> 00:02:01.450
in fact, this could extend
far beyond our screen

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.150
in either direction.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.950
But once again, you see
these same familiar elements.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.260
You see the carbon in the dark gray,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.330
the hydrogen in that white color,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.130
you see the oxygens in the red,

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.640
the nitrogens in the blue, and
the phosphorus in the yellow.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.990
So the big takeaway here is
that biological molecules

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.100
tend to be made up of the same set

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.930
of elemental building blocks,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.960
and in fact, it isn't just
at the elemental level,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.070
it can even be at the molecular level.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.380
For example, in ATP you have what's known

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.680
as a nitrogenous base right over here,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.370
you have a five carbon
sugar right over here,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.060
and you have three phosphate groups,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.480
or a triphosphate group.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.810
In DNA you have something very similar,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.990
the nitrogenous bases are hard to see,

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.610
they're kind of the
rungs of the ladder here,

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.040
you have your five carbon
sugars, also hard to see,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.820
and then you have these
phosphates as well.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.950
In fact, the backbone of DNA is made up

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.930
of these five carbon sugars
and these phosphates.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.430
Now why do these elements keep showing up?

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.110
Well these are elements that
you will see a lot in Earth.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.790
For example, nitrogen makes
up most of our atmosphere.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.130
We have a lot of water on
the surface of our planet,

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.020
which is made up of oxygen and hydrogen.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.820
Carbon actually makes
up a surprisingly small

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.090
percentage of our atmosphere, about 0.04%

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.750
of our atmosphere, but
photosynthetic organisms,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.330
like plants, are good at fixing carbon

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.060
and storing energy in carbon bonds,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.340
and when we eat those, those
become part of our bodies.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.540
And just to get an appreciation
of what we are made up of,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.850
in terms of elements, we
can look at this chart

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.620
right over here where we see that we are

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.940
primarily made up of
oxygen, percentage in body,

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.080
and that's because we're primarily

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.830
made up of water and
water is primarily oxygen.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.580
It also has hydrogen.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.000
Now second to oxygen is
carbon, and then you see

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.530
nitrogen, phosphorous, we of
course have a lot of calcium,

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.540
calcium of course used in bones,

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.850
but it's also used for things
like muscle contractions.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.930
And I could keep on going down this list,

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.900
and you will see these other elements

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.370
in your study of biology,
but the big picture is

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.450
that even though biological systems

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.060
can get fairly complex, they're made up

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.100
of similar building
blocks, and these elemental

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.800
building blocks come from the environment

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.663
in which these biological
systems exist and evolved.
