00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
Well the whole premise of the
last series of videos was

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.610
really just trying to get at
trying to figure out whether

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.080
some transformation T-- let's
have some transformation that

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.040
is a mapping from, let's say
it's a mapping from Rn to Rm,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.100
--the whole question is,
is T invertible.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.110
And we showed several videos
ago that a function, and a

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.900
transformation is really just a
function, that a function is

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.400
invertible if it meets
two conditions.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.740
So invertible.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.840
So I don't have to keep writing
the word over again.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.010
You have to have
two conditions.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.980
It has to be onto or essentially
it has to map to

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.210
every member of your codomain
and it also has to be

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.540
one-to-one.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.060
Another way of saying one-to-one
is that every

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.960
member of your codomain is
mapped to by at most one

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.700
member of your domain.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.060
And we did several videos where
we thought well if we

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.599
had a transformation, a linear
transformation, that's defined

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:11.140
by a matrix, A, where this would
be an m-by-n matrix, we

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:19.150
said that this is going to be
met if the rank-- This is only

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.740
met if the rank of A is equal to
the number of rows in your

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.710
transformation matrix
is equal to m.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.100
And in the last video I just
showed that this is only true

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.360
if every one of your column
vectors are linearly

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.200
independent or that they all
are basis vectors for your

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.720
column space or that the rank
of your matrix it has to be

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.320
equal to n.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.600
Now in order for something to
be invertible, in order for

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.290
the transformation to be
invertible, both of these

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.350
things have to be true.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.440
Your rank of A has to be equal
to m and your rank of A has to

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.490
be equal to n.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.050
So in order to be invertible,
a couple of

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.890
things have to happen.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.340
In order to be invertible your
rank of your transformation

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.660
matrix has to be equal to m,
which has to be equal to n.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.340
So m has to be equal to n.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.610
So we have an interesting
condition.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.145
You have to have a
square matrix.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.790
Your matrix has to be n-by-n.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.030
That's what this implies.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.930
If both of these are true, then
m has to be equal n and

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.480
you're dealing with
a square matrix.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.650
Even more, you're dealing with
the square matrix where every

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.760
one of the columns are
linearly independent,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.660
so this is our A.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.750
A looks like this.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.200
A1, A2, all the way to An.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.140
Since the rank of A is equal to
n, and this is of course an

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.280
n-by-n matrix.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.240
We just said that this has to
be the case because its rank

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.470
has to be equal to m, which is
the number of rows, and its

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.870
rank has to be equal to n,
which is the number of

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.780
columns, so the rows and columns
have to be the same.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.010
But the fact that your rank
is equal to the number of

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.250
columns, that means that all
of your column vectors are

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.300
bases for your column space, or
that if you put them into

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:14.500
reduced row echelon form, what
are you going to get?

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.130
Well all of these guys are basis
vectors so they're all

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.780
going to be associated with
pivot vectors or they're all

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.500
going to be associated
with pivot columns.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.570
So this is going to be 1, 0,
bunch of 0's, and then you're

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.180
going to have a 0, 1, a bunch
of 0's like this.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:40.690
They're all going to be
associated with pivot columns

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.610
when you go into reduced
row echelon form.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.090
So all of them are
pivot columns.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.890
It's an n-by-n matrix.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.470
So what is an n-by-n
matrix where every

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.570
column is a pivot column?

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.120
What is an n-by-n matrix?

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.870
Let me write this.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.970
So you have an n.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.710
So the reduced row echelon form
of A has to be equal to

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:15.350
an n-by-n matrix, cause A is
n-by-n, where every column is

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.510
a linearly independent
pivot column.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.870
And I mean by definition of
reduced row echelon form you

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.570
can't have the same pivot
column twice where every

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.460
column is a linearly independent
pivot column.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.450
It's a little bit redundant, but
I think you get the idea.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.550
So what is an n-by-n matrix
where every column is a

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.560
linearly independent
pivot column?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.960
Well that is just a matrix that
has 1's down the diagonal

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.215
and everything else is a 0.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.940
Or, you've seen this matrix
before, this is just an n-by-n

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.410
identity matrix or the identity
matrix on n or on Rn.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.965
So if you multiply this matrix
times any member of Rn, you're

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.350
just going to get that
matrix again.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.740
But this is interesting.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.440
We now have a pretty usable
condition for invertibility.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.360
We can say that the
transformation T that is a

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.800
mapping from Rn to-- well it
has to map to the same

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.300
dimension space so
from Rn to Rn.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.720
It's equal to some square matrix
n-by-n, it has to be an

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.030
n-by-n matrix, times our
vectors in our domain.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:41.690
And it's only going to be
invertible if the reduced row

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.550
echelon form of our
transformation matrix is equal

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.620
to the identity matrix on n.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.590
I mean I could have written an
m here and I could've said

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.160
this is an m-by-n matrix, but
the only way that this is

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.700
going to be true is if
this is also an n and

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.670
this is also an m.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.900
But maybe I could leave
them there.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.080
Let me leave those
m's there because

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.700
that's the big takeaway.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.990
The big takeaway is that in
order for the transformation

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.330
matrix to be invertible, the
only way it's invertible is if

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.640
the reduced row echelon form of
our transformation matrix

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.870
is equal to an n-by-n
identity matrix.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.410
The identity matrix is always
going to be n-by-n.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.510
So that's a big takeaway.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.880
Now we'll use that in the future
to actually solve for

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.620
transformations or solve for
inverses of transformations.
