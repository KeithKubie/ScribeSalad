00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:12.450
Charles Darwin said humans descended from
monkeys.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.839
Darwin coined the term “survival of the
fittest.”

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.820
Darwin was the first person to theorize evolution
as the origin of species.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.820
Darwin did not believe in God.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.279
Darwin played shortstop for the New York Yankees.

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.090
These are just few of the common myths that
are associated with Charles Darwin.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.220
(Well, maybe not playing for the Yankees.)

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.099
But, as with the Yankees myth we just created,
the rest are also all false.

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.461
Here is the truth about a few of the Darwin
myths so prevalently repeated.

00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:37.260
Myth #1.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.239
Charles Darwin said humans descended from
monkeys.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.039
The common mocking rhetorical question related
to this one is “If evolution says we descended

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.309
from monkeys then why are there still monkeys?”

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.059
In Charles Darwin’s 1871 science-altering
book The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.879
to Sex, the great naturalist and scientist
mused on his theory of evolution.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.319
While he attempted to draw connecting lines
between humans, monkeys, apes, he never explicitly

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:04.699
said that humans descended from monkeys.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.890
Instead, he referred back to On the Origin
of Species, in which he said,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.950
Analogy would lead me one step further, namely,
to believe that all animals and plants have

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.970
descended from one prototype.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.620
But analogy would be a deceitful guide.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.340
Nevertheless, all living things have much
in common, in their chemical composition,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.159
their germinal vesicles, their cellular structure,
their laws of growth and reproduction.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.820
Darwin’s main musing here was that all living
things perhaps descended from one thing, including

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.450
humans and monkeys.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.131
More to the point, he believed that humans
and monkeys came from a common ancestor, with

00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:39.960
humans and monkeys having something more akin
to a cousin relationship, than a parent/child

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.960
one.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.960
All that being said, we now know that humans
are more directly related to apes.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.960
In fact, humans and apes have more common,
gene pool-wise, than monkeys and apes.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.960
Myth #2.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.170
Darwin was an unknown scientist before On
the Origin of Species.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.359
Darwin’s On the Origin of Species struck
a chord when it was released in late 1859.

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:54.890
But prior to that, he was already well respected
in the scientific community.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.770
Peers described him as an “accomplished
naturalist” (from Andrew Murray’s 1860

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.509
review of the book) and “ANY contribution
to our Natural History literature from the

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.619
pen of Mr. C. Darwin is certain to command
attention” (Samuel Wilberforce, 1860).

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.860
There’s a reason all 1,250 copies of the
first print of On the Origin of Species sold

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.069
the first day.

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.940
It was as early as 1836 that Darwin started
getting attention for his work when his mentor,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.140
John Stevens Henslow, started telling others
of Darwin’s studies.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.450
Darwin wrote many books and pamphlets prior
to On the Origin of Species, including Journals

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.220
and Remarks published in 1839 (basically a
memoir about his Beagle travels) and The Structure

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.450
and Distribution of Coral Reefs (a much more
narrow writing about coral reefs).

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.920
While they weren’t as highly read nor as
revolutionary as his more well-known works,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.310
they were thought of as scientifically significant
within the community and helped establish

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.790
his reputation.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.060
Myth #3.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.950
Darwin was the first to publish a book about
evolution.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.950
Despite the common misconception that Darwin
is solely responsible for discovering evolution,

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.780
that is not the case.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.780
The idea of evolutionary biology was not by
any means a new one, with theories that touch

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.360
on evolution going all the way back to at
least the 7th century BC.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.560
Much more recently, in the early 19th century,
there was a very popular theory of evolution

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.810
proposed by Catholic scientist Jean-Baptiste
Lamarck.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.120
However, Darwin took a slightly different
approach than Lamarck, suggesting that entirely

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.940
different species could share a common ancestor,
a so-called branching model, rather than a

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.730
“ladder” model that was so popular in
some scientific circles before.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.680
In another example, fifteen years prior to
Darwin’s published work, building somewhat

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.150
on Lamarck’s work, there was Robert Chambers’
Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.320
Published in 1844 originally anonymously,
it talked of ideas like “stellar evolution”

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.850
– that stars change over time – and “transmutation,”
that species change from one form to another.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.860
Later, Darwin would cite Vestiges of the Natural
History of Creation in the first edition of

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.090
On the Origin of Species, then again in the
sixth edition, when he praised the book for

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.480
its forward thinking,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.660
In my opinion it has done excellent service
in this country in calling attention to the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.530
subject, in removing prejudice, and in thus
preparing the ground for the reception of

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.880
analogous views.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.130
Myth #4.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.240
Scientists across the world largely dismissed
Darwin’s theories initially.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.900
Sure, some did not agree with Darwin’s theories,
including Charles Hodge who was among the

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.780
first to associate Darwinism with atheism,
“If a man says he is a Darwinian, many understand

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.470
him to avow him- self virtually an atheist
; while another understands him as saying

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.130
that he adopts some harm-less form of the
doctrine of evolution.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.470
This is a great evil.”

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.900
But many praised, agreed, and admired Darwin
and his findings, as exemplified by this glowing

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.350
statement (from Wilberforce), “a beautiful
illustration of the wonderful interdependence

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.310
of nature—of the golden chain of unsuspected
relations which bind together all the mighty

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.200
web which stretches from end to end of this
full and most diversified earth.”

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.500
Additionally, this anonymous review appeared
on Christmas Eve 1859 in the Saturday Review,

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.700
“When we say that the conclusions announced
by Mr. Darwin are such as, if established,

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.130
would cause a complete revolution in the fundamental
doctrines of natural history.”

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.670
Myth #5.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.060
Darwin coined the term “survival of the
fittest.”

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.630
During this era of Victorian scientific study,
nothing was written, studied, or read in a

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.630
vacuum.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.230
This was certainly the case when Herbert Spencer
coined the phrase “survival of the fittest,”

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.810
which he did after reading Darwin’s thoughts
on evolution.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.180
Freely admitting that this was based on Darwin’s
theories, he wrote in his 1861 book Principles

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.870
of Biology, “This survival of the fittest,
which I have here sought to express in mechanical

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.510
terms, is that which Mr Darwin has called
natural selection, or the preservation of

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.870
favoured races in the struggle for life.”

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.110
Returning the favor, Darwin gives credit to
Spencer for providing a much more “accurate”

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.170
and “convenient” phrase to his own principles,
writing in the sixth 1872 edition of On the

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.380
Origin of Species,

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.930
I have called this principle, by which each
slight variation, if useful, is preserved,

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.940
by the term Natural Selection, in order to
mark its relation to man’s power of selection.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.010
But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert
Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.360
more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.700
Myth #6.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.890
Darwin was an atheist.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.270
Confronted with these questions while he was
still living, he passionately denied being

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.300
an atheist in correspondence, letters, and
even his own autobiography.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.930
Instead, he said, “I have never been an
atheist in the sense of denying the existence

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:15.930
of a God.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.440
– I think that generally … an agnostic
would be the most correct description of my

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.460
state of mind.”

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.360
As a scientist, he was smart enough to know
not to draw conclusions when the data was

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.360
lacking.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.160
In that same letter, he also admits that his
“judgement fluctuates.”

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.730
Even one of the greatest scientists in history
was flummoxed by the question of God and a

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:33.770
greater presence.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.620
There is also a myth out there that he recanted
evolution on his deathbed and “returned”

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.620
to Christianity.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.550
This is not true and, beyond creating a dichotomy
where one didn’t necessarily exist in Darwin’s

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.540
mind, has been denied several times by Darwin’s
descendants.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:54.010
To Darwin, religion and evolution weren’t
mutually exclusive.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:59.590
This brings us to our final myth.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.910
Myth #7: From the beginning, it has been almost
universally evolution vs. creation.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.340
While certainly the likes of the Church of
England and certain other religious groups

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.780
had issues with Darwin’s theories, largely
centered around the timetables involved (millions

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.840
of years, rather than less than about 6,000
years), this type of religious contention

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.919
was hardly the norm initially, with the “creation
vs. evolution” battle being more of a relatively

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:23.400
modern widespread phenomenon.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.230
(This is similar to the relatively recent
Big Bang vs. Christianity battle, when in

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.671
truth it was a Catholic priest, and probably
the greatest scientist of the 20th century

00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:32.770
you’ve never heard of, who came up with
the theory that would evolve into the Big

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:33.770
Bang.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.360
Ironically, it was initially rejected out
of hand by many scientists precisely because

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.500
it seemed to correlate strongly with Christian
views of the origin of the universe.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.770
Many scientists accused the priest in question
of allowing his religious views to cloud his

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.310
scientific judgement, despite that his ideas
were backed by a whole lot of mathematical

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.430
and scientific evidence, resulting in Albert
Einstein declaring, “This is the most beautiful

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.430
and satisfactory explanation of creation to
which I ever listened,” after hearing the

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.430
priest’s lecture on the topic.)

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.830
Back to evolution, in truth, many among the
clergy saw no problems with Origins of the

00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.670
Species, and the debate among various branches
of Christianity over the idea of evolution

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.229
often mirrored the types of debate going on
in secular circles.

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:08.340
Some major Christian groups even simply abstained
from taking an official stance- this was something

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.570
for science to figure out if there was validity
in the theories, as it didn’t inherently

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.260
contradict many religious views.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.250
For instance, the Catholic church never banned
the work, unlike so many other works they

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.550
felt even hinted at going against established
Catholic doctrine.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:21.550
(See: Galileo and Why He was Convicted of
Heresy)

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.340
More recently, many popes have discussed the
topic, including Pope Pius XII who stated

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.850
that there was no conflict between evolution
and Catholicism.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.790
Even more recent than that, Pope Francis noted
in 2014:

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:36.310
[God] created beings and allowed them to develop
according to the internal laws that he gave

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:41.150
to each one, so that they were able to develop
and to arrive and their fullness of being.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.959
He gave autonomy to the beings of the universe
at the same time at which he assured them

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:48.499
of his continuous presence, giving being to
every reality.

00:08:48.499 --> 00:08:52.660
And so creation continued for centuries and
centuries, millennia and millennia, until

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:57.600
it became which we know today, precisely because
God is not a demiurge or a magician, but the

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.259
creator who gives being to all things…

00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:04.700
The Big Bang, which nowadays is posited as
the origin of the world, does not contradict

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.279
the divine act of creating, but rather requires
it.

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:12.680
The evolution of nature does not contrast
with the notion of creation, as evolution

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:50.449
presupposes the creation of beings that evolve.
