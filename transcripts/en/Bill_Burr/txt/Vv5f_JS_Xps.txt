Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, January 4th, 2016 a brand new year. Brand New Year. Brand new you. Are you going to make the changes that you've always wanted to make? Where are you going to get up? Tell yourself you gotta change and actually go out there. Change. I always love the pressure at the beginning of the new year to be like, God, you know there's that one great thing, right? Like what? You're like guide, shaken off the last year. You know, like, I don't know who the fuck that guy was. Right? Like lie to yourself like you're not the same person fucking one minute later when it becomes a new year or you do the real childish thing as you blame everybody else for your own fucking problems, you know? Okay, wait for this year to be over, man. She spent so much fucking bullshit to share, to be like towards fucking you.

Speaker 2:          00:00:56       I can't wait for the next fucking year. It's like, Dude, oh well are you going to change anything? You're going to break up with the person, you're going to stop getting drunk and being a Dick and picking fights in a bar, right? All of that shit. Oh, you just gonna think that magically, because this is six there now instead of a five, that all of a sudden the world's gonna Change. You don't have to adjust. Oh, am I reprimanding somebody right now? I think I am. I don't know why. I have no idea why I'm recording this. Uh, at about eight 30 in the morning, last time delays time, my wife's still sleeping downstairs, so I gotta I gotta try to stay at medium energy, medium energy here, um, for the rest of this fucking podcast. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01:41       But whatever, I'm kind of, I've gotta be honest with you. I went to bed last night and I was sad. I love the holidays and I'm sad that they're fucking over. I had another great, you know, holiday break and to think that it's all going to fucking start over again, you know, here we go.

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:00       Now the fucking year or doing the road right and shit and doing all this stuff here we fucking go again. Yeah. The whole thing just got, oh, just totally overwhelming with me and I was just fucking laying in bed. You know, you know when you do fucking look too far ahead into your fucking life, um,

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:21       You know, it just gets too fucking overwhelming. And then maybe you start hearing the saint that, you know what song I always hear in my head, I always say that's that song. Make the world Jolo way. Sub Did sub dead Ed, get it off my shoulders. Um, that's what I feel like the most pathetic emotion you could have. Make the world go away. Can you just get to go in there and just pout, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:02:47       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:48       I got to ask a question about depression. Is it actually a chemical thing or is that just an adult world word for like somebody who's just kind of sort of powering, you know, I think a lot of times when people go, I'm depressed, it's just you. You're just kind of feeling sorry for yourself. And you know the ones that say it's like a chemical imbalance. You just like, you just shift your head really quickly. The chemicals go back to the other way and you'll chair up, you know, don't believe the mainstream media, you know, in all the pharmaceutical companies with their drugs, man, is there anything funnier they want somebody who's not a fucking doctor, you know, just starts going on and on about you. Let me tell you something, man, I'm telling you, all you gotta do is just go up, walk up to an oak tree, can't be a barge, can't be a maple.

Speaker 2:          00:03:43       Go Up to an oak tree and just bite on the little sapling. You just not on it, right? You got a little piece of bark and you stick it between you just like Choo. You just stick it to you go and all of that. And your depression will go away. Yeah, it is true. It is true that native Americans used to do it and they were never depressed. That's what they used to do until the white man came and took their bark away. Now look at them all grumpy. Just like the white man cause they, cause they couldn't get any more saplings with the tree bark there. Um, anyways, uh, for, as he and his wife left yesterday so the house is empty again. It just stinks man. I was having a great fucking time and join it. Now it's gone. I, I'll fucking starts over again.

Speaker 2:          00:04:29       I'm already starting the year off. My office is a fucking mess. You know, I'm, I'm the worst. I can't find this sticker to put on my fucking license plate. I know. I got it. I don't know where the fuck it is. It just, it all starts over. They just fun times over. Fun Time is over. You know what? We still got the Christmas tree up because Nia liked it extra a lot this year. So I still have today. I still have to go through that sad fucking operation, upbringing, that goddamn thing outside. And I told you I dispose that thing like a fucking mob head. You're never going to find the body by fucking neighbor already threw his right out on the street. Just tosses it out there, right? Some dead hooker, you know what I mean? Cut The fucking thing up and you put it in the barrel.

Speaker 2:          00:05:15       That's what you do. I get mine might the green barrel, right? We got the green barrels out here and that's just like grass clippings and all that shit. I have a whole fucking Christmas tree and then the lid closes completely. You'd have no fucking idea. I mean, come on people. How difficult is it? You cut all the branches off. They need just left with the trunk and then he just section it up. It says drop the thing. Right. The fuck in there. It's not a problem. He wait. You safety goggles, you know, so nobody can see you cry. And as you're doing it, I don't understand what the fucking problem is that God damn it, get out there and dispose of the fucking tree. Correct.

Speaker 2:          00:05:53       Um, environmentally, wouldn't it be more correct if you just thought to spread it across your lawn? The tree is just going to end up in a landfill or even worse out in the ocean. They don't, the lack of the Oh shit. Um, I can't wait to get to this fucking thing later on in this podcast with this guy. He's trying to claim that the, uh, the earth can sustain 100 billion people. I really cannot see, I cannot wait to, I just glanced at it and looked at it and it's just, I just, how the fuck you, you will arrived at that number. And I actually tried to find shit. I started looking up how many fucking people the Earth can sustain. And uh, what I've immediately found was that nobody could say for certain, but the numbers estimated we're nowhere near a hundred billion fucking people. How to billion. Sorry. So I cannot wait to read this guy somehow claiming that there's enough farmland.

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:47       To feed a hundred fucking

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:50       Billion people. Yeah. I don't know. Okay. Did we stack each other on top of one another? And even then, do elephants get to roam free anymore? Where all the fucking animals? Um, if there was odd a billion people on the planet, I would think that cannibalism would slowly start to become legal. They would have a Beta of farm people or stock people, that's what they'd call them. And they would be simply be, um, used for food, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:07:24       We just, you know, and of course it would be, uh, you know, the evil white man would decide who it is that gets eaten first. You know, baby, they'd start with like the pygmies or something like that because it'd be like, all right, well, you know, they're a, they are of a particular race, but they're not as tall as most people in that race. So, you know, there's sort of bite size, little like sliders, right? Sliders. They like, she would sliders, you know, get a little honey bun, you know, stick a fucking ankle between the two. Right. Why would you do an ankle, ankle meet? Um, so anyways, I've, I still feel fucked up from the rose bowl man. I still, you know, I barely got any sleep with Paul being out here. And then we also performed New Year's Eve, uh, down the Orpheum. And I bought this suit to wear New Year's Eve. I found it like over the summertime it was this all white suit.

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:08:18       Jacket and pants. But you know, from, from a distance it reads all white, but when you come up to it, it had these tiny black polka dots, you know what I mean? Just tiny. And uh, I walked into the store and it was on like the fucking 70% off rack because it's really one of those things like, where the fuck are you ever gonna wear that? And I saw, I was like, that's a perfect suit for fucking new year's. You put the black fucking solid black shirt underneath. They were little black pocket square, right? And your walk out, they're like John Travolta. But I bet book [inaudible] you can tell by the way I tell jokes, I'm a fucking act. No time for originality. I'm sorry. She fucking shit jokes. Fucking the jokes. I don't like to use concepts. I know. Anyways. So that was once again me standing to the side of the stage going like a, I am either go that people either going to like this suit or I'm going to get heckled the entire time I'm out here.

Speaker 2:          00:09:18       But either way, either way it's gonna add to the fucking show. But, uh, as I predicted it was new year's, I addressed the suit. I said this is the only night I could wear it. And people left and it was a, uh, it was a great fucking time. Great old theater. And uh, I had a bunch of people come out, um, a bunch of friends, you know, people I hadn't seen in a couple of years. People that you know, kind of in my life. It was awesome, man. I love doing new year's out here in La Cause uh, I don't have to travel or anything like that. And I get to do the job I love to do. However, I think that's the last New Year's Eve I'll do. I think I'll do like the 30th next time because I gotta tell ya the second show ends right. By the way, I had to do the countdown on like two jokes before my closing joke.

Speaker 2:          00:10:06       I was like halfway through this one pit that I'd been trying to work on. I kept fucking up the ending and I was going to try a new ending to it because the ending was too sad for every fucking city in this nation other than Dallas, Texas, Dallas, Texas. Fucking enjoy the shit out of the original ending. Um, and I'm right in the middle of that bit and I see that it's 1159. So then I had to get out of the pit, take a pause, and then do the countdown, and then the streamers came out. Right. Lovely. Nia came out on stage, gave me a kiss. All the guys came, you know, we fucking waves and everything and then everybody gets off the stage and then I had to go back into my act, which was uh, uh, I dunno, it just ended up being funny because it was really weird.

Speaker 2:          00:10:47       So anyways, um, we ended up doing the show and then as we leave, um, we're stuck in this brutal traffic. I'm like, what the fuck? There must've been some going on cause we went downtown La, that must have been something going on, um, down at like la live or some shit down there that's right near the staples center. And then I fucking realized the next day it was motley crew's final show ever at the staple center. And um, so I was like, ah, fuck, that's the traffic we get stuck in. And there's actually a clip up on youtube of, you know, Tommy Lee, the drummer does, he has a whole fucking rollercoaster attached to his drum kit where it turns upside down and it goes out over the crowd and then comes back and all that shit. I mean the right there alone. You know, if you're the other members in the band, you gotta be like, dude, this better be fucking worth it because the amount of money that's coming out of our checks to fucking carry that rig out on the fucking road. You know what I mean? That's one of those overhead costs. So I don't know if you guys have seen the video. It's their last fucking show ever and the thing gets stuck. It gets stuck and Tommy is upside down on this thing in this roadie scamper and up the side of it, like the fucking apes and plan into the apes when they were on the Golden Gate Bridge right there. Scampering up the side of this thing and Tommy is just upside down like, what the fuck man?

Speaker 2:          00:12:23       The fuck it digs busted. He's like, hey la. He's like, what? You look, you look at it too soon when I'm hanging upside down in Los Angeles and he's just hanging upside down. It's the most excrutiatingly uncomfortable thing I've seen her perform. I have to go through in a long time. He did. What the fuck he could do. I mean, once you just go, well, fuck the role of coach to her man, and you're still lagging upside down. I mean, what do you do? It's just fucking brutal in the fact that it happened on the very last show. You know, I don't want to start any infighting. I know the band doesn't exist anymore, but I think Vince Neil did it. I think the lead singer probably all these years, you know, he's used to being out front and all the chicks digging them, you know, walking around with his Barbie hair and all that.

Speaker 2:          00:13:15       And then all the drama goes all the way out over the crowd and everybody's looking at him and maybe he got sick of it after all these years. The amount of money that was coming out of his paycheck to bring that fucking loopty loop roller coaster with the fucking drum kit in it. And he probably went, probably said, hey, everybody look at that over there. And then he just pulled a fuse. Uh, that doesn't make any sense, Bill. Then he sabotaging his own show. Wow. You know, I can have a fucking theory, somebody could just email me with no fucking links or anything whatsoever and just tell me that the earth can sustain 100 billion people anyways. So we, uh, we're stuck in that traffic. I didn't get home until like a one 31 45, fell asleep around two and then I had to be up at 10 if 10 after five to then be outside for the next 13 hours at the, uh, at the rose bowl this year we brought eight people and um,

Speaker 1:          00:14:14       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:15       One of my buddies who went there, he just called it the goon parade and I gotta be honest with you. Uh, that's kind of what we were, I don't remember so much of it. I remember the whole game cause I just stopped drinking cause I had to drive. So I just remember walking to the stadium and after that I remember the entire fucking game. Um, so I'll take you through what I remember. So we fucking get there, right? First time ever. We get this so fucking early. They haven't even opened the gates yet. So when we finally get in, we're parked outside the VIP parking. I mean we had like a five minute walk to the stadium was fucking tremendous. And uh, I remember Barton, nick given me a Miller high life, the big grin on his face, cause we always had the Miller high life to start the day law had got his fucking law.

Speaker 2:          00:15:09       I had made it by the way he made it, you know, I'll never smile again. Um, he made it and uh, he got all three of his fires going and getting ready for the breakfast sandwiches. And I want to say that I waited till after I had law heads. Unbelievable breakfast sandwiches. The best breakfast sandwich I have every fucking year is that one. And it was absolutely delicious. And my favorite thing was looking over at firs, he, after he was two bites in and I was like, Hey Paul, I go, how's that breakfast sandwich? And he just fucking shot me. He look like, are you fucking kidding me? So I was already site and I knew he was going to have a great time. And, um, after that it was like, Hey, I'm like, who wants a heater? Everybody's like, yeah, right. So he poured like fucking eight of them and I had these, these, those big square ice cubes.

Speaker 2:          00:15:59       I had made those and brought him over in a ziplock bag, like a fucking, you know, kilo a coke. So I drop him into everybody's Plastic Cup in this so big, they don't make it all the way down to the bottom of the glass. So the booze is actually below the ice level and everybody's laughing. I'm like, well, you just got to fucking, he got to pull more bows in there and yet he put your hand over the ice cube and it'll melt down. And that became the technique. And then after that it just became like a slide shelf just to stuff. I remember, I remember a partner does this thing every year he gets off the dino gets out of the truck and he just screams at the top of his lungs. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the grand daddy of a ball. And everybody's always terrified, sort of laughing, whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:16:48       So these Iowa fans, somebody just said, oh, we do not need that voice here. And immediately we're not liking us. And uh, I dunno. I think that for whatever reason, they were really, they were like, I want to say older than me, but I'm pretty fucking old at this point. I'm 47 I think they were in their 50s and for whatever reason they were playing Drake. All right. And it was like fucking seven in the morning and their fucking music was louder than our music. So we're sitting there, the sun hasn't even come up yet and we'll listen to, you used to call me on your cell phone, you'll use to you. You too. And it's just was fucking, we're doing like, oh God. I think me playing that fucking song, like that song is like, that's like, there's a few songs that get played so much that you never need to hear them again.

Speaker 2:          00:17:41       I think the original song was in the mood binding. Benny Goodman, who was a Glenn Miller Dad at, at dead dead dead [inaudible] too. But I bet I never need to hear that song ever again. Right. I'd say book ending for way back in the day to fucking right now it goes in the mood. Glenn Miller and then a cell phone by Drake. I know it can only mean one thing. Oh, he's such a bitch in that fucking song. It's basically, hey, I used to just fuck you. I use to, I use you and any she moves away and then he's upset that the woman got on with the life.

Speaker 1:          00:18:29       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:18:29       You know what a fucking he's is he one of those possessive guys who wants, he fucks something and he feels like he owns it for the rest of his life. Let it go dude. All you were doing was fucking, or now what? Now you want her because she's not there anymore to come over and lick your balls and shape up your beard afterwards. I mean fucking move on with your life. Drake. Yo Yo yo yo Yo yo shit. That's fucking going on. And all I know. And they were annoyed with how loud Bart Nick yelled. So I don't know what happens. Somewhere between the beer that shot and a breakfast sandwich. I glance over and the older guy is chirping and fucking Bart, Nick's ear and Bart. Nick is just staring straight ahead, 600 yard stare, just standing there and I see the guy talk and talk and talking and then I just see Joe just shrug his shoulders and be like, well, you know, I don't like your music.

Speaker 2:          00:19:34       And I gotta be honest with you fucking, I don't know what else he said. But 10 minutes later those people were just gone and we never saw them again. I don't know if they had like some VIP fucking, you know, Iowa Hawkeye fucking barbecue thing, that tent that they would go into. I have no idea. But we would die and laugh and they had one conversation with Joe, like the heck do you mind keeping it down a little bit? And Joe just gave him the death fucking, you know, the 600 yard stare and uh, that was it. They just fucking left. So that problem was solved. And we would throw in the football around [inaudible] I remembered everything but forgot the bacon and uh, what's his face like? I was able to call an audible and he had some bison meat or something like that and Bacon Grease figure that one out. I don't know how the fuck he did it, but um,

Speaker 1:          00:20:27       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:27       Yeah. And everything was going great and I was throwing the football around and then at some point I was just so fucking hammered that I fell down and I was one of those drunk falls where it took me like 17 I started falling and it took like 17 seconds for me to fall. And the entire time I was saying, I'm sorry, uh, it's now known yet it's now known as the, I'm sorry, fall. And it took me so long to fall that just about everybody at the tailgates site. And uh, I think if what I happened was I was standing, well, I had had this tent, you know, one of those four posted 10 things. I was standing underneath it. And unbeknownst to me was right behind me was my cooler and all the other coolers and all the bags of groceries sort of sprinkled out.

Speaker 2:          00:21:18       Right. And I was talking and I did an about face to start walking and immediately tripped over the first cooler. All right. And as I was trying to get my leg to an open area without stepping on hamburger buns, I just, you know, there wasn't any space to put my feet down and I was doing like, it was almost like a wide receiver after they catch a football and they tried to stay in bounds a dance down the sidelines. I was doing that, but in between condiments and food and shit like that. And I just, I never regained my balance, but I didn't go down full of, I swear to God, if it was probably real time was probably like a 42nd fall, but that's a long time, you know, if you just fall, Bam, you're on the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:22:05       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:22:06       You know, in under a second. Right. I would think depending less, you're really short and you get there a little quicker. So I just kept going. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And right is like my buddy Nate came over to try and stop me from falling. I just, I fucking landed on my back and I twisted my left knee and I hear the whole place laughing and I was laughing evidently my last step, I stepped in some avocado and slipped on that and I just fucking went down like just thud right on my back. I landed like a wrestler so it didn't even hurt where it was just my entire backside hit the ground at the same time. And um, I remember talking about it later and I was like, yeah, but I didn't spill my drink. I didn't spill my drink. And everybody's like, yeah, you did. You did. You spilled it all with the front of your jacket. So, um,

Speaker 1:          00:22:56       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:57       Then I remember getting up the apple pies out. Why? Remember the brisket and the ribs being done and those were delicious. Lai had killing it as always. And then, um, I think I smoked a cigar next. Yeah, I smoked a cigar and then we had the apple pies and everybody freaked out and they loved them. And then I was, yeah. Then I smoked a cigar and I was like, all right, I gotta fucking sober up here because, uh, it's six hours, the game will be over and we'll be done. And then I gotta drive. So, um, oh fuck. Hang on a second. Hang on.

Speaker 1:          00:23:32       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:23:32       All right. I'm back. Sorry about that. Had blew my fucking nose. So anyway, so let me get into the A, we get into the game and I still don't know his fucking name because I was hammered. Um, the Ronnie back for Stanford just was right as we got to the stadium. You already ran for a touchdown and then it was just like, it was like a fucking Hollywood movie. They couldn't stop this kid. The kid even had another one. He ran like 70 yards for a touchdown. They had to bring it back. They just couldn't fucking get the kid down. Um, and before you knew it, it was like 28 to nothing, 28 to nothing. Then it was 35 to nothing. And W we still had like half, half of the second quarter that the fucking gay was just over. It still was the worst rose bowl game as far as being competitive that I'd been to slash the greatest individual performance I've ever seen.

Speaker 2:          00:24:26       We got to see that kid. He set the record for the most all purpose yards ever in a rose bowl. Um, and this is the granddaddy of a malts. The original roles, uh, the original, uh, I guess bull game, um, even though the Yale Bulls, the original bull stadium figured that one out anyways. Um, so we got to see that. And fortunately during halftime I didn't have to watch the Stanford band. Um, which by the way, it's just, I mean, could you, could they be more of a bunch of hipsters? The whole their whole thing. It's like they're mocking the halftime show yet, not showing how you could improve it. So there's like no risk. You just sort of mocking the whole fucking thing. Like, which is to me, classic hipster behavior. Uh, to me that's the difference between nerds and hipsters. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:25:20       It's like, alright, so you think what the, the standard way that a halftime show is done is too rigid. So you guys are gonna be, I just hate how the whole thing is done. Oh, these guys are crazy. Oh, look at the guy with the fucking rainbow wig play in the drum. Oh, what's he gonna do? I'll think it's fucking dumb. And then I just thought it was a badly made California look bad when they made fun of the Iowa people with the whole, uh, you know, farmers only. And once again, I don't know, I don't know anybody in the Stanford band, but it just seems like that classic, I live near an ocean, therefore I'm smarter than you. There's something about people live on the coast with their whole attitude towards the middle of the country's, the funniest fucking thing ever to me. Like fly overstate and Blahblahblahblahblah and all that.

Speaker 2:          00:26:04       It's like those fucking people that you sit there and making fun of, you know, like farmers old, hey, where'd you go Dan? Go Fuck your sister. It's like, you mean the people who grow the food supply for this country? You fucking dope. What are you doing that with the flute? Oh, look at the cool kid with the clarinet. I Dunno. I thought it was a hacky joke and um, I dunno, you know what I mean? Look, if you guys look, you know, just decided to trash one another, then it would be funny, but it just kind of comes off like a, it's like when Ricky Gervais' does that shit at the golden clubs, you know what I mean? He hires his staff or writers to write roast jokes aimed at people who showed up with acceptance speeches and it's just, Ah, gee, did you win that one?

Speaker 2:          00:26:47       What are you going to do next? Slap an ice cream out of a five-year-old hand. I just, I dunno. It's the same thing with that. I thought it was douchey behavior, but fortunately I missed all of it, you know? And yeah, he came out with the paper, we shake cow, it'll be epic. Ah, kill yourselves. It'd be one thing if Stanford Everly actually put on a good halftime show, like, wow, this band is next level. I get why they're trying to break the whole fucking format of it. But if you actually watch a, the competitions of the best fucking college bands out there, they're fucking drumlines alone

Speaker 2:          00:27:25       would destroy anyone in that band. So, uh, you know, I dunno, every once in awhile I'm a fucking conservative and I'm a conservative on that. What do I just say? Yeah, you get kind of fucking made an assay yourself. But anyways, and I just hate the deliberately bad dancing that they do. I think if you gonna to mock dancing, you should be able to dance wealth, you know, to just suck at it and then be like making fun of it. Then you just fucking like, all right. Yeah. Yeah. It just like we thought, yeah, you don't have any talent.

Speaker 1:          00:27:56       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:27:57       Fuck the Stanford band. I love the football program now. Anyways. Uh, so while all of that was going on, all that, that fucking nauseated hipster behavior, uh, the looks on their faces, like everyone in the crowd is like, their mind is blown. Like, oh my God, what's going on? It's the fuck you're in the band.

Speaker 1:          00:28:22       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:28:22       You play in the fucking triangle out there. You're not a rebel. You're not freaking anybody out.

Speaker 1:          00:28:30       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:28:31       so anyways, uh, we actually went out to the concession stand and, um, you know, just standing the whole fucking halftime. We're standing in this, in this, in this line, and we actually missed the first three minutes of the, uh, the third quarter and I'm standing in this line, Comedian Sean Coyne from Philly. He's fucking Hilarious, right? So we get all the way up there and, uh, I ordered a pretzel and a water and he ordered a pretzel and something else. And, uh, I'm fucking common around. He's still drinking, you know, he doesn't have to drive, so he's still fucking drinking during the game and they hand him the Pretzel and he proceeds after we waited a half an hour for a food, she hands him the Pretzel. They fucking just fumbled it. It was like a bad exchange between the quarterback and the running back. You know, they like bump into each other.

Speaker 2:          00:29:23       The dude never quite has the ball. He never quite had the pretzel and it just goes end over end in like slow motion and falls salts side down onto the concrete where everybody's standing. He immediately bends down and picks it up. And I'm looking at him and he just goes, he's, I, yeah, it's all right. It's all right. I'm like, dude, you gotta give that think back. And he's like, not sorry. It's all right. He doesn't give a fuck. So I'm dying laugh. Like this guy's a maniac. He's like people walking in and out our restrooms and then coming over to his standard and there's food money out of your fucking mind. But I'm still kind of drunk. So then I go over, we were putting mustard on the pretzel and then out of nowhere fucking lie ed shows up. And he asked, he had Sean for the piece of his Pretzel and he gave it.

Speaker 2:          00:30:08       So I almost fucking faked it. I was laughing. So hard fuck thing was on the ground. I was like, it was like watching a poison of light. I couldn't say anything. I was laughing so fucking hard. So, uh, don't we get, we finally get back into the, uh, finally get back into the, um, the stadium and then just the whole game just stopped. I mean there was barely any scoring. Iowa came back and scored a couple. Um, I was psyched for Versie cause he, uh, he went to Betsy, but you bet Stanford. And then in the next half a bet the ovary won both of them. So he picked up a buck 50 or something like that. And um, I dunno. Then we just ended up going back. The game was over and then we went back to, uh, the truck. We were hanging out, we got the bonfire going, the sun was down and in the middle of having a bonfire, all of a sudden this kid comes walking by with another friend, this Iowa Kid.

Speaker 2:          00:31:15       And he just goes, he just goes, hey. He goes, Hey ted. Bonfire's illegal. He can't have it. It's illegal. And right as he was by Raby like go like, ha ha ha, I'm just fucking around the Philly guy. And he goes, Hey, shut the fuck up. You fucking Blah, blah, blah. Right. And then the kid fucking puffs up his chest. There's like 10 of us sitting here. This kid was like, he was like five, six, five, seven. He comes running up talk and all this shit and I'm just sitting there looking at him like, it's fucking 10 of us here, you know, do you have an oozy? Like what? What are you doing? Right? So he gets into it, there's back and forth and next thing you know, versus over there and it looks like furs. He's about ready to square off with the guy because the guy kept walking away but like, all right, all right, whatever, whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:32:07       And He'd be like, Oh, fun, fun, fun. Who Fuck you. Because we'd always had the last thing and then we'd be like, fuck you. And it just kept going back and forth and back and forth. Then finally, the guy's like 30 yards away versus he's talking to them and I thought like, oh, this kid's going to soccer room. So I got up over there and go, relax, relax, relax. And then all of a sudden I hear a bottle break in this fucking maniac Philly guy, right fucking place the ball. That's the funniest thing ever. He breaks the bottle on the pavement. He fucking, he did it way too hard. When he brought his hand up, there was no bottle left. He just chatted the fucking thing. But then he like my him, like he still had the bottle in his end and this is the best part, the Iowa kid talking shit, never fledged.

Speaker 2:          00:32:56       So now he's pretended he had a bottle in his end. I didn't even know what he was going to do. It was like a fucking movie. It's like, what the fuck? Right. So the dude finally goes away as to yell a few more fucking things and um, it was so ridiculous. Then we went back and we, we was sitting around and all we did for the rest of the time there was make fun of Sean and how there was no bottle left and he actually cut his hand and we all just sit in, go and like, do, what were you going to do? What? He's like, I don't know. I don't know what I always wanted to do that. It was just, it's fucking ridiculous. So, um, and by then, you know, actually as I was coming out of the game, I, I was, I was so sober, I had already gotten into the fucking hangover.

Speaker 2:          00:33:42       So I just started drinking waters and um, then had another two hot dogs and a hamburger and I got to tell you dude, my body was like, what the fuck? And I just drove home like with a splitting fucking headache, stone sober, splitting, fucking headache. And um, and then by then my knee was killing me and I was walking like I had just ridden a horse from here to fucking Massachusetts and I was, I was shot. I came home and I just fucking, just pounded like three waters. And that was, it was during that time where I was just thinking to myself like, I'm never going to that game again. I fucking, you know, when you're out three to six weeks with a fucking knee strain, cause you went to a tailgate, you really got to start like looking back, going like, what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          00:34:39       But it happened to me again this year, you know, every year I go, you know, I'm going to go a little easy. Gonna go easy. I want to remember as much of this tailgate as I can. Like I passed out for like an hour of it and it popped. Part of it was the alcohol, but the other part was just like I had only gotten three hours sleep. You know, there's only so far you can go when you start the day off with a male. All right, let me, um, but it was one of one of the best, uh, one of the best fucking tailgates and I loved hanging with fucking, uh, all the new people that came along and I am now of course obsessed with the Philly accent. It's the funniest fucking accent. You get a beard. Big Easel. Everything's at John. Um, alright. Hang on a second. All right, cool.

Mercifully, that's the last bit of reading I have to do here for the fucking week. Um, all right. And with that, let's get to uh, oh. Can we talk a little f NFL football for us and what dad? Dad, dad [inaudible] booted. I would say the Patriots in Seattle entered the playoffs the exact opposite way. I'm going to go out on a limb. A the patriots just could not get anything going offensively. Um, our offensive line is just, uh, it's, it's, it's fucking shattered, dude. We got nobody left and every time Brady went to pass, there was someone in the back field. Um, a defense did great though. I mean it was holding him to like 10 points for most of the fucking game, but um, hopefully we can get healthy or I don't, I don't see us going too deep into the playoffs this year. Seattle on the other 10. Huh.

Speaker 3:          00:41:28       Now, this is the wildcard t nobody wants to play.

Speaker 2:          00:41:32       Put your got ask yourself are they peaking to early Seattle look like world beaters and the way that they handled the fucking cardinals yesterday they made them, I mean I don't know if the cardinal started to come back or not. I mean I watched the first fucking half and it looked like an NFL team playing a CFL team. Let me check out the final score here. Um, I mean I think it's just another phenomenal coaching job by Pete Carroll. Um, and he's got like, he's got him right about 36 to six. Yeah. They just destroyed them scoring it. We'll do an evidence, whatever the fuck they wanted. You know, Arizona special teams would look at like shit, that field goal kicker and MacTech couple of extra points. I don't know what the fuck was going on with them and they couldn't tackle anybody on punch or kickoffs. The only question mark I saw with Seattle was there a kicker missed another one and Richard Sherman's hair. That's the only thing I've found. That's the second time this year. Sherman has been brought down by his hair. Um, to the point they actually thought it was a facemask. He went down so fucking his head went down. Uh, but other than that, uh, I was, I was the guy, you know, a couple of weeks ago I was thinking like, you know, Arizona and a Carolina now I think it's a,

Speaker 2:          00:42:58       a Carolina is would play Seattle at home, but I got to tell you, Seattle doesn't give a fuck. They've been there the last two years in a row. Um, if they wouldn't again this year, a lot of people are going to be like, oh, they do one play away for winning it three times in a row. That's absolute bullshit. That's absolute bullshit. Um, you went to in a row, if you win the fucking thing, it changes. It changes your vibe, you know, defending versus bad tastes in your mouth. You know what I mean? Yeah. How long do you think Pete Carol's was able to actually get eight hours sleep after that super bowl? Like the drive that he's had to get back because that they fucked that thing up. Slash Malcolm Butler may one of the greatest defensive plays of all time, like battle. You know, there's a reason why nobody's ever won three in a row.

Speaker 2:          00:43:50       It's, you know, it's hard to stay that fucking motivated, I think anyways. Um, and I know watching the Patriots when the defending Super Bowl champions, for instance, just being the Patriots, which is bad enough, people want to beat you bad enough, but when you're the defending Superbowl champion, even that shit teams try hard against you. Um, but anyways, having said all that, um, you know, the way Seattle's played over the last month in that last game, like they look like fucking world beaters. Um, so, and us, I dunno if we could beat the Broncos at this point with how fucking injured we are, even with their, uh, their quarterback. I though it was hard to see Peyton manning be a backup man, but he took it like a gentleman. Um, I wonder if that was his last game. I wonder. I wonder. I wonder. All right, let's get to, uh, let's get to the fucking questions here for this week.

Speaker 2:          00:44:45       Right. And by the way, um, for all the Canadian fans, I'm not ducking the fact that you guys destroyed us in that game. I just haven't seen it yet. I started to watch it yesterday and after all the Hoopla and all of that shit, I got like a minute and a half in the game and they already scored. I was just like, oh man. I think the final was five to one. So congratulations to Yukon. But um, oh, I gotta fix my cooler to my cooler. It took a beating. Both hinges. What? Broken as the interior strap. Thank thankfully. Uh, Igloo makes a repair kit night. You know, it's obviously an easy repair. I gotta get that fucking taken care of this week, uh, that, that fucking coolest bend to every Rosebowl. I got to fix it up here. Who knows? Maybe when I fell on the one that knocked the fucking lid off the thing.

Speaker 2:          00:45:32       All right, breakfast. Here we go. There's no way I did 45 minutes. Jesus Christ. It's flame. I all right. Breakfast bill. I'm a father of two young children and I hold a nine to five corporate job. Don't feel bad for me though. I love my job. That's awesome. I want you to love your job. And he goes, and I don't bitch about how hard it is to be a parent. Uh, he goes, I maintain a decent diet. I was a college athlete, so I have a basic understanding of the human body. Granted you and I spend our mornings differently. I freeze my ass off every morning for five to six months of the year. Uh, I was wondering what you do for breakfast every morning? I don't know. What do you mean you freeze your ass off? What do you do? Oh, UK guys. I'm wondering what you do for breakfast setting every morning.

Speaker 2:          00:46:18       And then he goes on to say, I'm always on the go and I'm not hungry right when I leave for work, uh, which leads me in the car and at the office for the rest of the morning. Not a lot of options. Uh, beyond a banana and a coffee. It's too cold for smoothies. What's Amanda do? What's your morning food routine? Well when I'm being smart, I have two eggs over easy and I have some oatmeal with a, a banana, maybe some blueberries. I don't have any a bread or any of that stuff. And then between breakfast and lunch I have an apple. And then for lunch I have Turkey slices with the side salad. And then at four o'clock I have a meat with a protein in six o'clock meet with the protein and a meet with the protein of a protein with vegetables to fuck my brain is shot here.

Speaker 2:          00:47:11       I have, yeah, I have a protein with some vegetables. They meet with the protein and then I have a bread with some carbs. Um, that's what I ended up doing. And then I just, I stopped beating around six, five, six is when I had my last meal. And then I just drink waters after that. If I get really hungry, I just have celery with peanut butter and I got to get back to that diet because I've been cooking up a fucking storm, bacon and all that type of stuff. Um, and I have three goals this month. I'm gonna make a quiche. I'm gonna make a fucking Lasagna and I'm going to make this hunter's chicken. The last two are Mario Batali recipes and a Dodgers chicken. Isn't that bad? The fucking, um, the LASAGNA is pretty bad, but there's veal in it and I just can't, I can't get myself to eat lobster or veal. I just, just what the fuck they go through. I mean, I know the chickens and cows already have a bad enough thing, but like, it just seems extra fucking cruel. Boiling something alive and having something just sit in a fucking cage forever so it's softer and tastes better when you eat. It's just, it's fucking brutal.

Speaker 1:          00:48:21       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:48:23       anyways. All right, so what's my morning routine? Yeah, well, if I was you and I had tea, I would eat, I would get up, I wouldn't make the time and I would at least just have some oatmeal.

Speaker 1:          00:48:34       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:48:36       Amanda, but I don't have kids. I mean, I just hear you guys talking about having kids. Makes me glad I don't have any. I mean, it just seems so fucking right.

Speaker 1:          00:48:45       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:48:46       just never ending. Never ending. Um, I dunno. So I will, I will. What do you do for breakfast? All right. I told you I did the whole day.

Speaker 1:          00:48:58       Um, [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:49:00       yeah, if I was you, I would, you have to make the time. I would definitely say that you got to make the time and uh, I think the best thing for working out is you do it in the morning and you just get it out of the way and then you have a healthy breakfast and that gets you on the right track to start the day to start off the day. If you're eating bad and then try to be like, well, don't worry, I'm going to go to the gym later. The problem is with bad food is it chemically fucks your body and it makes you just want to lay down and do nothing. So if you start today, I dunno, just do that. That the tense about, I was telling you guys about the tents start off as like a 10 jumping jacks, 10 burpees, 10 pushups, 10 alternating lunges, 10 sit ups.

Speaker 2:          00:49:44       I forget the fucking order. I haven't done it, but you can, you can look it up on the Internet and find it and uh, and you go from 10 and then you do nine jumping jacks, nine burpees, nine pushups, nine setups, nine alternate leg jumps, nine squat jumps. And then you do eight and you go all the way down to one and then you're, you know, you pretty much winded. And then if you want to add a little more cardio to it, skip, skip rope for around a two or three or whatever you want to fucking do. A, I could do that workout in like a hotel room. Um, but that's what I would do. I would do something like that and that would just make sure, you know also if you really don't have time to work out, but it really help you during the day is to bring an apple and to pack a healthy lunch also saves you money. Also gives you more of a lunch hour cause you're not driving to and from wherever the fuck you go. And you go right down to the cafeteria, you knock it out, you chill the fuck out, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:50:37       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:50:37       You have something healthy in your afternoon break. And that's the biggest thing, dude. If you're not putting mistakes into your fucking mouth, you're going to get more results from your workout and you, you know, you've closed and start fitting better. And the same way you get addicted to eating bad salt, sugar, salt, sugar, you can get addicted to eating well. Uh, which where is not where I'm at right now. Um, all right, one trick pony. Uh, hey Billy balls. Uh, my wife loves you. Pie crust video. Oh, by the way, you know, I tried a lot in my, um, for my cross for the first time and it was a total game changer. The best crus I ever made. It did feel weird to smell bacon as I was making the pie crust. But um,

Speaker 1:          00:51:22       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:24       Um, uh, thank you to everybody that suggested that who, you know, the, your, your critique really helped my pie crust. Thank you. Um, all right. So anyways, this person says she's a fan of yours as well. He loved the pie crust video. She's a fan of you as well and it's been exposed to hours of your podcast. She likes you, Bill. Let me lead with that. Well here comes to big fucking slap in the face, but of course like all great women, she still has a capacity to chop a man down at the knees. After the video, I casually said, can't wait for the next one. She responded in an Oh sweetie tone with ha ha. Well, how many of these tricks do you think he has up his sleeve? This resulted in a long discussion where I defended your potential skills and she went with the, I love bill burr.

Speaker 2:          00:52:11       I'm just assuming he doesn't have much more to rival this pie crust. Uh, whether you can make a full series out of these videos or not, can you please explain to my wife that you're not a one trick pony? And even if you are a one trick pony, it's bullshit and unfair to assume this much. Ah, thanks. Come back to Wisconsin. Home of corruption as seen in documentaries. Um, well, you know something. As you get older, prism, man, you understand where that's coming from. Why your wife, as you said, like all great women always have to take you out of the knees what it is. As much as you gotta stop internalizing that and taking it personally, what it is is that's, it's almost like a subconscious fear thing that they have. You know what I mean? Like when they don't know you and they see you doing something, they have a positive reaction to a co, oh look, he can make a pie cross.

Speaker 2:          00:53:09       I bet he's going to be a great dad. Right? They think shit like that. But after they get with you and then they love you and they don't want to lose you when they see you continuing to grow as a person, they, it's, I can't even, this is a female thing. This is like a, uh, thing in general that people do in relationships is you actually hold back the person you love because you see them expanding on who they are and because it's something new and different and moves in a different direction, I think subconsciously a certain type of person feels insecure so then they, they have to tether it to the ground with fucking, uh, criticism rather than encouraging the person. So I think that that's where it's coming from. But um, as far as addressing it, like I will just say this as far as my cooking and baking, like you don't just know how to make corn flakes and you can also make a pie crust, you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:54:10       Knowing how to make a pie crust takes all of your shit to the next level. Okay. Like, no, like, no this because I can do that. Like back in the day, I used to look at like making like a quiche or something like that going, oh my God, that's fucking impossible. The cross the loan or making a Turkey pot pie or anything that involves having a crust. Um, you can add that I recently have learned how to smoke meat. You know, I smoked ribs. Uh, I can make all of my, my, my mother before we, when we all moved out, she wrote out all of her recipes, hand wrote them all out on cards and we have all of them and we can all cook the meals that she made when we were growing up. Like, I can make you a Hungarian Goulash and you know what else I can make the fucking noodles from scratch.

Speaker 2:          00:54:58       I took a pasta making class, you know, as you suspected, sir, your wife has no idea what the fuck she's talking about. What it really was. It was coming from a place of insecurity and jealousy. And right now she's going to roll her eyes and be like, oh my God, the Blah Blah Blah. It's fucking true. You know? Cause that's really just like a, just like to have like that, that Oh sweetie tone, you know, they do that shit. You know, you go out, you start looking a little too good, you get a new new suit, right. You look in a little bit. They got a fucking, they got, they got to make a comment. They fucking do it with each other. It's hilarious. I think that's one of the main reasons that's fucking them up by the way. You know? And they always talk about the wage gap and all that.

Speaker 2:          00:55:43       One of the biggest problems with the wage gap is not men. It's the fact that women don't get together and create businesses enough. They just don't do it cause they're too busy going look at this bitch and fucking look at her. She's too fucking skinny. She needs the eat something. She's got on too much fuck out. She knows what she's doing. You know, they don't work well together. I don't know why, but that's not our fault. I'm sure it is though. If you watch the video, I'm sure they could spin it around to us. So, um, yes sir. I actually absolutely love cooking and um, it isn't the only trick I have up my sleeve. Um, I could obviously make more of those. But the thing about it was, was that was the specific skill it was for the holidays. And people have suggested, well, why don't you do one on how to smoke meat or why don't you do one about making positive from scratch?

Speaker 2:          00:56:36       My thing is because you could watch Mario Batali do it, you can watch champion smokers do it. So I guess what makes mine different is that I make it funny. You know, I just looked at it as a one fucking random thing that I was going to do, but you know, now that she's been a douche about it, you know what, I'll make another one at some point I guess. Um, I'll, let's see. What the fuck will I do? The Turkey pot pie on the big green egg. I mean, I've watched you two videos of all of those. I just did a really saw somebody do like, is there a pie cross video? I don't know. I just thought it'd be fun. I literally feel like I'm in a relationship or right now I have, I'm sorry that that video annoying.

Speaker 2:          00:57:21       Okay. Oh God, that's so fucking moody. Uh, yeah, I will, I will figure out something else. Um, to make one of those. I'll do like one a year. Well, it's actually given me some ideas like maybe I'll do one. Oh, the summer's coming. All right. You're going to show up to 4th of July as a quick fucking thing you can make. You know what? Maybe I'll do it. Maybe I'll do it. I just don't like committing to shit like that. I love not having a job, which is why I'm a fucking comedian. I've really enjoyed this whole, I work when I want to rather than it being okay, we need 20 episodes of this. All right. Thursday afternoon podcast got me laid bill. Oh, something positive. Oh John, do you really think he could get somebody else laid fucking disease? Um, it's probably why we die eight years earlier just because they just won't give it up.

Speaker 2:          00:58:09       But if you get yourself out in front of it next time you wife does that to you, sir. Next time she takes you out at the knees, just come up to her and stroke the side of her face. You know when you, when you go out and get a new car and you say, oh honey, don't you think you're a little bit old for that car? You know, does one of those things makes you feel stupid? Right? Just walk up stroke the side of her face if has golf, sweetie, don't worry. I'm not going to leave you. It's okay. Nah, it's okay. Okay. I know I look it in the car. I'm sorry. Something like that. Some creepy. All right bill, last week on New Year's Eve, my wife and I listened to your podcast after we put the kids to bed, we drank wine and laughed our asses off.

Speaker 2:          00:58:53       That's great. This woke us up energized us. Just as the throwback clip came on, it appeared that we may have sex during in the new year. Well Boyle boy, not more than a few notes into the outro song. We were going at it. It was all over just moments after the song ended, so maybe four minutes or so of ball dropping bliss. My Dick. Thanks you for the laughs and the soundtrack. Did you guys fuck to the me on the song? I don't think I needed to know that. Um, all right. Oh, here it is. There it is. This is the one I wanted to read. This is, this is amazing overpopulation myth bill, how you're doing and I'm just checking in on you a to inform you that if you go online and see for yourself how much arable Ara, B, l, e Farm Land and resources there actually is in the world. You'll see that there is enough to feed and home at least 100 billion people for approvable fact.

Speaker 1:          01:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:00:02       I Dunno what that sentence didn't make sense. Did you like voice Texas or did you actually, this is how you actually type out sentences. Person goes. So anytime you hear anyone say that 7 billion people is too many people, I'm there.

Speaker 1:          01:00:20       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:00:21       T H, e I. R either seriously misinformed and or too lazy to do some research or flat out lying through their teeth, like are so-called leaders in scientists must be, oh yeah, they gotta be lying because you're not, you can't even spell their right because within one to do two days of research, you can find studies that prove what I say. It's going to take me one to two days to find it on the Internet. This is fucking hilarious. Why don't your days to one to two days to research. You can find studies that prove what I say is true. Parentheses, at least 100 billion. Now I know you're in the business.

Speaker 1:          01:01:03       Oh,

Speaker 2:          01:01:06       waking the masses up just like the lake group. Great. Bill Hicks. No, I'm not. But do you realize how serious the situation is regarding the distraction and brainwashing as organized by big business and they're controlling family owners. So as great as, I think you and your comedy are mentioning, overpopulation, which is a complete myth, is doing them parentheses, big corporations and the [inaudible] on them, a big service and adding to the brainwashing. Anyway, Bill, I know you're a great man because of the subject you talk about during these shows, but please look for yourself and how much admirable arable farm land there is a, and consider the fact that all food grows completely for free.

Speaker 1:          01:01:51       Um,

Speaker 2:          01:01:51       wow. All right, well, I'll tell you this buddy. I know I'm a moron, so I just looked up. I looked at how many people can the earth sustain.

Speaker 1:          01:02:01       Um,

Speaker 2:          01:02:01       and it says a hundred people can. The earth support. So 10 billion people is the utmost population limit where food is concerned. That's the first one. The next one says more than 7 billion people currently on the planet compared to 3 billion in 1967. Then what does it say?

Speaker 1:          01:02:23       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:02:23       Oh, I'll just go on. It's a video. I don't want to watch that.

Speaker 1:          01:02:27       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:02:28       Current population is three times this sustainable level. That's a, the next article. Um, how many people can the earth sustain? I'll click on this one. I'm trying to find anything that says anything even remotely close to a hundred million. 100 billion. Here's a staggering stat. According to the United Nations, the world's current population is 7.2 billion is now up to 7.8 is projected to increase by 1 billion over the next 12 years, which would bring us to 9.6 billion by 2050 how can we sustain all these people on the planet or rather how many people can this plan to sustain? That is the question Alan Weisman explored in his latest book countdown our last best hope for a future on earth. Question Mark. Uh, Jesus Christ, a bunch of conversations, bunch of words. [inaudible] number. Where's the fucking number?

Speaker 1:          01:03:24       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:03:25       Alrighty. As the charter or it's kind of the next 50 years, we will need to produce as much food as it's ever been consumed for an entire human history. Well, that makes sense because there'll be the most people, there'll be the most farts ever in, in the history of human beings. Well, there's no fucking number there, sir. All I can tell you is, is if you see the environmental damage that 7.8 billion people did, if you're going to have 100 billion people, like,

Speaker 1:          01:03:53       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:03:54       I mean, at this point in Africa, there's barely any land for, for wild animals. It's all, it's all like for the most part down in the southern part of the country, uh, it's all like roped off.

Speaker 1:          01:04:08       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:04:09       It's finite. You know what I mean? They're completely surrounded. I'd have to say that I disagree and not just by your spelling, cause I couldn't read half the fucking words you said, even when you spelled them. Right. But yeah, no, there's no fucking way 100 billion people and there's any sort of animal life left that isn't stuck in a cage. You know what I mean? Um, and also in this last year I traveled to Singapore, Hong Kong in Mumbai, India. And I saw what that next level of population look like too. And I was breathing that air that's Singapore. Singapore was, was different. Um, but Hong Kong and Mumbai, India, you could almost taste the fucking air. And it was just, uh, it was just way too many fucking people. I can, I can tell you that there's no way 100 billion people. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:05:01       yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:05:02       And I don't understand why I need to look it up for one to two days. Why could you just send me a link? I would love for you to be right, but, uh, I'm going to go out on a limb and say you're not, I'm going to go with the scientists on this one. And also, this also sounds like, you know, when people denied global warming, not to get all political, but one political party adamantly denied it for years and years and years, and now they've decades and now they finally just go, yeah, we are causing climate change. But you know what? It's too late now. So I imagine that that's what's we're going to do out here. We have a fucking methane gas leak that's been going on, and I guess that's probably, it's like 10 times worse than carbon dioxide as far as getting put into the fucking, uh, atmosphere as far as heating it up and all that. We're completely fucked. We're fucked, we're absolutely fucked. Um, and selfishly I hope I, it doesn't happen by the end of my own life, which is the exact sort of thought process that got us into this mess to begin with. But sir, you're, you're correct in assuming that I'm a fucking dope and I don't know what I'm talking about, but uh,

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:06:09       I'm just kinda going with having traveled extensively, you know, for the last 20 years on the road and watching the population increase just in this country. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:06:24       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:06:24       It's a weird thing when the population keeps looking like it's sort of leveled off and I don't know if because there's no factories anymore. All I know is like I've, I used to be back in the day, if I jumped on the highway at two in the afternoon, I was good. And now everywhere I go there's like traffic. And I'm just looking at these people going like, you guys all stand up comics. Does everybody work the third shift? How the fuck are all these people out on the road? I didn't know what's going on. Do a lot of people work from home and they're all driving out to get a sandwich at that time. I don't know. You know what? Let me look up. I heard the u s population has kind of leveled off, which excited me. That's exciting to me. You know u s population.

Speaker 1:          01:07:05       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:07:07       Oh Jesus Christ. Still can you fucking population.

Speaker 1:          01:07:10       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:07:12       By year, let's do this. All right. Let's see what we got here. US population by year

Speaker 2:          01:07:20       a right? Let's go back to 1997 there was 2.726 5 million and now there's 322.0 7 million. So it's gone up by like 50 million. Is that enough to notice? Well that's actually, you know, that's significant, right? That's all I could, I could get 20% increase. I think I make it a point. All right, let's move on here. All right. A advice changing high schools. Dear Bill, I'm a freshman in high school and would like to know your perspective on my situation. I currently attended a performing arts high school and Major G in jazz studies. Oh, that's fucking cool. I enjoy it. And all, but this, uh, the first semester has passed. I found out that jazz is something I don't want to do in life rather than carry on for what the next three years of this major. I'd rather change and majored in something that would benefit me in the long run, especially if I want to attend big schools like Harvard.

Speaker 2:          01:08:23       A well, let's go ahead man. You tried something you've realized early on, you know, like it and he got enough strength to be like, I communicate. I don't want to do this. Anyone need something else? It's all good so far. Uh, the problem is that in leaving my current school, I could possibly devastate the bands I'm in. Ah, Jesus there came in an ego out of nowhere and also hurt some friends. My director has placed me in some good bands and I even get paid money for playing gay. I'll see you crushing it out. Phil Chow wrote to leave my director as he has put me in a position that many others would gladly take this question. It's been tearing me apart for a while. What do you think, Bill? Should I stay or should I go? Also, if I do decide to leave, do you think I should tell my friends and directors that I, that I am or should I just go out quietly?

Speaker 2:          01:09:11       I'm told you have to do in life. If what makes you happy. If you try to make other people happy, that's all you're gonna do when you're not going to be happy and then you're going to be miserable to be around. You're going to turn into a bitter person who didn't do what they wanted to do in life and no one wants to be around that guy. All right? So as much as it's gonna hurt them, uh, you gotta leave and you gotta tell them and you have to tell them why you're going to leave and just say, listen, I'm just not happy doing this. I understand that I'm lucky. And then a lot of people would kill to be in my position. So I feel that someone should at least be happy and be excited. You know, if we'll be people desire to be in my position and I'm occupying that position and I'm not happy, I'm doing an injustice to myself and one of you guys.

Speaker 2:          01:09:54       All right, I apologize. I'm sorry. And then that's it. And you know, and it's a great life lessons sometimes. You know, when you ask for what you want, people get hurt and uh, you know, I don't mean you physically have to hurt them, you know that bottom lip quivers a little bit. That's all I'm saying. Um, that's it. But don't go out quietly. Don't sneak out the back door. Be a man or woman about it and fucking, you know, be an adult. All right. That's it. And you should be commended for understanding that you don't like something and, and not just staying in it. All right. Book recommendations. All right. Hey Bill, I'm not to start off by blowing smoke up your ass, but f f F is for family is a phenomenal show as me cracking up nonstop. But I'd aggressed well, thank you.

Speaker 2:          01:10:39       I appreciate that. It gives me a chance to promote the show. If you haven't watched it yet, please check out. F is for family. Evidently we're doing great on the all Netflix. Uh, this person says, I remember you mentioned you read open o that you read opened by Andre Augusti. So I picked it up and started reading it. It truly is one of the books that's tough to put down was wondering if he had any other recommendations that you've read of late. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. A that comedian book that I mentioned. Um, I have it downstairs. Uh, it's like the history of a standup comedy. Let me look it up here. Uh, which has taken me forever to get through, cause every time they bring up a name I'm like, who the fuck is that guy? And then I look them up and then I'm on the Internet. But it's been a, it's been a joy, the history of stand up comedy book.

Speaker 2:          01:11:35       There it is. All right. This is what I've been reading. It's called the Comedians, uh, drunks, thieves scoundrels in the history of American comedy. Jesus Christ, Hubbub Brilliance. Do you know any geniuses in there? No. No, no. Nod to Pryor, Lenny Bruce, none of that. All right. Um, yeah, so I would, that's what I've been reading and uh, I don't know. I'm in another one of those modes where I'm just playing a lot of drums and I'm, I'm cooking in that type of stuff. And uh, also feeling the pressure to put out another cooking video to shut up somebody that I'd never met before. How fucking ridiculous is that? Um, I should just let it go. You know I should, but you know what? I'm not gonna. You know what? Maybe I'll make a fuck. I'll make a breakfast one. I made a pie one. I'll make a breakfast one, I'll make a lunch one.

Speaker 2:          01:12:24       I'll make a demo or a supper one. I'll do it all throughout the fucking years. All right. That'll be all basic cooking by a basic cunt. All right, that's the podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves. I'll check in on you on Thursday. I'm to brand new year. I have like two standup gigs booked because I'm trying to figure out what the fuck is going to go on with this show for going to get a second season. I need to know, but a, I think I'm just going to start booking shit. Um, cause that's how this business works. You know, if you, uh, if you book a bunch of Shit then they just go, oh well let's fucking give you something right in the middle of all that other shit that you booked. If you don't book anything, then you're just going to be staring at your phone and it's never going to ring.

Speaker 2:          01:13:12       What do you fucking which billion to sue unit's superstitious stuff? Well maybe I am, I have no idea. But a Paul Versey is going to try to not drink starting today until the beginning of April. And I told him that I w I've sorta half ass committed that I would do it with them. Um, so I'm sort of on the wagon right now. I didn't drink last night. I don't really have any desire to do it today. I'm fucking wiped out. So we'll see. I'm going to try and see. I'll try and go as long as I can. I'm all right. That's it. Go Fuck Yourself. So I'll talk to you on Thursday.
