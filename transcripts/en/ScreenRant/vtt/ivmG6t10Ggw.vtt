00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.160
As the artists and storytellers at Pixar Animation
began to crank out successful movies set in

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.050
the fictional worlds of children’s toys,
sentient cars, and culinary rodents, it didn’t

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.820
take long for fans to realize the stories
weren’t as separate as they had thought.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.599
Fans have spun wild theories on a single unified
“Pixar Universe,” blurring the lines between

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.980
Pixar’s superheroes, animals, toys, and
everyday people.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.090
One overall story may be impossible to find,
but hunting down each easter egg is more than

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.090
worth the effort.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.550
Here are Screen rants 10 Hidden Clues to Pixar’s
Shared Universe.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.960
The Illustrated Bug’s Life

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.160
One of Pixar’s earliest films following
on Toy Story’s success, the story of one

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.161
insect’s pursuit of a great adventure has
proven just as worthy of easter eggs,and hidden

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:57.110
nods throughout Pixar’s talented team.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.100
As proof that the film is still worthy of
attention, a scene in Toy Story 2 shows even

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.930
Mrs. Potato Head is a fan, reading an illustrated
version of A Bug’s Life’s story.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.620
Is it merely a nod to an underrated film,
or explicit confirmation that A Bug’s Life

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.579
is a work of fiction to Andy and his toys…?

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:13.579
Bugs &amp; Monsters

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.979
There’s no doubt that the fantastical adventure
based on the monsters that keep children up

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.520
at night caught more attention than A Bug’s
Life, but the two are directly linked.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.700
A good chunk of the insect adventure is set
in the shadow of a mobile home, parked alongside

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.350
the infamous Pizza Planet delivery truck – one
of Pixar’s signature easter eggs, appearing

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.310
in nearly every one of their films.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.389
When the villain of Monsters, Inc., Randall
is sent into the home as punishment, and forced

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:38.249
to deal with its gator-hating inhabitants.

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:42.929
Monsters, Inc. doesn’t miss out on its own
nod to the movie that started it all, either.

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:43.929
Where’s Woody?

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.549
When Sully returns the mischievous Boo to
her very own bedroom at the end of the first

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.759
Monsters adventure, she isn’t ready to leave,
showing off her toy collection to what she

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.579
thinks is her big blue “kitty.”.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.049
The “Luxo Ball” from Pixar’s earliest
animated shorts can be seen, but Boo takes

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.189
particular pride in her cowgirl Jessie doll,
well-known to fans of Toy Story 2, and apparently

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.719
a hit with more than just Andy.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:05.909
Buzz Down Under

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.709
For a movie based in the oceans, Finding Nemo
hints at more connections to Pixar’s other

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.280
properties than you would expect.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.080
When the wayward Nemo finds himself living
in a dentist office aquarium, viewers are

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.130
given more than a few glimpses of the waiting
room and its sometimes-terrifying patients.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.940
Among the toys scattered around for children
to play with is the unmistakable profile of

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.050
Buzz Lightyear, one star of the Toy Story
series that was apparently even popular in

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.050
Australia.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.050
One Incredible Comic

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.590
The Toy Story movies always implied that there
were thousands of each toy scattered around

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.130
the world, but another nod in Finding Nemo
isn’t so easily explained.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.380
A young boy can later be seen reading a comic
book in the dentist’s office waiting room

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.010
clearly showing a young Mr. Incredible on
its cover.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.510
Whether it’s a real adventure from the golden
age of Pixar superheroes, or a sign that The

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.360
Incredibles are merely comic book characters
in Pixar’s universe… that’s for fans

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.060
to debate.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.060
Car People

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.840
It may not be the most critically-acclaimed
of Pixar’s movies, but the commercial power

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.160
of Cars made it an overnight sensation – and
the wealth of easter eggs spread across the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.730
studio’s other movies show the designers
have a soft spot for the story of humanized

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.730
vehicles.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.980
Although the world of Cars is lacking human
beings, the characters in the Toy Story series

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.620
are clearly fans: the third film in the series
includes a simplified version of star Lightning

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.850
McQueen, a child wearing a t-shirt boasting
his logo and number, and even Andy is a fan,

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.280
with a calendar in his room showing a more
realistic version of the sneezy Snot Rod.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.510
Jurassic Gas

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.190
As an added bonus, the gas company seen to
sponsor the film’s famous Piston Cup – Dinoco

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.660
– is also a gas company in the world of
Toy Story.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.370
And if viewers look close enough, the unmistakable
dinosaur on the company’s logo can be spotted

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.510
on a lighter in Wall-E’s collection of human
artifacts.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.510
Incredible Underwear

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.430
The story of a runaway rat with a flair for
high-end cooking may seem to have little in

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.460
common with Pixar’s other releases, but
it turns out comic book superheroes are just

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.910
as popular in the film’s version of Paris
as they are in the real one.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.569
As evidenced by the “Incredibles” logo
on Linguini’s underwear.

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:59.640
A Telltale Shadow

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.810
But the timeline of the Pixar universe is
also played with in the movie, as Remy’s

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.100
adventures through Paris end up bringing him
dangerously close to an unseen dog.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.790
But a closer look at the dog’s shadow reveals
it to be a dead ringer for Dug, the fan-favorite

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.440
canine from Pixar’s Up, appearing here years
before his own movie hit theaters – and

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.380
apparently before a groundbreaking collar
allowed him to speak English.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.380
Wall-E

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.850
As light-hearted and hopeful as Pixar’s
movies tend to be, Wall-E showed that if every

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.300
story is set in the same fictional world,
then all are headed for a seriously depressing

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.300
end.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.840
Set decades in the future, Wall-E follows
a single sanitation robot charged with cleaning

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.999
up the Earth after it’s been turned into
one massive landfill.

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:41.849
One big box retailer – Buy n Large – is
to blame for the mess, with their corporate

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:47.210
logo spread throughout the movie.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.430
Leaving no doubt that all of Pixar’s humans
are headed for this fate, the BnL logo is

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.729
shown on Buzz Lightyear’s batteries in Toy
Story 3.

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.030
He’ll at least have company, since Rex can
also be spotted in Wall-E’s collection.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.189
So what do you think of our list?

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:03.080
