Speaker 1:          00:00:01       So today I want to look at two kinds of games and then more change topic of beds and the game. Don't want to look at uh, about ultimatums and bargaining. I will start with ultimatums and we'll move smoothly through and we'll see why that's an easy transition in a while. All right, so the game we're gonna play involves two players. Um, let's do players, whoops, one and two. And the game is this player one is going to make a take it or leave it offer, take it or leave it to play it too. And this offer is going to concern a pie and it's made the pie worth $1 for now. All right, we'll put, we'll, we'll probably play this for real in a bit. We'll play it for $1. All right, so it's a split of a pie. We can think of the split as offering s to play a one and one minus ass to play out too. Alright. Asked to play a woman and one minus asked to play two and play a two has two choices. Two can accept this offer.

Speaker 2:          00:01:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       And there's two accepts the offer. Then the shares are then the, then they get exactly the offer play a one gets asked and player two gets one minus ass. All right? Alternatively, play it to all play. A two can reject. And if play a two rejects the offer, then both players get zero. Both players get nothing. All right? It's a very simple game. There's a dollar on the table. I'll take it out in the minutes as dollar on the table. All right? And our two players are going to bargain for this, but it isn't much of a bargain plate player ones. Basically you're gonna announce what the division is going to be. Two can either accept that division or no one gets out of thing. Alright, everyone understand the game. So I thought we'd start off by playing this game for real a couple of times. Um, so when they come down and do that,

Speaker 2:          00:02:23       all right,

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       so why don't we play with them people in this role? I've been playing with that row all the time. So a alley's going to help me find somebody. You found somebody, okay. So, uh, the person behind you and your name is a Clia, Clia, a shout out to build this. This, this doesn't make a noise. Shack. Yeah. [inaudible] Acquia. Thank you. Acquia. And uh, so you'll be player one and player two, uh, will be this gentleman here whose name is, shout out Noah. Noah. Okay. So Queer. Now do you know each other? That's okay. Okay. So, uh, uh, a queer can make any offer she wants. We'll buy this for real money, right? So there's a real dollar at stake. You can make any offer you want. It can be in fractions of pennies if you like, of the amount of dollar that you're going to offer. Two. No, no. The Noaa and the amount you're going to keep yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:03:16       There you go.

Speaker 1:          00:03:19       Just shout it out so everyone can hear. But he started standups enough. So this is your moment in the rights. The right.

Speaker 2:          00:03:25       Can you stand up as well? Here we go.

Speaker 1:          00:03:30       You can offer him a penny and no. Are you going to take a penny? No, no. It's not going to take a penny. So I didn't lose the money on that to no one. No one made any money. I didn't lose any money. That seems pretty good. Let's try a different couple. Let's move a movements mover. Move around the room a little bit. So, uh, why don't you, um, ally, when you take the guy behind here whose name is, shout out Gary. Gary. All right. So Gary, why don't you stand up and we'll let Gary play with, uh, the gentleman in here. What's the, what's your name in here and niche. All right, stand up and do you know each other? All right. So what do we make? What are we let a niche be player one this time you understand the rules of the game.

Speaker 2:          00:04:09       So make your offer 30 cents,

Speaker 1:          00:04:12       which is that you'll be like, oh, look for him. I'll bring him 30 cents. No, that's okay. He's saying he's saying no as well. Okay. Okay. So, alright, let's raise the stakes of it. Let's, let's, let's make it $10. All right, so I'm not getting much acceptance here. Let me try a third capital. All right, working my way back. So how about you? What's your name? So when, when you stand up as well. Well at court and be player one. And actually what I do want to sit down so I can, I can, I can do it from here and you and you are Danny. Danny. All right. The court is going to be player one and Dan is going to be planted. He's weren't on dating couples from earlier. Right. We're safe from that. Okay, good. All right, so, so Courtney, what are you going to offer? $5 which is half of the $10

Speaker 2:          00:04:52       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       except all right. Except all right. All right. All right. So it turned out in this game that's a lot of people are rejecting offers. Let's have a look at it on the border. Second, think about it in a second and we'll come back. We're not done. We're not done with this couple. I don't know any of your couples. We're going to come back to you. All right? So in this, in this game it has a pretty, it's pretty simple to analyze this game by backward induction, right? By backward induction. We're going to start with the receiver of the offer. And the receiver of the offer is choosing between,

Speaker 2:          00:05:26       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:26       The offer means to them, which was, which is an annotation is one minus ass. And our three examples, that was the penny than it was 30 cents. And then it was half of it to quote at 50 cents to to be consistent. All right. And we actually saw two of those offers rejected, but according to backward induction, assuming that people are trying to maximize their dollar payoffs here, what should we see? The, what should we see the receiver do?

Speaker 2:          00:05:51       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:05:52       They should accept, right? They should accept even the somewhat insulting offer of a penny that was made, even that someone insulting offer should be accepted, uh, by, uh, by Noah. Right? So, no, it didn't accept the offer of a penny and it's come back over this and no, he didn't accept the offer of a penny. And, uh, uh, I forget who it was with, but our second play, I didn't accept an offer of 30 cents, but we've just argued they should have been accepted. They should've been accepted. In fact, when Acquia made the offer of of one penny to Noah, I think she assumed that Noah would accept it as this. Right. Why do you think do and accepted? Shout out? Because I felt it'd be better off with a penny done. Nothing. It would be better for the penny than nothing. All right. All right. And then we saw an offer, the offer came up about who was my second offer, my second offer and what you offer a bit more.

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       What do you offer more? Um, it felt dirty. Pretty Fair. Shares a lot better than nothing. Right? Thirties in front of enough thing or they're not necessarily fair, but it's still better than nothing at all. Right. And where was my rejector of the second author who rejected the second offer? Why did you reject 30 cents? It's just a pride thing. It's a pride thing. It's a pride thing. Alright. And pretty soon we converged onto, or the 50 cents, which notice is no where near backward induction. It's nowhere near vaccination. So the third offer, which is Courtney, that right. Why do you offer, what was it? Half of it? Because half is better for me than half had been. You've nothing and you've figured he's gonna, he's gonna reject otherwise. And in fact he didn't reject what didn't you reject? Five is better than nothing. Probably better than nothing but that.

Speaker 1:          00:07:16       But the five is better than nothing. Argument would've argued against making any rejection in this game. Is that right? Right. So here's the game went backward. Induction is giving a very clear prediction. The clear prediction is first of all, the second player will except whatever's given to them, and second, given that the first player should offer them essentially nothing, offer them just a penny, right? So backward induction predicts, backward induction predicts that the offer will be essentially, I'd say 99 cents and 1 cents or even or even knew virtually a dollar and nothing. All right, but in fact we don't get that. We get a lot of rejection of these low offers and often we get offers made much, much higher in the visceral dizzy of half. All right. Now why? Why are we seeing a failure of backward induction in this game? I think this is a, this is not as you guys, it's a very reliable results in experimental data.

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       All right? So why, why do we see so many people in this ultimatum game? Both offer more and more importantly, reject last them a small amounts. All right, let's talk about it. So, so one person said it's a pride thing. It's a prior thing. Uh, where was I? This let's try the other airline here. So, uh, what's the, what's the smallest offer you would have accepted? What's your name? Festival. Um, um, listen the same too. Right? So there are some backward induction players in the room. All right? All right. Who, who would, who would ever rejected a scent, who would have projected 10 cents should be going on when we could be going down at least who did rejected 30th sentence? Few people dropped from 37 not money actually. Alright. How many of you would have rejected 50 states? One person, even with a projected 50 sentence, right? But, but essentially know what, okay. Okay. So what's, what's happening here? Why do people think people are rejecting what is essentially money from my pocket? Right? There's nothing going on here. I'm just giving you money. Why are they rejecting being given money?

Speaker 3:          00:09:23       Um, like over all the stakes are really low. So if you have any value on it's or like pride when people said, you know, it's, it's not worth a penny or

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       alright. Sense. All right, so it may be pride going on here. So certainly one thing is about pride. It turns out that people do this even in quite high stakes games. But you're right, certainly that trade off is going to start to bites. All right, what else is going on? So I agree. Pride is part of what's going on. What else is going on here? Let's try and get some conversation going. It was somebody in here, I can get the mic and shout out your name and really shout Peter Gordon. Change. It's cumbersome. Changes come and smoke. You didn't want to change. Okay, fair enough. Fair enough. But if the stakes go up, that would get rid of that. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:10:04       Um, maybe people are tying their own outcomes to the other players outcomes as well.

Speaker 1:          00:10:09       Right? So maybe people have different pay offs. To me, people that people are comparing that pay off to the other person's pay off. That certainly seems like a plausible thing to be going on here. You might feel less happy about getting 20 cents knowing the other person's getting 80 cents for example. You want to be trying to teach them a lesson to get them to offer more, right? You might be trying to send a sort of moral standard here. All right, so there's some notions of indignation or even teaching people that they really should offer people in the war. All right. What else could be going on here? Yeah. If people know I'm not going to accept less than 50 cents, then they should give me 50 cents by backward induction. Right? So, so part of what's going on here, actually this game was a one shot game, right?

Speaker 1:          00:10:52       We just play it once and we could've played it. In fact, they often do to play this, this, this way in the lab. You could have played it without anybody knowing who the other player was. All right, but particularly in this setting where everyone can see everyone else and even in the lab where people actually come see people, but they might imagine that the game is really repeated. You could imagine people trying to establish a reputation. Is that right? So there's lots of these reasons are sort of moral indignation reasons or teaching a lesson reasons, pride reasons. There's also this basic reason that people might be thinking this game is I should play this game as I would a similar situation in life where I might want to be establishing reputation. All right? So there's a certain amount of confusion going on in the game, but there's also a certain amount of, of a lot of things make sense. And I noticed that once we've established that people are going to reject small offers in this game, once we've established people that are going to reject small offers, it makes perfectly good sense to offer a lot more than than nothing. All right? It's not that surprising that once we've established the idea that people are going to reject small offers, you're going to see people making offers that are reasonably large, although not usually larger than 50 cents. Why is 50 cents so focal yet as 50 cents so focal?

Speaker 1:          00:12:07       No trick question. I'm just asking me why do people think 50 cents or so focal? What? I think it's typical that people end up offering around 50 cents. Why? It sounds fair, right? It seems fair. There's some notion of fairness. It's not clear, by the way, what ethical principle is involved here, right? It's not clear that if you're walking along the streets and you happened to find a dollar at your feeds, that you should pick it up and anyone else you happen to see at that moment you should get 50 cents too, right? That's essentially what the situation is. Then you just chose Depaul. This dollar that I just gave you, it isn't clear that there's any particularly great moral claim to give it to someone else, but I think people read this as a situation about splitting, splitting a cake cake in an environment of of distributional justice.

Speaker 1:          00:12:49       They view it as a larger picture. Is that right? So it turns out that the large literature on this, there's a large experimental literature on the ultimatum game and there's an even larger literature on an even simpler game in which I give people a dollar. I say, you can give whatever share you wanted to the other person and they don't even get a chance to accept or reject, right? That's called the dictator game. The dictator game, literally, you'll just simply given a dollar and you can get whatever show you wanted. The other person, it turns out even in the dictator game, people give quite a lot of money or that suggest that there really is some notion of fairness or some notion of of distributional justice going on in people's heads. Yet rightly or wrongly. All right, so one thing that should tell us is even an extremely simple games, extremely simple games.

Speaker 1:          00:13:35       We should be a little bit careful about reading backward induction into what's going to happen in the real world. Part of this is because as I mentioned, the very first day of the class, people care about other things than just the obvious payoffs and part of it is about more complicated things like reputation and solid. All right. Having said that, let's nevertheless for the, for the purpose of uptodate, uh, act as if we are going to do backward induction and let's embed this into a slightly more complicated gate. All right? It's on the more complicated game is as follows.

Speaker 2:          00:14:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:15       All right, so we're going to have a two period bargaining game,

Speaker 2:          00:14:21       two period bargaining

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       and this two pair of bargaining game at the beginning of the game is exactly the same as a dollar on the table and play a one

Speaker 2:          00:14:31       makes an offer

Speaker 1:          00:14:36       to two. I might, once again, we can call this off our ass and one minus ass just the same as before and justice before play a two can accept the offer. And if they the offer then this is indeed what they get. All right. But now if two rejects, which is twos other alternative, if play a two rejects the offer, then we flip the roles. We play the game again, but we flipped the roles. So we go to stage two. All right. This is everything we've said happen up here is stage one.

Speaker 2:          00:15:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:19       And down here we go to stage two. I need to stage to play it to gets to make an offer.

Speaker 2:          00:15:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:33       To one player two gets to make it off at a one. And once again we can. Cool. Last one, uh, we've been a bit, but to be careful, let's put, let's put one's hair just to indicate where in the first round and uh, to see how to indicate where in the second. All right, so you make it offers s two and one minus s two s two s as to is the, is the, is that that goes to play a one and one minus s two is that, is that that goes to play, uh, uh, to, to, to guests. We can offer an a player one and now one can accept or reject. If she accepts, then she gets her share from here. Offers accepted. And if she rejects,

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       let me get nothing. All right? So this game is exactly the same as playing the previous game, except we flip roles, but we're going to add one catch. The catch is this in the first round, the money on the table is a dollar. All right? But if we end up going into the second round, I was, the first offer is not accepted and we go into the second round, then part of the money is lost. And in particular we'll assume that the doe, the money on the table is delta. All right? What you could think of Delta as being just some number less than one. All right, so you want a concrete example. Think of this as being 90 cents. All right? So the idea here is if you get into the second round, time is passed, it's costly and to money in the second round, uh, is I think that money in the second round is being worth less, or can I actually think of this cake being eaten up?

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       Some of it's thrown away. So much wasted. All right, everyone understand the game? All right? This is very similar to the previous game, but we've got this second stage coming in and we've got discounting. So this is the idea of discounting. How many of you have heard the term discounting before? All right, so you're probably a storied enough finance cost or a macro class where we think about the being of value of money as value of time. That money today is worth more than money tomorrow, partly because you could put the money today into the bank and it could earn interest, partly because you're simply impatient to get that money and go and have lunch, particularly on the day in which the clocks changed. All right? Okay. So let's try this game again and let's just, let's just play it for real. So let's come down again.

Speaker 1:          00:18:11       Hi, everyone. Missed out down the game. Basically the same rules that with this flipping around and with the possibility that the cake may shrink. Let's see what people have learned. So who are our first pet? Our first power Acquia. And who was that quiz? And Noah. All right, so a, a Quia what? W what are you going to offer your player? One here. All right. But if your offers rejected, no, is going to get to make an offer to you. All right, so what are you going to offer this time? 45 99 uh, so 45 cents. Yeah. [inaudible] 46 46. Okay, so he, he gets 46 if you accepts the offer, is that right? Yeah, 40 46 missteps. The offer all makes sense that he's accepted that. Okay. That was easy. That was easy. So that, that was so, so uh, queer got uh, got 54 cents and a Noah got a 46 cents. All right, who was our second path? Go second pass. So that was a, I've forgotten a niche. Right. And uh, Gary and Gary. All right, so a niche. What are you going to have this done? I'll lock it. 43 43. You're going to push the envelope a little bit. All right. All right. Then we're gonna accept it as well. Okay. So people are, people are converging here. All right. And what about our third off? Uh, offer receiver was Courtney and Danny and Danny is a Courtney 30, 30, 30 for him.

Speaker 2:          00:19:27       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:19:30       I like sad. Oh, a three acceptances. All right, let's find out something here. So I was hoping to get into the second round, so supposing Ah, okay, so you accepted, that's fine. That's fine. All right. We will, no, no, no, no chicken sounds around the room. All right. All right. So, uh, is down here, right? Yeah. So Daddy, have you rejected or you accepted? But how do you accepted, what would you have offered in the second round?

Speaker 2:          00:19:53       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       45. 45. All right. 45 and would you have accepted that in the second round if you're 30, 30 to minutes after? Yes. Yeah. So, okay, so you might've, you might've been better at turns out. All right. All right, let's go back through the se, the other rejection. So the, is it the other acceptances who up my second capital, you offered 43, is that right? Right. And you said yes to 43 is that right? Have you rejected 43 what would you have offered back in return? 43 43 the same thing back would, would you were you accepted it and he gets 47 he would've got 47 in that case. You're just being accepted that, okay. Okay. And uh, queer went first and she offered 45 to, no, I know I had, in fact you rejected what would you've offered back? I would have also done 45 same thing back and we would you would you have accepted it?

Speaker 1:          00:20:39       Yeah. Okay. So, so we can see here that the decision to accept or reject partly depends on what you think the other side is going to do in the second round. Is that right? So here you are, you're making, if you're even in the middle of this game, if you're a player too, you've received an offer right now, these offers sounded crazy. I mean 30 cents was the lowest where I'm another sign crazy. And you're trying to decide whether you should accept or reject this offer. And one you have in mind is what would I offer if I reject and will that offer the, I then offer in the next round be accepted or rejected. Is that right? All right. And so if we just work backwards, we can see what you should offer in the first round. Should be just enough to make sure it's accepted.

Speaker 1:          00:21:22       Knowing that the person who's who's receiving the offer and the first round is going to think about the offer they're going to make in the second round. I'm going to think about whether you're going to accept or reject in the second round. Is that right? Right. So that sound like a bit of a mouthful, but that mouthful of reasoning is exactly backward induction, right? It's exactly backward induction as saying to figure out what I should do in the first round. I need to figure what I should offer in the first round. I needed to figure out where the player two is going to accept or reject and to figure out whether he or she is going to accept rejects. And I have to put myself in his or her shoes and figure out what he or she would offer if she did reject and what he or she thinks I would do if I got that second Matt, offer that right. Alright, so let's try and analyze this as if backward induction was going to work here as if we didn't have to worry about things like pride here. All right, so this is the game we're actually playing. Let's keep that one

Speaker 1:          00:22:23       and actually analyze it on the board. I want to walk us from a rotary mundane game of take it or leave it offers to a more complicated game in which there can be several rounds of offers, but we're going to go slow on. We'll start this with two rent.

Speaker 2:          00:22:41       All right? All right,

Speaker 1:          00:22:47       so first of all, let's just look at the stage one game, the stage one game and it's keeping track what the offer is and what the receiver. This is the opera and this is the receiver.

Speaker 2:          00:23:04       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:23:05       Hello. In the one with stage game, the game only has one stage.

Speaker 1:          00:23:12       Then we know from backward induction what the results should be. It isn't what we find in the in the lab. It isn't what we find in the classroom, but we don't, we should get the offer should offer to keep everything essentially or maybe 99 cents but it's called it one and the receiver gets nothing. All right? So again, I'm approximating it a little bit cause it could be 99 cents and a penny. But who cares? This is call it a dollar and nothing if it's a one stage game. All right, so now let's consider a two stage game. All right? And the two stage game, the person who's making the offer in the first stage needs to look forward. Anticipate what would happen if the off, if, if her offer was rejected by player too and play a two went forward into the second stage. Is that right from the two stage game and the first stage of the two stage game, the person making the offer wants to anticipate what the receiver would offer in the second round where the receiver to reject our offer.

Speaker 2:          00:24:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:14       But we can, we can do that by backward induction. We know that in the second round if the receiver rejects the offer, then the second round of the two stage game is what? It's a one stage. Okay. All right. And we've just argued as this, this, we printed these, these we believe in backward induction. In that case play a two who has done, the author will offer a dollar and play a one who is now the receiver. What accepted and yet,

Speaker 2:          00:24:42       okay. All right,

Speaker 1:          00:24:44       so play a one in the first round of the two stage game. Wants to make an offer that just enough to get player to, to accept it. Now. All right. So let's think about this check if play a one offers to something more than what? More than what? Tomorrow play a two can get a dollar. All right? But that's a dollar tomorrow. All right, so a dollar tomorrow is worth how much today if we're discounting it just worth Delsa, right? It's just worth Delta. So if player one offers play a two more than Delta time is one, which is what player too can get tomorrow then too. We're like steps

Speaker 1:          00:25:33       and if play a woman offers to less than Delta Times a dollar, cause you can get a dollar tomorrow, but that's only worth delta. Uh, that dollar tomorrow is worth just Delta today, then two will reject. All right? So the offer has to be exactly enough to get accepted, which is exactly Delta dollars. All right? Delta dollars. All right? So play a two knows that she can get it in pink player to know she can get a dollar tomorrow. So you need to offer her at least Delsa today to make it as good for her. I was getting a dollar tomorrow. All right. Do we know the receiver? Must be offered at least Delta tomorrow, which means the offer.

Speaker 2:          00:26:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:25       It's going to keep one minus delta. All right, so this in the stay in the first round of the two stage game play a one should offer, one might add one minus Delta took for herself and Delta for player too, and play a two shoot. Except that because Delta dollars today is as good as $1

Speaker 2:          00:26:48       tomorrow. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:26:52       Or another way to see that isn't a picture. Let's just draw a picture.

Speaker 2:          00:26:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:59       All right. Let's put the pay off of player one here and the payoff of player to on this access. All right, and these are good. We'll get, we're going to assume that it's going to maximize dollars where there's no pride in here and if we just look at the one stage game, we're simply looking at this line.

Speaker 2:          00:27:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27:18       All right. The offers and the one stage game, it could be that player one gets everything herself and gives nothing to play a two. It could be that player to keeps everything fresh. Again ended up getting everything and play a one gets nothing and it could be any combination in between. Right? And we argued by backward induction, although not in reality, in backward induction in the real, uh, in back conduction in the one stage game play on one, uh, makes an offer to play a two, which is kind of an insulting Golfer. Play one says I get everything and you get a petty, I don't know if this is the one stage gate,

Speaker 2:          00:27:53       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:27:58       In the two stage game, instead of it's in the Tuesdays gaming, if things are settled in the first stage, this line represents the possible divisions between player one and player two. But if we end up going into the second stage, the pious shrunk. The pious shrunk instead of being so going from one to one, it goes from Delta One, two, Delta, one off. It's like if Delta's 0.9, it goes from 0.9 2.9. So let's draw that line in. That's what we get into. The second stage will end up being here. All right? How this goes from Delta dollars here to Delta dollars. There were these dollars, those dollars are being evaluated at time. At at time one hunter, the pious shrunk. If we get into the second stage, then by backward induction play a two nos. Pay a two isn't an ultimatum game. Pay a two. We'll be making the offer and play a souk stays. Whatever cake is left, I'm going to take all of it and you're just going to get a pen. So if we get into the second stage, then play two will make this offer

Speaker 2:          00:29:06       to play a one.

Speaker 1:          00:29:09       I have to, we'll say I'm going to keep, I'm going to keep all of that. The whole of the pie, which in time, time was in the in first period, dollars is worth Delta. So I'm going to get, I'm going to end up with a payoff of Delta and you're going to end up with a powerful essentially nothing. Alright, play a two nos. Play a two knows that they can therefore get at least Delta dollars or Delta Delta and in current day dollars worth from state, from rejecting your offer, since they can get at least Delane these Delta current day offers from your offer, the lowest offer you can make to them isn't offer that gives them at least delta. So the offer you're going to make is this offer.

Speaker 1:          00:29:55       This is the two stage offer. It happens in the first stage, play a one gives it, makes an offer that gives player to what play a two could get in the second round of gives play a to Delta and keeps one minus Delta for herself. All right, everyone was on the picture. So this picture is just corresponding to this table, right? The thing people tend to get confused about here I think is they get confused between current dollars and uh, and discounted dollars. So we're going to do all the analysis here in terms of uh, the first period dollars dollars tomorrow are going to be worth goals. There's a hand up. Can I, can I get a shout shouting out? Yeah. Yes, yes. Sorry. Let me to put those labels bigger. Yes. So this is the outcome. If it was a one stage game and this is the outcome, if it was a a two stage game, right? The offer is made and accepted. All right, let's roll it forward. Let's look at a three stage game. Let's keep this picture handy and think about a three stage game. So the first beginning of the game is the same. All right? We're going to get three stage bargaining.

Speaker 2:          00:31:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:14       And the rules in three states bargaining, I pretty much the same as in two stage bargaining but now there's two possible flips in three stage bargaining.

Speaker 2:          00:31:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:27       And three stage pocketing in the first period and period one one makes the offer and if it's accepted the game's over. Alright, in period two. So if we rejects, if project, then we go to period to when to makes the Alpha and if it's rejected now the signed by player one, then we go to Paris three. Well once again, one makes the Alpha so you can see where we're heading. We're heading towards an alternate, an alternate offer bargaining model. I'm going to make an offer, Jake Scott, either accept or reject that I, he'll make an offer and we'll flip to and fro. There's a question. Let me try and get a mic out to the question.

Speaker 2:          00:32:22       Yeah, yeah. Question about the two player game. If

Speaker 1:          00:32:26       that's a shout out to be looking at here is if Delta is the best that player to can get tomorrow, then why wouldn't you want one offer player to Delta discounted by Delta today? Right. So good. So I think I was confusing about it. Somebody behind me clear. So tomorrow play a two can get everything. Everything that there is. All right, so whenever whatever Pi is left tomorrow, play a two can get all of it. All right, so call that pie tomorrow one and evaluated in current in in period $1 as being worth delta. All right. All right. Does that make sense? Okay. So I, I think I misspoke on that. So let me say it again. All right. So, so every period there's this pie. All right. And every period, if it was the last period of the game, the person making the offer is going to get the whole pie.

Speaker 1:          00:33:17       All right? But if I view that pie tomorrow from today, right? A Pie of $1 tomorrow is only worth Delta dials today. A Pi of $1 the day after tomorrow is only worth Delta dollars tomorrow and Delta squared dollars today. And so all right, so that, that, that's, that's the way which we're going to do discounting here. Good. All right. All right, so this game, if one makes an offer, if it's accepted, it's over, it's accepted, then we're done. And if there's offers accepted, then we're done. And if this office, except in the Madonna and the third round, if it's rejected, then both players get nothing. All right? And once again, we're going to assume, we're going to assume that the players are discounting. So what does it mean? What does it mean to say that discounting? It means that the dollars in period one are worth dollars. Dollars in period two RJ are discounted by del Sur and dollars in period three are discounted by Delta Times. Delta or if you like by this question.

Speaker 2:          00:34:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:25       All right, and just to put this into real, into real notions of money. If you think of Delta as being 90% then a dollar in period one is worth a dollar a dollar in period two viewed from period one is worth 90 cents and a dollar in period three viewed from period one is worth 81 cents.

Speaker 2:          00:34:44       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:34:46       Okay, so what do we think's going to happen here? Wow. Once again, we can do backward induction. Here we are in our picture.

Speaker 1:          00:35:04       Let's look at the three stage game and once again, when we analyze, as always when we analyze these games using backward induction, we want to start at the end. If we start at the end, we know that the last stage that to the third stage of the three stage game looks like what it looks like, the one stage game and in the one stage game we know the offeror. We'll get everything. All right, so again, so the last stage of the three stage game, we know the person who makes the offer, who this time we'll be player one will get everything however that everything is only worth Delta in two n's in period $2 and it's only worth Delta squared in period one off impaired $1 all right, so in period in period one it's right in the first part of this game. We know that if the offer is rejected, we know what's going to happen. Is that again, in the first period of this three stage game, if the offer is rejected, then we'll go into a two stage game. All right? We'll go to a two stage game and we already know what happens on a two stage game and a two stage game. The person who gets to make an offer gets one minus Delta and the person who receives the offer gets delta.

Speaker 2:          00:36:24       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:36:25       So we know in the first stage of the game that the person who receives the offer always has the outside option of saying, no, I reject and we know that that person tomorrow we'll get one minus delta, but one minus Delta tomorrow is worth how much today?

Speaker 2:          00:36:45       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:36:47       it's Dell. So one minus it tomorrow they're going to get one minus Delta dollars. So today that's worth Delta one minus Delta donors. All right, so the offer I have to make in the first round to make sure that the other person except it has to be just better in discounted dollars than what they're going to get tomorrow. They're going to get one minus Delta tomorrow, so I have to give them Delta y minus Delta today. All right. Which means I keep for myself one minus Delta, one minus Delta, and if you don't like the Algebra, let's look at the picture and the picture in the one stage game. This is the offer in the two stage game. We know if we get into the second round play a two gets everything right. We have to give him that much today. And if we get into the third round, now we're looking at Delta squared here and Delta squared here. I'll just go ahead and Dallas. Glad we know that if we get into the third round, the person who makes the offer and the third round we'll get to to get, uh, get everything so we can actually walk away a lot of it. All right, so in the third round, the person who makes the third offer, we'll get everything. So in the second round, you'd have to give them that much. So I ended up first round, you'd have to give plan to that much. All right. Say that again.

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       In Paris three the person making the offer can get, get everything. All right? So in period two, they must be getting a Delta Times that. So in period one you have to give them at least this much higher than this. Here is the offer you'd make in the three stage guy.

Speaker 2:          00:38:39       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:38:40       so on the picture, it's just going and doing a little zigzag on the, uh, on the, on the, uh, chart. We're also always working across the diagonal. All right, so we've done the, we've done the one stage game, the one stage game, the person making the offer get to everything in the two stage game. The person making the offer off as just too much, just enough to get the offer accepted, which is Delta because that's what, that's what the dollar's worth tomorrow in the three stage game, the person making the offer makes just enough to get the offer accepted, which is del Sur times what the receiver would get tomorrow. What they get tomorrow is one minus Delta, so they get Delta woman is Delta today. All right. How about the forestage game? It's, see we can do that. So we go to the fourth stage game now and the forestage game, if the person receiving the offer rejects the offer, then tomorrow they can get one minus Dell, so one minus delta. So I need to offer them enough now in current dollars so that, so they, so they will prefer that to getting one minus Delta one minus Delta tomorrow.

Speaker 1:          00:39:51       So how much we'll start off of them. I have to offer them at least Delta Times that much. So I have to offer them Delsa times one minus Delta Times one minus downside like this. All right? And again, I have to keep the rest. I'll keep the rest of myself, so I'll get one minus DELSA, one minus delta,

Speaker 2:          00:40:13       one minus downside. All right?

Speaker 1:          00:40:18       Actually the principal is always give people just enough today so they'll accept the offer and just enough today is whatever they'd get tomorrow discounted by Delta.

Speaker 2:          00:40:31       Right?

Speaker 1:          00:40:37       So actually this backward induction isn't so bad. All right? What makes it a little bit easier is you don't actually, what do when you go through an extra stage of this, you don't actually have to go all the way to the beginning. You can actually start where you were last time and just discount once more by Delta.

Speaker 2:          00:40:52       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:40:55       let's see. We can see it. Any kind of pattern emerging in this Algebra. All right, so let's just multiply out these brackets in the F in the forestage game. This thing is actually equal soon as multiplying through. It's one minus Delta Plus Delta squared, uh, minus Delta cubed. I hope it is. Anyway. That's what this is. And this thing is equal to delta. Delta minus squares a plus Delta. Cute. Alright. Just multiplying out the brackets. All right. Does anyone see a pattern emerging here and these offers? We had offers of one and then one minus delta. So we can also multiply out this one. It might be helpful to do so. This is actually one minus Delta plus uh, this is one minus Delta Plus Delta squared.

Speaker 2:          00:42:03       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:42:04       They want to see a pattern. What these offers look like. They kind of alternate, right? So let's, let's uh, that's how I look. What the, rather than do every stage, try it. One more stages. Here we can see a pattern emerging and I just jumped straight to 10 stages and see what happens. Go straight to 10. Then you'll say, let's do one. Let's do one. Just jumps into 10 to imagine. But this game actually had 10 rounds. This is the 10 stage game. Let's just take this as, continue our chart down here. So here's a little bit more space. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:42:59       right. Tanner stages 10 stage game. I'm going to continue my chart. My chart says in the 10 stage game, what am I going to get to the offer? The offer is going to be easy. The same pattern, one minus DELSA plus Delta squared minus Delta Cubes. Don't Dr a plus Delta to the eight minus Delta the night. I want to see that what I'm doing is I'm speaking, uh, continuing the pattern from above. All right, so I have 10 stages. I always start with a one. The positive and negative terms just alternates and I have as many terms as one minus the stage. I entering the four stage game. I ended up at Delta cubed during the 10 stage game. I'll end up at Delta to the line. All right, now we're happy with that. All right, so the fourth stage offer is this slightly ugly thing, one minus Delta Plus Delta squared minus Delta cubed. Dr. All right, so plus down to the four minus up to the five, et Cetera, et Cetera, plus Delta eight minus Delta nine. Right? That's a pretty ugly thing. But fortunately some point in high school you learned how to sum that thing. Do you know what this is? What do you call objects like this in high school? I don't remember. And I remember objects like one Delta, Delta Square, Delta, Cube Dunk, the Florida, what are they called?

Speaker 1:          00:44:36       They called geometric series right there called geometric series and I remember had a sum them, we know that x is equal to this. All right? This is what the offer is. If there's 10 rounds, we know the offers accepted. All right? The way, the way that remember how to stomach it is to the trick for something. It is to multiply both sides of this equation by by the Cuban ratio to multiply both sides by Delta.

Speaker 2:          00:45:08       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:45:09       So if I multiply this side by Delta, I got them off on the other side by Delta on this one will become a delta. This Delson, this Delsa will become a delta squared. This delta squared.

Speaker 2:          00:45:23       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:45:25       we'll become a delta cubed. This Delta cubed will become the delta. The fourth don't, don't, don't. There'll be a minus delta to the age coming from the seventh time. There'll be a plus Delta to the nine and with the delta aids term and there'll be a minus.

Speaker 2:          00:45:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:44       Delta to the temp, right? Everyone okay with that? I just multiplied everything through Phi Delta. I just shifted it along. One for convenience. What do I do now? Do you remember I the two lines together. Let's add the two lions together. All right, so I something on this side, I get one plus Delsa

Speaker 2:          00:46:08       that's 10

Speaker 1:          00:46:11       right on the other side. What's kind of convenient is everything cancels. The one comes through. I get a one, but these two terms council, these two terms council and these two turn councils and so on and so on. All the way out to the end. Or I get minus Dal of the 10.

Speaker 2:          00:46:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:32       We're okay. Well, the other types of cancel out. All right, so now just uh, sorting out my Algebra Brett, I'm going to take on another side. I'm going to have that. They offer you make off. This is what you're gonna get to keep. So they might, they might not. They might claim I should keep in the first round is one minus Delta to the 10

Speaker 2:          00:46:56       over one plus downside.

Speaker 1:          00:47:02       I have a little bit careful up notation here because maybe it'll a bit confusing. The 10 here doesn't mean to the 10th power, it's just the offer in the 10th round. Where's the tent here really does mean in the 10th power.

Speaker 2:          00:47:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:16       All right, so if you play this game for 10 rounds, the offer you'd make would be one minus Delta to the 10 over one plus Delta, which means that the amount of your offering to the other side, which is one ass would be Delta Plus Delta, the tenant

Speaker 2:          00:47:38       over one bus Dells. All right,

Speaker 1:          00:47:44       so let's just summarize where we are. We started off by considering a very simple game, a one stage take it or leave it offer. We know that in that take it or leave it offer player one is going to claim everything for herself and offer nothing to play at two. Then we can see a two stage game which was the same as the one stage game except that if player to rejects the offer he is go back to he. He gets to make an offer to play out one in the second period. We know that in the second period of that two stage game play, it too can keep everything for himself. Everything for himself tomorrow is worth Delta today so you have to offer him at least Delta today and keep one minus Delta for yourself. Then we noted a three stage game in this three stage game.

Speaker 1:          00:48:38       If player two rejects from the first round play, a two can make you an offer on the second round but now if your player one and you reject on the second round you get to make an offer to play or two in the third round. We argued that in the second round of this game, the person if play a two rejects you in the first round and makes an offer in the second round, it'll be at a two stage game and they'll be able to keep one minus delta of the Pie for themselves. So you have to offer them at least Delta Times one minus Delta today for them to accept the offer, keeping the rest of the ourself. Then we look to the forestage game in the fourth stage game. If you play a two rejects your offer, he can make you an offer, but if you can recollect now and you can make him an offer, but if he rejects it off, he can make you an offer. And once again we asked how much do I have to offer play a two now for him to accept the offer. Now he knows that if he rejects the offer, he can get this amount one minus Delta Times one minus Delsa tomorrow. So I have to offer him del Sur Times that today I want to get lucky.

Speaker 2:          00:49:43       I just saved myself.

Speaker 1:          00:49:46       All right. That's just a summary of what we did. And then what we did was we cheated. We jumped to the 10th stage just noticing that the pattern that emerged and we found that the 10th stage, this is the offer you'd make just according to the same pattern, and it was this horrible thing. And then we used a little bit of high school math to simplify this thing and it turns out this is the amount you'll keep yourself and this is the offer you'll make to play it.

Speaker 2:          00:50:09       Let's see. All right. Each case, they'll be accepted. I make a math mistake. Thank you guys. Let's make, let's put a Steven Strip to here. Good. All right,

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       so what do, what do we observe here? So the first thing to observe is in the one stage game, if we, if we believe backward induction, you certainly want to be the person making me off in the one stage, gave him the ultimatum game. There's no huge first mover advantage.

Speaker 2:          00:50:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:39       In the two stage game, it's not clear if you want to make the offer. It depends on how large Delta is. But if delta has a big number like 0.9 you'd rather be the person receiving the offer in the three stage game it looks like it looks like you'd probably rather make the offer, but it's not so clear. So where does it go to as we go down the path as it goes down towards the 10 stage game, it looks like in the 10 stage game he was like a 10 stage game. You probably still prefer to make the offer the note, but they're certainly much closer together than they were before. Some of that initial bargaining power has been washed out by the fact that 10 stages. All right, so let's try and push this just a little bit harder. What is, instead of looking at the 10 stage offer, what have we look at the infant stage office? So what is the, what is it in principle, in principle, we look at the infant stage of this game.

Speaker 1:          00:51:40       All right? So I can make you an offer. You can say no and make me an offer and then I can reject to make you an offer. And then you can object to make me an offer and so on and so forth. All right, so we look at this term. If there's an in principle, you could make an infinite number of office. All right, so what's this tone I'm going to look like if I can make an infinite number of office. So I claim it's going to look like this one minus Delta to the infancy over one plus delta. And over here is this it converge towards less than me. Picked up more formal and over here we'll have delta plus Delta to the infancy over one plus thousand

Speaker 2:          00:52:21       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:22       However, now I can get, now I get a little bit simpler. What is Delta to the infinity? It's zero, right? 2.9 times 0.9 10 point 909 has what? 9.9 0.99 a pound. Mine is zero. So this last term disappears. Past does this one and we just get one over one plus Delta

Speaker 2:          00:52:48       and

Speaker 1:          00:52:52       Delta over one plus Delta. So if we, like if we make alternating offer bargaining bargaining game, when each round I make you an offer, you can accept it or you can reject and make me an offer and we imagined this no bound to this game. It just goes on arbitrarily long. Then our prediction is that player one, the person who makes the first offer, we'll get one over one plus Delta of the initial Pi and play a two. We'll get delta over one plus Delta of the initial Pi.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       Let's try and get a handle about what those numbers are. All right, so if you imagine these offers can be made fairly rapidly. For example, I could make an offer today. You can make an offer back to me and half an hour's time and then I can make an offer back to you in half an hour's time. Then it's reasonable to assume that the pie is not shrinking very fast, right? The discount factor is not a big deal here. All right, so he's offers to be made in rapid succession. Then we might think that Delta itself is approximately one. The Pie isn't drinking very fast. If Dell does approximately one right? If we take Delta to one here, that'd be the time. Isn't that valuable given how rapidly we can make offers to and fro. Then what does this make this equal and the case went delta is equal to one. What did we get?

Speaker 2:          00:54:20       We got a health which means this will also be

Speaker 1:          00:54:29       so we learned something from this which is kind of surprising if you do alternating offers this, that standard, very natural game of bargaining, sort of the kind of bargaining you might do in the business and a market or the kind of bargaining you might imagine going on in negotiations between baseball players or their agents and teams. All general managers of teams. All right, which offers just go to and fro and they go to and fro fairly rapidly and in principle they could make lots and lots of office in principle what we should, what this model tells us is in principle we're going to end up with each people with each side splitting whatever. The Pie was

Speaker 2:          00:55:07       equally

Speaker 1:          00:55:09       very, very different from the ultimatum game where all the bargaining power was on the person who made the first offer.

Speaker 2:          00:55:16       All right. All right, so what are the lessons here? What can we conclude from this? We've looked at alternating offer bargaining

Speaker 1:          00:55:45       and we've concluded under under special conditions we've concluded that you get an even split.

Speaker 2:          00:55:51       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:55:52       why didn't you get an even share and even split 50 50 splits if three things are true, the first thing is there, there's potentially infinite many offers, potentially

Speaker 2:          00:56:07       potentially 10 bargain forever

Speaker 1:          00:56:19       if discounting is not a big deal. What does discounting really not being a big deal means? Means there's offers can be made in rapid succession. All right, so no discounting.

Speaker 2:          00:56:29       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:56:31       Is there just kind of take it or if you like rapid offers, if you don't have to wait a year between every offer, that discount factor would be a big deal, but I actually made a third assumption and I made it without telling you what was the third assumption I made. I snuck a third assumption past you without telling you what was that third assumption?

Speaker 1:          00:56:56       Can we get that? The mic? Can I claim I snuck a third assumption? There's somebody, let me start over here. What was the third or something? I don't know if this was really poor, but they know how big the pie is. They know how big the pie. That's true. That's a big deal actually. It's true. But there's something else going on here. What else is going on here? Uh, we assume that both players are rational. We assume that that's true, but we missed. That's, we've kind of been assuming that throughout. Back in induction. You're right. None of this packet induction would apply so cleanly if we didn't just see in that. What else do I say? It's hidden. Actually I snuck it in. A discount factor is a constant. We are still just go have just a constant. That's true, but not just constant, but something else. You're on the right lines. They're the same, right? I've assumed here implicitly I've assumed that both people are equally in patient. They have the same discount factor,

Speaker 1:          00:57:56       the same discount factor. Delta one equals Delta suit. All right. Why does that matter? What does that think about it intuitively a second. Suppose that one of these players is very, very impatient. They need the money. Now. If it's cake, they need the cake. Now that very impatient and the other person is very patient, right? They can wait forever to get this bug and to come across. All right. Who Do you think's going to do better? The patient plan or the inpatient player, the patient is going to do better. I had the patient placement to do better. The way we ended up way we did all this analysis is we assumed that those discount factors were the same. We assumed that each person was discounting time at the same rate, perhaps because they were facing the same bank with the same interest rate, but in practice, often one side is going to be in a hurry to get the dispute resolved on the other side can sit around forever, right? And in that world, the side you can sit around forever is going to do much better. Alright, now we're going to look at relaxing this assumption and this assumption in particular, we're going to relax it

Speaker 1:          00:59:10       on a homework exercise. All right, so I knew a homework exercise. You're going to try redoing part of this analysis. Good practice anyway, but doing it in a setting where the where the discount factors are different.

Speaker 2:          00:59:27       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:59:29       so one thing we learned here was yes, you get an even split, but it depends. It depends on these three assumptions. All right, and it's kind of important because when you, when you think about bargaining, I think a lot of people simply assume intuitively that will, whenever the bargain is about, people will eventually split on the metal. When you're bargaining about a house and what price you're going to pay for a house, all these things, you kind of implicitly have this assumption they're going to end up splitting the difference. What I'm arguing here is you will split the difference and this natural bargaining game, but only under very special assumptions and in particular the assumption of patients

Speaker 2:          01:00:03       for sure. All right? All right.

Speaker 1:          01:00:09       There's another remarkable thing here though. It's also hidden. So not only did we end up with an even splits, but something else remarkable happened in this bargaining game. What was the other thing? Somewhat amazingly, very unrealistic thing that occurred in this bargaining game. Let's see. We can spot it. So one thing was an assumption I made and the other is actually a prediction. Yeah. So the first offer will be the offer that's accepted. Good, good. Everyone see that? So in this bargaining game, I set it up as alternating offer bargaining. So the image you had in your mind was of haggling. I made an offer. You guys thought about this offer, shall I take this off? Oh man, maybe I won't take this off and you make me an offer back to me and we kind of handles to and fro. But actually in the equilibrium of the game, none of that happened. That will happen in our mind. We thought about what offer we would make and we thought about what offer you would make back to me if I made you this offer and you were drafted it and so on. We did this backward induction exercise, but it was all in our heads, right in this, in this game. The actual prediction is

Speaker 1:          01:01:16       the very first offer is accepted. Very first offer is accepted. There's no haggling, there's no bargaining.

Speaker 2:          01:01:30       All right?

Speaker 1:          01:01:31       But that doesn't seem very realistic.

Speaker 2:          01:01:34       All right? There's no haggling.

Speaker 1:          01:01:44       Backward induction suggests that we should never see bargaining, but let me see what the actual process of pocketing. Well we should see is an offer is made and it's accepted. Now what is it about the real world that allows for haggling to take place? If this was the, if there was a model of the real world and we will leave it backward, induction, then we're done. So why is it in fact, in the real world we seek will see people make offers to and fro. What's different about the real world than this model?

Speaker 2:          01:02:17       All right, let's talk about it. A bet.

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       How many of you have a, you must have all bargain for something in the real world and none of you probably bargained for a house yet, but you want a bargain for cars, I think right in the, in the real world you make offers go to and fro, right? What's going on? Why are we getting off frigging offers in the real world? Whereas we don't in this game, what are we missing? Yeah, that's good. Let's trap it.

Speaker 2:          01:02:42       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:02:44       Uh, in the real world, you don't actually know what the other person discount factor is there for. You have uncertainty as to what your highest possible offer can be. Good. Good.

Speaker 1:          01:02:52       So in the real world, unlike the model on the board, not only are those discount factors different, but you probably don't know how patient or in patient, the other side is. You can get some ideas about how patients are patient. The other side is by looking at other characteristics. For example, for as long as you know that the person you're bargaining with over their car, you're trying to buy that car and they're a graduate student who's just got a job in a Adam, it was Pakistan or something and they ain't gonna take him to the car with them and they're leaving next week, you know, you know they're in a hurry. All right? So there's times when you're gonna know something about what other people discount factor is how patient they are, but lots of times you're not going to know. All right? So one thing is you just don't know what the discount factor is. By the way, what else might you not know about the other side? What else might you not know?

Speaker 3:          01:03:43       Yeah, how big the surpluses that you're splitting.

Speaker 1:          01:03:45       Good. You might not know this good that you're selling. You might not know. We've been talking about the being one pie, which you're carving up and everyone knows the size of the Pie, right? But in the real world, I might not know that this, this, this, this object that's being sold. I might not know how much this object is worth to the other side and he or she may not know how much it's worth to me. Alright, so that, that lack of information, lack of information is going to change the game considerably. In particular, I might want to turn down some offers in this game in order to appear like a patient person. Well, I might want to turn down some offers in the game in order to appear like somebody who doesn't really value this all very much. All right. And in so doing, I'm going to try and get you to make me a better offer all answering what's going on in handling and boggling bargaining according to this model. What's missing in this model is the idea that you don't know who it is you're bargaining with. You don't know how much they value the objects and question. You don't know how impatient they are to get away with the cash. All right? So it's a big assumption here. Very big assumption is that everything is known, right? So both the Dick both disc, both patients,

Speaker 2:          01:05:00       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:05:00       Things, uh, both the size of the pie. What is the value of the pie?

Speaker 2:          01:05:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:09       The value of the pie and the value of time is assumed to be known,

Speaker 2:          01:05:23       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:24       But in the real world, you typically don't know the value of the pie of the other side. And you typically don't know how much they value your time. All right? So that produces a whole literature on bargaining, none of which we really have time to do in this class. It's a pity because boggling, ton of important. So instead, I want to spend the last five minutes just introducing, uh, why is it really worth interesting in your topic in the last five minutes? Um, no, I don't think it is. Let me talk a little bit more about marketing rather than that.

Speaker 2:          01:05:51       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:05:52       All right. So what does this suggest? All right, what does this suggest if we're going out in the real world? All right. I'll actually take Mr. Taking this to reality, right? So one thing it suggests is people for whom it's noon, that they're going to be impatient. People for whom it's known that they desperately need this deal to go through are going to do less well in bargains. Right. We already knew people made it less one bonding cause cause they're less sophisticated players. But here he doesn't put that as sophisticated. They can be sophisticated you like, but they're just going to be in a, in a hurry. All right. We already talked about the greatest student who's meeting for us, Pakistan, right? But who else typically in bargaining is going to need, need cash now, who else is going to be a weaker position when that bargaining socially and in, in our society,

Speaker 1:          01:06:44       I'm trying to get this questions out here. Yeah. And Labor management, uh, disputes labor. So that's a good question. Right? It's a good question. In Labor management dispute, there's one going on right now in Hollywood. It's not clear that right. Could be. It could be the, it could be the management side who's in a hurry because they just need right now to get a in, um, David Alman, David David Edmunds stripped written or that would, that would tend to favor labor, but it could be the labor side. Why might it be the Labor side? So it never know this, there's this, there's this, there's a writer's strike going on in Hollywood right now. All right? So the people on the management side who are in the weakest position or the people who are in the most hardy to get this result, and those are guys with the fewest scripts in the pipeline and that tends to be late night TV shows. So those guys really want this thing settled fast there in a week. Bargaining position. On the other hand, the maybe a reason why Labor's in a week bargaining position. Why might labor being a week bargaining position relative to management

Speaker 1:          01:07:40       rents to pay, right? They have rents to pay that they have immediate demands on that cash right to the typical worker is typically poorer than your typical manager. Not always, but typically. All right. Are they just have to, they have to pay the rent. They have to feed. They have to feed that children. All right, so there's a more general idea that more generally in bargaining, the people who are poorer, typically we'll have this, isn't this poor in terms of income, it's poor in terms of wealth are going to have, I've got to be more impatient to get things resolved and that's going to put them in a weaker bargaining position. I got a second one. So in bilateral bargaining, right, having low wealth and being known to have low wealth puts you in a weaker position and that means that typically people who are poorer, I'm going to do less. Well though the late night TV show, maybe an exception.

Speaker 2:          01:08:28       All right. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:08:30       What makes you think a little bit about weather? Just setting up a bargaining position makes things equal for everybody. All right. Any other thoughts about who has strengthened, who has weakness and body? What are the, what are the kinds of stumps do we see people do in bargaining? What else? He's got a missing here that we need to think about, particularly if we want to do in this class. It's developed these ideas and take them to the real world. So one of the real world, real world things here are kind of missing.

Speaker 2:          01:08:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:08:57       Usually people make their first offer a lot higher than what they're actually willing to accept, right? So typically, typically you're right, typically people come, the typically bargaining isn't just a series of random numbers. Typically people start out high and then they can see towards the middle. Is that right? So if, if I, if I'm the buyer, I start out with a low price and come up. And if you're the seller, you start off with a high price and come down. All right. So again, that seems to be about establishing reputation and trying to indicate how much I want this. Good. All right. There's, uh, something worth staying here, which we haven't got time to doing this class and I hope you'll have time to take you to take the foot off plus one 56. We can actually show formally, but in a setting in which buyers and sellers are bargaining and buyers and sellers do not know how much the good is worth to the buyer or how much it cost to the silo.

Speaker 1:          01:09:48       Typically you can not expect to get efficiency. Let me say that again. All right? So it's kind of an important economic facts that were, that's missing from one 15 and unfortunately missing from this class. But if we go to a more real world setting in which people's values and not known, not only are the offers not accepted immediately, and not only is there something near Quincy in that the port and that be more impatient than that dude as well. But also you get, you get bad inefficiency and the inefficiency is occurs essentially because the sellers want to seem like that hard and the, and the buyers want to seem like that hard and you get a failure, you get a failed effort for deals to be made. All right? So some deals are actually going to be lost or take a long time in coming. You're gonna get some strikes before the deals occur. And that's all inefficient. Alright, so bargaining not in this model, but in the real world tends to lead to inefficiency. Alright, so I'll leave it there. We'll have an earliest lumps were all starving because the top change anyway.
