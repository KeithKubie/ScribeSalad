00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:01.966
- [Voiceover] The Empire State Building,

00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:05.083
the Sears Tower, the
Canadian National Tower,

00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:09.605
each of these structures
was the tallest in the world

00:00:09.605 --> 00:00:14.398
at the time they were built, or no errors.

00:00:14.398 --> 00:00:15.554
So, let's see.

00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:16.994
They list a bunch of structures here.

00:00:16.994 --> 00:00:19.450
The Empire State
Building, the Sears Tower,

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.389
the Canadian National Tower.

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:25.127
And then they talk about
each of these structures.

00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:26.706
So really they're talking about

00:00:26.706 --> 00:00:29.445
a singular subject right over here, each.

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:31.256
If they said all of these structures,

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:33.030
then we would talk about,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.969
we'd have a plural subject,

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.081
but they're saying, "Hey,
take one of these at a time,"

00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:39.250
each of these structures
and so this makes sense

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.963
that this is was 'cause
was would be the singular

00:00:41.963 --> 00:00:45.388
form of the verb, each
of these structures was,

00:00:45.388 --> 00:00:46.792
if this was all of these structures,

00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:48.333
then we'd put a were there.

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.512
They say each of these structures

00:00:49.512 --> 00:00:52.673
was the tallest in the world

00:00:52.673 --> 00:00:56.254
at the time they were built.

00:00:56.254 --> 00:00:57.888
Now, this is interesting.

00:00:57.888 --> 00:01:01.588
This is a singular subject,
singular verb, that makes sense,

00:01:01.588 --> 00:01:03.677
but then we shouldn't be
referring to they now,

00:01:03.677 --> 00:01:05.596
we're talking about
each of the structures,

00:01:05.596 --> 00:01:08.414
so it was really at the time it was built,

00:01:08.414 --> 00:01:11.614
at the time it was built.

00:01:11.614 --> 00:01:12.884
Remember, we're talking about each

00:01:12.884 --> 00:01:16.249
of the structures taken individually,

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:20.017
so each of these structures
was the tallest in the world

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:22.655
at the time it was built.

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:24.272
If you wanted to say they were built,

00:01:24.272 --> 00:01:26.482
you would have to say
all of these structures

00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:31.270
were the tallest in the world
at the time they were built,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.078
but we don't have the option of changing

00:01:33.078 --> 00:01:35.481
the each to the all right over here,

00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:38.314
so since we're talking
about a singular subject,

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:41.437
we would keep the was
and instead of they were,

00:01:41.437 --> 00:01:43.516
it would be an it was,

00:01:43.516 --> 00:01:45.321
so let's just read the
whole thing over again.

00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:47.713
The Empire State
Building, the Sears Tower,

00:01:47.713 --> 00:01:50.108
the Canadian National Tower,

00:01:50.108 --> 00:01:55.108
each of these structures
was the tallest in the world

00:01:55.352 --> 00:01:58.415
at the time it was built.

00:01:58.415 --> 00:02:00.897
Yep, error in part D.
