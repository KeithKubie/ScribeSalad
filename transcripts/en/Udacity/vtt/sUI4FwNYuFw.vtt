00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.566
Let's pretend for a second that instead of this inequality of x minus four times

00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:09.022
x plus four is greater than zero, that we had an equation instead. X minus four

00:00:09.022 --> 00:00:13.392
times x plus four is equal to zero. We saw before that the way we would treat

00:00:13.392 --> 00:00:18.000
this would be to look at the two different situations that would make the left

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.636
side equal to 0. This would happen if either x minus 4 is equal to 0, or if x

00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:27.337
plus 4 is equal to 0. My question for you is then whether or not we should do a

00:00:27.337 --> 00:00:32.470
similar thing in dealing with this inequality. Should our next step in moving to

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.245
a solution for x be to solve the two inequalities x minus 4 is greater than 0,

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:39.140
and x plus 4 is greater than 0?
