00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.580
Some very hairy mice are bringing us another
step closer to un-LOCKing a way to regenerate

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.590
a full head of hair.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.820
Did somebody say a pun?!

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.780
About 50% of men and 25% of women experience
at least partial hair loss by the age of 50,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.789
whether due to age, medical treatments, or
disease.

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.000
Current options for those looking to reverse
this loss include things like medications

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.749
that may slow hair loss and transplants from
hair follicles elsewhere on the body.

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:31.669
But neither have the often desired effect
of restoring a thick and full volume of hair.

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.370
Researchers have been optimizing techniques
for culturing “hair follicle germs” in

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.580
a dish for years.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.970
There are 2 key types of cells that help hair
follicles develop before we’re born -- epithelial

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.650
cells that help us create skin, and mesenchymal
cells that help us create a variety of connective

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.350
tissues -- so researchers copied this strategy
from the embryo into the lab and they got

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.000
hair follicles to grow!

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.370
Though, these techniques were never high yield
enough to produce the amount of follicles

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.400
needed to restore a full head of hair -- to
its previous luxurious glory -- until now…

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.320
Recently, Japanese researchers made improvements
to this protocol, and then designed a special,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.850
oxygen-permeable mini-chip to scale up the
farming of follicles, growing up to ~5000

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.130
at once.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.869
The “chip” isn’t like a computer chip
-- it’s a tiny polymer structure with little

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:17.929
wells in it.

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.539
They grow the follicles, add a collagen and
mesh layer for easy handling, and transplant

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.939
right to the head where hopefully, it takes
hold and grows like normal hair.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.570
They showed that transplanting these follicles
onto immunodeficient mice led to lots of new

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.109
hairs being formed within just 18 days!

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:40.030
They could easily transfer cells from their
chip to a collagen matrix for uniform transplant

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.240
with follicles nice and evenly spaced out,
which would make for practical harvesting

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.139
when it comes time to transplant cells grown
with these chips onto humans.

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:51.999
While these engineers made big progress in
the scale-up and efficiency of growing hair

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:56.639
follicles on a chip, their tests WERE all
done with immune-deficient mice.

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:00.460
But it’s not always a great idea to suppress
a human’s immune system.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.159
It leaves them vulnerable to infections.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.359
So, each patient would need their own personal
source of hair follicles…

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:13.250
Fortunately, hair follicles contain stem cells
capable of regenerating new hairs, among other

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.250
cells.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.799
Meaning that perhaps in the future instead
of transplanting follicles from another part

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.709
of the body, scientists can take a few follicles
from a patient, expand them in culture, then

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.870
transplant way more back onto your bald spot!

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.520
So, for those waiting eagerly for solutions,
they’re coming!

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.640
Keep putting sunscreen on the back of your
head.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.860
We have the machinery, scientists just need
a little more time to figure out the cells

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.810
that’ll grow in them.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.810
Before you go, everyone.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.450
This is SAM!

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.430
Sam is going to be on the channel more often
from now on, she’s amazing she studies neurobiology and I predict

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.500
-- like hair -- she’s going to grow on you!

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.930
That is an excellent/horrible pun.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.070
Hi everyone!

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.730
I’m super excited, I will need to up my
pun game for sure.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.730
Your puns are great.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.550
You can also find sam on instagram

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.550
Yep!

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.500
I’m @Science.Sam and I talk about
my work in Neuroscience and other science

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.400
communication topics all the time.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.540
Thanks for watching! Did you know that we shared our DNA with neanderthals?

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.080
And they shared it with us too, if you know what we mean. Watch this video to learn more?

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.320
Did you know theres a special word for something that produces hair?

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.080
It's called trichogenic, and insects and other arthropods have these cells too.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.840
Thanks again for watching Seeker!
