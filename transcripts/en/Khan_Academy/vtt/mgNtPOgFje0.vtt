00:00:00.728 --> 00:00:01.896
Voiceover: In the last video, we took the

00:00:01.896 --> 00:00:04.849
Maclaurin expansion of E to the X

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:08.870
and we saw that it looked
like it was some type a

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.871
combination of the
polynomial approximations

00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:15.272
of cosine of X and of sine of X.

00:00:15.272 --> 00:00:16.567
But it's not quite, because there's

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:18.319
a couple of negatives in there.

00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:20.847
If we were to add these
two together that we

00:00:20.847 --> 00:00:22.567
did not have when we took

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:25.778
the representation of E to the X.

00:00:25.778 --> 00:00:28.631
But to reconcile these,
I'll do a little bit of a

00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:30.879
I don't know if you can
even call it a trick.

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:35.593
Let's see if we take
this polynomial expansion

00:00:35.593 --> 00:00:38.567
of E to the X, this
approximation, what happens

00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:41.351
if we say E to the X is equal to this,

00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:43.908
especially as this
becomes an infinite number

00:00:43.908 --> 00:00:46.447
of terms and becomes
less of an approximation

00:00:46.447 --> 00:00:48.550
and more of an equality.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.954
What happens if I take
E to the IX and before

00:00:51.954 --> 00:00:53.863
that might have been kind
of a weird thing to do.

00:00:53.863 --> 00:00:57.663
Let me write it down, E to the IX.

00:00:57.663 --> 00:00:59.247
Because before, I said how do you define

00:00:59.247 --> 00:01:00.617
E to the Ith power?

00:01:00.617 --> 00:01:02.152
That's a very bizarre thing to do,

00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:04.254
take something to the XI power.

00:01:04.254 --> 00:01:05.933
How do you even comprehend some type

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.376
of a function like that.

00:01:07.376 --> 00:01:10.900
But now that we can have
a polynomial expansion

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.127
of E to the X, we can
maybe make sense of it.

00:01:13.127 --> 00:01:16.800
Because we can take I to different amounts

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.390
to different powers and
we know what that gives,

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.776
I squared is negative one, I
to the third is negative I,

00:01:20.776 --> 00:01:22.615
and so on and so forth.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.983
So what happens if we take E to the IX.

00:01:24.983 --> 00:01:27.255
So once again, just like
taking the X up here

00:01:27.255 --> 00:01:29.295
and replacing it with
an IX, so every where

00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:32.895
we see the X in it's
polynomial approximation,

00:01:32.895 --> 00:01:34.631
we would write an IX.

00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:35.887
So let's do that.

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:39.359
So E to the IX should be
approximately equal to,

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:41.230
and it will become more and more equal,

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.543
and this is more to give
you an intuition I'm not

00:01:42.543 --> 00:01:45.791
doing a rigorous proof here,
but it's still profound.

00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:47.656
Not to oversell it,
but I don't think I can

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:50.608
oversell what is about
to be discovered or seen

00:01:50.608 --> 00:01:56.310
in this video, it would
be equal to one plus

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.751
instead of an X will have
an IX, plus IX, plus,

00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:04.319
so what's IX squared?

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.224
So let me write this down.

00:02:06.224 --> 00:02:11.790
What is IX squared over two factorial?

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.584
Well I squared is going
to be negative one,

00:02:13.584 --> 00:02:16.346
and then you'd have X
squared over two factorials.

00:02:16.346 --> 00:02:21.105
It's going to be minus X
squared over two factorial,

00:02:21.105 --> 00:02:23.505
I think you might see
where this is going to go.

00:02:23.505 --> 00:02:26.140
And then what is IX?

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.287
Remember everywhere we saw an X,

00:02:27.287 --> 00:02:28.938
we're going to replace it with an IX.

00:02:28.938 --> 00:02:31.293
So what is IX to the third power?

00:02:31.293 --> 00:02:32.391
Actually let me write this out,

00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:34.863
let me not skip some steps over here.

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:40.872
So this is going to be IX
squared over two factorial,

00:02:40.872 --> 00:02:44.420
actually let me, I want
to do it just the way.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:52.820
So plus IX squared over two factorial,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.229
plus IX to the third over three factorial,

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:02.881
plus IX to the fourth over four factorial,

00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:07.940
and we can keep going,
plus IX to the fifth

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.370
over five factorial, and
we can just keep going

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.954
so on and so forth.

00:03:12.954 --> 00:03:15.682
Let's evaluate if these
IXs raised to these

00:03:15.682 --> 00:03:17.898
different powers.

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:23.371
So this will be equal to one plus IX,

00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:26.434
IX squared, that's the
same thing as I squared

00:03:26.434 --> 00:03:29.329
times X squared, I
squared is negative one.

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.247
So this is negative X
squared over two factorial,

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:36.487
and this is going to be the same thing as

00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:38.570
I to the third times X to the third.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.595
I to the third is the same thing as

00:03:40.676 --> 00:03:44.145
I squared times I, so it's
going to be negative I.

00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:47.737
So this is going to be minus I times X to

00:03:47.737 --> 00:03:51.518
the third over three factorial.

00:03:51.518 --> 00:03:56.651
So then plus, you're going to have,

00:03:56.651 --> 00:03:58.610
what's I to the fourth power?

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.358
So that's I squared squared.

00:04:01.358 --> 00:04:03.226
So that's negative one
squared, that's just

00:04:03.256 --> 00:04:03.926
going to be one.

00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:05.255
So I to the fourth is one and

00:04:05.255 --> 00:04:06.735
then you have X to the fourth.

00:04:06.735 --> 00:04:10.350
Plus X to the fourth over four factorial.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.639
And then you're going
to have, I don't even

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.359
write the plus yet, I to the fifth.

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.583
So I to the fifth is
going to be one times I,

00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:22.130
so it's going to be I times X to the fifth

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.842
over five factorials plus
I times X to the fifth

00:04:26.842 --> 00:04:28.225
over five factorial.

00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:29.906
I think you might see a pattern here.

00:04:29.906 --> 00:04:32.985
Coefficient is one, then
I, then negative one,

00:04:32.985 --> 00:04:38.946
then negative I, then one,
then I, then negative one,

00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:42.515
X to the sixth over six factorial,

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:48.618
and then negative IX to the seventh

00:04:48.618 --> 00:04:51.131
over seven factorial.

00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:54.114
So we have some terms,
some of them are imaginary,

00:04:54.114 --> 00:04:57.119
they're being multiplied by I.

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:58.600
Some of them are real.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.983
Why don't we separate them out?

00:05:02.983 --> 00:05:04.653
So once again, E to the IX, is going to be

00:05:04.653 --> 00:05:06.694
equal to this thing, especially as we add

00:05:06.694 --> 00:05:08.125
an infinite number of terms.

00:05:08.125 --> 00:05:11.741
Let's separate out the real
and the non-real terms.

00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:14.741
Or the real and the
imaginary terms I should say.

00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:20.294
So this is real, this
is real, this is real,

00:05:20.294 --> 00:05:23.732
and this right over here is real.

00:05:23.732 --> 00:05:27.445
And obviously we could
keep going on with that.

00:05:27.445 --> 00:05:30.210
So the real terms here are

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.261
one minus X squared over two factorial

00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:37.974
plus X to the fourth over four factorial,

00:05:37.974 --> 00:05:39.909
you might be getting excited now,

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.638
minus X to the sixth over six factorial

00:05:43.638 --> 00:05:45.261
and that's all I've done
here, but they would

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:47.941
keep going so plus so on and so forth.

00:05:47.941 --> 00:05:50.930
So that's all of the real terms.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.197
And what are the imaginary terms here.

00:05:52.197 --> 00:05:55.130
And I'll just factor out the I over here.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.503
Actually, let me just factor out.

00:05:56.503 --> 00:06:02.862
So it's going to be plus I times,
well this is IX, so this will be X.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:05.153
And then the next, so
that's an imaginary term,

00:06:05.153 --> 00:06:06.440
this is an imaginary term.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.733
We're factoring out the
I, so minus X to the third

00:06:09.733 --> 00:06:14.539
over three factorial, and then the next

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:15.862
imaginary term is right over there.

00:06:15.862 --> 00:06:19.908
We factor out the I,
plus X to the fifth over

00:06:19.908 --> 00:06:22.874
five factorial and then
the next imaginary term

00:06:22.874 --> 00:06:24.483
is right there, we factored out the I.

00:06:24.483 --> 00:06:29.948
So it's minus X to the
seventh over seven factorial.

00:06:29.948 --> 00:06:31.683
And then we would obviously keep going.

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:34.475
So plus minus keep going,
so on and so forth,

00:06:34.475 --> 00:06:36.372
preferably to infinite
so that we get as good

00:06:36.372 --> 00:06:38.603
of a approximation as possible.

00:06:38.603 --> 00:06:43.140
So we have a situation where E to the IX

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.275
is equal to all of this business here.

00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:50.371
But you probably remember
from the last two videos

00:06:50.371 --> 00:06:53.360
the real part, this was the polynomial,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.520
this was the Maclaurin
approximation of cosine

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.364
of X around I should say
the Taylor approximation

00:07:00.364 --> 00:07:02.300
around zero or you could also call it the

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.843
Maclaurin approximation.

00:07:03.843 --> 00:07:07.579
So this and this are the same thing.

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:11.219
So this is cosine of
X, especially when you

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:14.739
added an infinite power
of terms, cosine of X.

00:07:14.739 --> 00:07:18.873
This over here is sine of
X, the exact same thing.

00:07:18.873 --> 00:07:20.531
So it looks like we're
able to reconcile how

00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:23.300
you can add up cosine of X and sine of X

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.739
to get something that's like E of the X.

00:07:25.739 --> 00:07:29.245
This right here is sine of X.

00:07:29.245 --> 00:07:31.292
And so if we take it for granted,

00:07:31.292 --> 00:07:33.275
I'm not rigorously proving it to you,

00:07:33.275 --> 00:07:34.675
and if you were to take an infinite number

00:07:34.675 --> 00:07:36.963
of terms here that this
will essentially become

00:07:36.963 --> 00:07:39.360
cosine of X and if you
take an infinite number

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.219
of terms here this will become sine of X.

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:45.139
It leads to a fascinating formula.

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:50.499
We could say that E to the IX, is the same

00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:54.995
thing as cosine of X,
and you should be getting

00:07:54.995 --> 00:07:57.147
goose pimples right around now.

00:07:57.147 --> 00:08:02.764
is equal to cosine of X,
plus I times sine of X,

00:08:02.764 --> 00:08:08.039
This is Euler's Formula.

00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:12.777
And this right here is Euler's Formula.

00:08:12.777 --> 00:08:14.961
And if that by itself isn't exciting and

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:17.240
crazy enough for you,
because is really should be.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.152
Because we've already done
some pretty cool things.

00:08:19.152 --> 00:08:21.447
We're involving E, which we get from

00:08:21.447 --> 00:08:23.430
continuous compounding interest.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.430
We have cosine and sine
of X, which are ratios

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.344
of right triangles, it comes
out of the unit circle.

00:08:28.344 --> 00:08:30.447
And some how we've
thrown in the square root

00:08:30.447 --> 00:08:31.399
of negative one.

00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:34.526
There seems to be this
cool relationship here.

00:08:34.526 --> 00:08:37.940
But it becomes extra
cool, and we're going to

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.430
assume we're operating in radians here.

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:42.638
If we assume Euler's Formula, what happens

00:08:42.638 --> 00:08:44.998
when X is equal to pi?

00:08:44.998 --> 00:08:47.879
Just to throw in another
wacky number in there.

00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:49.479
The ratio between the circumference and

00:08:49.479 --> 00:08:50.878
the diameter of a cirle.

00:08:50.878 --> 00:08:52.887
What happens when we throw in pi?

00:08:52.887 --> 00:09:01.847
We get E to the Ipi is
equal to cosine of pi.

00:09:01.847 --> 00:09:06.469
Cosine of pi is what?

00:09:06.469 --> 00:09:10.920
Pi is half way around the unit circle,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.780
so cosine of pi is negative one and then

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:18.564
sine of pi is zero, so
this term goes away.

00:09:18.564 --> 00:09:20.676
So if you evaluated at pi
you get something amazing,

00:09:20.676 --> 00:09:25.057
it's called Euler's Identity.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.945
I always have trouble pronouncing Euler's.

00:09:27.945 --> 00:09:32.114
Euler's Identity, which
we could write like this,

00:09:32.114 --> 00:09:34.448
or we could add one to both sides and

00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:36.441
we could write it like this.

00:09:36.441 --> 00:09:39.267
And I'll write it in
different colors for emphasis.

00:09:39.267 --> 00:09:51.515
E to the I times pi plus one is equal to ,

00:09:51.515 --> 00:09:53.100
I'll do that in a neutral color,

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.149
is equal to, I'm just
adding one to both sides

00:09:55.149 --> 00:09:59.778
of this thing right over
here, is equal to zero.

00:09:59.778 --> 00:10:03.210
And this is thought provoking.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.273
I mean here we have, this
tells you that there's

00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:08.900
some connectedness to the universe that we

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.479
don't fully understand or at least I don't

00:10:10.479 --> 00:10:11.265
fully understand.

00:10:11.265 --> 00:10:13.843
I is defined by engineers
for simplicity so that

00:10:13.843 --> 00:10:16.593
they can find the roots of
all sorts of polynomials.

00:10:16.593 --> 00:10:23.349
As you could say the square
root of negative one.

00:10:23.349 --> 00:10:26.714
Pi is the ratio between the circumference

00:10:26.714 --> 00:10:28.794
of a circle and it's diameter.

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.233
Once again another interesting number but

00:10:30.233 --> 00:10:33.314
seems like it comes from
a different place as I.

00:10:33.314 --> 00:10:35.379
E comes from a bunch of different places.

00:10:35.379 --> 00:10:37.169
E you could either think of it comes out

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:39.546
of continuing compounding interest,

00:10:39.546 --> 00:10:41.913
super valuable for finance.

00:10:41.913 --> 00:10:43.688
It also comes from the
notion that the derivative

00:10:43.688 --> 00:10:45.256
of E to the X is also E to the X,

00:10:45.256 --> 00:10:46.960
another fascinating number.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.360
But once again seemingly
unrelated to how we came

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.482
up with I and seemingly unrelated

00:10:51.482 --> 00:10:53.789
with how we came up with pi.

00:10:53.789 --> 00:10:56.266
And then of course you
have some of the most

00:10:56.266 --> 00:10:58.561
profound basic numbers right over here.

00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:00.305
You have one, I don't have to explain

00:11:00.305 --> 00:11:01.896
why one is a cool number.

00:11:01.896 --> 00:11:05.264
And I shouldn't have to explain
why zero is a cool number.

00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:06.913
And so this right here connects all

00:11:06.913 --> 00:11:11.688
of these fundamental
numbers in some mystical

00:11:11.688 --> 00:11:12.976
way that shows that there's some

00:11:12.976 --> 00:11:15.538
connectedness to the universe.

00:11:15.538 --> 00:11:22.410
So frankly, if this
does not blow your mind,

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:26.288
you really have no emotion.
