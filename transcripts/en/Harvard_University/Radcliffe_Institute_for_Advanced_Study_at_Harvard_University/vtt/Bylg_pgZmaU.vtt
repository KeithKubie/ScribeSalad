00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.740
- Good afternoon,
everybody, and welcome back.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.675
So let me introduce our
distinguished keynote speaker.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.910
Jhumpa Lahiri is a professor
of creative writing

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.690
at the Lewis Center for the
Arts at Princeton University.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.150
She received a
Pulitzer Prize in 2000

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.310
for her debut story collection,
Interpreter of Maladies.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.890
Her followup novel,
The Namesake, in 2003

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.460
was adapted for
the screen in 2007.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.040
Her book of short stories,
Unaccustomed Earth--

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.680
which was being read by the
woman next to me on the plane

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.090
on a return trip from Newark
Airport, which was just

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.600
about the only part of that
trip that was interesting to me.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.590
Nothing against Newark.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.000
That received the 2008 Frank
O'Connor International Short

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.470
Story Award.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.420
Finally, her book The
Lowland, Random House 2013,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.120
also won the 2015 DSC Prize
for South Asian Literature.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.180
After reading her
keynote, Jhumpa

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.150
will be accompanied
in conversation

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.020
by Celeste Ng, who is the
internationally best selling

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.230
author of the novels
Everything I Never Told You,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.990
and Little Fires Everywhere.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.810
She is a Harvard
graduate and also has

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.300
received her MFA from the
University of Michigan.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.310
And she has the coolest
Twitter handle ever.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.065
Jhumpa.

00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:44.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.250
Oh, no, no.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.760
They have to guess.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.264
It's pronounced Ng.

00:01:49.264 --> 00:01:50.680
But I should have
let you do that.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.780
I'm so sorry.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.450
Jhumpa Lahiri.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:02.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.620
- Thank you.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.920
Good afternoon.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.680
I am honored to be here.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.900
And I want to thank everyone
at Radcliffe for inviting me.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.140
I feel like I've been
in this room before.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.740
Is that possible?

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.710
I think I might have been here
when The Namesake came out.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.300
And I believe I read here.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.707
Anyway, I feel very comfortable.

00:02:27.707 --> 00:02:28.540
That's a good thing.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.020
I'm looking forward to my
conversation with Celeste.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.620
And as a point of
departure, I'd like

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.390
to read a short story that was
published a couple of months

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.910
ago in The New Yorker magazine.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.960
It's called "The Boundary."

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.030
This is a story I
wrote originally

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:03.430
in Italian three years ago
when I was living in Rome.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.040
And it was published in
Italian, in the Italian version

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.400
of Granta magazine, which,
sadly, is no longer in print.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.340
Last fall in Princeton, I
decided to translate it myself

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.680
into English.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.840
And this is the result. The
title of the story in Italian

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.590
is [ITALIAN],, which is the
word for a boundary, a border.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.180
And so I chose "The Boundary"
as the English title.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.430
Every Saturday a new
family comes to stay.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.280
Some arrive early in
the morning from afar,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.710
ready to begin their vacation.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.820
Others don't turn up until
sunset in bad moods, maybe

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.880
having lost their way.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.440
It's easy to get
lost in these hills.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.190
The roads are poorly signposted.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.180
Today, after they introduce
themselves, I show them around.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.160
My mother used to
do the welcoming,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.700
but she's spending the summers
in a nearby town helping out

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.640
an elderly gentleman
who's also on vacation.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.170
So I have to do it.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.170
As usual, there are four
of them, mother, father,

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.710
two daughters.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.080
They follow me, their eyes wide,
happy to stretch their legs.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.690
We stop for a moment on the
shaded patio that looks out

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.740
over the lawn under a thatched
roof that filters the light.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.040
There are two armchairs and a
sofa covered with white fabric,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.090
lounge chairs for sunbathing,
and a wooden table big enough

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.880
for 10 people.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.880
I open the sliding glass
door and show them inside.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.580
The cozy living room with two
comfortable sofas in front

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.700
of the fireplace, the
well-stocked kitchen,

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.230
two bedrooms.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.910
While the father
unloads the car,

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.610
and the girls who are
probably around seven and nine

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.420
disappear into their room,
shutting the door behind them,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.570
I tell the mother where to
find extra towels and woolen

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.220
blankets in case it
gets cold at night.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.860
I show her where the
mouse poison is hidden.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.710
Kill the flies before
going to bed, I suggest.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.400
Otherwise they start buzzing
at dawn and become a nuisance.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.770
I explain how to get
to the supermarket, how

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.560
to use the washing
machine behind the house,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.870
and where to hang
the laundry, just

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.040
on the other side of
my father's garden.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.220
Guests are free to pick
lettuce and tomatoes, I add.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.100
There were lots of tomatoes
this year, but most of them

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.940
spoiled in the July rain.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.990
I pretend not to watch
them, to be discreet.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.150
I do the housework
and water the garden.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.960
But I can't help noticing how
happy and excited they are.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.780
I hear the girls' voices as
they run across the lawn.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.550
I learn their names.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.340
Since the guests usually
leave the sliding door open,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.040
I overhear what the
parents say to each other

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.790
as they settle into the house,
as they unpack their suitcases

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.990
and decide what
to have for lunch.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.670
The cottage where
my family lives

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.490
is a few yards away,
behind a tall hedge

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.950
that forms a kind screen.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.780
For years our house
was just a room

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.530
that served as both kitchen and
bedroom for the three of us.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.900
Then, two years ago
when I turned 13,

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.840
my mother started working
for the elderly gentleman.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.730
And after saving
up enough money,

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.790
my parents asked the man who
owns the property if they

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.730
could add a small room for me.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.880
My father is the caretaker.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.670
He looks after the big
house, chops the wood,

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.770
works the fields
and the vineyard.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.000
He looks after the horses, which
the owner loves with a passion.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.150
The owner lives abroad, but
he's not a foreigner like us.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.760
He comes every now
and then on his own.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.290
He doesn't have a family.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.660
During the days, he
goes horseback riding.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.480
In the evenings, he reads
in front of the fireplace.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.480
Then he goes away again.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.740
Not many people rent his
house other than in summer.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.820
The winters here are biting, and
in spring there's lots of rain.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.620
In the mornings from
September to June,

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.770
my father drives me to school
where I feel out of place.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.240
I don't mix easily with others.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.270
I don't look like anyone else.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.440
The girls in this family
resemble each other.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.800
You can tell right away
that they're sisters.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.720
They've already put on
matching bathing suits

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.730
to go to the beach later on.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.490
The beach is about
15 miles from here.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.350
The mother looks
like a girl, too.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.460
She's small and thin.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.820
She wears her long hair loose.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.500
Her shoulders are delicate.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.930
She walks barefoot on the
grass, even though the father

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.000
tells her not to, saying--

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.740
and he's right-- that
there might be porcupines,

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.030
hornets, snakes.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.119
After a few hours, it's as
if they've always lived here.

00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:55.160
The things they brought
for a week in the country

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.100
are scattered all over the
place, books, magazines,

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.410
a laptop computer,
dolls, hoodies,

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.640
colored pencils, pads of
paper, flip-flops, sunscreen.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.100
At lunch, I hear
fork striking plates.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.370
I notice each time one of them
sets down a glass on the table.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.310
I detect the calm thread
of their conversation,

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.200
the sound and smell
of the coffee pot,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.840
smoke from a cigarette.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.330
After lunch, the father
asks one of the girls

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.160
to bring him his glasses.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.500
For a long time he
studies a roadmap.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.520
He list small towns to visit
nearby, archaeological sites,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.780
ruins.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.910
The mother isn't interested.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.580
She says, this is her
only week of the year

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.539
without appointments
and obligations.

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:41.539
Later on, the father heads off
to the sea with his daughters.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:45.030
He asks me as they're leaving
how long it takes to get there.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.210
Which of the beaches is nicest?

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.790
He asks me about the weather
forecast for the week,

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.230
and I tell him there
is a heat wave coming.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.060
The mother stays home.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.450
She's put on her bathing
suit anyway to get some sun.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.330
She stretches out on one
of the lounge chairs.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.380
I assume she's
going to take a nap.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.930
But when I go to
hang up the wash,

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.210
I see her writing something.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:12.270
She writes by hand in a little
notebook resting on her thighs.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.520
Now and then, she lifts
her head and looks intently

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.860
at the landscape
that surrounds us.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.950
She stares at the various
greens of the lawn, the hills,

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.220
the woods in the distance,
the glaring blue of the sky,

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.260
the yellow hay,
the bleached fence,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.980
and the low stone wall that
marks the property line.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.880
She studies everything
I look at every day.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.920
But I wonder what
else she sees in it.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.480
When the sun starts
to go down, they

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.030
put on sweaters and long
pants to shield themselves

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.620
from mosquitoes.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.630
The father and the girls have
wet hair from the hot showers

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.120
they took after the beach.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.250
The girls tell their
mother about their trip,

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:53.330
the burning sand, the
slightly murky water,

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.940
the gentle, disappointing waves.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.430
The whole family goes
for a short walk.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.410
They go to look at the
horses, the donkeys,

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.687
a wild boar kept in a
pen behind the stables.

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:05.270
They go to see the
flock of sheep that

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.440
passes in front of the house
every day around this time,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.290
blocking for a few minutes
the cars on the dusty road.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.060
The father keeps taking
pictures with his cell phone.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.030
He shows the girls
the small plum trees,

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.980
the fig trees, the olives.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.380
He says, fruit picked
straight from the tree

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.180
tastes different
because it smells

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.280
of the sun, the countryside.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.870
Parents open a bottle
of wine on the patio.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.150
They taste some cheese,
the local honey.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.040
They admire the
blazing landscape

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.470
and marvel at the
huge glowing clouds

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:42.090
the color of
pomegranates in October.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.320
Evening falls.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.032
They hear frogs, crickets,
the rustle of the wind.

00:10:46.032 --> 00:10:47.490
In spite of the
breeze, they decide

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.410
to eat outside to take advantage
of the lingering light.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.810
My father and I eat
inside in silence.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.390
He doesn't look up when he eats.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.920
With my mother away, there is
no conversation during dinner.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.720
She is the one who
talks at meals.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.060
My mother can't
stand this place.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.550
Like my father, she comes
from much farther away

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.070
than anyone who vacations here.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.870
She hates living
in this country,

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.530
in the middle of nowhere.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.530
She says that the
people here aren't nice,

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.960
that they're closed.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.696
I don't miss her complaining.

00:11:19.696 --> 00:11:22.070
I don't like listening to her,
even though she's probably

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.120
right.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.040
Sometimes when she
complains too much,

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.870
my father sleeps in the car
instead of in bed with her.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.030
After dinner, the girls
wander around the lawn

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.680
following fireflies.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.450
They play with
their flashlights.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.930
The parents sit on the patio
contemplating the starry sky,

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.820
the intense darkness.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.340
The mother sips some
hot water with lemon.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.740
The father, a little grappa.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.250
They say that being here is all
they need, that even the air is

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.080
different, that it cleanses.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.240
How lovely, they
say, being together

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.254
like this, away from everyone.

00:11:57.254 --> 00:11:59.420
First thing in the morning,
I go to the chicken coop

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.740
to gather eggs.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.900
They're warm and pale, filthy.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.880
I put a few in a
bowl and bring them

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.980
to the guests for breakfast.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.780
Normally, there's no
one around, and I just

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.030
leave them on the patio table.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.700
But then I notice
through the sliding door

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.010
that the girls
are already awake.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.500
I see bags of cookies
on the sofa, crumbs,

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.380
a cereal box overturned
on the coffee table.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.800
The girls are trying to swat
the flies that buzz around

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.510
the house in the morning.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.840
The older one is
holding the flyswatter.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.610
The little sister, frustrated,
complains that she's still

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.020
waiting for her turn.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.352
She says she wants
to swat them, too.

00:12:36.352 --> 00:12:38.980
I put down the eggs and
go back to our house.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.550
Then I knock on their door and
lend the girls our flyswatter.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.380
That way they're both happy.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.810
I don't repeat the fact that
it's better to kill the flies

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.550
before you go to bed.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.410
It's clear that
they're having fun,

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.270
while the parents, in
spite of the annoying

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:57.300
flies and the girls'
racket, continue sleeping.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.060
After two days, a
predictable routine sets in.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.450
In the late morning, the
father goes to the cafe in town

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.960
to buy milk and the paper,
to get a second coffee.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.630
He pops over to the
supermarket if need be.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.600
When he gets back, he
goes running in the hills

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.410
despite the humidity.

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.110
One time, he comes home
rattled after crossing paths

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.830
with a sheepdog that blocked his
way, even though, in the end,

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.200
nothing happened.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.560
The mother does what I do.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.400
She sweeps the floor,
cooks, washes dishes.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.250
At least once a day, she
hangs up the laundry.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.160
Our clothes mingle and
dry on a shared line.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.530
She tells her husband,
clasping the laundry basket

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.410
in her arms, how
happy this makes her.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.110
Since they live in the city
in a crowded apartment,

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:44.630
she can never hang their clothes
out in the open like this.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.450
After lunch, the father
takes the girls to the beach,

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.500
and the mother stays home alone.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.680
She stretches out and
smokes a cigarette,

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.380
writing in her notebook with
an air of concentration.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.120
One day back from
the beach, the girls

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.310
run around for hours
trying to catch crickets

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:01.870
that jump through the grass.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.190
They snatch them up.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.220
They put a few in a jar with
little pieces of tomato stolen

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.960
from their parents' salads.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.750
They turn them into
pets, even naming them.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.910
The next day, the
crickets die, suffocated

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.280
in the jar, and the girls cry.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.470
They bury them under
one of the plum trees

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.280
and put some wildflowers on top.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.020
Another day, the
father discovers

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.470
that one of the flip-flops
he's left outside is missing.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.700
I tell him that a
fox probably took it.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.970
There's been one
prowling around.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.030
I tell my father, who knows
the habits and hideouts of all

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.580
the animals around
here, and he manages

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.950
to find the shoe,
along with a ball

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:42.320
and a shopping bag abandoned
by the previous family.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.470
I realize how much the guests
like this rural, unchanging

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.660
landscape, how much
they appreciate

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:53.570
every detail, how these things
help them think, rest, dream.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.612
When the girls pick
blackberries staining

00:14:55.612 --> 00:14:57.070
the pretty dresses
they're wearing,

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.780
the mother doesn't
get mad at them.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.200
Instead, she laughs.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.230
She asks the father
to take a picture

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.530
and then throws the
dresses in the wash.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.470
At the same time, I wonder what
they know about the loneliness

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.670
here.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.370
What do they know about
the days always the same

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.650
in our dilapidated cottage?

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.020
The nights when the wind
blows so hard the earth

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.980
seems to shake, or when the
sound of rain keeps me awake?

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.200
The months we live
alone among the hills,

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.180
the horses, the
insects, the birds that

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.860
pass over the fields?

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.790
Would they like the harsh quiet
that rains here all winter?

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.660
On the last night,
more cars arrive.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.700
Friends of the parents
have been invited along

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.700
with their children, who
run around on the meadow.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.800
A couple of people report
that the traffic was

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.720
light coming in from the city.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.610
The adults take a
look around the house

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:46.840
and walk in the garden.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:51.470
At sunset, the table on
the patio is already set.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.880
I hear everything as they eat.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.940
The laughter and chatter
are louder tonight.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.800
The family relates
all their mishaps

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.900
in the country, the
tomato eating crickets,

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.900
the funeral under the plum
tree, the sheepdog, the fox that

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.240
carried off the flip-flop.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.030
The mother says that being in
touch with nature like this

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.840
has been good for the girls.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.870
At a certain point, a cake
comes out with candles,

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:16.150
and I realize it's
the father's birthday.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.920
He's turning 45.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.220
Everyone sings, and
they slice the cake.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.370
My father and I finish
up some overripe grapes.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:25.810
I'm about to clear
the table when

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.350
I hear a knock at the door.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.830
I see the girls,
hesitant, out of breath.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.410
They give me a plate with
two slices of cake on it,

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.600
one for me and
one for my father.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.760
They dash off before
I can say thanks.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.870
We eat the cake while the guests
talk about politics, trips,

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.280
life in the city.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.977
Someone asks the mother
where she got the cake.

00:16:45.977 --> 00:16:47.810
It came from a bakery
in their neighborhood,

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.290
she says, adding that one of
the other guests brought it up.

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:53.270
She mentions the
name of the bakery,

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.120
the piazza where it's situated.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.360
My father lays down his
fork and lowers his head.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.800
His eyes are agitated
when he looks at me.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.590
He gets up abruptly
and then steps out

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:07.849
to smoke a cigarette unobserved.

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:09.800
We used to live
in the city, too.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.619
My father sold flowers
in that very piazza.

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:14.720
My mother used to help.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.880
They spent their days
next to each other

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.910
in a small but pleasant
stand, arranging bouquets

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.040
that people took home
to decorate their tables

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.869
and terraces.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:25.280
New to this country,
they learned

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.810
the names of the flowers.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:30.620
Rose, sunflower,
carnation, daisy.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:35.030
They kept them, there stems
submerged in rows of buckets.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.370
One night, three men showed up.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:38.600
My father was alone.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.400
My mother, pregnant
with me at the time,

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.310
was at home because he didn't
want her to work at night.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.240
It was late.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.430
The other stores around
the piazza were closed,

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.960
and my father was about
to lower his grate.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.970
One of the men asked
him to open up again,

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.850
saying that he was about to
go and see his girlfriend.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.950
He wanted a nice bouquet.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.900
My father agreed that
he'd make him one,

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:03.220
even though the men were
rude, a little drunk.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.780
When my father held
up the bouquet,

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.120
the man said that it
was skimpy and asked

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.800
him to make it bigger.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.800
My father added more flowers,
an excessive number of them,

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.900
until the man was satisfied.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.060
He wrapped paper
around the bouquet,

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.790
then he bound it up with
colored ribbon, tying a bow.

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.130
He told him the price.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.440
The man pulled some
money out of his wallet.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.820
It wasn't enough.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.220
And when my father refused
to hand over the bouquet,

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.160
the man told him that he was
an idiot, that he didn't even

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.220
know how to put together a nice
bouquet for a beautiful girl.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.160
Then together with the other,
he started beating my father

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.870
until his mouth
filled with blood,

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:42.490
until his front
teeth were shattered.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.250
My father yelled, but at
that hour no one heard.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.650
They said, go back to
wherever you came from.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:51.740
They took the bouquet and left
him like that on the ground.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.650
My father went to
the emergency room.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:56.320
He couldn't eat solid
foods for a year.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.840
After I was born, when he
saw me for the first time,

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.720
he couldn't say a word.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.790
Ever since, he's
struggled to speak.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:07.000
He garbles his words as
if he were an old man.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.850
He's ashamed to smile
because of his missing teeth.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.439
My mother and I understand
him, but others don't.

00:19:12.439 --> 00:19:14.230
They think since he is
a foreigner, that he

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:15.850
doesn't speak the language.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:19.480
Sometimes they even
think he's mute.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.910
When the pears and red apples
that grow in the garden

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.480
are ripe, we cut them into thin
slices, almost transparent,

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.880
so he can savor them.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.120
One of his compatriots
told him about this job

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.860
in this secluded place.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.050
He wasn't familiar
with the countryside.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.740
He'd always lived in cities.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.380
He can live and work here
without opening his mouth.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.450
He's not afraid
of being attacked.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:46.010
He prefers to live among the
animals, cultivating the land.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:51.410
He's become used to this
untamed place that protects him.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.570
When he talks to me as
he drives me to school,

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.850
he always says the same
thing, that he couldn't

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.230
make anything of his life.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.560
All he wants me to do is
study and finish school,

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.960
go to college, and then
go far away from them.

00:20:05.524 --> 00:20:06.940
The next day, late
in the morning,

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.650
the father starts
to load the car.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.070
I see four people, tanned,
even more closely knit.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:13.894
They don't want to leave.

00:20:13.894 --> 00:20:15.310
At breakfast, they
say that they'd

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.350
like to come back next year.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.350
Nearly all the guests say
the same thing when they go.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:21.970
A few faithfully return.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.260
But for most of
them, once is enough.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.820
Before heading out,
the mother shows

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.570
me the stuff in the
fridge that they don't

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.480
want to take back to the city.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.660
She tells me that she has
grown quite fond of this house,

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.550
that she already misses it.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.290
Maybe when she's
feeling stressed

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:40.080
or overwhelmed by work,
she'll think of this place.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.060
The clean air, the hills,
the clouds blazing at sunset.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.120
I wish the family safe
travels and say goodbye.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.970
I stand there waiting until
the car's out of sight.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.490
Then I start to prepare the
house for the new family that's

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.380
supposed to get here tomorrow.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.380
I make the beds.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.340
I tidy the room the
girls turned upside down.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.960
I sweep the flies they swatted.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.050
They've forgotten--
or left on purpose--

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.370
a few things they don't
need, things I hold onto.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.710
Pictures the girls grew,
shells they picked up

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:14.970
at the beach, the last drops
of a perfumed shower gel,

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.490
shopping lists in the
faint, small script

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.550
that the mother used on
other sheets of paper

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:23.532
to write all about us.

00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:25.020
Thank you.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:46.802
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:46.802 --> 00:21:49.010
- Jhumpa, thank you so much
for that beautiful story.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.220
I think it touches on
so many of the topics

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.830
that this conference
is about and that we

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.750
talked about in some
of the earlier panels.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.390
But first, I want to ask
you just some questions

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:03.300
about this story.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.430
Can you tell us how you
came to write this story,

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.830
if there was something that
sort of sparked it in your mind,

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.730
or how you came to write it?

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:19.330
- I came to write it because
I was living in Rome.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:25.350
And one of the lovely
things about my life in Rome

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:30.750
is that every day I end up
speaking inevitably all three

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.310
of the languages that I speak.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.410
I speak Italian when
I go out of the house.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:41.070
I speak English inside
the house with my family.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:49.410
And I speak Bengali
with many, many people

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:52.900
from Bangladesh
who live in Rome,

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:57.570
who work all over the
place in Trastevere, which

00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.650
is the neighborhood we live in.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:06.660
They sell things in makeshift
stalls on the streets.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.990
Everything from
shoes and suitcases,

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.030
to bed sheets and tablecloths.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.200
They work in the markets.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.890
They peel the vegetables.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:17.850
The butcher shops.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:21.150
In any case, they form part of--

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.120
the Bangladeshi community
forms part of my day

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:32.540
to day life in almost every
establishment that I frequent.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.850
And I talk to them.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.460
I ask them what they
like, what they don't

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.230
like about living in Rome.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.430
And from the very
beginning, I heard

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:53.290
a lot of troubling
impressions, anecdotes.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:58.610
And this grew out of--

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:07.550
I mean, that moment at the end
of the story, that violent act,

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:12.815
is based on something I
heard one man tell me about.

00:24:15.099 --> 00:24:16.640
He actually worked
in the flower shop

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.300
I used to go to all the
time to buy flowers.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.440
This had happened to him
in another neighborhood,

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.060
not in our neighborhood.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.230
And it was something I heard
quite early on in my life

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:28.775
there, and it stayed with me.

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.900
And then some years
later, I was on vacation

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.790
with my family in a
place called Capalbio,

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:44.060
which is about two hours
north of Rome, right

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.970
over the border in Tuscany.

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.910
But not the sort of
Tuscany people think of,

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.670
most people think of.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:58.430
A more kind of Cape Cod-like
Tuscany, if you will.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.570
And we were there.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:05.090
And we were renting
a friend's house.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:08.780
And I was very aware of
the caretaker's daughter,

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.170
who was a young girl, very
small child at the time.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:16.010
She was very curious
about my kids

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:20.030
and would pop out sometimes
from their little house,

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:21.820
venture out to say hello.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:26.360
And I spent most of the
vacation thinking about her

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.750
and wondering what her life
would be like in 10 years.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:34.060
So the story was
inspired by that.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.910
- You mentioned that
one of the stories

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.840
that worked its way into this
piece you heard some years ago.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.300
Of course, stories like
that, unfortunately,

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.289
have happened all over
the place and have

00:25:45.289 --> 00:25:46.330
happened for a long time.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.340
And I think we're
starting to hear

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.510
more with more stories of
violence against immigrants,

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:52.510
at least here in the US.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:57.089
Especially now, but
elsewhere as well as right

00:25:57.089 --> 00:25:59.005
wing parties have started
to assert themselves

00:25:59.005 --> 00:26:01.402
all over the place.

00:26:01.402 --> 00:26:02.860
When I told people
that I was going

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.930
to get to speak with
you today, and I said,

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.263
she's going to be reading
this story that was in The New

00:26:07.263 --> 00:26:09.187
Yorker, many people
got very excited

00:26:09.187 --> 00:26:10.520
because they had read the story.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.890
And in talking with friends
and other writers, many of them

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.500
assume that the story
took place in Italy.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.590
Because it mentions that it's
translated from the Italian,

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:23.320
because you're known
to live in Italy.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.000
But in the story
itself, the location

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.220
is sort of deliberately
unspecified,

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:31.600
as is the home nation of
the narrator and her family.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.450
And the truth is that it could
almost take place anywhere,

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:36.790
including even in the US.

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:38.920
And I'm curious
about your decision

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.520
to not name the two central
locations in the story, where

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:46.140
it takes place and then where
the family itself is from.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.580
It's such an interesting choice.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.350
- Well, yeah, it is a choice.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.050
And it's something I've
been choosing to do or not

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:57.720
do for some years now.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.020
I think all of my
Italian writing

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:09.570
has been taking place in an
invented space, if you will.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:19.470
It was interesting because I
asked my son, who's almost 16,

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.770
if he wanted to read the story.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:25.490
Because he was sort of vaguely
aware that it had come out.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:30.290
I think he saw it, or heard
me and my husband talking

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.347
about it, or something.

00:27:32.347 --> 00:27:34.680
So I said, well, you know,
if you want, you can read it.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.384
It's pretty short.

00:27:36.384 --> 00:27:38.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.580
And he said, sure, OK.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.750
And he read it.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:48.430
And I said, could you
recognize where it took place?

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:51.940
And he said,
Wellfleet, Cape Cod,

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:55.000
where they actually-- my kids
and my husband are right now.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.810
And I'm going to
join them tomorrow.

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:01.400
And it is a place--

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.660
we used to go there
much more often.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.780
It's a place we love
very much and a place

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.890
in which we feel a little bit
like the family in that story.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:15.640
And we have that kind of
relationship with the place.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.750
I think the story is very
much about how people--

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:23.050
how a single place can be
read in so many different ways

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:27.460
and experienced in different
ways, depending on who you are

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:32.315
and the things we project on to
places that aren't necessarily

00:28:32.315 --> 00:28:32.815
ours.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.540
But the reason I don't want
to name the place, to specify

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.000
the place-- even
though, yes, it was

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.410
inspired by this small
town called Capalbio,

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:54.170
which is in Italy, which is in
this part of the planet Earth.

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:57.050
And there are some--
some Italian friends

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:59.160
read it and say, ah, Capalbio.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.190
And they know right away.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:02.780
And others aren't so sure.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.990
But I really feel very
strongly right now

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:11.316
about leaving the specificity--

00:29:11.316 --> 00:29:14.600
just to leave it
entirely open in terms

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.820
of where the story is placed.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:23.570
And I think this is
probably my own desire

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:34.220
to liberate myself from a
certain weight I feel in terms

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:39.470
of being connected to specific
geographical and cultural

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:41.600
points of reference.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.677
- And I think in doing
that also, like you said,

00:29:43.677 --> 00:29:46.010
it sort of allows other people
to overlay their own sort

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.843
of experience in it.

00:29:46.843 --> 00:29:48.830
Like your son seeing
Wellfleet in there,

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.380
which is a place that I
happen to know as well.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.420
And for other
people, too, I think

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:57.440
to sort of make their own
meaning out of the story.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.580
This is sort of the larger
questions of the conference.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.530
In an interview with The
New Yorker about this story,

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:07.160
you mentioned that you do think
of this as a political story.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.930
And I think they had
asked you, do you

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.450
see this as a
political story or do

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:11.810
you see it as something else?

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.370
And you had a wonderful quote.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:17.960
You said, all my work is about
identity, about belonging.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.900
And therefore, all of my
work may be read politically.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.290
And I love what you said about
that idea of the point of view

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:26.350
shift, where--

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:29.390
I think a lot of
times people will say

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:31.599
that something is political.

00:30:31.599 --> 00:30:33.890
And I'm curious about what
your thoughts are about what

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:34.880
political writing is.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.040
Do you think that there
is such a thing as writing

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.020
that isn't political?

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.050
So there's a big question.

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:43.270
- That is a big question.

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:47.890
I mean, I think
certainly most of my work

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:51.280
can be looked at through that.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:57.400
I mean, I'm not writing it with
any specific intent, message,

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.780
anything like that.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:04.660
But I think it would be naive
to not think of that reality.

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:12.610
I remember when I was
growing up, my father--

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:19.320
so my family and I moved
to Cambridge in 1969.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.490
And he would say now
and then, well, it's

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:27.360
thanks to President
Nixon that we're here.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.440
And I remember
growing up thinking,

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.400
why is my dad saying that?

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.690
Why is this even relevant?

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:35.040
And Nixon's bad.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.740
Why do we have to
talk about this?

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.140
But then I realized
what he was getting at,

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:44.490
that it's all about laws, it's
all about immigration laws.

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.610
And it's all about these
political realities.

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.560
It's about governments
making decisions

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:55.800
about how to negotiate
their borders.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.640
And so, yes, as a result of
that law, and that moment,

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.250
and those policies, in
that time, in that year,

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.460
my father got the
clearance to come

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.850
with his wife and his
daughter to the United States.

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:12.480
And there they remained.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.460
But I think for
someone who is actually

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:20.140
doing the border crossing,
you never lose sight of that

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.600
no matter who's in
charge at the moment,

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.160
even if it's Richard Nixon.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:28.810
You sort of have that sense of--
that weird sense of gratitude

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.060
that the doors opened for you.

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.320
And it is political.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.600
- Yeah, I think it's--

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.850
what you're saying reminds
me that it's very difficult

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:41.830
to separate the context in which
your work is being inspired

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:44.692
or is taking place from
what the work itself is.

00:32:44.692 --> 00:32:46.900
And I don't know that that's
even necessarily a thing

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.810
that we want to do.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.090
One of the things that
I find myself struggling

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:55.090
with as a writer is, as
you say, when people view

00:32:55.090 --> 00:33:01.300
your work through this political
lens, of trying to figure out

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.800
what I as a fiction writer--

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.860
I spend my day making
up stories about people.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.140
So as a friend of mine
said, I'm spending my day

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.600
with imaginary people
in imaginary places

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.740
doing imaginary stuff.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.710
But at the same time, I hope
that the work that I'm creating

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:20.860
and that you're creating speaks
to the world that we're in.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:24.514
And being in that
strange border area

00:33:24.514 --> 00:33:25.930
has been a thing
that I'm learning

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:29.820
to negotiate as a writer
sort of starting out in this.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:33.730
And curious about what you
think the role of the writer

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:37.480
is in the current
sociopolitical climate?

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.560
Do we have a responsibility to
directly and consciously try

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:46.330
and talk about those issues
in our work or off the page?

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:48.340
Or is that really just
part of the meaning

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.250
that critics and readers
should be bringing to our work?

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:53.330
Is it sort of above our
pay grade, so to speak?

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:57.340
- I write to feel free.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:01.710
So I don't write
for any purpose,

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:08.620
to answer to anything other
than a desire on my part.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:12.190
It's a very selfish occupation.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:14.230
I will not lie about it.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.500
If I'm talking to
anybody, it's usually

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:24.090
to a group of dead
writers who have guided me

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:25.409
and taught me how to live.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.795
I feel that that is
where my energy lies.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.590
You produce the work.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:37.480
It's born.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.080
And it has its own life.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.065
And it's received.

00:34:42.065 --> 00:34:44.190
And there's really very
little you can do about it.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:45.803
It's either read,
or it's ignored.

00:34:45.803 --> 00:34:46.469
It's understood.

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:47.710
It's misunderstood.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:48.360
It's maligned.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.920
It's praised.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.434
It's read in all sorts of ways.

00:34:51.434 --> 00:34:53.850
- And probably will be read
in all sorts of different ways

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:56.100
10 years from now,
50 years from now.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.180
- Of course.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:02.890
So I mean, I think
it's foolish to try

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:08.470
to write to solve anything,
to explain anything.

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:18.390
I think writing can, and
does, communicate great truths

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:23.860
to people who read, and read
carefully, and are searching

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.390
as readers.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:27.670
And that is why
literature speaks to me.

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:32.250
But it's a very
personal relationship.

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.350
And my relationship
to the writers I read

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:38.770
is unlike that relationship
between another person

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:40.300
and those same writers.

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.480
And everyone-- we all have
our different constellations.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:49.840
So that's where I
am as an artist.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:55.710
And then there's
another conversation

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.570
that happens that I'm not--

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.160
that I don't
participate in, and I

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.530
have no interest in overseeing.

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.770
- In some ways, I think one
of the paradoxes of being

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:05.520
a writer, and especially
a fiction writer,

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.100
is that I think when I come
to the page, I am not--

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.074
as you say, I'm not coming in
with an agenda or message that

00:36:11.074 --> 00:36:11.990
I want to write about.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:14.531
I'm not thinking, now I'm going
to write a book that is going

00:36:14.531 --> 00:36:16.140
to teach people about this.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:19.080
I'm writing in some way because
there's something in the story

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.360
or in the characters
that's intrigued me.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.110
But then when those
stories-- as you said,

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.710
they go out into the world,
and they get interpreted,

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:31.320
misinterpreted,
translated in some way--

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.100
we heard in some of
the morning panels,

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.940
for any of you who were here--

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.000
we heard a little bit about
the power of narrative

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.350
and the power of story.

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:42.516
And it's something that I
wanted to sort of bring up

00:36:42.516 --> 00:36:44.550
for our discussion.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.620
Sarah Leah Whitson was talking.

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.770
She showed some videos which
they were using in the Middle

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:52.860
East to try and
work in Saudi Arabia

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:57.180
to end the guardianship
system, in which men

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:00.720
are assigned to be the guardians
of women in their lives.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:06.554
And she talked about working
with women in Saudi Arabia

00:37:06.554 --> 00:37:08.970
to kind of figure out, what
is the narrative of the story?

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:11.303
What is the story that we
want to show in the video that

00:37:11.303 --> 00:37:13.485
will resonate with
the women that we're

00:37:13.485 --> 00:37:15.360
trying to talk to and
even the men that we're

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.400
trying to talk to.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.850
And Kari Hong told us a little
story at the end of her talk

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:25.680
in which she mentioned
that her father said,

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:30.127
we're lucky to live in a country
that we're allowed to disagree

00:37:30.127 --> 00:37:30.960
with the government.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:35.190
Because he knew what it had
been like to live in a regime

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:37.710
that didn't allow
that kind of freedom.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:40.020
And this is not actually
a question, I guess.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:44.809
But I'm interested in
talking about that position

00:37:44.809 --> 00:37:46.350
that writers find
themselves in where

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.150
we create these sort of texts.

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:51.750
And these narratives
do have a lot of power

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:52.920
to go out beyond us.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.440
And yet, those aren't-- that's
not something we can control.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.981
And I'm not even
sure it is something

00:37:56.981 --> 00:37:59.250
that we should control.

00:37:59.250 --> 00:37:59.850
- Exactly.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:00.349
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:02.040
I mean, I think that's--

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:08.450
yes, I think you're
rightly embellishing

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:14.820
what I was trying to put forth
when I was talking earlier,

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:20.130
just this idea that there
are different spheres, right?

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:21.600
Different spheres of activity.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.400
And there's the writing.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.270
There's the reading.

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.160
There's the perception.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.500
There's the life of
the book over time.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.980
There's the relationship
of the book with the world.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:35.430
The world is
constantly shifting.

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:37.350
The situation is
constantly shifting.

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:43.660
So the book has greater or
lesser resonance depending on--

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.390
- Or just different
resonance, yeah.

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:48.390
- Depending on who's reading
it, when they're reading it,

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:51.570
how they're reading it.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:55.905
I mean, just from a purely
personal point of view,

00:38:55.905 --> 00:38:58.050
Anna Karenina meant
one thing to me

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:01.170
when I read it
presumptuously at 16.

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:02.640
It meant something
very different

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.270
when I read it when
I was breastfeeding

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:07.470
my newborn daughter.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:09.610
And it will mean
something very different

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:12.990
the next time I sit
down to read it.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:16.680
Because I'm not
that same person.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.460
It remains a point of
reference, but you see it

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:22.290
in a totally different way.

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:24.924
And it speaks-- it's telling
you completely different things.

00:39:24.924 --> 00:39:27.090
- And of course, yeah, I've
had a similar experience

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:29.910
with The Count of Monte Cristo
as a favorite book of mine.

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:32.290
And of course, the
text remains the same.

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:33.639
And so when I read it--

00:39:33.639 --> 00:39:34.680
my sister was in college.

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:35.460
And she gave it to me.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.418
And I was an adolescent,
and I was really taken

00:39:37.418 --> 00:39:39.084
with the adventure story at 12.

00:39:39.084 --> 00:39:41.250
And then I read it again
at 15, and I was very taken

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:43.110
with the romance in the book.

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:45.000
And I thought it
was very romantic.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.980
And then I got older,
and I started to see it

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.230
as this sort of morality story.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.420
And now I read it
as this question of,

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.490
how much are you really
allowed to play god?

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:56.040
How much can you do that?

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.540
And all of those
things-- obviously,

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.706
those changes have happened
in me, as you're saying.

00:39:59.706 --> 00:40:03.870
It has this different resonance
depending on the context

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:06.370
in which you read it.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.880
I think that one
thing that writers--

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.460
we writers can and do
have to really consider

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:14.610
sort of which stories we tell.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:17.220
And in the story that
you read, "The Boundary,"

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:20.199
the mother who comes on vacation
is also a writer of some kind.

00:40:20.199 --> 00:40:21.990
We don't know exactly
what she's doing when

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:23.820
she's writing in her notebook.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:26.670
But we have the sense
that she is maybe

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:29.820
going to tell her
version of this trip

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:34.530
and her version of the story
of the narrator and her father.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.420
But of course, she
doesn't know the things

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:39.003
that the narrator knows and the
things that the narrator tells

00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:42.000
us about what happened
to the father.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.720
And if this mother
tells the story,

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.960
she's almost certainly
going to leave out

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:50.400
some really important context
to the story at the very least.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.770
And it, for me,
raised the questions

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:55.830
of who should tell the story?

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.069
Who's allowed to
tell the stories?

00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:59.610
And thinking about
some of the panels

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:03.240
from this morning where
questions were raised about,

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.100
well, if we are
coming from the West,

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.477
and we are talking to
other parts of the world,

00:41:07.477 --> 00:41:09.810
is this sort of a narrative
that we're imposing on them?

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:14.100
Or to what degree do we allow
them to tell their own stories?

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.742
And it's something
that I find myself

00:41:15.742 --> 00:41:16.950
wrestling with in my writing.

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:19.410
What stories am I
allowed to tell?

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.667
What stories am I going
to be good at telling?

00:41:21.667 --> 00:41:23.542
I'm curious what you
think about all of that.

00:41:26.146 --> 00:41:27.520
- Well, I think
the writer should

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.760
have no identity whatsoever.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.950
- Do you think that's possible?

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:34.052
- I'm trying.

00:41:34.052 --> 00:41:35.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.610
I'm trying to get to that point.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:40.480
But I think I've
always been that way.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.310
I think I've never
had an identity.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:45.800
I've never understood
what identity was.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.790
And whenever I started to
understand what it was,

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:50.920
it terrified me.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:54.640
And every time my life
seems to take some sort of--

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.530
something more than
a penciled-in shape,

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:59.870
I run away from it.

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:06.330
But I think this is crucial for
the artist, for the writer--

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:08.620
especially the writer--

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:15.070
to always evade any kind
of precise identity.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:23.830
Because it is that vacillating,
formless state in which you

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:30.520
can shape-shift into anything or
anyone at any time in any place

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:34.060
that allows you to create,
and to create characters,

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:38.080
and to create a world that isn't
yours, and to think your way,

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:40.870
feel your way,
understand your way

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:46.290
into other hearts, other souls.

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:51.320
And so that's how I felt as--

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.870
as a young girl, I felt that.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:55.870
And I think because I
wasn't a writer then,

00:42:55.870 --> 00:43:00.220
because I was just a child,
it was a little bit scary.

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:04.360
Because I think
in some sense, we

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:06.940
want identity because
identity is like a home.

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:08.500
It's like shelter.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:13.540
It provides walls, and
a roof, and a sense--

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:17.020
a semblance of security,
which is what home

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.730
is, a semblance of security.

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.630
But I think that as I--

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:31.280
once I became a writer, that
state, that state of being,

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:35.120
that stateless state
of being, if you will,

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:40.120
became my instrument.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.970
It's my only instrument.

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:49.430
And I think that is something
that I very carefully cultivate

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:51.770
at this point.

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:54.200
Because I know that that
is the only instrument

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.750
that allows me to work.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:58.490
- It's interesting
that you phrase it

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:04.370
as having no identity versus
having multiple identities.

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:07.370
I'm trying to think about
whether those two things are

00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:09.665
flip sides of the same
coin, or if there's

00:44:09.665 --> 00:44:11.540
a difference between
feeling that you are not

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.190
rooted anywhere or feeling
that you have multiple roots.

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:16.564
I'm thinking of the
conversation we had at lunch

00:44:16.564 --> 00:44:18.230
where you mentioned
you feel like you've

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:20.229
got a life in Italy, and
you've got a life here,

00:44:20.229 --> 00:44:24.500
and you've got many different
lives in different places.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.780
- I have many lives,
but I don't have--

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.120
identity is a different thing.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:33.580
Identity is a different thing
that you feel or you don't.

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:34.080
Right?

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:40.420
So my mother feels
Indian, right?

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:44.320
Even right at this moment
in her home in Rhode Island.

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.150
She feels Indian.

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:50.770
And nothing will make
her not feel that.

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:52.840
That's identity.

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.400
I don't have that.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.920
I don't feel Indian.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.060
I don't feel American.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.680
I don't feel Italian.

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.580
I don't feel English.

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:04.610
I was just in London,
and people say, well, you

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:05.930
must feel a little bit English.

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:07.810
You were born in London.

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:09.050
How can I feel English?

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:10.605
I mean, what does that mean?

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:19.220
I mean, maybe it's
just my own inability

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.160
to connect to identity.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.050
But I think I've--

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:26.720
because of the way I was
raised and the world in which I

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.070
was raised, and the worlds
in which I was raised,

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:32.270
I was always suspicious of it.

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:36.020
I was always
suspicious of identity.

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:40.190
And now in my adult
life, again, I

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:44.480
feel like I have
to remain vigilant.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.700
But maybe it's just a
self-protective mechanism.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.169
Because I can say this.

00:45:49.169 --> 00:45:51.710
I can sit up here and say, well,
I don't believe in identity.

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:56.780
But I think I also feel I've
suffered so much in my life

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:59.420
for lacking an identity.

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:03.230
And it has been a source
of anguish for me to lack,

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:07.280
to be able to-- to not be able
to say, I'm this, or I'm that.

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:11.390
And it's that absence,
that absence of identity

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:15.620
that I talk about a
little bit in my last book

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:19.420
and in other words where
I talk about language.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:22.040
It's that vacuum,
that black space,

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:31.410
that silence that was
a terrifying reality.

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:36.070
So I think what I've constructed
around that is my own--

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:40.670
I'm sure it's my own defense
mechanism as well as something

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:46.670
I try to embrace as the
key for my creativity.

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:48.730
It's both things.

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:49.740
- It's so fascinating.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.900
I feel like I could talk to
you about this for another half

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:52.400
an hour.

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.720
But I think we're meant to move
on to the audience questions.

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.881
So are there question cards?

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:05.032
Thank you.

00:47:05.032 --> 00:47:06.740
All right, this is
where I'm going to try

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:09.274
to read your handwriting.

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:17.530
All right, so this is
a question about the--

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:20.130
you mentioned that the title
of your story in English,

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:22.830
it's "The Boundary," but
in Italian, it's [ITALIAN]..

00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:24.500
- [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.190
- And it says, it suggests--

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:32.450
it's not only boundary, but
it also suggests confinement.

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:36.960
And this question is, can
you discuss the many senses

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:41.730
of confinement in our cultures
in terms of who's confined

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:43.950
and who gets to do that,
and in what way that

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:47.620
maybe relates to the story?

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:53.480
- Well, boundaries are created
to keep people confined

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:57.500
in some sense, to demarcate.

00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:01.160
And so much of
human civilization

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:06.410
has been about this reality,
negotiating this reality,

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:11.540
fighting over this issue,
these lines we draw.

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:19.740
But I mean, I think
it's a rich metaphor.

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:20.310
I don't know.

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:25.140
I mean, I haven't really
thought about it that much.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:30.690
But I suppose, as you
say, as you mentioned,

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:33.630
the mother character
is the writer.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:35.430
And she's sort of me.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.890
I was that mother in some sense.

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:39.640
And I was also the
little girl, of course.

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.860
I'm everybody in the story.

00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:47.060
But I think, of
course, each of us

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.070
is confined in our own reality.

00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:51.150
I think that's the point.

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:57.520
And the writer writes to
get out of one's reality.

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.610
At least that's why
I started writing,

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:05.680
was to get out of my
skin and my reality.

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.760
Partly because I was curious.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.900
Partly because I didn't
really like my reality.

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:23.010
Partly because it just felt
exciting and different.

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:30.630
But I think in the end, we each
have our reality, our thoughts,

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:32.290
our perceptions, our minds.

00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:35.160
And this is the boundary.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:44.430
We are individual boundaries
of incredibly complex, unique,

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:45.850
individual boundaries.

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:49.050
And so much of life,
and literature,

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:53.820
and our problems, our woes,
are about the inability

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:58.800
to communicate
openly and clearly,

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:01.480
the inability to negotiate
those boundaries.

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.870
And I think my work has
really been about that

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:07.350
from the very beginning,
looking at it in all sorts

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:16.460
of variations on the theme.

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:20.047
- And that touches on one
of the next questions.

00:50:20.047 --> 00:50:21.630
It says, could you
say more about what

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:23.592
you mean by saying that
you write to be free?

00:50:23.592 --> 00:50:25.050
And I think this
is related to what

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:26.940
you've just been talking about.

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.940
This person asks, what
does that mean to you

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:34.430
in terms of being
free in your writing?

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:36.120
Is it just, as
you said, the ways

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.610
that you can communicate with
each other sort of clearly?

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:41.760
Or is it also
about, in some ways,

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.260
being able to step
outside of your own life,

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:45.146
your own experience?

00:50:45.146 --> 00:50:46.770
What does that mean
to you when you say

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:48.142
that you're writing to be free?

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:54.330
- It means I'm
writing to feel free.

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:56.041
It means that--

00:50:56.041 --> 00:50:57.540
- Sorry, whoever
asked the question.

00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:58.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:00.199
- I mean-- no, I
don't mean to be--

00:51:00.199 --> 00:51:01.740
I don't mean to
dismiss the question.

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:04.530
It's a very complex question.

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:08.100
And I'm trying to
write myself an answer.

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:19.545
I think one is in flight or not.

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:33.650
But I think I am someone who
has been wary of expectations

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:35.450
handed to me.

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:44.020
And wanting to-- objecting
to certain expectations.

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:46.100
- You mean expectations
of what people

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.510
expected you would write about?

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:49.480
Or what you would
say about them?

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.120
- Who I would be.

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.650
I mean, forget about writing.

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:54.860
Just as a human being.

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.040
Expectations on me for who
I would be, how I would be,

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:02.517
how I would live my life,
how I should live my life.

00:52:02.517 --> 00:52:03.725
What I would do with my life.

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:09.760
I felt this keenly
from a very young age.

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:13.790
And I think part
of it was because I

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:16.910
was raised by displaced
people who had

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:19.840
a very keen sense of identity.

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:24.580
And so that creates a
very charged environment

00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:26.380
in the family--

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:27.700
at least in my family--

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:31.680
in terms of how I
was expected to be,

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.630
and what I was
expected to be, and who

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:37.240
I was expected to be all of
those things with, and et

00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:37.990
cetera, et cetera.

00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:42.010
So I felt incredibly under
intense forms of control.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.870
Not just-- I'm not--
this is not to say,

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:50.510
oh, my parents wanted
all of these things.

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:53.710
It was more than my
mother and father.

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:55.000
It was a sort of community.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.590
It was a world within a world.

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:58.644
It was layers of expectations.

00:52:58.644 --> 00:53:01.310
It was expectations when I would
go to Calcutta with my parents.

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:03.610
It was expectations when
I was in this country.

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:08.460
It was expectations of
people outside of my family.

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.300
And ultimately they
were the expectations

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:14.080
that I was bringing to the
equation, the worst of them

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.100
all.

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:19.302
Because I wanted to somehow
please absolutely everybody.

00:53:19.302 --> 00:53:20.510
- In all of those disparate--

00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:23.570
- In all of the disparate
worlds and ways.

00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:27.460
And it really is a recipe
for intense unhappiness

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:28.401
and disaster.

00:53:28.401 --> 00:53:28.900
- Yes.

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:29.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:33.640
- So I tried to find
a way out of that.

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.140
And that's the freedom I seek.

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:39.190
I seek the freedom from that
weight and that obligation.

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:40.720
The freedom to be.

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:46.330
The freedom to be happy and--

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:52.990
which is lightly said
but painfully gained.

00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:54.766
- This is a slightly
lighter question.

00:53:54.766 --> 00:53:56.890
Someone would like to know
who are the dead writers

00:53:56.890 --> 00:53:57.760
that you speak to--

00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:57.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:57.970 --> 00:53:59.530
--when you have
that conversation

00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:02.300
with the dead
writers you mention?

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:05.930
- Well, it depends
on the graves I'm

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:07.790
going to visit on
any particular day.

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.600
I was reading Kafka
on the plane today.

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:23.130
But in general, for
the past several years

00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:26.860
I've predominantly been
reading Italian writers.

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:27.725
Most of them dead.

00:54:27.725 --> 00:54:28.225
Not all.

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:37.270
And I've been translating
a living author, perhaps

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:41.850
Italy's finest living
author, Domenico Starnone.

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:50.720
But really, I mean, the
constellations are vast,

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.815
as they are in real
life in the real sky.

00:54:56.030 --> 00:55:02.600
So there just-- I mean, I'm old
enough to be able to say, well,

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:03.600
those were the writers--

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.440
I mean, I can sort of link
every book to a different group

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.600
of writers, shall I say.

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:11.840
But this story, for
example, I don't

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:13.130
know what it comes out of.

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:18.380
But certainly, I think
probably the writer

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:25.460
Agota Kristof inspired this
story, a Hungarian author who

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:30.260
moves to Switzerland and--

00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:33.050
flees to Switzerland
with her family,

00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:36.290
and learns French,
and writes in French.

00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:37.130
Wrote in French.

00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:39.820
She's no longer living.

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:42.950
And it was reading her, a
great discovery when I was

00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:45.260
beginning my Italian journey.

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:50.030
A great point of reference
for me to read her

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:54.870
and to think about what
she did and her example.

00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:57.150
So this story was
inspired by her.

00:55:57.150 --> 00:56:00.300
- When you think of yourself
as talking to those writers,

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:01.980
do you talk to
them in your head?

00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:04.060
Or do you see your
work as, in some ways,

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.782
being your
conversation with them?

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:14.750
- I don't know if it's
anything as conscious as that.

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:18.860
I mean, I think reading for
me is just a form of writing.

00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:20.330
No, that came out wrong.

00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:22.250
I think writing is
a form of reading.

00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:24.950
I think writing is a
form of reading for me.

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:28.670
When I was young, when
I was a little girl,

00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:32.900
I learned how to read
around six or seven.

00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:38.050
And I couldn't read
without copying

00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:42.260
what I was reading
in some strange form

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:45.780
almost simultaneously.

00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:47.464
I don't know why I did that.

00:56:47.464 --> 00:56:48.380
But that's what I did.

00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:49.754
And that's how I
started writing.

00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:58.960
So that's remained a constant,
in that if I read something

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:02.100
deeply enough--

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.720
which is how we read when we're
just learning how to read,

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:05.220
right?

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.579
Because we don't know how to--

00:57:06.579 --> 00:57:07.620
we're not used to it yet.

00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:09.960
And it's such a revolution.

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:12.347
It must be.

00:57:12.347 --> 00:57:12.930
I mean, it is.

00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:15.270
It's such a revolution to be
able to learn how to read.

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:18.460
My god, it's, like,
the best thing ever.

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:19.680
- It's such a--

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.690
my son is seven.

00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:23.490
And he taught himself
to read quite early.

00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:25.680
But it was this
revelation to him,

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.240
like you said, that there was--

00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:30.450
somebody somewhere else at
some other point in time

00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:33.310
had written down these
words and had this idea.

00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:35.340
And that now this
idea was in his head

00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:37.950
was this sort of
mind-blowing idea to him.

00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:41.160
That in some ways,
he could have their--

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.210
he could get some
semblance of their ideas.

00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:47.070
Like you said, it's such
a transformative thing.

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:50.910
- Yeah, I mean, I think, for me,
the transformative experience

00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:56.260
was more just the pure solace,
the first solace of life

00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:58.620
is reading.

00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:05.110
And then I start to
echo what I'm reading.

00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:12.190
And so even now I feel that
that's what I'm doing somehow.

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:15.995
I mean, in a less
mechanical way.

00:58:15.995 --> 00:58:17.620
Because when I was
young, I would read.

00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.078
And I would I would
read something.

00:58:19.078 --> 00:58:20.820
I would read Little
House On the Prairie,

00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:24.380
then I would write this weird
version of the same story,

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:24.880
right?

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:26.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:29.470
- I did that also, actually.

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:31.120
My mother recently
found sketchbooks

00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.710
in which I had drawn and
illustrated little stories.

00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:33.550
There's little Mary.

00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:34.220
And there's little Laura.

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:34.886
- Wagons, right.

00:58:34.886 --> 00:58:36.320
- There's a lawn, blue and pink.

00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.720
And yeah.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.600
- But I think as
one grows older--

00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.820
and I mean, if you
end up being a writer,

00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:48.350
then that back and forth becomes
much more complex and layered.

00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:51.780
And then there are
influences that you're--

00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:54.000
either you're consciously
channeling them,

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.370
or you're unconsciously
channeling them.

00:58:57.370 --> 00:58:58.470
You pick things up.

00:58:58.470 --> 00:59:01.200
You're not aware.

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.150
You're not aware of all
of the particles that

00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:06.320
are moving around in the
room in any given moment.

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:08.330
- Are there contemporary or--

00:59:08.330 --> 00:59:09.090
not undead.

00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:14.340
Non-dead, alive writers
that you have been reading

00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:16.180
over the past few years?

00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:20.880
- Well, as I said, Domenico
Starnone, whose two novels

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.250
I've recently translated.

00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:25.920
One is called Trick in Italian--

00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:26.940
in English, sorry.

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:28.801
And the other is Ties.

00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:37.510
I recently very much
admired the novel

00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:39.850
by Neel Mukherjee, my
friend, who's here with me

00:59:39.850 --> 00:59:41.950
today, A State of Freedom.

00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:44.680
We had a wonderful
conversation about that novel

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:47.410
not long ago in Princeton.

00:59:47.410 --> 00:59:51.306
But in general, I don't read
very much contemporary fiction.

00:59:51.306 --> 00:59:53.680
And at this point, I don't
really read fiction in English

00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.780
either.

00:59:55.780 --> 01:00:00.490
So it's a lot of 19th
century and 20th century

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:04.442
Italian authors at the
moment who are feeding me.

01:00:04.442 --> 01:00:06.400
- Along those lines, we
have a couple questions

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.245
about translation.

01:00:09.245 --> 01:00:10.870
Someone says, can
you talk a little bit

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:13.420
about your experience of
translating the story that you

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:15.412
read and your book.

01:00:15.412 --> 01:00:17.620
In other words, you wrote
in Italian and then someone

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:18.520
else translated it.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.960
And this story you wrote and
then translated yourself.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.550
And following on
that, someone wants

01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:26.860
to know, so when you translate
from Italian to English,

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:29.167
did you edit substantially?

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:30.500
Did you change it substantially?

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.770
What was that
process like for you?

01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:35.380
- To translate this story?

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.930
It was really weird.

01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:42.685
It's a very weird thing to
try to translate myself.

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:46.900
It's very disorienting.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:52.210
I mean, it's a level of
disorientation that is--

01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:56.570
it's like the final
frontier, in a way.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.540
The other day with my
family we walked out

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.750
on the breakwater
at Provincetown,

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:06.200
that final little bit that
I wrote about many years ago

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.690
in The Namesake, the
novel I'm convinced

01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:11.440
I presented in this room.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:14.400
In any case.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:19.670
And as I was walking this time
with my family, my kids now

01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:22.610
racing ahead of their
old parents, my son

01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:25.390
coming back saying, can
you speed it up, guys?

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:27.170
We've reached the end.

01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:28.980
Anyway.

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:35.510
But I was going slowly, partly
because I was reflecting on--

01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:39.860
I mean, it was in
Provincetown 20 years ago

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:43.490
that I really felt
born as a writer,

01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:48.710
fully born in a kind of
definitive way, in a way

01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:51.920
that I never
subsequently questioned.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.440
Because until that experience--

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.540
I was 30 years old.

01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:59.540
And everything, all of the
sort of writing activity

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:03.820
before then, it
was all in pencil.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:07.330
I was ready to erase everything.

01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:11.650
Not literally the words, so
much as just the presumption.

01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:19.320
And after those seven
months in Provincetown,

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.220
something happened.

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:24.970
And I felt that it was
ink and not pencil, that I

01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:26.620
was ink and no longer a pencil.

01:02:29.530 --> 01:02:32.470
In any case, I was walking
out across the breakwater.

01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:34.610
And I was thinking,
well, 20 years ago,

01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:39.380
I started writing
seriously in English.

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:45.260
And then 15 years after
that, I moved to Italy.

01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:48.820
And I started writing
in a new language.

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:53.330
And then a couple
of years ago, I

01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:57.930
started translating
out of Italian the work

01:02:57.930 --> 01:02:59.530
of somebody else into English.

01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:03.300
And now I'm writing in
Italian and translating myself

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.870
out of Italian.

01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:08.250
And I thought, I think that
is that final lighthouse

01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:09.180
that you get to.

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:12.550
And then you just
can't go anywhere else.

01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:16.050
I think I've gotten
to that point.

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:18.290
So translating myself is that.

01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:22.740
It is quite-- it is arduous
and bewildering for me.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.840
I've just finished a
short novel in Italian

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:30.450
that I'm thinking
of translating.

01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:35.430
And I mean, I'm
sort of dreading it.

01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:37.620
Because it's going
to be very hard.

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.870
- Do you prefer, though,
to translate it yourself

01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:41.703
rather than to turn it
over to someone else?

01:03:41.703 --> 01:03:44.400
- I feel completely sort
of torn up about it.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.410
Because on the one
hand, I don't want

01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:49.050
anybody else to translate it.

01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:52.030
And on the other
hand, I don't really

01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:53.920
want to translate it either.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.370
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:56.370 --> 01:03:57.690
But I have to.

01:03:57.690 --> 01:03:59.580
I have to figure out something.

01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:02.920
I think maybe once
I get into it,

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.530
into the room with the Italian
version, maybe it will be OK.

01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:10.452
I mean, this story was
sort of an experiment.

01:04:10.452 --> 01:04:11.910
One day I was
swimming in the pool,

01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:15.980
and I thought, well,
it's only 10 pages.

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:17.490
How hard can it be?

01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:18.640
And it was hard.

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:19.170
It was hard.

01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:22.820
But I think what made it easier
was that I had a lot of time.

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:26.970
It was something I wrote so long
ago now that it's almost like--

01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:29.040
I mean, once I write something--

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:32.620
after I write something,
and if enough time goes by,

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.240
I completely forget about it.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:37.126
And it just-- it could
be written by anybody.

01:04:37.126 --> 01:04:39.750
- I imagine that would make it
a little bit easier in some ways

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:40.416
to translate it.

01:04:40.416 --> 01:04:41.550
Because there's some space.

01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:45.370
- Yeah, so once it sort
of hardens like that,

01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:46.770
and I don't really connect--

01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:49.560
I'm not connected to it
anymore, it might be easier.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.060
I mean, the problem
with this novel

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:54.660
is that I just finished it up.

01:04:54.660 --> 01:05:00.630
And it's still-- the spirit of
it is still kind of hovering.

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:03.090
And I don't know if
it's the right time

01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:06.390
to immediately translate
it back into English.

01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:10.290
But then I feel this horrible
expectation and people

01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:13.320
saying, well, when is it
going to be translated?

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.102
Because of course,
nobody can read it

01:05:16.102 --> 01:05:17.610
if I don't translate it.

01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:20.190
I mean, nobody
other than Italians.

01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:25.020
And it's very interesting to
be performing this experiment

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:33.090
and to be really living the
reality of how colossally

01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:35.970
dominant the English
language is in our world,

01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:43.340
and to just realize it, and
to experience it as a writer,

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:47.330
to experience what it means
to write a story in Italian,

01:05:47.330 --> 01:05:51.120
in Granta Italia, which is no
longer even in publication,

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.760
and to know that
10 people read it.

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:58.150
And that's only because I told
10 people in Rome, guess what?

01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:59.220
I have this story.

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:02.340
And I made photocopies
and shared it with them.

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:04.440
The way I used to--

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.530
when I used to live in
Boston all those years ago,

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:09.720
and my very first short
story was published

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:10.830
in the Harvard Review.

01:06:10.830 --> 01:06:13.100
And I was so ecstatic.

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:14.610
And three people read it.

01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:17.210
And three more people read
it because I made photocopies

01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:19.980
and gave them to them.

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:23.205
I'm back in that place
as a writer in Italian.

01:06:26.310 --> 01:06:28.140
And then it comes out
in The New Yorker,

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:32.700
and it has a totally different
life, a totally different set

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:37.530
of muscles and capacity to--

01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:42.110
there's no basis of comparison.

01:06:42.110 --> 01:06:43.935
It's absurd.

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:48.000
It's staggering.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.662
It's mind-boggling.

01:06:49.662 --> 01:06:51.620
- But it does sound like
it's important to you,

01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:55.540
too, that this story does reach
this larger audience, that it--

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:58.922
- You know, I translated this
story totally sort of randomly.

01:06:58.922 --> 01:07:01.380
Literally, I was swimming in
the pool one day in Princeton,

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:05.040
thinking, let me just
see what it's like.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:10.140
I wasn't really thinking about
publishing the story in English

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:10.950
in that sense.

01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:12.570
I mean, it just
seemed like a story

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:17.190
I wrote, a kind of
discrete piece of work.

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:18.745
And I'd forgotten about it.

01:07:18.745 --> 01:07:20.745
And then I thought, oh,
let me see what happens.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.310
And then my agent said,
what's going on back there?

01:07:29.310 --> 01:07:31.410
And I said, well, I
have this little thing.

01:07:31.410 --> 01:07:33.180
I don't know.

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:34.910
And The New Yorker
kindly published it.

01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:37.120
But I wasn't thinking
about it in that way.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.300
I mean, I think that's
another thing I'm

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:43.500
trying to liberate myself from.

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:47.750
I mean, maybe I'm just
completely crazy at this point.

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:52.800
But just the whole machinery
of publishing, editing.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:53.400
I don't know.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.571
I'm questioning everything.

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:56.570
- Well, and then I think
all of those mechanisms

01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:59.520
are very separate from
the act of creation

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:02.910
and the artistic side of it.

01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:05.035
This may be a difficult
question for you to answer.

01:08:05.035 --> 01:08:07.409
But you might be one of the
few people who can answer it.

01:08:07.409 --> 01:08:09.500
Because you can read in
Italian and in English.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.210
I'm curious if the
responses were different,

01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:13.880
if the story was
read differently

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:19.552
in Italy than it has been read
over here in The New Yorker.

01:08:19.552 --> 01:08:23.507
Not just in terms of numbers,
but in terms of meaning,

01:08:23.507 --> 01:08:25.965
or import, or the meanings that
people are putting onto it.

01:08:31.388 --> 01:08:32.529
- I don't know.

01:08:32.529 --> 01:08:38.010
I mean, I think the story is--

01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:40.689
as you say, I mean, it
could take place anywhere.

01:08:40.689 --> 01:08:46.890
And it talks about a very,
unfortunately, rather

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:53.040
widespread problem,
phenomenon in our world

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:58.439
regarding intolerance, and
migration, and attitudes

01:08:58.439 --> 01:09:04.200
toward people who are different,
and feeling out of place,

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:09.069
and belonging or not belonging.

01:09:09.069 --> 01:09:15.060
And I mean, I think
immigration is one thing

01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:16.210
in the Italian context.

01:09:16.210 --> 01:09:18.750
And it's a different thing
in the context of the United

01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:21.477
States or in the
UK, for example.

01:09:21.477 --> 01:09:23.560
They're different places
with different histories,

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.605
different reality, so forth.

01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:34.719
I mean, I think for the--

01:09:34.719 --> 01:09:41.359
I think I am read differently
by Italians in Italian.

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:47.410
And I'm read differently-- as
opposed to people who know me,

01:09:47.410 --> 01:09:49.330
the Jhumpa Lahiri
who wrote in English

01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:52.210
and was born as an
English language writer.

01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:57.310
I think for some
of those readers,

01:09:57.310 --> 01:10:01.700
this story comes as a bit
of a, what happened to her?

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:04.780
So some people have said,
well, but your other stories

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:06.667
were like this.

01:10:06.667 --> 01:10:08.750
And they were talking about
those kinds of things.

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:09.970
And they sounded more like that.

01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:11.410
- Which goes back
to that question

01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:14.710
of expectations of what
people expect you to be.

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:17.320
- So in English, there's
a little bit more

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.240
of the before and after
comparison conversation more.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:27.200
Whereas I think in
the Italian context,

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:33.740
Italians are more just sort
of benevolently curious

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.840
about what I'm doing.

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:44.870
And they're equally incredulous,
but in a more benevolent way.

01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:49.190
Whereas I think in
the American context,

01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:56.580
I'm now in a phase where I'm
aware that what I'm doing

01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:02.370
is odd and not the expected.

01:11:02.370 --> 01:11:09.760
And I have to tolerate much
more of a sort of mixed reviews,

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:10.260
as it were.

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:11.260
I don't read my reviews.

01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:16.925
But a mixed sense of people
who just don't like this.

01:11:16.925 --> 01:11:18.300
People don't like
what I'm doing.

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.490
People are very intolerant.

01:11:20.490 --> 01:11:22.870
People just want me to
go back to the old thing

01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:25.710
and the old ways.

01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:30.030
Don't like this experimentation.

01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:36.270
They say things to
my face about it.

01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:39.090
And it's interesting,
because I think

01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:46.040
it's all part of this quest
to evade the idea of identity,

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:51.200
even a writerly identity,
which can be quite problematic.

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.760
Which I think is problematic.

01:11:52.760 --> 01:12:00.680
Again, I think the artist has
to shun identity at all costs.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:03.110
- Well, it's fascinating
to read this story

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:04.340
and see your new direction.

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:05.600
Thank you so much, Jhumpa.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.200
- Thank you.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.050
[APPLAUSE]
