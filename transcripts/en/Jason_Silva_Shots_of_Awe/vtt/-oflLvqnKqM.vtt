00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.920
This episode of "Shots
of Awe" is brought to you

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.210
by Kay Jewelers.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:21.760
Every kiss begins with K.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.050
You know, when people talk
about the desire for happiness,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.610
when we talk about
chasing happiness,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.220
I think what they're
ultimately talking about

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.200
is chasing novelty.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.700
Because it's only the new
that awakens the mind,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.570
that fully engages
us with the world.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.462
We become anthropologists
in the new environment.

00:00:40.462 --> 00:00:44.220
You know, we transcend
the banality and boredom

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.240
and the trivialities
of the every day.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.850
Normally, we trivialize
ourselves with triviality.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.250
But when we're engorged by a
new experience, all of a sudden,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.037
we become alive.

00:00:53.037 --> 00:00:53.870
We feel as children.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.575
We gawk.

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:56.591
We are just enraptured.

00:00:56.591 --> 00:00:57.840
And we're always chasing that.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.240
We're like, we want happiness.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.164
And I think it would
help if we actually

00:01:01.164 --> 00:01:02.990
understood what we were
saying when we say,

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.660
oh, I just want to be happy.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.729
I just want to be happy.

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.770
What you mean is you want
to continue to explore.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.690
You want to continue to learn.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.355
You want to continue to discover
novel lands, new landscapes

00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:12.740
of the mind, of
perception, of thoughts.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.920
And this is what we mean.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.635
We can never stop learning.

00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:17.420
We can never stop seeking.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.958
I think that we settle
down into these routines.

00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.840
And then we wonder
why we're miserable.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.736
And I think it's ultimately
because happiness

00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:28.270
lives in the space of novelty.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.620
