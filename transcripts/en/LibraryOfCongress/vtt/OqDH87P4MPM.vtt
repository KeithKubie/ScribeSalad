00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.660
When I was named president
of Harvard, there was a lot

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.120
of attention paid to the fact

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.980
that I am the first
woman president

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.380
and there was a press
conference the afternoon

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.150
that my appointment was
announced and I just

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.870
about the first question that
I got from a reporter referred

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.140
to me as the woman president
of Harvard and I reacted

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.440
to that almost with that.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.280
I hadn't thought it through
in advance how I'd react,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.650
but it just came out.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.840
I said, I'm not the
woman president of Hart.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.650
I'm the president of Harvard,
and by that I think I wanted

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.460
to underscore that I didn't want
to be in a separate category.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.460
I didn't want to be
thought of as less

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.560
than all the other presidents
of Harvard, but I learned a lot

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.650
in the very first weeks
after making that comment.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.430
I still would stand
by that comment,

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.970
but I'd understand it
more broadly in that.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.260
During those weeks, I got
dozens and dozens of letters

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.720
and communications from people
all over the world and people

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.240
who wrote to me included a
lot of young women and a lot

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.040
of parents have sometimes
very young women like babies

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.660
who just been born and
the message that came

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.840
through in this series of
letters and other kinds

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.340
of messages was how
important it was to them

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.700
that there was a woman
president of Harvard and how

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.290
that enabled them to expand
what they could imagine

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.590
for themselves.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.350
And so I thought I need
to occupy this status

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.870
as woman president of Harvard
and use the platform and try

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.250
to be the role model that all
these correspondence had asked

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.580
me to be.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.110
So that is something that
I very much kept in mind

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.510
as I've been president over
the last 11 years and met

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.900
with young women and girls
schools all over the world

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.200
and in the United States.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.960
And tried to fill
that expectation

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.580
of what a woman president
of Harvard could mean.
