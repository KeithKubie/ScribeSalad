those technologies have been actually

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930
those technologies have been actually
 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.660
those technologies have been actually
thinking about them and then we went and

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670
thinking about them and then we went and
 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.630
thinking about them and then we went and
spoke to both users and non-users of

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640
spoke to both users and non-users of
 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.760
spoke to both users and non-users of
these technologies because we wanted to

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770
these technologies because we wanted to
 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.250
these technologies because we wanted to
learn how people imagine these four

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260

and so in order to do that we created a
 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.600
and so in order to do that we created a
number of design exercises that

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610
number of design exercises that
 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.150
number of design exercises that
abstracted each technology into

and use to start imagining the potential
because we found that if you give

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310
because we found that if you give
 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.760
because we found that if you give
something to people that's too polished

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770
something to people that's too polished
 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.850

they'll look for the flaws but if you
give them something that's pretty rough

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510
give them something that's pretty rough

they can begin to see the potential
so let's look at take a look at what we

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:56.450
a mute button to avoid any distraction
and that made us think a our might have

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460
and that made us think a our might have
 

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.940
and that made us think a our might have
the ability to help people focus and

00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:58.950
the ability to help people focus and
 

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.799
the ability to help people focus and
that's not typically what we think about

00:21:00.799 --> 00:21:00.809
that's not typically what we think about
 

00:21:00.809 --> 00:21:02.330
that's not typically what we think about
right when we think about AR it's always

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340
right when we think about AR it's always
 

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.279
right when we think about AR it's always
about adding stuff about augmenting

00:21:04.279 --> 00:21:04.289
about adding stuff about augmenting
 

00:21:04.289 --> 00:21:06.919
about adding stuff about augmenting
reality but what if we use it to remove

00:21:06.919 --> 00:21:06.929
reality but what if we use it to remove
 

00:21:06.929 --> 00:21:09.980
reality but what if we use it to remove
things and to enhance focus so is there

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:09.990
things and to enhance focus so is there
 

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.799
things and to enhance focus so is there
an opportunity to help prioritize

00:21:11.799 --> 00:21:11.809
an opportunity to help prioritize
 

00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:14.510
an opportunity to help prioritize

AR so say you picked up this card and it

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:18.900
AR so say you picked up this card and it
 

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.770
AR so say you picked up this card and it
says think of a moment in your users day

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:21.780
says think of a moment in your users day
 

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.669
says think of a moment in your users day
when they're overwhelmed or distracted

00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:24.679
when they're overwhelmed or distracted
 

00:21:24.679 --> 00:21:28.340
when they're overwhelmed or distracted
now consider your particular user their

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:28.350
now consider your particular user their
 

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.320
now consider your particular user their
day-to-day life and could that be a

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:30.330
day-to-day life and could that be a
 

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.970
day-to-day life and could that be a
certain time of day or maybe it's a

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:31.980
certain time of day or maybe it's a
 

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.460
certain time of day or maybe it's a
certain type of situation they're in you

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:34.470
certain type of situation they're in you
 

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.080
certain type of situation they're in you
picture that scenario in your mind and

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:36.090
picture that scenario in your mind and
 

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.630
picture that scenario in your mind and
then you flip the card over to the

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640
then you flip the card over to the
 

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.180
then you flip the card over to the
design prompt which reads how might we

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:41.190
design prompt which reads how might we
 

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:45.799
design prompt which reads how might we
use AR to remove distractions so we'll

00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:45.809
use AR to remove distractions so we'll
 

00:21:45.809 --> 00:21:47.210
use AR to remove distractions so we'll
give you an example so you know how this

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:47.220
give you an example so you know how this
 

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.539
give you an example so you know how this
works so say you're a physical retailer

00:21:50.539 --> 00:21:50.549
works so say you're a physical retailer
 

00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:53.600
works so say you're a physical retailer
and when a customer walks into your

at times your user may be browsing and
 

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.860
at times your user may be browsing and
they may just be roaming the store but

they may just be roaming the store but
 

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:05.720
they may just be roaming the store but
at other times they may actually know

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:05.730
at other times they may actually know
 

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.360
at other times they may actually know
exactly what they want and in those

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:08.370
exactly what they want and in those
 

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.269
exactly what they want and in those
cases entering a store may be a very

00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279
cases entering a store may be a very
 

00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:13.310
cases entering a store may be a very
overwhelming and and distracting

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320
overwhelming and and distracting
 

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.919
overwhelming and and distracting
experience so you could consider

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:15.929
experience so you could consider
 

00:22:15.929 --> 00:22:19.129
experience so you could consider
creating an AR application that helps

00:22:19.129 --> 00:22:19.139
creating an AR application that helps
 

00:22:19.139 --> 00:22:22.279
creating an AR application that helps
your customer find exactly what they

00:22:22.279 --> 00:22:22.289
your customer find exactly what they
 

00:22:22.289 --> 00:22:26.169
your customer find exactly what they
want by simply removing what they don't

00:22:26.169 --> 00:22:26.179
want by simply removing what they don't
 

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:28.909
want by simply removing what they don't
now that's just an example there's a

00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919
now that's just an example there's a
 

00:22:28.919 --> 00:22:31.399
now that's just an example there's a
clear product opportunity there but you

00:22:31.399 --> 00:22:31.409
clear product opportunity there but you
 

00:22:31.409 --> 00:22:34.220
clear product opportunity there but you
can see how there's a very human desire

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:34.230
can see how there's a very human desire
 

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.249
can see how there's a very human desire
in this case the need to focus that can

00:22:37.249 --> 00:22:37.259
in this case the need to focus that can
 

00:22:37.259 --> 00:22:41.240
in this case the need to focus that can
be met using a AR and what we are doing

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:41.250
be met using a AR and what we are doing
 

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.610
be met using a AR and what we are doing
here is basically we're finding a design

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:43.620
here is basically we're finding a design
 

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.249
here is basically we're finding a design
opportunity which leads with a human

00:22:46.249 --> 00:22:46.259
opportunity which leads with a human
 

00:22:46.259 --> 00:22:50.600
opportunity which leads with a human
scenario and a need and desire so we

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:50.610
scenario and a need and desire so we
 

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.639
scenario and a need and desire so we
didn't choose the technology first we

00:22:52.639 --> 00:22:52.649
didn't choose the technology first we
 

00:22:52.649 --> 00:22:55.190
didn't choose the technology first we
didn't say which kind of AR application

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200
didn't say which kind of AR application
 

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.090
didn't say which kind of AR application
can we build we basically asked how can

00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.100
can we build we basically asked how can
 

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.789
can we build we basically asked how can
we help people focus and AR might be one

00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799
we help people focus and AR might be one
 

00:23:01.799 --> 00:23:04.580
we help people focus and AR might be one
technology that does that and in doing

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:04.590
technology that does that and in doing
 

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.499
technology that does that and in doing
this exercise in using these cards you

00:23:06.499 --> 00:23:06.509
this exercise in using these cards you
 

00:23:06.509 --> 00:23:09.980
this exercise in using these cards you
may also find that actually some of

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:09.990
may also find that actually some of
 

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.259
may also find that actually some of
these technologies don't lend themselves

00:23:12.259 --> 00:23:12.269
these technologies don't lend themselves
 

00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:14.659
these technologies don't lend themselves
to your business and your customer and

00:23:14.659 --> 00:23:14.669
to your business and your customer and
 

00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:15.919
to your business and your customer and
that maybe they're not worth pursuing

00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:15.929
that maybe they're not worth pursuing
 

00:23:15.929 --> 00:23:19.340
that maybe they're not worth pursuing
and that's fine too at least by doing it

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:19.350
and that's fine too at least by doing it
 

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.039
and that's fine too at least by doing it
this way you didn't commit months of

00:23:22.039 --> 00:23:22.049
this way you didn't commit months of
 

00:23:22.049 --> 00:23:24.200
this way you didn't commit months of
resources to it before finding out the

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:24.210
resources to it before finding out the
 

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.320
resources to it before finding out the
pardon well frankly expensive way okay

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:27.330
pardon well frankly expensive way okay
