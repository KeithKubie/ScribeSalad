00:00:00.388 --> 00:00:01.651
- I feel a little bit like I'm at

00:00:01.651 --> 00:00:04.302
an auto mechanic shop here,

00:00:04.302 --> 00:00:07.639
but instead of coming here
to get spare car parts,

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.126
you come here to get spare beef parts.

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:12.771
The amount of beef they have
here, they have beef balls,

00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:14.684
they have shank, they have definitely

00:00:14.684 --> 00:00:17.650
some random, unknown beef parts.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.508
The aroma and the steam that it's trapped

00:00:20.508 --> 00:00:24.502
within this low roof is
just, the aroma is amazing.

00:00:24.502 --> 00:00:28.162
This is the type of sauna you want to have

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:29.098
when you're in Thailand,

00:00:29.098 --> 00:00:33.533
this is what a Thai aroma
therapy is all about.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.116
(upbeat music)

00:00:37.687 --> 00:00:40.873
Hey everyone, it's Mark Weins,
I'm in Bangkok, Thailand

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:45.474
hanging out with my buddy
Joel and Su right here.

00:00:45.474 --> 00:00:48.851
For lunch today we're at just
an amazing Thai restaurant

00:00:48.851 --> 00:00:52.113
in Bangkok, the name of
this restaurant is called

00:00:52.113 --> 00:00:54.473
Neua Toon Tha Nam Sathu Pradit.

00:00:54.473 --> 00:00:56.594
You gotta just check out the roofing,

00:00:56.594 --> 00:00:59.761
look at the storage on the roof there.

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:02.941
So at this restaurant
they are doing the cooking

00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:04.448
at the corner of the restaurant

00:01:04.448 --> 00:01:05.957
and then they just have tables

00:01:05.957 --> 00:01:07.466
in the variety of shop houses,

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.663
you can choose the shop
house you wanna sit at,

00:01:09.663 --> 00:01:12.375
but then they also have tables, open air

00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:14.625
under the very low ceiling.

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:19.069
What a fantastic dining environment.

00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:32.315
Wow, if you're scared
of, I'm like actually

00:01:32.315 --> 00:01:35.065
my head is right at the top here.

00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:38.462
Don't stand up too fast when
you come to this restaurant.

00:01:38.462 --> 00:01:40.656
The meat sauna that I'm
experiencing right now

00:01:40.656 --> 00:01:44.798
under this low ledge roof
is just indescribable.

00:01:44.798 --> 00:01:46.552
You can order just a single bowl,

00:01:46.552 --> 00:01:47.771
like if you come here by yourself

00:01:47.771 --> 00:01:49.927
you can order a single bowl of noodles

00:01:49.927 --> 00:01:52.041
and you can either
choose to get Neua toon,

00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:55.071
which is braised beef,
which is fall apart tender,

00:01:55.071 --> 00:01:57.632
or you can get Neua
sod, which is fresh beef

00:01:57.632 --> 00:02:00.145
and she will assemble your bowl of noodles

00:02:00.145 --> 00:02:02.788
just with absolute expertise,

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:04.782
but along with just a
single bowl of noodles

00:02:04.782 --> 00:02:08.322
you can also order a Mou
Fi, which is a fire pot.

00:02:08.322 --> 00:02:10.356
And that way you get a whole pot full,

00:02:10.356 --> 00:02:14.439
it's a hot pot full of
beef with all the fixings.

00:02:17.352 --> 00:02:20.450
Do not touch your head on the power cords

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.369
that run at the top of this restaurant.

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:25.711
There's braised beef in here,
there's beef nuggets in here,

00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:29.659
there is beef meatballs, there's striped,

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.842
there's probably a number
of other beef parts

00:02:33.842 --> 00:02:37.221
in here as well and it
just smells unbelievable.

00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:39.216
You can see the curdles of blood.

00:02:39.216 --> 00:02:40.595
When I was out there
looking at the kitchen,

00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:42.016
they also told me this is one
of their signature dishes,

00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:44.903
which is, it's fried pork skin.

00:02:44.903 --> 00:02:47.655
This is almost like croutons.

00:02:47.655 --> 00:02:48.714
So I think you could probably toss them

00:02:48.714 --> 00:02:50.607
in your soup, but you have
to eat it really fast,

00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:52.194
because you wouldn't
want them to get soggy,

00:02:52.194 --> 00:02:55.387
or you can just eat them garnishing

00:02:55.387 --> 00:02:56.456
as you're eating the soup.

00:02:56.456 --> 00:02:57.785
- They have a name for it here

00:02:57.785 --> 00:02:59.567
that I've never heard before, mukwai.

00:02:59.567 --> 00:03:01.881
- Mukwai, the soup is not spicy at all.

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.879
And what you do is you can dish yourself

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.866
or actually since we're
just eating friends

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:08.103
and we're eating together
we're probably just gonna

00:03:08.103 --> 00:03:10.057
use our chopsticks and
go directly into that.

00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:13.434
The master pot, the main pot
and pick out pieces of beef,

00:03:13.434 --> 00:03:15.959
but yeah it's not spicy or anything,

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.158
so what you do is you mix your own sauce.

00:03:18.158 --> 00:03:20.991
I'm gonna go in for chilly flakes,

00:03:22.957 --> 00:03:26.864
a good, a good couple of spoonages of that

00:03:26.864 --> 00:03:31.099
and wow, I'm gonna go in for some vinegar,

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.473
vinegar, chilly vinegar and then

00:03:34.473 --> 00:03:36.348
I'll probably add a
little bit of fish sauce,

00:03:36.348 --> 00:03:37.811
just to balance it off.

00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:40.779
That is like a perfect,
perfect dipping sauce.

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:42.447
We are ready to dig in man.

00:03:42.447 --> 00:03:44.810
So actually, should we just
taste that broth first?

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.480
Oh there's tendent in here as well,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.027
oh look at that soup and there's also,

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:52.194
oh there's just like a,
that's just pure meat parts.

00:03:55.141 --> 00:03:59.473
Oh it's so beefy, comforting,
the amount of beef in this.

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:01.999
That is the definition of mommy,

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.604
there are, there's that extra
flavor in there for sure,

00:04:04.604 --> 00:04:08.771
undoubtedly, oh that's so
smooth and so beefy and salty.

00:04:10.177 --> 00:04:13.142
Oh, oh, oh, time to dig into the beef.

00:04:13.142 --> 00:04:14.564
I got to go and just get the.

00:04:14.564 --> 00:04:16.903
- [Joel] Choose your first piece.

00:04:16.903 --> 00:04:19.850
- The braised beef on the top here,

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.905
oh I'm gonna rehydrate it
a little bit in that soup

00:04:22.905 --> 00:04:24.616
and actually I might not
even dip in the sauce,

00:04:24.616 --> 00:04:27.783
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna eat it.

00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:36.051
Oh, oh, oh, oh that is so tender.

00:04:39.334 --> 00:04:40.797
Oh that just melts in your mouth,

00:04:40.797 --> 00:04:43.767
that is ridiculously good.

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:47.017
There's so much condensed beefy flavor.

00:04:48.278 --> 00:04:49.583
And I'm gonna move in for some trike,

00:04:49.583 --> 00:04:52.556
which is the next visible
piece of meat on top here

00:04:52.556 --> 00:04:54.142
and oh a curly piece of trike.

00:04:54.142 --> 00:04:56.742
I think I'm gonna dip this into the sauce.

00:04:56.742 --> 00:04:58.659
Oh that sauce, oh yeah.

00:05:02.076 --> 00:05:04.725
Not so chewy, a little bit,

00:05:04.725 --> 00:05:07.123
definitely a little bit
of a rubbery texture,

00:05:07.123 --> 00:05:10.456
but really, really good, it's delicious.

00:05:11.968 --> 00:05:15.970
That sauce is just pure fire,
dry chilly and really sour,

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.083
so I can probably add a little
bit of fish sauce to it.

00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:22.036
Let's go for a beef
meatball next cause you're

00:05:22.036 --> 00:05:26.203
definitely need to soak in
the chilly for a little bit.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.198
Oh man, one of the toughest
things about eating meatballs

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:34.150
is that there's nothing
for, yeah there's nowhere

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.753
to put the sauce to cling onto.

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:39.561
So you have to actually go
in with your chopsticks,

00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:42.490
grab some of that sauce and put it on top

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.197
to maximize your sauce on the meatball.

00:05:46.197 --> 00:05:50.364
- [Joel] Coverage, your
meatball, your sauce coverage.

00:05:54.344 --> 00:05:55.177
- Oh yeah,

00:05:58.006 --> 00:06:02.026
all the sponginess, oh they're
bouncy, they're so bouncy,

00:06:02.026 --> 00:06:05.157
you can definitely tell that
these are 100% beef, all beef.

00:06:05.157 --> 00:06:08.291
- The consistency is even
all the way through, so,

00:06:08.291 --> 00:06:10.487
the mouth feel is so nice, oh my god.

00:06:10.487 --> 00:06:12.844
- And then what I like about
them also is they are not

00:06:12.844 --> 00:06:16.787
too smooth, they have a little
bit of like texture to them.

00:06:16.787 --> 00:06:17.763
So you need texture.

00:06:17.763 --> 00:06:19.391
- Some flavor in there,
that's one of the best

00:06:19.391 --> 00:06:20.855
beef meatballs I have ever had.

00:06:20.855 --> 00:06:25.022
- Next up let's try the, these
are like pork skin croutons.

00:06:27.123 --> 00:06:28.714
Really, really crispy on the outside,

00:06:28.714 --> 00:06:31.642
they started to taste like
melt, like butter on the inside.

00:06:31.642 --> 00:06:33.187
I think what would be absolutely awesome

00:06:33.187 --> 00:06:36.236
if you take your spoon and
then you submerge your spoon,

00:06:36.236 --> 00:06:38.596
just drown them out, oh, oh, oh,

00:06:38.596 --> 00:06:41.346
this is gonna be an amazing bite.

00:06:46.336 --> 00:06:49.550
Wow, it's like the best I have ever,

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.643
oh another fire pot has just arrived.

00:06:52.643 --> 00:06:53.827
How many of Aussie they go through,

00:06:53.827 --> 00:06:56.714
how many FDA servings of
beef we have in front of us.

00:06:56.714 --> 00:06:57.547
- 16, 18?

00:06:58.784 --> 00:07:01.417
- While this thing is still
boiling away, we gotta go in

00:07:01.417 --> 00:07:02.913
and this is a little bit different,

00:07:02.913 --> 00:07:05.315
so there's more blood in the soup.

00:07:05.315 --> 00:07:09.257
Oh there's, oh, what is
that, very gelatinous,

00:07:09.257 --> 00:07:12.757
wiggly, that's exactly what I'm gonna eat.

00:07:13.675 --> 00:07:16.258
I'm gonna dip this, oh, oh, oh.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.830
Oh that is a big pice of wiggliness.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.150
Oh it's so hot,

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:39.001
oh that's just dissolving
on my tongue, oh wow,

00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:42.348
whatever it is, it's just insanity.

00:07:42.348 --> 00:07:44.507
- The tenderness is unbelievable.

00:07:44.507 --> 00:07:45.651
- Okay, over here we have the noodles,

00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:50.145
you can see how rich and oily
and blood curdle that broth is

00:07:50.145 --> 00:07:54.711
there's noodles on here,
there's the braised beef.

00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:57.442
And let's try this baby,

00:07:57.442 --> 00:08:01.609
there's always some woning
blurry in here as well.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.301
Oh with the noodles it's amazing,

00:08:06.301 --> 00:08:09.242
they just soak up all of that beef broth.

00:08:09.242 --> 00:08:10.828
In this one you can really
taste that the broth

00:08:10.828 --> 00:08:12.818
is thickened from the blood.

00:08:12.818 --> 00:08:14.975
Again, an amazing beef flavor.

00:08:14.975 --> 00:08:17.662
We're gonna sit here and
just dig through these

00:08:17.662 --> 00:08:21.571
piles of beef, it is just
so ridiculously good.

00:08:21.571 --> 00:08:24.738
And this one I'm gonna put on my rice.

00:08:26.412 --> 00:08:28.995
Guess I'll eat it all together.

00:08:35.493 --> 00:08:38.660
Wow, and then taste it with some soup.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:49.125
That's exquisite, that is
unbelievable, masterful.

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:52.093
The beef flavor is just off the charts.

00:08:52.093 --> 00:08:54.130
It's off the charts in here.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.797
- Hey, they all like
babies, hi, yeah hello.

00:09:01.233 --> 00:09:03.733
I'd like to have a new friend.

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:09.208
- That beef went down
so well, and it's gone,

00:09:09.208 --> 00:09:12.333
so we did the only thing
that was right to do

00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:15.846
and we ordered one more
entire pot, just to.

00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:19.846
You can't, you can't, you
actually can not stop.

00:09:20.765 --> 00:09:24.432
(speaking foreign language)

00:09:27.394 --> 00:09:31.384
Our grand finale, we got,
which is braised beef,

00:09:31.384 --> 00:09:33.337
100% braised beef.

00:09:33.337 --> 00:09:34.788
- We handed him our order and he thought

00:09:34.788 --> 00:09:38.937
we were asking for the
bill, he looks, he goes, oh,

00:09:38.937 --> 00:09:40.967
these guys are ordering three.

00:09:40.967 --> 00:09:44.192
- I'm gonna ask him to redo it.

00:09:44.192 --> 00:09:45.697
I don't think I can
pick up anything better

00:09:45.697 --> 00:09:47.976
in the world right now than a flaming,

00:09:47.976 --> 00:09:50.298
boiling pot of braised beef.

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:53.465
You literally just wanna swim in this.

00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:57.504
If it was, if it was cooled down,

00:09:57.504 --> 00:09:59.049
I would, I really wouldn't be opposed

00:09:59.049 --> 00:10:01.406
to taking a swim in this broth.

00:10:01.406 --> 00:10:05.573
It's just perfection, it's
absolute beef perfection.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:17.278
That is as good as the
first two fire pots.

00:10:17.278 --> 00:10:18.375
Digging your chopsticks in here

00:10:18.375 --> 00:10:20.654
is almost like going fishing

00:10:20.654 --> 00:10:23.981
with a 100% success rate.

00:10:23.981 --> 00:10:26.964
- [Joel] Oh dude look at this piece.

00:10:26.964 --> 00:10:30.964
It's, it just looks like
it's barely hanging on.

00:10:32.174 --> 00:10:34.840
- It looks like scary almost,

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.599
look at that, the way the
fat clings to the meet

00:10:38.599 --> 00:10:41.117
and it just shakes on your chopsticks.

00:10:41.117 --> 00:10:43.534
- [Joel] It really is living.

00:10:45.056 --> 00:10:48.223
- It's like an organism, look at that,

00:10:49.383 --> 00:10:53.216
that's like a bungee cord, ha, ha, ha.

00:10:53.216 --> 00:10:55.716
Bye-bye, thank you, thank you.

00:10:58.217 --> 00:11:00.437
We just finished with that meal,

00:11:00.437 --> 00:11:05.073
that was one of those life
changing meat experiences.

00:11:05.073 --> 00:11:07.857
The beef was so incredibly good,

00:11:07.857 --> 00:11:10.870
come here, you can either
get the fire pot with beef,

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.802
or you can get just a plain
bowl, well not very plain,

00:11:13.802 --> 00:11:17.710
but delicious bowl of
noodles and braised beef.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.831
Everything they serve I
think is just top notch

00:11:19.831 --> 00:11:22.926
incredibly, insanely delicious

00:11:22.926 --> 00:11:26.428
and I just absolutely
love this environment.

00:11:26.428 --> 00:11:29.480
This restaurant, they literally

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.437
looks like they have, they own about

00:11:31.437 --> 00:11:34.043
four or five shop houses in a row.

00:11:34.043 --> 00:11:35.831
And so you can actually eat indoors,

00:11:35.831 --> 00:11:38.031
or you can get a table on
the outside, which just

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:42.198
surrounds on kind of the
outside, like balcony area.

00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:45.814
Just remember not to stand up too hard

00:11:45.814 --> 00:11:48.461
and when you're walking
inside you gotta duck,

00:11:48.461 --> 00:11:51.672
so that you don't hit
your head on the concrete,

00:11:51.672 --> 00:11:54.528
but the beef is just
unbelievably good here

00:11:54.528 --> 00:11:58.433
if you're looking for some
amazing beef in Bangkok.

00:11:58.433 --> 00:12:01.849
This is the restaurant you're
not gonna want to miss.

00:12:01.849 --> 00:12:02.682
Bye-bye.

00:12:03.853 --> 00:12:05.964
