00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.820
 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.280
In 1783, the author Joel
Barlow wrote a letter

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.960
to the Continental Congress
in the United States

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.850
urging the adoption of
copyright legislation.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.050
Here's the heart of his letter.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.600
 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.020
"There are certainly no kind of
property in the nature of things

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.910
so much his own as the
works which a person

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.277
originates from his own
creative imagination.

00:00:40.277 --> 00:00:42.110
And when he has spent
great part of his life

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.510
in study, wasted his time,
his fortune, and perhaps

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.320
his health in improving his
knowledge and correcting his taste,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.800
it is a principle of
natural justice that he

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.770
should be entitled to the profits
arising from the sale of his works

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.840
as a compensation for his
labor in producing them,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.660
and his risk of reputation in
offering them to the public."

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.510
This letter was both
influential and typical.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.490
12 of the 13 American states adopted
copyright statutes, moved in large part

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.610
by sentiments of the sort expressed
in Barlow's heartfelt letter.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.130
Since then, authors, lobbyists,
legislators, and judges

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.510
have frequently invoked
similar arguments

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.650
to justify or expand copyrights.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.040
An excellent collection of examples
can be found in a 1996 article

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.400
by Stewart Sterk.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.660
Here are a few.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.850
In 1906, the famous
composer John Philip Sousa

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.130
sent a telegram to the chairman
of the congressional committee

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.840
considering legislation that would
have expanded public performance

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.280
rights, in which Sousa
argued as follows.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.250
 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.910
"Earnestly request that
the American composer

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.730
receives full and adequate protection
for the product of his brain.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.510
Any legislation that does not
give him absolute control of that

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.630
which he creates is a return
to the usurpation of might

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.320
and a check on the intellectual
development of our country."

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.020
An expansive declaration
of this general sort of

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.940
comes in the 1954 decision of
the United States Supreme Court

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.720
in the case of Mazer versus Stein.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.522
 

00:02:30.522 --> 00:02:35.000
"Sacrificial days devoted
to such creative activities

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.210
deserve rewards commensurate
with the services rendered."

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.900
The most general idea, latent
on all of these passages,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.910
is that a person who works hard
deserves to be compensated,

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.800
and that the law should
be crafted to ensure

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.590
that he or she receives
that compensation.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.440
Stating this broadly, the idea enjoys
very wide public support, at least

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.520
in Western democratic societies.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.190
Social psychologists tell
us that most people tacitly

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.190
subscribe to what the psychologists
sometimes call equity theory.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.860
The central principle
of equity theory is

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.680
that justice entails giving each person
in a collective enterprise a share

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.470
of the products of that
enterprise proportional

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.360
to his or her contributions to it.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.560
A more specific and controversial
variant of this general attitude

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.910
is that a person who works hard deserves
to control the fruits of her labor.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.040
In other words, she should not
only be compensated appropriately.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.980
She's entitled to a property
right in her creations, the right

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.930
to do with them what she wishes.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.860
When seeking support for that idea
and guidance in construing it,

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.330
lawmakers and scholars commonly
looked at the political theory

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.710
of the 17th century British
philosopher John Locke.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.020
Locke's writings are attractive
for at least two reasons.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.900
First, his ideas have been highly
influential in Anglo-American

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.960
political culture,
although to a lesser extent

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.190
in continental European
political culture.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.620
Thus, if one can ground a
policy argument in Locke's work,

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.209
the stature of that argument increases.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.100
Second, Locke did not offer an
unqualified defense of property rights.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.150
Rather, he offered an
influential justification

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.710
of private property balanced by
various analytical devices meant

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.500
to ensure that the interests
of the public at large

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.290
would not be impaired by
private property rights.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.980
To most modern writers
who seek similar balances,

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.730
Locke's complex approach is
intriguing and inspiring.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.760
I'll spend a few minutes now
summarizing the main features

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.890
of Locke's general theory
of property rights.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.390
This argument is likely to be familiar
to many of you, but not to all.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.730
Once we're done, we'll consider
the application of Locke's argument

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.925
to intellectual property, and
to copyrights in particular.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.290
Most of Locke's theory is
distilled in chapter five

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.390
of his Second Treatise of Government.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.720
The heart of that chapter is a
generative vignette, an evocative

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.730
story.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.240
In that story, a person-- for
Locke, that person is a man--

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.390
comes upon a parcel of land that no
one yet owns, or, more precisely,

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.290
that is held in common.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.240
The man works hard to
make the land productive.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.960
How?

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.930
Well, he doesn't say
precisely, but you can

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.810
imagine him removing the trees and the
large rocks, breaking open the soil,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.180
ensuring that it's adequately
irrigated, and so forth.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.980
He then plants seeds, which grow
into plants, which, properly tended,

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.800
produce fruits and vegetables.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.870
Engaging in these activities,
Locke argued, the man

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.280
acquires a natural property
right, not merely to the crops

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.540
but to the land used to grow them.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.476
Here's the key passage.

00:06:09.476 --> 00:06:14.600
"Though the Earth and all inferior
creatures be common to all men,

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.910
yet every man has a
property in his own person.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.590
This, nobody has any
right to but himself.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.070
The labor of his body and the
work of his hands, we may say,

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.410
are properly his.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.670
Whatsoever, then, he
removes out of the state

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.630
that nature hath provided
and left it in, he hath mixed

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.560
his labor with and joined to
it something that is his own,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.190
and thereby, makes it his property.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.450
It being by him removed from the
common state nature placed it in,

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.330
it hath, by his labor,
something annexed to it

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.550
that excludes the common right
of other men, for this labor

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.730
be the unquestionable
property of the laborer.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:02.790
No man but he have a right to
what that is once joined to,

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:11.410
at least where there is enough and
as good left in common for others."

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:16.160
All of this happens, Locke
argued, in a state of nature.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.960
In other words, the farmer's rights
are natural rights, not dependent

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.290
upon state recognition.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.070
But once a state is
formed, it has a duty

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:30.270
to recognize and enforce natural
rights acquired in this fashion.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.800
According to Locke,
the ability of a person

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.570
to acquire natural property
rights in this fashion

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.760
is, however, limited in three ways.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.360
These limitations are
commonly known as provisos.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.180
The first is known as
the sufficiency proviso.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.360
According to Locke, the acquisition of
natural property rights by the farmer

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:58.590
only occurs if he has left, as you'll
recall, as much and as good for others.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:02.500
This restriction is analytically
very important, as we'll see.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.700
But to Locke, it did not
seem especially problematic

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.180
because, at the time he
wrote, the world contained

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:14.560
lots of what Locke thought of as unowned
land, most notably in North America.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.920
Today, of course, the
sufficiency proviso

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.250
would impose much stricter
limits on the ability of a person

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.740
to acquire real property through labor.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:30.200
The second proviso is known
as the spoilage proviso.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.929
According to Locke, if the
farmer has grown so many crops

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:37.720
that he's unable to consume
them and they rot in his barn,

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.200
he not only forfeits his
right to the unused crops,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.150
but also his right to as much of the
land as was necessary to grow them.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.280
In other words, his
legitimate holding shrinks.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.370
Again, this restriction was not
particularly important for Locke

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.930
because in his view, it was
rendered largely irrelevant

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.390
by the invention of money.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.390
After the adoption of
a medium of exchange,

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.350
if you grew more crops
than you could eat,

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.940
you could exchange the surplus for
hard currency, which you could then

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.910
use to purchase other
goods and services.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:12.940
The result?

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:17.239
A surplus did not go to waste, and
the legitimacy of your holdings

00:09:17.239 --> 00:09:18.030
was not threatened.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.720
 

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.030
The third and last of the
provisos, less clearly recognized

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.460
in chapter five but implicit in
other portions of Locke's work,

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.940
is sometimes referred to
as the duty of charity.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:37.140
This restriction, emphasized by
Wendy Gordon in a pioneering article,

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.650
entails an obligation to let others
share one's property in times

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:45.140
of great need, so long as one's
own survival is not threatened.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.050
 

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.040
So that, in brief, is the
core of Locke's general theory

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.910
of private property.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:57.600
Many nuances and controversies
lurk in this quick summary.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.380
In particular, I have not said
anything about the longstanding debate

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.490
concerning the extent
to which Locke should

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:08.070
be understood as an
apologist for capitalism.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.860
If you're curious about
such matters, feel

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.760
free to explore some
of the materials listed

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.650
in the bibliography, to which
there's a link on the map.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.740
But we're going to press on to
consider the application of Locke's

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.940
theory of real property to copyright.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.060
 

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.430
It's widely thought that Locke's theory
provides an even stronger justification

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:36.010
for intellectual property than
it does for property in the land.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.880
The following circumstances
underlie this assumption.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:45.310
First, the public domain, by which I
mean the large body of unowned cultural

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:49.900
products that all authors draw
upon when creating their own works,

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:56.090
provides a plausible analogue to
the land held in common that figures

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.900
so importantly in Locke's argument.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.530
Next, with respect to many
kinds of intellectual property,

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.130
labor seems to provide a
disproportionately large source

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.980
of its value.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.800
To create a novel, a writer, of
course, needs a few tangible,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.840
raw materials-- some paper, some
pencils, nowadays a laptop computer,

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.280
and so forth.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.810
But much more of the value of the
novel derives from the writer's work

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.520
than from those materials.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:32.800
Consequently, it seems more appropriate
to confer on her ownership of the novel

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:39.690
than it does to confer ownership of
the land upon Locke's homestead farmer.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.890
Finally, in ways that will gradually
become more obvious as we proceed

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.820
through these lectures,
Locke's famous provisos

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.450
seem to align in a suggestive
fashion with several

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.510
of the so-called
exceptions and limitations

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:58.790
that copyright law imposes
upon the rights of authors.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:03.290
For all these reasons, Locke's theory
of property seems to many observers

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:07.970
to provide both a potent justification
for the system of copyright law

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.860
and, equally important,
a guide when determining

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.500
how far that law should reach.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:20.570
That widespread assumption
turns out to be overstated.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.800
Most fundamentally, it's
less obvious than it first

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.400
appears that Locke's argument
has any bearing at all

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.910
on intellectual property.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.340
Even if one can get past
that initial hurdle,

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.230
it turns out that key
features of Locke's argument

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:39.680
contain ambiguities that blur its
application to the kinds of issues

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.130
that arise in the copyright context.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.390
Let's take up the
threshold difficulty first.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.970
In a shrewd article,
Seana Shiffrin points out

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.520
that one can find in chapter
five of the Second Treatise

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.920
six different explanations for
why labor upon unowned land

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.890
generates natural property rights.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:06.380
Those six rationales are summarized
in the map in front of you.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:10.500
First, natural reason,
Locke argued, informs us

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.530
that people have, quote, "a right
to their preservation," end quote.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.640
And the only practical way
of effectuating that right

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.560
is by appropriating--
in other words, owning--

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.170
the materials we need
for food and shelter.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.550
This is more than a
right, in Locke's view.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.100
It's a duty.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.480
We have a religious obligation
to preserve ourselves.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:37.300
More broadly, God commanded us to subdue
the Earth, specifically to, quote,

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.540
"improve it for the benefit
of life," end quote.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.770
And the only way to do that
is to labor upon it and then,

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:48.130
again, appropriate the
fruits of that labor.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:52.030
Next, Locke argued that
our intuitions tell us

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:55.670
that a person has a, quote,
"property in his own person,"

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:59.080
including, as we saw in
the passage I read earlier,

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.990
quote, "the labor of his body and
the work of his hands," end quote.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:09.970
When we mix the work of our hands,
which we own, with unowned raw material,

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:14.140
it seems natural, he argued, that
the former should color the latter.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.750
 

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.870
Locke's fourth argument
is that work is virtuous.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:25.740
God gave the world, he argued, quote,
"to the industrious and rational, not

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.000
to the fancy or covetousness
of the quarrelsome

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.370
and contentious," end quote.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:36.850
Virtuous workers deserve rewards.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:42.600
Fifth, it seems natural, Locke argued,
that ownership of a finished product

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.350
should track ownership of
the most valuable component

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:50.410
thereof, which he argues
is typically labor.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:55.360
Sixth, and finally, Locke
throughout chapter five

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.820
draws sustenance from the
language of transformation.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.670
He depicts the homestead farmer's
activities as attractive,

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:07.400
in part because of the way they alter
the landscape from wild to domestic,

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.835
from raw to cultivated,
from chaotic to ordered,

00:15:10.835 --> 00:15:14.800
and from nonproductive to productive.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.600
All of these changes seemed to Locke
self-evidently worthy of commendation.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.910
Once one has catalogued the foundations
of Locke's theory of real property,

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.520
it becomes much less
clear that his argument

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.870
has force in the context
of intellectual property.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.980
In particular, as Shiffrin points
out, only the fourth and fifth

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:41.290
of the six rationales seem to
provide clear-cut justifications

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:46.460
for a novelist's acquisition of
a property right in her novel.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.200
Presumably, the novelist
owns the work of her hands,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:54.050
just as much as the farmer, and
her labor is just as virtuous.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:57.920
But her survival is not dependent
on controlling her novel,

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.230
nor does a novel seem pertinent
to her religious obligation

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.530
to subdue the Earth.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:09.050
The relevance of the other
two arguments is uncertain.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:13.430
In short, there's
trouble at the threshold.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.950
But let's assume that
rationales four and five--

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:21.570
the moral value of work and
intuitions regarding proportionality--

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:27.380
are indeed adequate to launch a
Lockean justification for copyright.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.220
We can thus move on to more
detailed questions concerning

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.890
the implications of Locke's
approach for the law.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.550
 

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.990
Quickly, we encounter
other difficulties.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:45.240
Perhaps the most fundamental is what
sort of labor is deserving of a reward?

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:51.400
What counts, more specifically,
as virtuous intellectual work?

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.070
There are at least four possibilities,
again listed in the map.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.910
The first, which seems closest to
Locke's original understanding,

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.620
is that labor consists
of time and effort--

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.550
hours spent in a chair,
typing, or standing in front

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.099
of an easel, painting.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:10.089
But as Justin Hughes has
shown, we often speak

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:14.359
of meritorious work in other
terms, tacitly defining it

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:20.950
as something you'd rather avoid doing or
as something that creates social value.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.530
Finally, as Lawrence Becker
suggests, we sometimes

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.960
speak and act as if
creative labor is more

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:32.380
meritorious than
mechanical or drudge labor.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.620
These differences matter for copyright.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:40.730
Suppose, for example, that a particular
writer or a particular class of artists

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.610
love their work and would
rather do it than anything else.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.750
The avoidance theory of labor-- in
other words, the interpretation that

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.737
defines labor as something
you'd rather not do--

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:53.820
would suggest that writers
of this sort should not

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.810
be given copyrights in their creations,
whereas the other interpretations would

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:01.650
confer upon them legal protection.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.680
Perhaps poets, who seem especially
passionate about their work,

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.420
should be denied copyrights.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:14.670
Another example-- suppose you work
hard, but you're bad at what you do.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.190
Indeed, your labor reduces
rather than enhances

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:21.920
the social value of the
materials you labor upon.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.180
To take a classic
hypothetical example, you

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.760
find a beautiful piece of naturally
sculpted driftwood on the beach,

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.420
and you paint it pink,
reducing its beauty.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.660
Do you deserve a copyright
in your sculpture?

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.380
 

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.540
Here's another challenge.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.010
An important dimension
of Locke's argument

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:46.640
is that the magnitude of the reward--
or the property right-- acquired

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.810
by our laborer should be
proportional to the amount of labor

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.280
he or she has invested.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.140
But how do you decide how large a
reward or property right is appropriate?

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.110
 

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:07.280
An illustration-- Scott Lieberman is a
cardiologist who lives in Tyler, Texas.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.220
He's long been fascinated
by the space program

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.460
and is an avid amateur photographer.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.650
On February 1, 2003, Mr.
Lieberman figured out

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.540
that the space shuttle
Columbia would pass over

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.420
his home in East Texas around 9
o'clock in the morning on its way

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.670
to a landing in Florida.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:31.580
He and his wife went out into the yard
and pointed their cameras at the sky.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:37.250
As it happened, this was just the moment
when the Columbia began to break apart.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:43.330
One of Lieberman's images
captured that horrific incident.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:47.150
He submitted the photo to the local
newspaper, which, in turn, forwarded it

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.210
to the Associated Press.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:55.310
By the next afternoon, Lieberman's
photo was on the cover of Time Magazine.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:59.370
As you know from the first lecture,
as a matter of copyright law,

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:03.390
Lieberman surely is entitled to
a copyright in his photograph,

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:07.740
so the AP and Time needed
Lieberman's permission

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.350
to print and publish the photo.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:15.430
But what is the magnitude of the
appropriate or, in Lockean terms,

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:19.860
proportional reward to
which Lieberman is entitled?

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.390
He himself seems not
to have been mercenary,

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:28.130
but he could have demanded
quite a large fee from the AP.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.730
Should he have been able to do so?

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.620
Locke's theory points us
in the general direction

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.030
by emphasizing the principle
of proportionality,

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.620
but it doesn't give us much
guidance in determining

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.730
what, exactly, proportionality
means in cases like this.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.690
 

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.610
The way in which the issue is
framed matters quite a lot.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.690
If you focus on the
amount of effort that

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.780
went into pressing the
shutter at the moment

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:57.420
the space shuttle
passed overhead, then it

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.970
might seem that Lieberman is morally
entitled to only a small reward.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:05.040
By contrast, if you take into
account the cost of his equipment,

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.120
his years of self-training,
and so forth,

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.240
then the appropriate reward
might be much larger.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.520
But putting that important
nuance to one side,

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.730
it's apparent that the largest source
of the value of Lieberman's photo

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:22.130
arises from luck-- being in the
right place at the right time.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:26.550
What's an appropriate-- in other
words, proportional-- reward for that?

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.710
Yet another difficulty--
how exactly should one

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:33.690
construe the Lockean
concept of the commons?

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.260
Various options are listed on the map.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.940
One possibility would be to treat the
concept of the commons as equivalent

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:45.300
to the idea/expression distinction
that we discussed in the first lecture.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.470
As you'll recall, copyright
law in all countries

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:52.440
excludes from protection facts or ideas.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:57.460
Only an author's distinctive expression
of facts or ideas is shielded.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:01.030
Perhaps the root of that doctrine
is the Lockean proposition

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.920
that facts and ideas
constitute part of the commons,

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.220
upon which authors apply their labor.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:14.650
But this, an initially attractive
interpretation, quickly crumbles.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:18.460
For one thing, an author's
ideas, if they're original,

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.870
don't seem to be part of the commons,
the existing stock of cultural

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:25.650
materials, yet they cannot be owned.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.530
Another problem arises out
of the fact that, for Locke,

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.370
labor upon a tract of
land held in common

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.290
resulted in ownership of that tract.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:38.620
By contrast, labor upon facts and
ideas does not, as we've seen,

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:43.940
result in ownership of
those facts and ideas.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.364
In short, Locke's theory
doesn't seem to fit well,

00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:48.405
the way the copyright law
is currently organized.

00:22:48.405 --> 00:22:51.550
 

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.570
Last but not least, the
application of the provisos--

00:22:54.570 --> 00:23:00.450
the famous three Lockean provisos--
to copyright law is tricky.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:04.330
Scholars wrestle over the best
interpretation of those provisos

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:08.010
and over the proper application
of each interpretation

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:09.800
to intellectual property.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:14.090
Part of the problem arises from the
ambiguity of the provisos themselves.

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:17.480
For example, should
the sufficiency proviso

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.510
be construed to prevent the
acquisition of property rights, when

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:25.060
the result would be to leave unowned
raw materials in sufficient amount

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.650
for others to appropriate?

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:31.040
Or rather, should it be
construed more broadly

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.060
to prevent the acquisition
of property rights

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:38.120
only when the overall welfare
of other people is impaired?

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:42.630
The answer makes a big
difference to copyright law.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.440
In other cases, the proviso
itself seems reasonably clear cut,

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.380
but its application to
intellectual property is unclear.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:53.080
For instance, although most scholars
think that the spoilage proviso is

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:58.360
irrelevant in the context of
copyright because novels don't rot,

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:03.880
Benjamin Damstedt has argued plausibly
that when an author or an inventor

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.440
secures an intellectual property right
over a socially valuable innovation

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.080
but then refuses to make it
widely available to consumers,

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.730
the result is a kind of
spoilage, and the law

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:19.740
should devise some mechanism to
override the creator's selfish choice.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:26.420
Scholars are likely to continue
to wrestle with these puzzles.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:31.020
My own sense is that it's unlikely
that any scholar will succeed

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.940
in identifying a unique, true,
or best interpretation of Locke's

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.910
original theory in the
context of copyright.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.980
Locke himself supported
literary property

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.060
but had relatively
little to say about why,

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:49.340
and his highly influential
remarks about property and land

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.210
contain too many ambiguities
to provide crisp answers

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:55.460
to the kinds of questions
we must resolve today

00:24:55.460 --> 00:25:01.190
in the context of art, literature,
architecture, software, and so forth.

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:05.910
This should not be terribly surprising,
nor should it be terribly disturbing.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:11.350
The real value of Locke's theory is not
that it gives us definitive answers,

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:15.920
but that it encourage us to ask
particular kinds of questions.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:21.470
What resolutions to
particular disputes over IP,

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.860
or over the rules governing
kinds of disputes,

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.370
would treat the parties most fairly?

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:32.020
In other words, what would
give them what they deserve?

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.060
Locke's original writings
and the many layers

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.910
of commentary upon those
writings sensitize us

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:43.560
to some of the considerations that seem
relevant to answering those questions.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.500
Most importantly, they urge us to
be attentive to the role of labor

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.820
in creating intellectual
products, and to give the laborers

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.430
the rights they deserve, while
insuring that the public at large

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.740
is not disadvantaged.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.330
But what that guideline
means in particular contexts

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:02.880
is largely up to us.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.390
Set forth on the map
are a few of the issues

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:08.070
to which fairness theories
direct our attention.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:10.900
 

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.310
How can we ensure that
the many contributors

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:17.070
to composite intellectual
products are fairly rewarded?

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.970
A premier example
consists of films, which

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.600
arise out of the creative contributions
of many different people--

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.320
screenwriters, actors, directors, set
designers, costume advisers, camera

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.580
operators, and so forth.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.720
As we'll see, the copyright
systems of different countries

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.940
handle the rights for those various
contributors in quite different ways.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:42.270
When we get to that doctrine,
we should and will ask which,

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:47.420
if any, of the national systems fairly
compensate all of the contributors

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.960
to a film?

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.920
Another variant of the
same general question--

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.270
at the end of this lecture series,
we'll consider the shifting rules

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:00.380
governing so-called
traditional knowledge.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:04.890
These are the cultural
products of indigenous groups.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:10.630
When we do so, one normative issue
will be what system of rules, if any,

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:13.990
takes appropriate
recognition of the fact

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:16.510
that traditional knowledge
typically results

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.680
from the intellectual labor
of many generations of people?

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.980
The issue of proportionality will also
come up frequently in this course.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.810
Here's just one context.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:32.400
The value of many copyrighted
works derives, in part,

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.670
from the labor of the
copyright owner, but also,

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:39.070
in part, from materials
taken from the public domain.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:43.960
Classic examples include Disney's
animated versions of folktales,

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:50.140
such as Snow White or Cinderella,
or historical narratives,

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.410
such as Pocahontas.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:57.130
Should the scope of Disney's
copyrights in such adaptations

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:01.370
of traditional materials be smaller
than the scope of copyrights and films

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:05.070
incorporating more original plots?

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.690
The kinds of considerations
that Lockean scholars attend

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:12.930
to suggest that the answer is yes,
but it's hard to determine how,

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:15.100
exactly, one would
implement that guideline.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.790
 

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:21.520
Another example-- should
considerations of the sort

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.490
highlighted by fairness theory prompt us
to reconsider the absence of copyright

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:28.230
protection for factual
works, many of which

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:32.040
require considerable effort
and investment to produce?

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.000
As we'll see, European
countries currently

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.760
offer reasonably generous
copyright-style protection

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:44.210
to databases, which are
compilations of factual materials.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:47.750
The United States is much less generous.

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:52.770
In this respect, is Europe right
and the United States wrong?

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:56.120
In the same vein, should the
writers of autobiographies

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.970
have more control over the
narratives of their own lives

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.360
than they currently do under
contemporary copyright law?

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.430
 

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:08.750
Ensuring that people who engage in
creative labor are fairly rewarded

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:13.840
creates a presumption that the answer
to each of these questions is yes.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.630
Whether that presumption is overridden
or trumped by other considerations,

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:21.050
we'll take up in future lectures.

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:24.590
So here's one last, crucial issue.

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:30.030
Does fairness require only giving
authors appropriate monetary rewards,

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:33.830
or does it also require giving them
control over the physical embodiments

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:37.190
or performances of their works?

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:40.710
Rob Merges, a leading
IP scholar and a founder

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:43.570
of the Berkeley Center
for Law and Technology,

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.375
has recently argued for
the latter position.

00:29:46.375 --> 00:29:49.300
 

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.530
Merges's stance in these
debates is interesting.

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:56.860
For most of his career, Merges
approached difficult policy questions

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.780
involving the law of
intellectual property

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.490
from the perspective of
utilitarian theory, the approach

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:06.000
that we'll take up in
lecture number four.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.070
In other words, he sought
to identify the set of rules

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:13.360
that would be socially
optimal in each situation.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:18.480
Eventually, however, he became convinced
that utilitarian theory is inadequate.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.620
In particular, it's
incapable, he now believes,

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:25.750
of generating a solid justification
for the entire intellectual property

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.970
edifice.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:33.250
So here's a passage, in which he
expresses this disillusionment.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:37.130
"In my research, I've become
convinced that with our current tools,

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.640
we will never identify
the optimal number

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:43.290
of patented copyrighted
and trademarked works.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.700
Every time I play the
archaeologist and go

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:50.630
looking for the utilitarian footings
of the field, I come up empty.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:55.880
Try as I might, I simply cannot justify
our current IP system on the basis

00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:00.000
of verifiable data showing that people
are better off with IP law than they

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.960
would be without it.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:07.140
Maximizing utility, I've come to see, is
not a serviceable first-order principal

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.630
of the IP system.

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:15.350
It's just not what IP is really
all about at the deepest level."

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:20.660
Now, Merges has not abandoned his
utilitarian calculator altogether,

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:25.100
but he has relegated it to what he
calls a middle-- intermediate-- layer

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.870
in his theory of intellectual property.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:30.760
For deep-level inspiration
and guidance, he now

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.810
relies on the writings
of Locke and Kant.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:39.150
One of the lessons that Merges derives
from his explorations of those writers

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:42.150
is that monetary compensation
for deserving authors

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:47.030
is inadequate, that respect for
their work and their autonomy

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:52.150
necessitates giving them property
rights over their creations.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:55.400
Decades ago, Merges had
advocated the same position

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.400
from the standpoint of
cost/benefit analysis.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.500
Now he offers an alternative,
non-consequential justification.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.060
 

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.560
Much later in this series of lectures,
we'll take up the question of what,

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.770
if anything, should be done to alleviate
the ongoing crisis in the entertainment

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:18.110
industry resulting, in part, from
the ubiquity of peer-to-peer copying.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:21.670
At that point, Merges's
argument concerning

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:27.610
whether compensation is adequate or
whether property rights are essential

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:29.460
will become relevant.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:33.940
We'll see whether his
contention holds up.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:39.100
This concludes our review of the cluster
of arguments known as fairness theory.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.270
We'll now turn to the
second of the four clusters,

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:45.452
commonly known as personality theory.
