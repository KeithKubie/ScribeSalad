00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.381
Hello. I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember, it so you don't have to.

00:00:09.381 --> 00:00:12.180
In the world of comic books, characters die a lot.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.979
So many characters have died and often come back, that I wonder if there's a phrase among comic writers, that says "Die early and die often".

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.980
And one of the greatest villans of all time, is no stranger to this running joke, The Joker.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.520
Though, in all fairness, when it comes to the comics, we don't see it that much.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.400
Well, there's been plenty of fake outs, and he certainly been mangled and distorted something fierce,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.299
but when it comes to actual dying, it's the other avenues that take a literal shot at this.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.820
We definitely get one in Tim Burton's Batman.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:52.120
We kind of got one in the Arkham video games. Although his personality still lives in other people, somehow? It's a bit confusing.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.240
Injustice has Superman RIPPING HIS GUTS OUT!

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.220
Yikes!

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.720
And of course there's that infamous last page of Killing Joke.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.760
Where people still don't know if Batman's killing the Joker or just putting his arms on him in a fit of insane laughter.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.470
The short answer is "He doesn't kill him." As Barbara Gordon is paralyzed in that comic and the Joker appears in continuity with that fact.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.520
But people still wonder if the intent of the writer was to originally kill him, seeing how it is called the Killing Joke, and no main characters die.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.460
The series that, ironically, likes playing around with killing him the most is the quote, unquote "kids version". The Animated Series.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.400
In one version, he's fed to a shark and another he's killed in a vengeful rage, he even gets blown up in a giant metal smile.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.040
Puddin'!

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.580
At this point, he probably is. (Damn, Batman!)

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.120
Much like Killing Joke though,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.690
he often pops up, despite their looking like there's no real chance he could survive.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.360
Nevertheless, even with all these deaths, fake outs, or whatever you want to call them,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.440
the Animated universe had a death scene that many consider on-par with The Killing Joke.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.780
And that comes from Batman Beyond: 
The Return of The Joker.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.380
After the run of Batman: The Animated Series, Warner Brothers launched a spin-off show, taking place in the future of Gotham City.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.929
Bruce Wayne was now the mentor to another Batman. ...or Batboy?

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.040
Spider-Man.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.640
The show is gaining more and more of a following, but even people unfamiliar with the show,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.140
know about the movie that show the death of the Animated Series Joker.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.680
Not a spin-off movie or different animated universe, the animated series MANY OF US grew up with!

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.480
The one that contained what many people consider the best Batman and the best Joker.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.380
Don't believe me that a lot of people are familiar with this death?

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.020
We'll just take a look at the YouTube hits.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.180
Part One starts off strong, but starts to lose viewers as most split up videos do.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.279
But there is a HUGE spike in Part 6. Which has, you guessed it, the death of The Joker.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.240
This is so well done that in many people's opinion, it's among the best Batman lore.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.480
This Part is so good, I could actually talk about it, scene by scene.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.720
So here we go!

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.500
Yep, I'm gonna go over why this mere 10 minutes is arguably one of the best Batman stories ever told.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.700
Because hey, great storytelling, even if it's only ten minutes, long deserves to be analyzed.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.449
It begins with commissioner Barbara Gordon, (A.K.A. Batgirl) telling the tale of the night when Robin, (Tim Drake then) was abducted by Joker and Harley.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.540
(Sinister Laugh) "A bird in the hand."

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.820
First of all, this reveal is more brilliant than you may think.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.980
You see the show went through a redesign, and all the characters were given a bit of a makeover.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.760
While most of them were pretty good, a lot of people had issues with the "way too simplified and colorless" Joker.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.340
This reveal makes you think it's going to be that version. Only to reveal it's much closer to the original design.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.480
In fact, it's almost a perfect fusion of the two.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.800
Creating not only a good fake out, but also a creepy image.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.080
Tim goes missing for THREE weeks as Batman is unable to find him.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.100
That amount of time, added to the mystery of what's happening, beautifully raises the tension.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.500
Joker finally sends Batman an invite to meet him at Arkham Asylum.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:15.380
He doesn't even open the door. This, again, visually demonstrates Batman stress about losing his adopted son. Whom HE's put in danger.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.520
The asylum is silent, with a creepy humming in the distance.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.060
( "Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring..." )

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.900
You immediately think this was going to be an eerie, scary battle. Especially seeing how The Joker hasn't been visible for three weeks.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.420
"Puddin', company!"

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.840
But, we see it's all part of the Joker's traditional humor,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.460
as he acts like him and Harley have been waiting for Batman to join them for dinner.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.730
Even the music is more lighthearted!

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.840
"Hello there! Welcome to a happy home."

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.680
It gives you the impression that maybe this is just another Joker outing, and he has Robin over a shark tank or something.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.900
You know the usual stuff. But, we finally see what he's been up to you for three weeks.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.100
"He needed a little molding, of course. What kid doesn't?"

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.120
"Say hello, J.J."

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:12.860
That look alone is amazing! Even before you fully see him, you start snickering with fear.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.180
Until he's finally revealed.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.580
This setup is both disturbing and hilarious at the same time. Pure Joker!

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.720
The idea of this mastermind having a son, a mini him running around, is super funny.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.160
But when you think about
 what he had to do to achieve it,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.580
three weeks of both physical and
 mental torture to A LITTLE BOY,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.400
it's probably the most unsettling thing the show's ever done!

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:50.160
While Batgirl tries to take out Harley and get Robin to safety, leading to probably the funniest line in the film,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.600
"Sweetie, get Mommy's bazooka!"

00:05:52.660 --> 00:06:00.420
Joker in hiding, shows Batman the details of Robin's transformation. Showing his torture like a film strip of family movies.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:07.560
Again, always keeping the humor involved, even though it's so uncomfortable. And just when you think another bombshell couldn't drop.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.120
"Dear lad began to share such secrets with me."

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.300
"Secrets that are mine alone to know..."

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.660
"Secrets that are mine alone to know... Bruce."

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.900
Now on the one hand, a lot of people have figured out who Batman is.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:29.900
But the Joker is almost never one of them. In the movies, in the comics, even in other death scenes, it's NEVER revealed.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:36.240
So, not only is this an iconic figure discovering the biggest secret/weakness of another iconic figure,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.420
but it's the one we've had years and episodes of familiarity with.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.460
It's not just another incarnation of the Joker, it's one we really gotten to know for a long time.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.560
So their particular relationship is beyond well known to us.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:57.200
For a fan, this is a legitimately shocking and even uncomfortable moment. On top of all the other ones we just had.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:04.840
And in typical Joker fashion, how does he react to one of the most famous and tragic backstories in superhero history?

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.800
He makes fun of it!

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:14.480
"Behind all the sturm and bat-a-rangs, you're just a little boy in a playsuit, crying for mommy and daddy."

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.040
"It'd be funny if it weren't so pathetic."

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.120
Oh, bitch! You're a bitch Joker! You're a goddamn bitch!

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.539
Really think about this, too.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:31.040
Most villains upon discovering Batman's identity would play it up as a big thing. Play up the drama and how everything is different now.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:38.760
But the Joker still starts off doing his regular stick of making jokes, playing pretend, and even can keeps calling him Batman.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.960
He doesn't want to let on too early because the reveal it's just too much fun for him.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.300
It's so creepy what a master showman he still is, even with information like this.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.180
And you know he's not going to tell anybody else about it,

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:57.310
because the only audience member in all of this and deserving of the most joy is of course himself.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:05.500
Batman get so pissed off, that he breaks through the projector booth and actually gets two punches in, before the glass even touches the floor.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.040
It's wonderfully chaotic animation.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.380
And again, even knowing his true identity, he still calls him Batman.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.940
"You've lost, Batman. Robin is mine."

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:22.120
Because that's what he's known him as for all these years. And that's how he still sees him.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.040
In his final act, he passes the gun to Robin and tells him to kill him.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:31.600
Again, how crazy is that!? It's not even The Joker that would kill him off. It would be Batman's son,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.780
whose mind was destroyed by the Joker. When you really think about it, it's so friggin twisted.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.540
But Tim finds even in his altered state, he can't do it.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.880
Or at least has enough fight back to swerve it away for just a second, shooting The Joker.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:49.839
Killed by HIS OWN punchline. The Joker delivers the only fitting last words.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.480
"That's not funny."

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.820
"That's not-"

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.280
How is this NOT seen as one of the GREAT Batman stories?

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:09.980
I mean, don't get me wrong, the rest of the movie is fine. Through some sort of techno babble, The Joker's consciousness comes back,

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:17.029
it's not really his body or a full resurrection, but it allows our younger Batman to take him out, and... it's good.

00:09:17.029 --> 00:09:21.500
It's fine for what it is. It's a decent flick. But this 10 minutes...

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:27.480
Holy hell, is it brilliant! It has humor, it has action, it has drama,

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.320
It has the psychological intrigue,
 but without talking about it too much,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.040
It's a perfect balance of everything!

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.840
There's even call back to other great deaths.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.200
You could argue this steals heavily from when The Joker killed Robin in the comics,

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.860
and even when he paralyzes Batgirl. The idea of getting to Batman through someone else.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.050
But while those two certainly were shocking, both of them were older and led their own lives.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:56.440
This was a little kid. Batman's son, still in his care.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:05.600
Putting him through weeks of torture, breaking his mind and body, turning him not only mentally insane, but also resembling Batman's arch-nemesis,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.620
GOOD GOD! That's a lot!

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:16.000
And don't get me wrong. In many respects, Killing Joke IS a better story, with better dialogue, symbolism backstory, all that good stuff.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:26.580
But in terms of the death of The Joker? It doesn't have the familiarity, continuity, or history established by years of being in one universe.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.260
Granted, there's been one major change to the layout,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:36.540
but the Batman comics have gone through TONS of changes. Making it harder to form a connection like we do with these characters.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.340
Now Killing Joke there's a brilliant job with the writing,

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:46.120
establishing the history. But this one doesn't need to set it up, because it's already been established for years.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.140
It's an advantage The Killing Joke in no way can overcome.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.580
Even the censored version that originally aired on TV is still good.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:11:01.760
It's not as strong, but it still works. Robin tosses the gun and tries to battling The Joker. Spilling water and wires all over him.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.880
Resulting in the Joker tripping and turning on the electricity, killing himself.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.180
Some see this as cheap, but it's still Tim fighting back.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:19.280
And, let's face it. It's a funny way to die. In a strange way The Joker would almost be proud that he perishes,

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.120
in the equivalent of slipping on a banana peel. A pretty fitting death for a clown.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.520
It's hard to know how many more deaths or fake outs we're going to get in the future,

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:34.860
but needless to say, it's going to be pretty hard to top this one. In a mere 10 minutes, we've been given a 100%

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:40.860
perfect Batman story ABOUT the death of the Joker. Not only is there nothing wrong with it,

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:49.780
but it delivers everything we would want to see, from arguably the best Batman and best Joker we've ever seen battling each other for years.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.260
What can I say? It's a masterpiece!

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:58.170
Batman and The Joker will always battle in different incarnations, different outfits, and in different stories.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:03.840
But when it comes to which battle ended in the most fitting, familiar, and entertaining way,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.680
Return Of the Joker delivers the perfect punch line.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.180
"That's not funny..."

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.740
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it, so you don't have to.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:04.920
Hey, Doug walker here doing charity shout-out and this week. We are doing the National Federation of the Blind.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:12.140
This organization believes in the full capacity of blind people and has the power influence diversity

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.880
and determination to help transform their dreams into reality.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:23.320
Their democratically-elected leaders and diverse nationwide membership are made up of blind people, families, and friends.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:29.120
They are bound together by their belief that the blind are capable of living the lives they want.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:33.420
They act with courage and determination when they encounter barriers

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.260
or experience setbacks and engage in collective action to improve lives

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.820
If you check out their site and look at their YouTube channel you can not only see

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.080
all the good they accomplish, but also all the awesome people they help.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.409
If you want the proof, just check them out and discover all the great work they do for yourself.
