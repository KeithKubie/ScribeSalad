00:00:07.142 --> 00:00:08.350
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.950
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.160
Today, it's my great pleasure
to introduce local author,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.100
local to Boston, Heidi Pitlor.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.370
HEIDI PITLOR: Thank you.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.720
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.178
HEIDI PITLOR: Thanks
for having me.

00:00:20.178 --> 00:00:21.780
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks for coming.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.071
HEIDI PITLOR: My pleasure.

00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:25.010
MALE SPEAKER: No, our pleasure.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.290
HEIDI PITLOR: No, mine.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.810
MALE SPEAKER: Actually, this
is Heidi's second time here.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.430
She was here last week for
David Duchovny as our guest.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.560
Heidi worked for nine years as
an editor at Houghton Mifflin.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.210
Since then, she's worked
for another nine years

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.660
as co-editor of the Best
American Short Stories

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.100
of the Year, so you've probably
read more short fiction,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.550
at least American short fiction,
than anybody else probably

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.620
anywhere can claim.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.620
HEIDI PITLOR: I hope so.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.170
If anyone else reads more,
I think they need help.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.060
I need help, so they
definitely need help.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.630
MALE SPEAKER: She's
also found time

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.720
to write two novels, "The
Birthdays" and her most

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.830
recent novel, which you have
copies of, "The Daylight

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.250
Marriage," which
I read in advance

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.920
and in another month or two,
I may recover from reading.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.940
It's pretty strong
stuff, should be

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.880
available only
with a prescription

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.630
or to people over-- I
don't know, 18, 16, 14.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.140
Seriously, it's powerful stuff.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.000
So with no further ado, Heidi.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.930
HEIDI PITLOR: Thank you
again for having me.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.520
It's a real pleasure to be here.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.810
I'll sum up the
book for you, and I

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.920
thought I would read a few pages
just to give you a sense of it,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.910
and then maybe we could talk
about it, or anything else you

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.020
might want to talk about today.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.650
So this novel is about
a married couple.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.870
They've been married
for a long time.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.835
They have a 15-year-old
and an eight-year-old,

00:02:09.835 --> 00:02:11.960
a 15-year-old
daughter named Janine

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.880
and an eight-year-old
son named Ethan.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.720
Their marriage has
grown strained.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.780
They are not super thrilled
with each other anymore,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.760
and the book starts
out with them getting

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.050
into an argument,
a heated, you know,

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.020
your typical
married couple being

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.840
pushed to the extreme argument.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.940
So where I'm going to start
is-- the characters' names

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.560
are Lovell is the husband
and Hannah is the wife.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.280
They have just finished
their argument.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.940
Hannah has run off into the
son's room, whose name is

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.240
Ethan, and we're
with Lovell now,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.550
the aftermath of the fight,
the moments after, in his mind.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.600
"He faced Hannah's
pillow, bunched

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.880
into a ball in its ivory case at
the far corner of the mattress.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.820
The poison that they had kept
stored away inside themselves,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.590
this toxic stew that
had expanded for years,

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.950
had finally boiled over and out.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.900
Janine pushed the
door open an inch

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.630
and leaned her face forward.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.440
She peered around the room.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.870
Her hair sat in a brutalized
tangle at the top of hear head.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.890
'You all done?' she asked.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.770
'Yes,' he said, unable
to face her right now.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.260
'Let's get you back
to sleep,' he managed.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.160
If he was able to
seem calm and steady,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.650
she might believe that he was.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.650
'I wasn't sleeping,' she said,
keeping herself behind the door

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.020
as he approached.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.950
'Of course not.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.840
I'm sorry.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.680
That was no good.' He had
learned that the more he tried

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.810
to explain away their battles
to her, the worse they sounded.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.910
'Where's mom?' she asked.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.490
Hannah slept in
Ethan's room whenever

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.630
she had trouble sleeping,
which was most nights.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.730
'Probably in your brother's
room.' Janine stepped carefully

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.970
around the door and
in front of him.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.800
'Is she OK,' she asked.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.220
His daughter could
be surprisingly

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.340
maternal toward Hannah.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.820
'Your mother's fine,'
he said automatically.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.770
'I'm fine too,' he added,
not that she had asked.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.660
He followed her to her bedroom.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.390
He tucked her in, although
she flinched at his touch,

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.800
and then he sat beside
her on her mattress.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.400
At last, she closed her eyes.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.450
He stayed a moment, looking
down at his daughter, the wisps

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.830
of light hair across
her temple, her lips

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.120
barely parted as she
lay there on her side.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.740
She may not have been sleeping.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.400
She may have been pretending,
but he did not say anything.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.637
He was grateful that she
allowed this right now,

00:04:38.637 --> 00:04:40.970
that she was letting him just
stay here and look at her.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.660
The early days, those
first few months

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.520
of friendship, when all that
he knew of Hannah Monroe

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.570
fit inside a daydream.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.360
She had grown up on
Martha's Vineyard

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.850
and now lived alone in
one of her parents' two

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.140
off island homes, a four bedroom
brownstone on Clarendon where

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.970
a tree sized grandfather
clock stood guard just

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.910
inside the front door.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.610
She kept a rosewood
box of [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.210
honey caramel truffles on her
coffee table at all times.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.920
She collected antique
glass perfume bottles

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.930
that were rounded and spiny,
swirled with primordial indigo,

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.370
and deep, opaque emerald.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.360
She was passionate
about the Red Sox

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.220
but hated the Patriots
and football in general.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.590
She gave the
impression of a swan,

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.140
regal but fragile, lovely
and thoughtful and capable

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.050
of sudden wildness.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.790
She was the most feminine,
self assured, compelling female

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.837
that he had ever met.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.420
She called him one
night with a ticket

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.450
to a game against the Blue
Jays the next afternoon.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.660
'My friend just backed out.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.390
I'd have called you
sooner,' she began.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.050
He immediately accepted,
and because she had a car

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.620
and he did not, they agreed
that she would come pick him up

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.560
before the game.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.240
The next afternoon, she arrived
at his apartment in Brighton

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.910
wearing a ski jacket, her neck
swaddled in lumpy, hairy scarf.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.860
Her nostrils were
pink and inflamed

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.420
and she sounded congested.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.240
Had he missed it over the phone?

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.590
He led her inside and
offered to make her some tea.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.280
'We don't have to leave this
second, do we?' he asked.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.200
'No,' she shrugged,
'not just yet.'

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.430
He hung up her jacket while
she unraveled her scarf.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.320
He filled a mug with water
and put it in the microwave.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.650
They sat across from each
other at the wobbly card

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.810
table in his kitchen.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.010
Down the hall, his
roommate Paul labored

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.400
with his trombone scales, unable
to reach the higher notes.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.820
Hannah's hair pooled
down onto her shoulders

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.880
and ran over her small
breasts, down over her stomach,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.800
stopping at her waist.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.850
She had these light filled
eyes and a black eyelash clung

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.140
to the side ridge of her nose.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.770
She made considerable
attempts to sniff back all

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.130
that was inside her sinuses.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.430
He went to find a box of
tissues, and when he returned,

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.610
he asked, 'You sure you're
up for a baseball game

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.880
outside?' 'I'll be fine.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.120
The season's almost over.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.450
We have to go.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.500
Thanks,' she said, as
she reached for the box.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.030
She asked, 'have you ever been
in love?' Her crazy questions,

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.075
always non-sequiturs,
still blindsided him.

00:07:10.075 --> 00:07:11.390
'I'm not sure.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.690
I don't think so,' he said.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.930
Paul groaned and started again
at the beginning of his scale.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.750
The microwave beeped and
Lovell found a box of Lipton

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.020
that Paul's mother had
left on her last visit.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.150
Lovell set the mug
down before Hannah

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.860
and she brought it to her
mouth for a dainty sip.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.690
The table tottered
beneath her arms

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.440
and she wrapped her
fingers around the mug

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.800
to protect the tea or her lap.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.610
He found an empty box of Frosted
Flakes with the recycling,

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.880
folded it into awkward
fourths, and jammed it

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.210
under the shortest table leg.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.540
Once he took his seat again,
she looked off beyond him.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.930
'So what exactly does it
feel like,' he said at last.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.820
'Oh, you'd know,' she said.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.850
'That's what they always
say, you just know,' he said.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.660
The trombone grew louder, a
whiny, embarrassing little

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.060
brother in the next room.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.940
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.640
'The first night I met him,
we slept together,' she said.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.910
This jerk named Doug
Bowen had been her fiance

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.550
just a few months ago.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.350
She talked about him a lot.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.120
'And the next night
too,' she said.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.170
'I probably shouldn't
admit that.'

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.630
How to respond?

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.090
Anyway, Lovell had a
chemical oceanography paper

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.380
due the next day.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.160
He should have been finalizing
his isotope indicators,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.150
proofreading.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.870
He had 100 things he should have
been doing other than sitting

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.034
here with this girl.

00:08:29.034 --> 00:08:30.450
She said, 'you've
never done that,

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.929
slept with someone right
away?' She made one last,

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.809
heartbreaking attempt to
breathe through her nose.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:40.380
He had, but he didn't think it
was love, nothing like that.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.074
'What's the right
answer,' he said.

00:08:42.074 --> 00:08:44.730
'There's no right
or wrong,' she said.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.990
'Well, I guess there was this
one girl and we almost did.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.580
We got really close,' he said,
'but I didn't want to hurt her

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.890
later on, so I held off.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.776
I mean, we both did.'

00:08:55.776 --> 00:08:58.840
'Ah, the right answer
anyway,' she said.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.950
He watched her guide the
tea bag around the water

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.550
by its paper tag.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.300
He was a gawky, long
limbed PhD candidate

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.130
from semi rural Maine.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.430
He was allergic to shellfish,
and in his rare free time,

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.760
he did little other than
monopolize his roommate's

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.050
Nintendo.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.120
She was light years
out of his league.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.474
'Now the wrong
answer,' she said.

00:09:20.474 --> 00:09:22.890
'Yes, we went ahead and slept
together but I didn't really

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.750
love her,' he said.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.520
'Tell me more,' she said.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.830
'She,' he began.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.790
A section of his chest withered.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.140
He felt protective of it.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.400
'No.'

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.650
'No,' she said.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.210
He shook his head.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.180
'Good for you,' she
said, and nodded.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.120
'Really, it's none of my
business.' She finished her tea

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.100
and drew a deep breath,
this time through her mouth.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.730
She sat up straighter and
looked at him anew as if only

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.380
now realizing he was in
the room with her, Lovell

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.260
and not someone else.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.340
'You're a good person,
aren't you?' she said.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.910
'I try,' he said.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.610
She studied his face,
side to side, up and down.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.210
'I could use a good person.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.740
I need someone good in my
life right now,' she said.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.920
'Good,' he said sadly.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.000
He had landed on that
brotherly side of the spectrum.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.730
'Oh,' she said.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.890
'Oh what?' His face was hot.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:14.000
It was too late.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.220
'Nothing,' she said carefully,
but she half smiled,

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.950
embarrassed, maybe
hopefully intrigued.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.110
'Are we ready to go?'

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:24.960
Now, Lovell checked
one more time

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.240
to see whether both cars
were in the driveway.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.450
When he saw that they
were, he headed downstairs

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:32.396
for his laptop and
answered some work emails.

00:10:32.396 --> 00:10:34.270
There would be no point
trying to fall asleep

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.730
after this night.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.740
He skimmed the newspaper,
considered finding his banjo,

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.420
which he had not
played in a few years.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.060
He flipped through
some magazines.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.400
He eventually made his way
back upstairs and into bed.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.880
Later, he heard the Mechener
kid on this bike outside

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.720
and the smack of newspapers
landing on driveways,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.780
as well as the sound of
the milk truck screeching

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.100
down Winter Street, that
compact, joyless, bovine

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.960
woman-- Hannah's
term, It had made

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.550
him howl-- who left
bottles of organic milk

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.050
on people's porches once a week.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.750
In the morning, Hannah remained
steely for the brief time

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.730
that he saw her before
he had to leave for work,

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.600
but she allowed him to give
her a quick kiss goodbye,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.104
and he hoped this might
be a precursor to a truce.

00:11:16.104 --> 00:11:17.520
He turned his
thoughts to all that

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.150
lay ahead of him at his office.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.020
The numbers from Pago
Pago would screw up

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:25.180
his estimates of potential
intensity of tropical cyclones.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.840
Hurricane Katrina
had garnered him

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.030
and his theory some
attention, but still, there

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.350
were plenty of naysayers
in the government.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.440
Lovell arrived at
Mass Environmental

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.440
and the day began" Thank you.

00:11:38.726 --> 00:11:40.100
MALE SPEAKER:
Thank you for that.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:40.970
HEIDI PITLOR: Sure.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.730
MALE SPEAKER: I love the prose.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.800
HEIDI PITLOR: Thank you.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.750
MALE SPEAKER: So I'm curious.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.960
I would like to get
into the differences

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.250
between short fiction
and extended fiction.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.550
You're a novelist,
but you've spent

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.580
most of your career
at this point,

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.220
or a significant
part of it, basically

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.700
judging short fiction.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.180
When you were an editor
at Houghton Mifflin,

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.950
did you work a lot
with short fiction

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:12.810
or did you just stumble
into short fiction?

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.720
HEIDI PITLOR: Well, before I
worked at Houghton Mifflin,

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.020
I got my MFA at Emerson College,
and most writing students

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.520
start out by studying
short fiction because it's

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.350
a very workshoppable form.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.640
It's a very digestible form.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.130
So I guess I started
with short stories,

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.110
and that might have
been my true love.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.560
When I became an
editor, I did work

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.970
on short story
collections and novels.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.780
I did a little
nonfiction, but because I

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.740
worked with a lot
of new writers,

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.740
that tends to be the form
people start out with,

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.440
so I did some of them.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:54.310
A story collection is
not the preferred form.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.010
It wasn't then.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:55.660
It's not now.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.590
Publishers say, that's great.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.560
Do you have a novel after that?

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:04.630
So that tends to be the way to
get some writers in the door.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:06.700
I was an assistant but
worked on a book called

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.710
"The Interpreter of
Maladies," and it

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.740
was so gratifying to see that
this was a story collection.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.910
We published it as
paperback original.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.550
It was a very modest
acquisition and it

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.232
doesn't matter what form it is.

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:21.940
Great writing, I think,
is great writing,

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.670
and I still feel that way.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:28.060
My day job is short fiction,
my writing is longer fiction,

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:33.270
but in my mind, they're
almost interchangeable.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.560
It's more about the writing,
to the, and the prose,

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.690
and the quality of it than
the form that it comes in.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.770
MALE SPEAKER: I've
always imagined,

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.310
and I've never gone
through a writing program,

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.000
so I could be
completely misinformed,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.970
but I've always imagined that
the short story as a form

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.620
has always required
a different skill set

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.980
or always has its
own set of rules

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.375
as opposed to longer fiction.

00:14:04.375 --> 00:14:06.709
Is there any truth to that?

00:14:06.709 --> 00:14:07.500
HEIDI PITLOR: Yeah.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.458
I mean, it's such a
different feeling to write.

00:14:12.671 --> 00:14:14.170
At the beginning
of writing a novel,

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.950
you walk into a big, empty
house, and you think,

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.910
I have to fill all these rooms.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.620
And when you're writing a
story, you're in a room,

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.870
and usually, you
can see at least one

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.820
or two walls, a closet.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.580
You can sense what
the parameters are.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.130
I think in novels, so
many new writers stumble

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.720
when they are over
ambitious and you think,

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.680
I've got to fill this
whole damn house.

00:14:40.754 --> 00:14:42.420
Let's throw in some
history, let's throw

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.510
in a lot of characters.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.310
I think you see a lot of
novelists really stuffing it

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:48.800
full because of that fear
when you walk in, that fear

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.010
of emptiness, of white
space on the page.

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.110
I'm forgetting what
your question was.

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:59.510
MALE SPEAKER:
Basically, differences

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:03.870
in potentially both the
form of a short story

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:08.790
and the skills required
to produce both forms.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:10.540
HEIDI PITLOR: You know,
they're different,

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.830
and I do think writers
tend to either fall on one

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.960
side of the wall or the other.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.780
You're either a short story
writer or a novel writer.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:23.770
In short stories, obviously,
every word matters more.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:25.960
There's not the room for
tangents and digressions

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.220
that there is in novels.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.170
The flip side of
that is in novels,

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.880
there's a lot of space to fill.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:38.060
I think it was really
interesting writing this book

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.490
because it's short and it's,
I think, kind of tight.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.220
I cut away a lot
of the digressions

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.380
that were in there earlier.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.907
Maybe this is kind of a hybrid,
what's called a novella.

00:15:50.907 --> 00:15:52.240
It's being published as a novel.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.900
I'm not sure if I'd say
it's different skill

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.500
set or a different mindset.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.580
I think it's a very
different mindset

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.580
and some people are
more comfortable in one

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:04.910
than in the other.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:08.440
I've seen a lot of story writers
make the transition awkwardly.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.440
I've seen a lot of novelists
try and squeeze themselves

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.760
into short stories, and you
can tell a lot of times.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.280
Granted, that's my job and all
I do is read short stories,

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.370
and I'm very critical
of this stuff,

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.120
but I do think you can
tell where people's comfort

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.710
level is.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.570
MALE SPEAKER:
Commercially speaking,

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.220
I won't identify
the person, but I

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:32.130
know there's at least one
person in this room who's

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.486
an aspiring fiction writer.

00:16:34.486 --> 00:16:36.110
HEIDI PITLOR: Oh good.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:39.100
MALE SPEAKER: You mentioned that
at Houghton Mifflin, at least,

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.690
and I assume most
publishers, that,

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:44.760
if I understood
correctly, it's easier

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:49.910
to get published as a novelist
than as a short story writer.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.350
What advice would you give
the aspiring writer of fiction

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.820
because I can also imagine
going the route of publishing

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.950
short stories in
journals, McSweeney's

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:06.849
and different places, and then
possibly, having done that,

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:10.910
outlining a novel, workshopping
that, and going to a publisher

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.880
and saying, I have these
short story credits.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.850
Here are three chapters
and an outline.

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:16.599
What do you think?

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:18.609
Or going to an agent.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:20.835
Is that a legitimate way to go?

00:17:20.835 --> 00:17:22.460
HEIDI PITLOR: That's
the standard route

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.000
is to write short stories,
to try to get them published

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.421
or win some awards or
do some residencies.

00:17:28.421 --> 00:17:30.670
There are all these great
writing centers-- GrubStreet

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:32.310
in Boston, there's Bread Loaf.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:35.580
There's a lot of different
residencies and programs

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.000
you can apply to.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.750
So to go that route,
writing short stories,

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:44.220
gather some credits,
try to find an agent,

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.260
put together a collection.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.980
Usually, you'll be
asked to write a novel.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.610
I'm a big fan of-- I don't
think breaking rules as much

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.210
as following what it is that
you really want to write.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.300
So if you want to write stories,
by all means, go that route.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.450
It's not easy to get
stories published.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.080
I'm not sure why
exactly that is.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.710
There's a ton of literary
magazines out there,

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:09.220
but it's really hard to
get stories published.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.847
I've talked to umpteen writers.

00:18:10.847 --> 00:18:13.430
When I used to write stories, I
had a hard time finding people

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.570
to publish them.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.640
It's a funny world,
and I'm not sure

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.380
if it's because a
lot of the magazines

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.970
are published by
universities, so you

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:25.600
get grad students reading the
piles of stories that come in

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.630
and they might not have a
sense of if a story's trying

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:29.620
to take a risk.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:34.780
You see less risky stuff out
there in some of the journals.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.274
But to go back to
the question, I

00:18:36.274 --> 00:18:37.690
think it's important
to figure out

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.030
what you really want to write.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.030
If you want to write a
science fiction novel

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.000
and that is your
end goal, screw it.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.430
Get to that.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.900
If you want to
write a prose poem,

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.990
you have to find
where that energy is,

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.760
where that thing that
keeps you interested is.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.130
It's hard these days.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:56.190
Who wants to write?

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.530
There's so much to distract us.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:02.540
You at Google should know this.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.380
The whole world is full
of attention thieves,

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.280
so you have to find what
is just gripping to you

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.620
and allow yourself to
write that, I think,

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.587
no matter what it is.

00:19:12.587 --> 00:19:14.420
There's always going
to be prescribed routes

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.420
to go about this and
that, and then you

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.640
hear these stories of the
most successful people

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.130
didn't go that route.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.270
J. K. Rowling, people
who wrote on the sly.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.290
I think, again, the key is to
figure out what works for you

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:32.360
and to respect your own
inner voice, in a way.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.010
It's a hard thing
to do these days,

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:35.134
but I think it's important.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.700
MALE SPEAKER: Now, in terms of
the Best American Short Fiction

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.710
of the Year, you typically
work with well known writers,

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:50.860
most recently, Pulitzer
Prize winner Jennifer Egan,

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.040
to produce those.

00:19:54.659 --> 00:19:56.200
Do they pull their
weight or are they

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.570
just big names to
put on the covers?

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:00.400
You don't have to
answer that honestly.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.320
How does the process work?

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.320
HEIDI PITLOR: They
definitely pull their weight.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.736
I mean, I have a
different weight.

00:20:05.736 --> 00:20:08.630
So what I do is
I read everything

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.820
that's published in
the calendar year

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:15.650
by an American journal
that is distributed,

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.805
which encompasses a huge amount.

00:20:17.805 --> 00:20:19.680
MALE SPEAKER: How many
stories would that be?

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.460
HEIDI PITLOR: I read between
3,000 and 4,000 a year,

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.920
so I'm really picky
and critical and awful.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.650
I'm kind of your worst nightmare
reader because I have kids

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.390
and I write and I
have no patience.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:37.600
So either I'm with you on
page one or two or forget it.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.260
So I read all these stories.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.150
They all get sent to me.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.950
They just come in.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:45.360
I'm on everybody's
circulation list.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.060
I read them all.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:50.460
I pull 120 of them, and then I
said those to my guest editor

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.670
who pulls 20.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:52.660
They pick 20.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.710
And everyone's different.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.740
We work together sometimes
more, sometimes less.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.640
They're the big name.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.310
I let them decide how
the process should go.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:04.910
But it's the world's
greatest job.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:06.580
It really is.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:11.930
I get to be a one on one book
club with just an incredibly

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.060
successful and talented
writer every year

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.670
and have it be
someone different.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.304
It's fascinating.

00:21:18.304 --> 00:21:19.970
It's completely,
completely fascinating.

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:23.160
Their processes
are all different.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.870
I never know what to expect.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.754
When I started this
job, I thought,

00:21:27.754 --> 00:21:29.545
Alice Sebold, who wrote
"The Lovely Bones,"

00:21:29.545 --> 00:21:33.835
I pulled all these violent
stories about kids and girls,

00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:35.990
and none of them.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:39.190
She was really into historical
fiction, and I thought,

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:40.440
I have no idea.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.120
So then I began to just say,
I just need to rely on my gut,

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.440
pick things that I
like, not try to please

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.160
the other person, which is such
a good life lesson sometimes.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.690
And it's really
unpredictable each year,

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.350
but there's a lot of reading,
and they do a lot of reading,

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.850
too.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:00.570
They have to read 120 of
these stories and pick 20.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.580
And some years, it's
easier than others.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.690
There can be a lot of
back and forth between us.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:07.140
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.845
But ultimately, the
20 that they pick

00:22:09.845 --> 00:22:11.510
are the ones that
will go on the book?

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.260
HEIDI PITLOR: Yes.

00:22:15.699 --> 00:22:16.490
I write a foreword.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:17.615
They write an introduction.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:21.840
It's kind of nice for
me because if people

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.560
complain about the stories, I
say, well, blame Jenny Egan.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.250
I had nothing to do with it.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.990
It's nice not to have
the full load rest on me.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.190
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:33.650
Always good to have a backup.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.470
Anything else you
want us to know

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.550
about anything else you do?

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.060
HEIDI PITLOR: Oh my god.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.530
Well, everybody sit back.

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.379
MALE SPEAKER:
Totally open ended.

00:22:49.379 --> 00:22:50.670
HEIDI PITLOR: I don't think so.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.580
Do you guys have
any questions maybe?

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.550
I always like
knowing what you want

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.600
to hear so I'm not yammering
into the ether so much,

00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.736
so go ahead.

00:22:59.736 --> 00:23:02.712
AUDIENCE: I would love to ask
you a question about this book.

00:23:02.712 --> 00:23:05.192
I have read some
reviews on the book

00:23:05.192 --> 00:23:10.170
and I understand this is
very emotional and very hard

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.648
on the reader, in a
sense, and I really

00:23:12.648 --> 00:23:15.624
look forward, and also
am a little bit afraid.

00:23:15.624 --> 00:23:20.088
I imagine a lot of readers can
relate to it because people

00:23:20.088 --> 00:23:22.568
are in relationships,
people tend to argue,

00:23:22.568 --> 00:23:25.048
people tend to have remorse
after their arguments.

00:23:25.048 --> 00:23:29.016
And usually, it
doesn't go that bad,

00:23:29.016 --> 00:23:34.968
but this is like not
living out a fantasy,

00:23:34.968 --> 00:23:36.952
but reading about
some characters

00:23:36.952 --> 00:23:42.408
and seeing what
happens [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:42.408 --> 00:23:44.888
This might be a really
good lesson for us.

00:23:44.888 --> 00:23:47.864
But even if I don't learn
anything from the book,

00:23:47.864 --> 00:23:50.344
if I enjoy it, then
it's worth reading.

00:23:50.344 --> 00:23:54.236
I was wondering
what made you choose

00:23:54.236 --> 00:23:59.610
such an intense,
emotional subject.

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:03.030
How did you weigh your
risk of having something

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:08.010
that readers take
months to recover from?

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:12.138
And also, how did
you cope emotionally

00:24:12.138 --> 00:24:15.449
with the burden of having
to be in the position

00:24:15.449 --> 00:24:19.952
of the characters and having
to write out and go back

00:24:19.952 --> 00:24:24.239
over and over and rewrite,
really reliving what they

00:24:24.239 --> 00:24:25.530
are living through in the book?

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:30.865
What did it mean for you to
write from the point of view

00:24:30.865 --> 00:24:33.380
of these characters?

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.870
HEIDI PITLOR: So a few answers.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.220
I wrote my first book.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.510
It was published
in 2006, and it is

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:44.800
a novel about a family
full of pregnant people,

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.180
and it's kind of a family drama.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.950
It's set on an island in Maine.

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:52.130
And after I published it, a
well known writer came up to me

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.252
and he said, you know
what I love about a book?

00:24:55.252 --> 00:24:55.960
And I said, what?

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.868
He said, well, I usually
like when something happens.

00:24:58.868 --> 00:25:01.740
And I said, wow, thanks.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.740
I just turned purple
and crept away.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.840
But it stuck with me and I
thought, I love my first book

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.490
but it doesn't have a huge plot.

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:13.820
It was more of a psychological
exploration of a family.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.210
And I thought, I wouldn't
mind writing a big bang book.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.890
It's always been
important to me,

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.160
and this sounds really basic,
but to keep your reader

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.527
turning pages.

00:25:26.527 --> 00:25:27.860
It's a really fundamental thing.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.030
I think a lot of readers
lose sight of that.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.900
Once again, these days, there
are so many distractions

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:34.640
out there.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.280
A lot of people aren't reading
as much as they used to,

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.860
and it's important to
keep your reader engaged.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:45.760
So I had that in the back of
my mind after my first book.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.420
I got pregnant with
twins and my husband

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:52.060
and I lived out in a small
town, and I took this new job,

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:56.260
and I was just home
bound with twins,

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.520
which was really hard on me.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.680
We were isolated.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.000
We were what felt like out
in the middle of nowhere.

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.220
It was a strange place to be.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.060
All I knew is I wanted to write
something that had a big story.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:12.140
And around this time,
the Lacey Peterson story

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.650
was in the news a
lot, and I started

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:15.850
noticing there's all these
stories of these very

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.800
beautiful women who go
missing and something grizzly

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.730
happens to them, and why are
they getting so much coverage?

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.760
Why are these stories
getting so much coverage?

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.820
So I kind of dipped a toe in
this story, and then maybe

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:31.420
a month later, a woman who
lived in my town was shot,

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.470
she and her young baby
were shot in her bed

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.920
by her British husband,
and the press just

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.670
flooded into our town.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.690
And I was like a crazy person.

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.530
I was completely
obsessed with this case.

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:46.960
They lived less than a
mile and a half from us.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.750
Our town center, our nice
little, bucolic town green

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.440
filled up with reporters.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.180
And I watched this whole thing
and it just got under my skin.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:59.450
And I thought, why has
this become a dark fairy

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:01.120
tale for us?

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.790
Why do people lap this up--
the media, the readers.

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.332
Why do I care?

00:27:05.332 --> 00:27:06.840
I'm sort of a smart person.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.230
I'm literary.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.660
I don't usually read
tabloid news so much,

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.840
but I could not get
enough of this case.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.165
So that was my in
door to this story.

00:27:15.165 --> 00:27:18.690
I had these things
swirling around in my head,

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:23.710
and I started writing it, and
the darker story was really

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:27.646
part of a back story as I was
writing the first few drafts.

00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:30.080
There was a nicer,
happier story around it,

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.880
which eventually fell away
with the help of my editor, who

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.600
saw that the book really
was about the darker,

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.230
more uncomfortable
story, and it was

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:41.090
OK to let that sit
alone on the page.

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:43.930
I didn't set out for it to
be this emotional and this

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:44.650
intense.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:46.340
I think it needed to be.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.920
It's a weird thing as a
writer, and it probably

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.010
sounds a little bit
crazy, but a book

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:53.190
needs to be a certain thing.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:56.420
Your characters
speak to you in a way

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.580
that can override
what your needs are.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:04.750
And so this thing took
over my life for so long.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.510
It was very painful to
write, but it was also

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:09.380
when I had finished
it in the way

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.460
that it needed to be finished,
it was incredibly rewarding.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.030
And I felt nervous because
I thought, oh god, I'm

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.600
going to send this dark
thing out into the world,

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.930
but I also thought of many
other dark books that did OK.

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.000
I think people can
handle intensity

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.070
and I think it's important
to trust your reader.

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:32.934
I think not enough people
in various businesses do,

00:28:32.934 --> 00:28:35.350
and I think people at the end
of the day want to be moved.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:37.240
They want catharsis
in their reading.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.770
So maybe this was all
just justification,

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:43.720
but I clung to it, and
now we have this book,

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.700
if that answers that.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.340
Any other questions?

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.420
Anything anyone
wants to talk about?

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.170
MALE SPEAKER: Actually,
I had one more,

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:54.690
and you touched on it.

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:58.250
Taking off of your
question, certainly,

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:03.050
there are at least a few
superficial similarities

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.120
to another dark book-- you know
where I'm going with this--

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.510
which has gotten--

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:09.430
HEIDI PITLOR: I have no idea.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.880
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
you might have

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.310
heard there was a book that
was on the Times bestseller

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:17.806
list for about 19 or 20 years,
seemingly, called Gone Girl.

00:29:17.806 --> 00:29:18.930
HEIDI PITLOR: Oh, that one.

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:19.284
MALE SPEAKER: I
think they might have

00:29:19.284 --> 00:29:20.780
made a little movie about it.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:24.470
There are a few at least
superficial resemblances

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:26.700
between your book and that one.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:31.270
Was that something that
came up during the editing

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.877
process or the publishing
process with you?

00:29:34.877 --> 00:29:36.460
HEIDI PITLOR: That's
a great question.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:40.780
So yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:43.730
So this book took me
a long time to write,

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:47.670
and "Gone Girl" was published
I'm not sure what year,

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:49.470
but a few years
into my writing it.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:52.460
And I thought, uh oh.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.621
I read it and
right away thought,

00:29:54.621 --> 00:29:55.870
this is such a different book.

00:29:55.870 --> 00:30:04.160
I think "Gone Girl" is an edgy,
wonderful mystery thriller,

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.420
funner ride of a book.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.699
Mine has been called
a mystery or thriller

00:30:09.699 --> 00:30:10.990
and I don't really think it is.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:14.290
I think it's
suspenseful and I always

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:16.800
feel a little pretentious
using the word "literary,"

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:21.460
but I think it's literary and
suspenseful and psychological,

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:27.080
but it's not "Gone
Girl" in any way.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.230
The first five pages, maybe
there's a similar premise,

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:32.940
but it goes in such a
wildly different direction.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.190
That said, it's been hard
having that out there.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:38.680
It feels like the person in
the room, the 800-pound gorilla

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.300
that's hanging out with
me during this whole time.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.150
I love "Gone Girl."

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:43.274
I thought it was wonderful.

00:30:43.274 --> 00:30:44.780
I loved the movie.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:45.840
This isn't that book.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:50.900
I think there's a lot of
desire out there to say,

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.480
this is the next
"Gone Girl" or this

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.870
is the next whatever
big book out there.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:00.380
As a writer, you can't
pay attention to that

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.170
unless it is the same book.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:03.780
Once I had read
it, I felt better.

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:07.500
But there's been a lot of
comparisons made in the press,

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.050
and I worry with
that together where

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:12.520
there's a lovely quote from
Stephen King on the front.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.910
I worry that the "Gone
Girl" comparison, together

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.260
with this great
Stephen King quote,

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.242
is going to mislead people.

00:31:20.242 --> 00:31:22.450
But at the end of the day,
I guess that's not my job.

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:24.750
My job is to write a book
and worry about the writing,

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.900
and then at this
point, it's yours.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.620
It's for the readers,
and I go away and shield

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:34.300
myself a little bit, hopefully.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.072
So that's what I'll
say about that.

00:31:36.072 --> 00:31:36.780
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.077
Fair enough.

00:31:39.077 --> 00:31:39.660
Anything else?

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.180
AUDIENCE: Have you got any
ideas for another book?

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.620
HEIDI PITLOR: I
do, and I'm always

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.610
nervous to talk
about it too soon,

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:47.800
but I do and it's much lighter.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.370
I kind of feel like I need
a vacation after this one,

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:55.170
and I worry it might be
so light that if there's

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:57.140
a reader that likes this,
they won't like that.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.380
But again, you can't care about.

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.296
You have to just write
what you want to write.

00:32:00.296 --> 00:32:06.260
So my main idea is that it's
about happiness and the search

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.050
for happiness,
which will probably

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:10.610
mean it'll turn into something
horrible and unhappy,

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:13.174
knowing me, but
I'm going to try.

00:32:13.174 --> 00:32:14.340
I need a lighter experience.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:18.780
Anything else?

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:19.700
Any other questions?

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.960
Go ahead.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.900
AUDIENCE: In your
description of your job,

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.810
you seem to read something
like five, six, seven,

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:32.884
eight short stories a day,
which brings me to a question.

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:38.320
Usually, when I finish a book,
be it a short story or a novel,

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.030
it doesn't matter
what it is about.

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.840
I just need to pay my
respect to the book

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.592
by just waiting for
a few days before I

00:32:45.592 --> 00:32:46.550
switch to another book.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:50.140
I was wondering how you manage
to do this context switching

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.935
so fast, five times a day.

00:32:51.935 --> 00:32:52.810
HEIDI PITLOR: I know.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.430
So I have to do mini
switches, or palate cleansers,

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:56.700
I call them.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.360
This is what's made me an
absolute Twitter and Facebook

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.280
junkie because it's the
perfect amount of time.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.470
If I read a whole
story, my computer's

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:10.970
there, putz around on Twitter
and Facebook for a bit,

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:13.110
get the mind out,
because I can't afford

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:14.980
to take a longer chunk of time.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.700
There's just too much to read.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.120
At the end of my reading year,
always, there's this avalanche.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.160
No matter how much I try
and stay on top of it

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.550
through the year, there's
just this growing pile

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:27.880
that is sitting there
at the end of the year,

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.750
and there's a few less
palate cleansers in there.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:34.850
You learn to do
it after a while,

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:39.240
but you also learn to accept
the fact that you're human,

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.600
that you're not perfect.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:47.185
I always feel like-- you
just feel strange about,

00:33:47.185 --> 00:33:50.490
who am I to decide what the
best American short story is?

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:52.260
At some point, all
of us just say,

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:53.880
well, I'm going to
do the best I can

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.950
and I'm going to
accept my shortcomings.

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:58.676
There are days where
I'm in a bad mood,

00:33:58.676 --> 00:34:00.550
and unfortunately, if
I'm reading your story,

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:03.720
that's the way the world
works, like any job.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.370
There are days where my kids
are driving me crazy or are sick

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:10.620
and I have to read
with the TV blaring

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:15.960
and the water pipes
broken or something.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.909
I'm going into my
10th volume, so I've

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:20.100
learned to forgive
myself in a lot of ways

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:24.960
and at least try to accept
my imperfections on the job.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.800
But that said,
Twitter and Facebook

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.389
are my friends for
palate cleansing.

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:32.989
Anyone else have
any other questions?

00:34:35.773 --> 00:34:36.701
Go ahead.

00:34:36.701 --> 00:34:40.460
AUDIENCE: So between
the two orthogonal tasks

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:44.340
of reading and
reviewing and authoring,

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:49.340
do you find it hard to create
the dividing line here,

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.698
where ideas from one aren't
leaking into the other?

00:34:52.698 --> 00:34:53.739
HEIDI PITLOR: Absolutely.

00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:56.724
I think the best thing to do
is to write first in the day.

00:34:56.724 --> 00:34:58.390
I drop my kids off
at school and then go

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:02.840
write, because if I read first,
other voices get into my head.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:07.360
I try to have a time
separation, whether it's lunch,

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.920
go run an errand or something.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.340
But it's really easy to
even subconsciously grab

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:16.580
onto a voice or a
phrase or a character

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:21.440
and have it worm its way through
without even realizing it.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.720
And the other thing
that I think is hard

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.760
is that my day job makes me
a really critical reader,

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.830
so it's hard not to be
hard on myself as a writer.

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:32.480
It's much easier
for me to revise

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.330
than to produce new work.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:38.550
When you're in that
generative space,

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:41.200
it's almost like being
in a dream state.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.790
You have to turn off every
critical voice in your head

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:45.540
or you're not going
to produce anything.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:48.440
So that's gotten harder
for me over the years,

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:53.070
and I've revised this for long
enough that it's been awhile.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.310
So writing this new
book feels a little bit

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:58.660
like I've been put in
a sandbox with no toys

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.980
and I kind of have
to figure it out.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:03.240
It's tough, but hopefully
I'll be able to get back

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.400
in the mode of it.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.930
Any other questions,
concerns, fears?

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:13.540
MALE SPEAKER: I have
one more, and one more.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.150
I was just wondering.

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:18.290
I would guess you would
be past this stage,

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:21.620
if it ever happened, but at
any point in this career,

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:26.680
have you ever had editors
or agents or writers

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.160
themselves say the
equivalent of, please

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.550
don't read this story of
mine when your kids are

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:34.969
driving you crazy or something.

00:36:34.969 --> 00:36:37.510
I know you've read 10 stories
of mine in the last five years,

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:38.880
but this is the one.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.900
HEIDI PITLOR: Oh yes.

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.590
I have authors send me stuff.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:44.817
And again, I'll read
anything that was published,

00:36:44.817 --> 00:36:46.400
but they don't get
to say when I read.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.370
I think it's like any award.

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:50.330
It's the unfortunate
luck of the draw.

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:52.460
I've definitely had people
send me notes saying,

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.280
this is the best
story by this author,

00:36:54.280 --> 00:37:02.020
and you can't really
take any of it in.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:05.170
I think I've gotten
to the point where

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:08.545
my kids used to play soccer
at this indoor soccer place.

00:37:08.545 --> 00:37:11.550
It was the, loudest,
smelliest, nastiest space.

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:13.200
And I'd sit there
reading my stories,

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.490
and all the other moms
were chatting away.

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:19.940
And I think I got really
good at telling right away,

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:22.060
this is a good
story or this isn't.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:25.350
It becomes this
automatic thing where

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:29.530
there's a switch
flicked or not, and it

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.480
becomes easier and easier
the more you do it.

00:37:34.172 --> 00:37:36.490
MALE SPEAKER: But
people do politic.

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:38.410
HEIDI PITLOR: People
rally a little bit,

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:40.520
and they're allowed to
rally all they want,

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.010
but it's not going to
make any difference to me.

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:44.887
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:37:44.887 --> 00:37:46.470
HEIDI PITLOR: Did
you have a question?

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:51.150
AUDIENCE: So as someone
who's read a ton of stories,

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:53.630
it sounds like you have
a good sense for what

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:55.310
it is that makes a good story.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:58.628
From my perspective of being
a much less avid reader,

00:37:58.628 --> 00:38:01.370
there is always this conflict
between a story that's

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:03.120
really strong throughout
and then the ones

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:06.802
that one piece of imagery,
that no matter how

00:38:06.802 --> 00:38:09.260
little I'm enjoying it during
the reading, two years later,

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.342
I'm still revisiting
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:12.342 --> 00:38:14.896
Do you find that
correlation is there,

00:38:14.896 --> 00:38:18.254
or the inverse
correlation, perhaps,

00:38:18.254 --> 00:38:20.670
the ones that stick with you
the most versus the ones that

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:22.080
are actually [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.570
HEIDI PITLOR: They do.

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.220
I've started to think in
this very romantic term.

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.610
My head is a computer that's
getting really stuffed.

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:33.330
So I don't remember
as much as I used to.

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:36.900
I also should say Houghton
Mifflin is publishing

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.680
a book called "100 Years of the
Best American Short Stories,"

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.340
and that's coming
out in October.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.310
So along with reading
3,000 to 4,000

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:45.080
of the regular
stories every year,

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.740
for the past three
or four years,

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:51.140
I've read every volume of the
book to put together this.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:54.370
So this computer chip,
whatever is fried.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:56.900
I mean, there's just not
a lot of specific imagery

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.180
that I'm just sitting
around thinking of.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:03.467
But for my favorite
stories, it's true.

00:39:03.467 --> 00:39:05.050
There are moments
that stick with you.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.760
There are lines
that stick with you.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.360
What do I think
makes a strong story?

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.120
Confident writing,
natural writing.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.300
I wish there were
more humor out there.

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.120
I like risk taking.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:23.800
I'm a big fan of melding of
genres of sci-fi, of dystopia,

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:29.190
or of humor or mystery, as
well as literary fiction.

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.850
I like anything
that feels inventive

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:34.630
or new or important or relevant.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:38.050
I wish more people wrote stories
about technology and science

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:42.000
and the economy.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.870
It's funny.

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:46.880
In short fiction, news
or content of the day

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.930
takes a while to
penetrate short fiction.

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:53.181
So now I'm reading a lot of
stories about the Iraq war.

00:39:53.181 --> 00:39:55.430
So I always feel like I'm
reading the shadow of what's

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:58.210
happening in the real world
because it takes writers

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:03.390
a while to properly digest
what's going on in the world

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:07.760
and make sense of it and
turn it into art, obviously.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.310
That's basically what
I look for, I think.

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:13.540
That said, good writing
is good writing.

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.890
I'm always surprised
when I like a story that

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:18.110
is about nothing, that's
just a great voice

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:21.070
or has great imagery
or characters.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:24.390
That is incredibly
gratifying, too.

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:25.620
Thank you so much for coming.

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:26.550
This was really fun.

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:27.420
Thank you.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:28.970
[APPLAUSE]
