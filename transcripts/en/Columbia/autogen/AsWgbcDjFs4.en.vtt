I want to start out today by just saying

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
I want to start out today by just saying
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.650
I want to start out today by just saying
a few words relating to the question of

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660
a few words relating to the question of
 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.519
a few words relating to the question of
inevitability which was the the question

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529
inevitability which was the the question
 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.560
inevitability which was the the question
asked from the midterm examination

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570
asked from the midterm examination
 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.859
asked from the midterm examination
whether the rise of the West was

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869
whether the rise of the West was
 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.600
whether the rise of the West was
inevitable and if so from what point the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610
inevitable and if so from what point the
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.220
inevitable and if so from what point the
the first point I make is that the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230
the first point I make is that the
 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.420
the first point I make is that the
question assumes that the West exists as

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430
question assumes that the West exists as
 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.020
question assumes that the West exists as
a as an entity during most of the time

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
a as an entity during most of the time
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.049
a as an entity during most of the time
period that was suggested that is say

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059
period that was suggested that is say
 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.650
period that was suggested that is say
period from 1500 down to 1900 you would

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660
period from 1500 down to 1900 you would
 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.510
period from 1500 down to 1900 you would
have had a very difficult time finding

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
have had a very difficult time finding
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.200
have had a very difficult time finding
anyone who knew what the West was they

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210
anyone who knew what the West was they
 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.400
anyone who knew what the West was they
would have thought

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410
would have thought
 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.279
would have thought
Frances on their eyes or Britain is on

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289
Frances on their eyes or Britain is on
 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:12.440
Frances on their eyes or Britain is on
the rise or Spain is on the rise but

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
the rise or Spain is on the rise but
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.320
the rise or Spain is on the rise but
they wouldn't have a grenaded all the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330
they wouldn't have a grenaded all the
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.760
they wouldn't have a grenaded all the
things they these things together

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770
things they these things together
 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.690
things they these things together
particularly including North America as

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
particularly including North America as

particularly including North America as
the West this may not seem entirely

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500
the West this may not seem entirely
 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.359
the West this may not seem entirely
logical because we have been taught now

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369
logical because we have been taught now
 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.309
logical because we have been taught now
to recognize that the Orient is the

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319
to recognize that the Orient is the
 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.449
to recognize that the Orient is the
other of the West but in some respects

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:41.459
other of the West but in some respects
 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.089
other of the West but in some respects
the Orient was created before the West

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:44.099
the Orient was created before the West
 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:48.859
the Orient was created before the West
existed which is a could be a problem if

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
existed which is a could be a problem if
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.080
existed which is a could be a problem if
anybody wanted to pursue it very far in

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090
anybody wanted to pursue it very far in
 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.280
anybody wanted to pursue it very far in
other words we had an orient that was

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290
 
 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.630
 
thought of as being other than something

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640
thought of as being other than something
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.790
thought of as being other than something
but it was more normally thought as

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800
but it was more normally thought as
 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.910
but it was more normally thought as
being other than say the Christian world

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920
being other than say the Christian world
 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.480
being other than say the Christian world
or other than Europe or other than a

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490
or other than Europe or other than a
 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.020
or other than Europe or other than a
particular country but the notion of the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030
particular country but the notion of the
 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.699
particular country but the notion of the
West as a broad category the closest

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709
West as a broad category the closest
 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:21.930
West as a broad category the closest
thing you would get to it would be a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940
thing you would get to it would be a
 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.600
thing you would get to it would be a
concept like Christendom and yet if you

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610
concept like Christendom and yet if you
 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.360
concept like Christendom and yet if you
posed the question was the rise of

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370
posed the question was the rise of
 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.020
posed the question was the rise of
Christendom inevitable after 1500 well

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030
Christendom inevitable after 1500 well
 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.270
Christendom inevitable after 1500 well
probably that would be a very difficult

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280
probably that would be a very difficult
 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.940
probably that would be a very difficult
question for anybody to to undertake

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950
question for anybody to to undertake
 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.570
question for anybody to to undertake
because we've now taken West to be to be

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580
because we've now taken West to be to be
 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.660
because we've now taken West to be to be
a a real entity and in some respects

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670
a a real entity and in some respects
 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.440
a a real entity and in some respects
this is a presumption that is at the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450
this is a presumption that is at the
 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.550
this is a presumption that is at the
very root of the contemporary history

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560
very root of the contemporary history
 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.530
very root of the contemporary history
teaching of world history because the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540
teaching of world history because the
 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.729
teaching of world history because the
first really influential book on world

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739
first really influential book on world
 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.180
first really influential book on world
history was William McNeil's the rise of

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190
history was William McNeil's the rise of
 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.910
history was William McNeil's the rise of
the West and by the time people were

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920
the West and by the time people were
 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.590
the West and by the time people were
reading that book and were impressed by

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600
reading that book and were impressed by
 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.070
reading that book and were impressed by
the book

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080
the book
 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.240
the book
the West had come into being and

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250
the West had come into being and
 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.440
the West had come into being and
interestingly the East by that time was

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450
interestingly the East by that time was
 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.039
interestingly the East by that time was
not the Orient

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049
not the Orient
 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.280
not the Orient
it was the Communist Empire so that the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290
it was the Communist Empire so that the
 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.870
it was the Communist Empire so that the
rise of the West was not if you talk

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880
rise of the West was not if you talk
 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.560
rise of the West was not if you talk
about east-west politics in the 1960s

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570
about east-west politics in the 1960s
 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.580
about east-west politics in the 1960s
1970s 1980s you're not talking about the

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590
1970s 1980s you're not talking about the
 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.430
1970s 1980s you're not talking about the
West versus the Orient you're talking

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440
West versus the Orient you're talking
 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.830
West versus the Orient you're talking
about Europe and about NATO against

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840
about Europe and about NATO against
 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.350
about Europe and about NATO against
against the Warsaw Pact so there are

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360
against the Warsaw Pact so there are
 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.240
against the Warsaw Pact so there are
real difficulties with the whole notion

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250
real difficulties with the whole notion
 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.280
real difficulties with the whole notion
of the inevitability of the rise of the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290
of the inevitability of the rise of the
 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.410
of the inevitability of the rise of the
West because of the assumption it makes

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420
West because of the assumption it makes
 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.360
West because of the assumption it makes
about the word West even leaving aside

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370
about the word West even leaving aside
 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.800
about the word West even leaving aside
the question of what the world

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810
the question of what the world
 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.660
the question of what the world
inevitable means

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670
inevitable means
 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.070
inevitable means
okay that's the first observation I make

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080
okay that's the first observation I make
 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.369
okay that's the first observation I make
the second observation I would make is

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379
the second observation I would make is
 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:21.099
the second observation I would make is
that if I had asked the question is the

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109
that if I had asked the question is the
 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.680
that if I had asked the question is the
rise of China inevitable that would have

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690
rise of China inevitable that would have
 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.120
rise of China inevitable that would have
been I think a very difficult question

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130
been I think a very difficult question
 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.750
been I think a very difficult question
for people to address because there the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760
for people to address because there the
 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.440
for people to address because there the
word inevitable would have a predictive

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450
word inevitable would have a predictive
 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.420
word inevitable would have a predictive
aspect to it so one of the things about

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430
aspect to it so one of the things about
 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.640
aspect to it so one of the things about
the rise of the West being inevitable is

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650
the rise of the West being inevitable is
 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.210
the rise of the West being inevitable is
that it is strictly retrospective say

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220
that it is strictly retrospective say
 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.300
that it is strictly retrospective say
okay we know what happened hence let us

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310
okay we know what happened hence let us
 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.409
okay we know what happened hence let us
evaluate in some fashion why it happened

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419
evaluate in some fashion why it happened
 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:54.159
evaluate in some fashion why it happened
and how it might have happened

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169
and how it might have happened
 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.590
and how it might have happened
differently but say with the rise of

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600
differently but say with the rise of
 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:04.890
differently but say with the rise of
China is it inevitable in terms of the

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900
China is it inevitable in terms of the
 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.030
China is it inevitable in terms of the
arguments made in the the book referred

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040
arguments made in the the book referred
 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.409
arguments made in the the book referred
to in the mid term that is to say are

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419
to in the mid term that is to say are
 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.210
to in the mid term that is to say are
there or have there been moments when

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220
there or have there been moments when
 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.680
there or have there been moments when
the rise of China could be derailed or

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690
the rise of China could be derailed or
 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.529
the rise of China could be derailed or
the baby strangled and its cradle I

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539
the baby strangled and its cradle I
 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.320
the baby strangled and its cradle I
think was the image that used to me the

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330
think was the image that used to me the
 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:36.390
think was the image that used to me the

quote well when it's something ongoing
 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.480
quote well when it's something ongoing
you could say well yeah I mean supposing

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490
you could say well yeah I mean supposing
 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.219
you could say well yeah I mean supposing
during the Korean War the United States

during the Korean War the United States
 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.520
during the Korean War the United States
had had followed the advice of General

had had followed the advice of General
MacArthur and used the atomic bomb

post-world War two ERA have come to the
 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:40.489
post-world War two ERA have come to the

same kind of path that China has come to
 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:44.049
same kind of path that China has come to
now and I think you can hypothesize

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:44.059
now and I think you can hypothesize
 

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:49.659
now and I think you can hypothesize
these things and quite easily say well

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669
these things and quite easily say well
 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:55.089
these things and quite easily say well
sure something could have happened and

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:55.099
sure something could have happened and
 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:58.369
sure something could have happened and

know ongoing historical processes are
 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:07.969
know ongoing historical processes are
much more difficult to assess then than

much more difficult to assess then than

much more difficult to assess then than
ones that appear to have have passed but

ones that appear to have have passed but
 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.049
ones that appear to have have passed but
that's always in appearance because the

00:07:15.049 --> 00:07:15.059
that's always in appearance because the

that's always in appearance because the

what it is to look at and there's there
 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:25.579
what it is to look at and there's there
always other optics that can be used

on in the in the period since World War

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:35.399
on in the in the period since World War
 

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:41.689
on in the in the period since World War
two we have given and probably for some

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:41.699
two we have given and probably for some
 

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:45.829
two we have given and probably for some
time will continue to give singular

00:07:45.829 --> 00:07:45.839
time will continue to give singular
 

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:51.459
time will continue to give singular
prominence to the to the Cold War and

00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:51.469
prominence to the to the Cold War and
 

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:53.959

people who are old enough to have lived
 

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:56.119
people who are old enough to have lived
through that period well think that it's

00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:56.129
through that period well think that it's
 

00:07:56.129 --> 00:08:03.290
through that period well think that it's
hard how could you not do that but the

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:03.300
hard how could you not do that but the
 

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.109
hard how could you not do that but the
question of whether the Cold War needs

00:08:06.109 --> 00:08:06.119
question of whether the Cold War needs
 

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:08.889
question of whether the Cold War needs
to be at the center of things

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:08.899
to be at the center of things
 

00:08:08.899 --> 00:08:13.219
to be at the center of things
particularly now that it's 20 years in

00:08:13.219 --> 00:08:13.229
particularly now that it's 20 years in
 

00:08:13.229 --> 00:08:17.269
particularly now that it's 20 years in
the past and indeed you might even say

00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:17.279
the past and indeed you might even say
 

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:19.449
the past and indeed you might even say
30 years since it was winding down

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:19.459
30 years since it was winding down
 

00:08:19.459 --> 00:08:22.790
30 years since it was winding down
before the final fall of the Soviet

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800
before the final fall of the Soviet
 

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.069
before the final fall of the Soviet
Union from the dissolution of the Soviet

Union from the dissolution of the Soviet
 

00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:28.399
Union from the dissolution of the Soviet
Union how long are we going to continue

Union how long are we going to continue
 

00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:31.489
Union how long are we going to continue
to say that that is the the great story

00:08:31.489 --> 00:08:31.499
to say that that is the the great story
 

00:08:31.499 --> 00:08:32.719
to say that that is the the great story
of the post-war

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:32.729
of the post-war
 

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:37.600
of the post-war
era and this is a problem that you have

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:37.610
era and this is a problem that you have
 

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:43.069
era and this is a problem that you have
in historical structuring and I

00:08:43.069 --> 00:08:43.079
in historical structuring and I
 

00:08:43.079 --> 00:08:45.220
in historical structuring and I
mentioned this in part because when you

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:45.230
mentioned this in part because when you
 

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:50.230
mentioned this in part because when you
embark on the final examination the

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240
embark on the final examination the
 

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.790
embark on the final examination the
first you to write the first 200 words

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800
first you to write the first 200 words
 

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.490
first you to write the first 200 words
of a final chapter which will be post

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:55.500
of a final chapter which will be post
 

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:02.240
of a final chapter which will be post
1991 those 200 words can be and need

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:02.250
1991 those 200 words can be and need
 

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.519
1991 those 200 words can be and need
maybe should be a kind of philosophical

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:04.529
maybe should be a kind of philosophical
 

00:09:04.529 --> 00:09:08.840
maybe should be a kind of philosophical
run-up to the year 1991 in which you can

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:08.850
run-up to the year 1991 in which you can
 

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.210
run-up to the year 1991 in which you can
say well this is the end of something

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:11.220
say well this is the end of something
 

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.850
say well this is the end of something
but you can also say that actually new

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:13.860
but you can also say that actually new
 

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.699
but you can also say that actually new
things began before that and are now I'm

00:09:16.699 --> 00:09:16.709
things began before that and are now I'm
 

00:09:16.709 --> 00:09:19.250
things began before that and are now I'm
now going to highlight those things that

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:19.260
now going to highlight those things that
 

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.150
now going to highlight those things that
are continuing the year 1991 happens to

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160
are continuing the year 1991 happens to
 

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.370
are continuing the year 1991 happens to
be the year that the authors of the

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:25.380
be the year that the authors of the
 

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.220
be the year that the authors of the
earth and its people chose as a dividing

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:28.230
earth and its people chose as a dividing
 

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.480
earth and its people chose as a dividing
point but it's not a necessary turning

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:32.490
point but it's not a necessary turning
 

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.329
point but it's not a necessary turning
point and indeed we had a huge argument

00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339
point and indeed we had a huge argument
 

00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:36.889
point and indeed we had a huge argument
among the authors about whether there

00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:36.899
among the authors about whether there
 

00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:40.449
among the authors about whether there
was any date prior to 1991 and

00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:40.459
was any date prior to 1991 and
 

00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:44.540
was any date prior to 1991 and
subsequent to 1945 that seemed to be a

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:44.550
subsequent to 1945 that seemed to be a
 

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:50.600
subsequent to 1945 that seemed to be a
watershed year and of course one of the

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:50.610
watershed year and of course one of the
 

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.670
watershed year and of course one of the
problems of 1991 is going to be 2001

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:54.680
problems of 1991 is going to be 2001
 

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.870
problems of 1991 is going to be 2001
which is fear of 9/11 and and the

00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880
which is fear of 9/11 and and the
 

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.309
which is fear of 9/11 and and the
question of whether that is a watershed

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:01.319
question of whether that is a watershed
 

00:10:01.319 --> 00:10:08.269
question of whether that is a watershed
year so anyway these are our

00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279
year so anyway these are our
 

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:11.210
year so anyway these are our
constructions so the Cold War is in many

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:11.220
constructions so the Cold War is in many
 

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:16.009
constructions so the Cold War is in many
ways a kind of of construct certainly

00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:16.019
ways a kind of of construct certainly
 

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:23.230
ways a kind of of construct certainly
had enormous political and intellectual

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:23.240
 
 

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.379
 
force behind it as it turned out it did

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:27.389
force behind it as it turned out it did
 

00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:30.980
force behind it as it turned out it did
not lead to a nuclear war and the wars

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:30.990
not lead to a nuclear war and the wars
 

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.160
not lead to a nuclear war and the wars

Cold War never reached the scale that

00:10:39.259 --> 00:10:39.269
Cold War never reached the scale that
 

00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:42.530
Cold War never reached the scale that
had been anticipated you know in the

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:42.540
had been anticipated you know in the
 

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.530
had been anticipated you know in the
late 1940s

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:46.540
 
 

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.860
 
it reminds me in a way of one of the

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:50.870
it reminds me in a way of one of the
 

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:58.420
it reminds me in a way of one of the
great structural concepts of the 19th

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:58.430
great structural concepts of the 19th
 

00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.869

nuclear war between Iran and Israel that
 

00:34:18.119 --> 00:34:22.339
nuclear war between Iran and Israel that
is of course the most pressing issue in

is inevitable that Iran will initiate a

is inevitable that Iran will initiate a

nuclear war against Israel and therefore

it is essential that those pre-emptive

it is essential that those pre-emptive
