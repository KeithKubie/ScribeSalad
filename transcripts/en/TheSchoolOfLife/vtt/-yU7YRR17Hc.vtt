00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.440
It can, at points, seem horrifically clear
that simply no one really cares. They barely

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.150
notice our presence, they hardly stick around
to listen to what we have to say, they catch

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.880
none of our hints – and they are overwhelmingly
preoccupied with their own projects and day-to-day

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.720
concerns. On the basis of such evidence, it
is easy for us to fall into a large, damning

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.160
and dangerously heart-breaking conclusion
about our situation: that we are profoundly

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.600
alone – far beyond any possibility of connection
or empathy. But the truth may be at once more

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.570
mundane and rather more hopeful. Most of us
humans are extremely keen to help when we

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.739
notice an urgent need, but we are also continuously
distracted, grievously taken up with our lives

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.670
and unlikely to spot that there is anything
at all the matter with people around us unless

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:06.210
the problem is spelt out in the clearest,
most unambiguous terms. Then, but only then,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.189
will we swing into action and bring the whole
of our intelligence and will to bear on another’s

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:19.320
pains. In other words, we respond well to
screams, but terribly to hints. The issue

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.619
comes particularly to the fore in tragic cases
where someone we know takes their own life.

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.170
We are certain that we would, if we had known
how desperate they felt, have done pretty

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.259
much anything to help. At the same time, we
also know that we didn’t enquire very much,

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.539
didn’t look too closely for hints and must
surely have given off an impression of constant

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:49.000
busy-ness. We feel, understandably, entirely
wretched and callous. We would be wise to

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.799
rehearse these facts about human nature without
rancour or surprise when we are next at our

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.859
most fragile and desperate. The apparent indifference
of others truly is only apparent. We need

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:07.750
to learn to scream. Sadly, we tend to lack
any confidence to do so precisely when it

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.040
would be most necessary, because a primal
embarrassment takes hold of us around being

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.180
in need, as if it was in the remit of any
human to get through life by their own wits

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.180
alone. Part of the tragedy of being desperate
is how illegitimate our agony feels to us.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.810
Yet we should never allow ourselves to forget
that, whatever the surface indifference of

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.459
others, we are surrounded by people who, when
they see an emergency in front of them, will

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.909
jump into icy rivers to rescue total strangers.
If we know unambiguously that someone (even

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:49.769
a casual acquaintance) needs us a lot right
now, we will probably drop everything and

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.530
run to assist. But at the same time, we are
hopeless at reading minds or taking hints.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.240
The next time we are in trouble, we must remember
not to hate ourselves for requiring help and

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.470
should call out, hopeful in the knowledge
that most people around us will respond to

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.440
our pain once it reaches their ears. We need
to remember to scream a little louder – and

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.240
hate ourselves a little less.
