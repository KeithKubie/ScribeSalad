00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So one of the areas where this kind of ordering process takes place in social network analysis

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is in measuring the centrality of different nodes.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We talked a little bit about centrality in the previous unit,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but let me talk a little bit about some different types of centrality that you might find useful.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
One that we're going to return to,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and we've already kind of touch on is this node of closeness centrality.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The idea that a given node is central if it has short path to other nodes in the network.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Between this centrality has to do with the idea that a node is central

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
if most of the shortest path between arbitrarily chosen pairs of nodes in the network

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
end up having to pass through the node in question.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's between most to the other nodes. It's kind of stuck between them.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Node centrality is actually a much simpler concept,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
which says that the node is central if it has lots of edges

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If it's very well connected, and this is well connected in a very local sense

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
just in terms of the degree of the node or the number of neighbors that it has.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Let's look at this one first and then we're going to combine

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
what we learned with other kinds of path base metrics next.
