Thanks Kai/g. Let's do an exercise where we match the methods with their

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.090
classes. Don't worry if you're not sure how to do this yet. I haven't actually

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.145
given you enough information, just go with your gut. Here's the first one.

00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:14.710
BirthDay.getmonth. Here, the method is getmonth. "Hello world!".length, here

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.829
length is the method. Anniversary.addDays, here the method is addDays. And

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:27.910
lolcatsPic.draw, here the method is draw. Enter the letter for the class, in

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.830
the box next to the method call.
