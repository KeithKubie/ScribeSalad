00:00:00.346 --> 00:00:02.233
Voiceover:We have an infinite series here,

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:03.566
and the first thing I'd like you to try

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:06.700
is to pause this video and
see if you can express this

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.233
as an infinite geometric series,

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:11.966
and if you can express it as
an infinite geometric series,

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:15.833
see what its sum would be given
an interval of convergence.

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:18.700
Figure out over what
interval of xs would your

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.167
infinite geometric series converge

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:22.333
and what would that sum actually be.

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:24.433
I'm assuming you've given a go at it,

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:26.533
so let's try to work
through this together.

00:00:27.023 --> 00:00:28.434
The first thing I want to do is

00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:30.100
let me just factor out a common factor.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.566
This might simplify it in
terms of trying to express it.

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.035
Let's see.

00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:34.366
If I factor out, it
looks like all of these

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.767
are divisible by three x squared.

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:41.812
I can rewrite this as
three x squared times

00:00:42.627 --> 00:00:50.467
one minus x to the third
power plus x to sixth power

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.100
minus x to the ninth power,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.466
and a pattern is starting to emerge.

00:00:59.832 --> 00:01:02.566
Let me actually close the
brackets with the same color,

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.133
with that pink right over there.

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:04.703
Let's see.

00:01:04.703 --> 00:01:09.100
This looks like we are taking
powers of x to the third,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.166
so let me write it that way.

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:14.035
This is the same thing
as three x squared times,

00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:16.647
we could write this first term,

00:01:16.647 --> 00:01:18.300
or I guess I could say the zeroth term.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.833
This is x to the third to the zeroth power

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:27.500
then minus, this is x to the
third to the first power,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.766
and then plus this is x to
the third to the second power,

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.192
and then I think you see what's going on.

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:35.679
This is x to the third to the third power,

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.300
and of course, we can keep going.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.500
But now we have to worry about

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.167
the switching of signs
that we keep having.

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.900
This would be negative one.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.500
This is positive, which is the same thing

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.500
as negative one in the zero power.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.017
This is negative, which is
negative one to the first power,

00:01:49.017 --> 00:01:50.500
so let's actually write it this way.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.468
We can write it as three x squared times

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:58.833
this first term we could
write as negative one,

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:01.966
or we could just write as
negative x to the third

00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:04.179
to the zeroth power,

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.833
and then you're going to say plus.

00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:08.957
With plus, we could say
negative x to the third

00:02:08.957 --> 00:02:10.633
to the first power.

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:13.033
Negative one to the first
power is negative one.

00:02:13.371 --> 00:02:15.866
x to the third to the first
power is x to the third

00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:20.433
plus negative x to the
third to the second power

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:24.966
plus negative x to the
third to the third power.

00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:26.766
That's this term right over here.

00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:28.500
Negative one to the third
power is negative one,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.233
and of course, x to the third
to the third is x to the ninth

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:32.667
and it keeps going.

00:02:32.702 --> 00:02:36.567
This makes it a lot clearer
what our common ratio is.

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:42.134
Our common ratio here is
negative x to the third.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.433
Over what interval would this converge?

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:47.567
It's going to converge if our common,

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:50.300
if the absolute value of our common ratio

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.833
is less than one.

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:55.133
We are going to converge

00:02:57.433 --> 00:03:01.500
if the absolute value of our common ratio,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.766
the absolute value of our common ratio,

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:08.567
which is negative x to the
third is less than one.

00:03:08.567 --> 00:03:11.033
Or another way of saying
this is the same thing,

00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:13.700
the absolute value of a
negative is going to be

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.766
the same thing as the
absolute value of a positive,

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:17.633
so that's the same way of
saying the absolute value

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:20.568
of x to the third is less than one,

00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:23.499
or saying that x to the
third is less than one

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:27.166
and is greater than negative one.

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:28.500
The way that's going to happen,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.100
if you take the cube roots
of both sides of this,

00:03:32.653 --> 00:03:34.369
or all the sides of this inequality,

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:36.833
you're going to get that
x is going to be between

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:38.167
negative one and one.

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:41.500
This right over here is our
interval of convergence,

00:03:41.715 --> 00:03:45.800
interval of convergence.

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:49.433
If we restrict our xs to that,

00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:51.100
what is this going to sum to?

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.568
This infinite geometric
series, our common ratio,

00:03:53.568 --> 00:03:56.033
its absolute value is less than one,

00:03:56.033 --> 00:03:58.500
and so this is going to sum to,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.100
this is going to be
equal to our first term,

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.967
I guess we could say,

00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:04.679
or the thing that's multiplying
them by this whole thing,

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:05.561
but if you multiply it out,

00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:07.166
this would be our first term.

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:09.700
It's going to be three x squared,

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.833
all of that over one
minus our common ratio,

00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:16.366
so one minus negative x to the third,

00:04:16.366 --> 00:04:19.733
that's just going to be
one plus x to the third.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.100
Everything we've done so far

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.433
is we've shown that this,

00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:26.367
let me actually write it this way,

00:04:26.367 --> 00:04:29.301
that this thing is equal to this thing

00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:32.200
over the interval of convergence.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.966
Let me write, copy and paste
it, so write like that,

00:04:36.966 --> 00:04:39.433
over the interval of convergence.

00:04:39.433 --> 00:04:41.366
If x is between negative one and one,

00:04:41.366 --> 00:04:43.400
these two things are the same.

00:04:43.633 --> 00:04:46.567
Now, we can start to put
our calculus hat on here

00:04:46.567 --> 00:04:48.433
because this looks interesting.

00:04:48.433 --> 00:04:50.366
This, you might remember,

00:04:50.366 --> 00:04:52.633
this looks like the derivative
of something that's familiar.

00:04:52.633 --> 00:04:54.674
One plus x to the third,
what's the derivative of that?

00:04:54.674 --> 00:04:56.634
That's three x squared.

00:04:56.972 --> 00:05:01.766
It looks like this right over
here is the derivative of

00:05:01.766 --> 00:05:05.300
the natural log of one plus x to the third

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.100
or the absolute value of
one plus x to the third.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.567
If you don't believe me,

00:05:09.567 --> 00:05:12.502
let's take the
anti-derivative of this thing

00:05:12.502 --> 00:05:13.684
right over here.

00:05:13.684 --> 00:05:15.100
In fact, for fun,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.967
let's take the anti-derivative
of both sides of this,

00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:21.240
and if we do that, then we
will have shown essentially

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.567
a geometric series representation

00:05:25.567 --> 00:05:28.166
of whatever the anti-derivative
of this thing is.

00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:29.966
I encourage you to pause the video again

00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:32.034
and try to take the anti-derivative

00:05:32.034 --> 00:05:33.933
of both sides of this equation.

00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:37.966
We're going to take the anti-derivative

00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:39.433
of the left-hand side,

00:05:39.433 --> 00:05:41.821
and we're going to take
the anti-derivative,

00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:44.800
the anti-derivative of
the right-hand side.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.033
Now on the left-hand side,

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:48.112
I mentioned that it looks like we have

00:05:48.527 --> 00:05:50.100
an expression and its derivative.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.866
That just calls out for u-substitution.

00:05:53.234 --> 00:05:57.333
If we say that u is equal
to one plus x to the third,

00:05:57.566 --> 00:05:58.933
let me write this down,

00:05:59.366 --> 00:06:02.967
u is equal to one plus x to the third,

00:06:02.967 --> 00:06:04.866
then what's du going to be?

00:06:05.366 --> 00:06:11.668
Then du is going to be
equal to three x squared dx.

00:06:11.834 --> 00:06:15.200
Notice, we have u and then du.

00:06:15.568 --> 00:06:19.134
du is this right over here.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.833
This expression right over
here could be rewritten as,

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:25.366
let me go over here,

00:06:25.366 --> 00:06:34.833
this could be rewritten as
the integral of du over u,

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:36.767
or I could say,

00:06:36.767 --> 00:06:37.700
actually, let me write this,

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.887
one over u du,

00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:45.900
which of course is equal to,

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.633
which is going to be
equal to the natural log

00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:52.033
of the absolute value of u,

00:06:52.033 --> 00:06:55.046
the natural log of the absolute value of u

00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:57.669
plus some constant.

00:06:59.566 --> 00:07:02.909
We of course know that u
is one plus x to the third,

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:06.100
so this is going to be
equal to the natural log

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.167
of the absolute value of
one plus x to the third,

00:07:09.167 --> 00:07:12.700
one plus x to the third plus c,

00:07:13.038 --> 00:07:14.366
plus c.

00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:18.034
Now, we're restricting
our domain for x being

00:07:18.034 --> 00:07:19.434
between negative one and one.

00:07:19.434 --> 00:07:24.359
So for that domain, this
thing is always going to be,

00:07:25.298 --> 00:07:28.720
this whole thing actually is
always going to be positive,

00:07:29.643 --> 00:07:31.601
so what we can do,

00:07:33.566 --> 00:07:35.568
we don't have to write
the absolute value sign,

00:07:35.568 --> 00:07:38.267
so this is going to be
equal to the natural log,

00:07:38.302 --> 00:07:39.666
let me write it,

00:07:39.766 --> 00:07:43.501
the natural log of one
plus x to the third,

00:07:43.501 --> 00:07:46.533
one plus x to the third plus c,

00:07:47.042 --> 00:07:48.500
plus c.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.301
That's this left-hand side,

00:07:50.301 --> 00:07:51.966
and the right-hand side is actually

00:07:51.966 --> 00:07:52.900
a lot more straightforward.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.233
This is just a straightforward polynomial.

00:07:55.233 --> 00:07:56.673
Now, as you can imagine,
we're going to get

00:07:56.673 --> 00:07:58.033
some type of constant there,

00:07:58.033 --> 00:07:59.361
so let me differentiate them a little bit.

00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:01.502
Let me call this one c one,

00:08:01.502 --> 00:08:04.567
and then on the right-hand
side, what do we get?

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:08.300
The anti-derivative of
this is going to be,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:08.634
let's see,

00:08:08.634 --> 00:08:11.767
the anti-derivative of x
squared is x to the third

00:08:11.767 --> 00:08:14.000
divided by three.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.566
This first term, the anti-derivative,

00:08:16.566 --> 00:08:19.734
is just going to be x to the third power.

00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:22.566
The derivative of x to the
third is three x squared.

00:08:22.566 --> 00:08:25.368
Now, this term right over here,

00:08:25.368 --> 00:08:27.766
negative three x to the fifth,

00:08:27.766 --> 00:08:29.835
the anti-derivative of x to the fifth

00:08:29.835 --> 00:08:34.968
is x to the sixth over six,

00:08:35.192 --> 00:08:36.833
x to the sixth over six,

00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:38.233
but then we have that three over here.

00:08:38.233 --> 00:08:39.833
Three over six is two,

00:08:39.833 --> 00:08:44.767
so it's negative x to the sixth over two.

00:08:45.013 --> 00:08:46.367
Actually, let me do that
in a different color,

00:08:46.367 --> 00:08:47.933
just so we can keep track of it.

00:08:48.566 --> 00:08:51.100
This one right over here is negative,

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.500
the anti-derivative is negative
x to the sixth over two,

00:08:54.946 --> 00:08:56.033
and then, let's see,

00:08:56.033 --> 00:08:57.302
I'm running out of colors.

00:08:57.302 --> 00:08:59.433
The anti-derivative of x to the eighth

00:08:59.433 --> 00:09:00.900
is x to the ninth over nine,

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.566
so it's going to be plus x to the ninth,

00:09:03.566 --> 00:09:04.966
and then we have this three.

00:09:04.966 --> 00:09:06.866
Three over nine is three.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.800
And I think you see a pattern happening.

00:09:09.967 --> 00:09:13.166
And then let's just do
one more of these for fun.

00:09:13.166 --> 00:09:15.566
x to the 12th over 12,
but we have this three,

00:09:15.566 --> 00:09:20.433
so negative x to the 12th over four,

00:09:20.433 --> 00:09:22.433
and then we keep going,

00:09:22.433 --> 00:09:24.366
and then we're of course going to have,

00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:25.700
we're going to have some constant.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.073
Actually, let me put the
constant in the front.

00:09:28.953 --> 00:09:31.033
Let me copy and paste that,

00:09:31.033 --> 00:09:34.433
or cut and paste that
so I have some space.

00:09:34.433 --> 00:09:39.500
Let me write over here.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.313
I'll put some other constant, c two,

00:09:41.313 --> 00:09:43.166
it doesn't have to be the same one,

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.500
plus all of this.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.567
Now to simplify this,

00:09:45.567 --> 00:09:47.703
I could subtract c one from both sides

00:09:47.703 --> 00:09:49.300
or essentially from c two,

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:54.700
and then I'm going to
have the natural log of

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.035
one plus x to the third power.

00:09:57.035 --> 00:09:58.766
One plus x to the third power,

00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:00.309
this is kind of neat what we've just done,

00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:01.967
with a little bit of integration,

00:10:01.967 --> 00:10:05.308
is equal to c two minus c one.

00:10:05.308 --> 00:10:07.578
This is some constant
minus some other constant,

00:10:07.578 --> 00:10:11.866
so that's just going to be
some arbitrary constant,

00:10:12.566 --> 00:10:14.266
plus all of this business.

00:10:16.901 --> 00:10:20.166
We can even figure out what
the constant is going to be

00:10:20.166 --> 00:10:22.301
by trying out some values of x

00:10:22.301 --> 00:10:25.733
that's in our restricted domain.

00:10:26.013 --> 00:10:28.700
x equals zero is between
negative one and one,

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.566
so let's see what happens
when x is equal to zero

00:10:31.566 --> 00:10:32.800
to solve for c.

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:35.268
If x is equal to zero,

00:10:37.038 --> 00:10:48.050
we get natural log of
one is equal to c plus,

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.900
all of these terms are going to be zero,

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.301
zero to the third power
minus zero to the sixth

00:10:52.301 --> 00:10:53.101
on and on and on,

00:10:53.101 --> 00:10:54.701
plus zero plus zero,

00:10:55.024 --> 00:10:55.766
or another way,

00:10:55.766 --> 00:10:57.233
and natural log of one, of course,

00:10:57.233 --> 00:10:58.166
[either what] power is one,

00:10:58.166 --> 00:10:59.700
well, that's zero,

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.100
so c must be zero.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.700
C is equal to zero.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.102
This thing right over
here is equal to zero.

00:11:05.102 --> 00:11:08.569
What we have just done, using
a little bit of integration,

00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:10.367
is starting with a ...

00:11:10.367 --> 00:11:12.500
let's just appreciate what went on.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.167
Starting with an
arbitrary infinite series,

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:18.167
we showed it could be represented
as a geometric series.

00:11:18.167 --> 00:11:19.634
We defined it into rule of convergence

00:11:19.634 --> 00:11:21.501
over which this would converge,

00:11:21.501 --> 00:11:23.167
over which the common
ratio's absolute value

00:11:23.167 --> 00:11:25.100
is less than one,

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.300
and then using that,

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.100
we expressed its sum,

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.434
and then we took the
anti-derivative of both sides

00:11:30.434 --> 00:11:36.166
to figure out an expansion
for the natural log

00:11:36.166 --> 00:11:41.100
of one plus x to the third power,

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.000
which, at least in my
mind, that was pretty neat.

00:11:46.033 --> 00:11:48.700
Natural log of one plus
x to the third power

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.634
is x to the third power
minus x to the sixth over two

00:11:52.634 --> 00:11:55.433
plus x to the ninth over three,

00:11:55.433 --> 00:11:56.500
so on and on and on.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.500
Actually, just to give
ourselves some closure here,

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.700
let's write it in sigma notation.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:06.039
We could write the natural
log of one plus x to the third

00:12:07.023 --> 00:12:08.633
over our restricted domain,

00:12:08.633 --> 00:12:11.633
where the absolute value
of x is less than one,

00:12:11.633 --> 00:12:19.333
is equal to the sum from, let's say,

00:12:19.986 --> 00:12:24.434
n equals one to infinity

00:12:24.434 --> 00:12:30.700
of x to the third to the nth power,

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.567
so to the first power, the
second power, third power,

00:12:33.567 --> 00:12:34.766
over n.

00:12:34.766 --> 00:12:36.366
This is x to the third over one,

00:12:36.366 --> 00:12:39.100
x to the third squared over two,

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.100
oh, and I of course have
to throw in, let's see,

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.446
this first one is,

00:12:44.446 --> 00:12:46.233
we're going to have to
care about the sign,

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:48.500
so let me throw in a negative one.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:48.835
Let's see.

00:12:48.835 --> 00:12:51.900
Negative one to the first
power should be negative,

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.101
but here, it's positive,

00:12:53.101 --> 00:12:57.033
so I'll say negative
one to the n plus one,

00:12:57.033 --> 00:12:58.900
negative one to the n plus one power.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.833
Does that work?

00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:00.500
I think it does.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.966
When n is equal to one,

00:13:01.966 --> 00:13:04.766
this thing just becomes one.

00:13:04.766 --> 00:13:06.234
This is x to the third over one.

00:13:06.234 --> 00:13:07.802
When n is equal to two,

00:13:07.986 --> 00:13:10.966
this becomes negative,
which it needs to be,

00:13:10.966 --> 00:13:13.500
and then this becomes x to
the sixth, and we're over two,

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.700
and so there you go.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.041
We are done.

00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:18.333
I found that pretty satisfying.
