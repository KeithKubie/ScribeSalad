00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.610
- All right, so I am so
excited because we are here,

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.210
it is Tuesday, May 29th 2018,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.890
and this is Manhattanhenge.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.980
This is Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.130
your personal astrophysicist

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.920
and the man who named

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.018
the event where we are, Manhattanhenge.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.250
- Okay, so I called it
to everyone's attention

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.083
- Okay.

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:21.916
- Of course this has been going on

00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:22.830
since the grid has been up

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.440
but no body has been paying
attention, you know why?

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.273
- Why?

00:00:25.273 --> 00:00:26.106
- First it has to be clear.

00:00:26.106 --> 00:00:26.939
- Okay.

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.070
- But second, you have to
be crossing the street,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.903
- Okay.

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:31.150
- And not concerned about your health

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.321
and well-being while
you're crossing the street.

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:35.240
- As evidenced by the number of people

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.562
who are in the middle of the street!

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:37.395
- [Neil] Right.

00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:38.940
And you have to be on one of the two days

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.040
in which this is going on.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.873
- Right.

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:43.690
- And I knew such a day
would exist. I calculated it.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.540
My first shot of Manhattanhenge

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.090
was on this very
intersection of Park Avenue

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.990
and 34th Street.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.300
The beautiful Empire State Building,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.809
there it is right there, you check it out.

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.170
Empire State Building.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.003
- Yeah baby.

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:54.836
- [Neil] There you go.

00:00:54.836 --> 00:00:56.450
- New York, New York state of mind.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.040
- New York state of mind.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.160
Okay, so then I publish
my first photo of it.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.993
- Okay.

00:01:01.993 --> 00:01:03.268
- And then people started
gathering in the streets

00:01:03.268 --> 00:01:06.550
and I said, "Look,
traffic has been stopped

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.400
for like Con-Ed digging holes."

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.233
- Right.

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:12.950
- For all, for you know
pedestrians getting hit by cars.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.783
- Right.

00:01:13.783 --> 00:01:14.764
- I figured let the traffic stop

00:01:14.764 --> 00:01:17.630
because the people want
to drink in the Cosmos.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.070
- Very nice.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.000
- Yes yes yes.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.030
And what such event is the alignment

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.270
of the sunset on the Manhattan grid.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.430
- Where did you get the
name Manhattanhenge?

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.930
- As a kid I visited Stonehenge
I was very impressed.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:29.763
- [Chuck] Very nice.

00:01:29.763 --> 00:01:31.130
- [Neil] With the fact
that ancient peoples

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.513
made these vertical stone monuments and

00:01:33.513 --> 00:01:36.472
Stonehenge itself is
actually an observatory

00:01:36.472 --> 00:01:38.480
and no one knew that until like

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.970
an astronomer figured that out.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.687
People said, "Oh they're
worshiping the sun,"

00:01:41.687 --> 00:01:44.100
"and they're this and
the druids and whatever."

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.510
This is a frickin observatory
that can predict eclipses.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.640
Okay? Just because they're ancient people

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.954
don't mean they're stupid.

00:01:49.954 --> 00:01:51.380
- Well that is true.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.770
And just because we're modern people

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.450
doesn't mean we're smart.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.283
- Thank you.

00:01:55.283 --> 00:01:56.116
- Yes.

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.090
- Oh, we got a bus coming.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.923
- Oh bus.

00:01:57.923 --> 00:01:58.756
- We in the bus lane.

00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:00.253
- It's like we're playing
football back in the hood.

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:01.900
(laughs)

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.380
- And so now like thousands of people

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.098
pour into the street and stop
traffic for a cosmic reason.

00:02:06.098 --> 00:02:06.970
- Absolutely.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.100
- Yeah yeah I'm totally into that.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.535
- This is your baby, you got to be proud.

00:02:09.535 --> 00:02:11.809
- I'm proud now. So this
happens twice a year.

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:15.670
The same number of days before the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.290
June solstice.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.123
- Right.

00:02:18.123 --> 00:02:20.428
- As after. One of our
challenges is in summertime,

00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:22.944
we get, as is true for
most of the country.

00:02:22.944 --> 00:02:26.899
We get our weather from the
states that sit west of us.

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:30.820
So our weather comes from
New Jersey. From New Jersey.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.653
- Bus.

00:02:31.653 --> 00:02:35.200
- And so if there's like storms
and things over New Jersey--

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.730
If there's storms over New Jersey,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.290
the sun will set behind the storms

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.920
and we get no Manhattanhenge.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.770
So I'm worried about that,

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.130
there's some cloud action over there.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.450
New Jersey might be messing with us again.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.560
Oh, another bus coming.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.540
So you notice how anytime we
dig up old civilizations--

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.373
- Yes.

00:02:49.373 --> 00:02:50.310
- We say, oh they worship the sun

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.711
and this is their sun culture.

00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:53.640
So I'm imagining the day

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.630
where apocalyptic earth,

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.597
and they dig up the grid of Manhattan.

00:02:59.597 --> 00:03:02.580
Okay. And then they try to figure out

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.120
'why was it aligned this way?'

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.300
So if you look at what is
happening in American Culture

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.991
on those two days, okay?

00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:09.760
The first of the Manhattanhenges

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.490
happens around Memorial Day.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.045
The second one, happens--.

00:03:13.045 --> 00:03:17.000
The second one happens near
baseball's All Star Break.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.833
- Oh

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:22.212
So future anthropologists
would surely judge

00:03:22.212 --> 00:03:25.850
that we align Manhattan in honor

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.500
of the two things
America cares most about.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.096
- War, and baseball.

00:03:30.096 --> 00:03:31.950
(laughing)

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.240
It's that simple.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.543
We're America, we love war and baseball.

00:03:35.543 --> 00:03:36.376
- War and baseball.

00:03:36.376 --> 00:03:37.523
So what's going on is,

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.487
people say, oh watch this--

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:42.865
What direction does the sun rise?

00:03:42.865 --> 00:03:46.573
- It sets in the east, so
it must rise in the west.

00:03:46.573 --> 00:03:48.885
- So both of them are wrong.

00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:52.190
The sun rises in the
east and sets in the west

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.270
on only two days a year.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.103
- Okay.

00:03:54.103 --> 00:03:55.377
- And those are on the equinoxes,

00:03:55.377 --> 00:03:57.387
March 21st and September 21st.

00:03:57.387 --> 00:03:58.600
- And why is that?

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.210
- And every other day of the year,

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.940
the sun is rising and
setting somewhere else

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.320
on the horizon, okay?

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.153
- But why is that?

00:04:04.153 --> 00:04:05.854
- I did a little Trump thing here.

00:04:05.854 --> 00:04:07.483
- Somewhere else.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.770
Somewhere fantastic.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.130
- So before today.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.963
- Bus bus.

00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:17.952
- The buses butt is in the way.

00:04:17.952 --> 00:04:20.306
So what happens is the
sun is setting at an angle

00:04:20.306 --> 00:04:23.120
and before today, before today,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.122
it has set south of this aligned street.

00:04:26.122 --> 00:04:28.370
So you would never see the sunset.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.203
- Right?

00:04:29.203 --> 00:04:33.110
- Beginning today, you see the
sun cross this field of view.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.563
And today it's setting on the grid.

00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:36.960
Tomorrow, it's gonna set
a little farther north

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.940
and a little farther north

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.018
and it'll keep doing that until June 21st.

00:04:41.018 --> 00:04:42.327
First day of Summer.

00:04:42.327 --> 00:04:43.330
Lemme finish.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.163
- Okay, go ahead.

00:04:44.163 --> 00:04:46.550
Come to the north and it
sets its farthest point north

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.383
on June 21st.

00:04:47.383 --> 00:04:48.216
- Okay.

00:04:48.216 --> 00:04:49.049
- After that, it starts --

00:04:49.049 --> 00:04:51.110
and the sun slows down, stops,

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.060
that's why it's called solstice.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.893
- Right.

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:55.190
- Latin for stationary sun.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.330
So, after that it starts
setting backwards again.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.730
And it re-appears here and
this would be around July 11th.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.195
- [Chuck] Uh-oh, police.

00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:05.253
They're worse than the bus.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.110
Back up to the sidewalk,
back up to the sidewalk.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.090
By the way, you not supposed
to be in the bus lane, officer!

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.930
Excuse me, officer!

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.750
You not supposed to be in the bus lane!

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.583
Okay.

00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:20.416
- Why didn't you say
that when he was closer?

00:05:20.416 --> 00:05:21.810
- Well you know, 'cause I'm a coward.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.300
- So there you have it, Manhattanhenge.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.650
It looks like we're not getting it.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.937
- We're not gonna get it
because of the clouds.

00:05:25.937 --> 00:05:28.013
- New Jersey took Manhattanhenge from us.

00:05:28.013 --> 00:05:29.809
They put a cloud in the way.

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:31.959
- [Chuck] And that's the
sun right behind that cloud.

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:35.120
- Jersey did it! Curse you, New Jersey!

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.953
- [Chuck] If you look--

00:05:35.953 --> 00:05:37.730
- Chuck lives in New Jersey.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.222
- I do, it's my fault.

00:05:39.222 --> 00:05:41.472
(laughing)
