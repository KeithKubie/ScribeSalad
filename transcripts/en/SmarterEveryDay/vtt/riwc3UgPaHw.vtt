00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.
Something cool happened on the way home from work today

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.010
Venus passed in front of the sun. Well, between us and the sun.

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.020
I guess technically. I had this little camera with me, and I went to the US Space and Rocket

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.060
Centre, and there were people there from all over, and they had their telescopes and all these

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.090
different gadgets and gizmos setup so they could see the sun without burning

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.120
their eyes. It was pretty awesome. And I assume if you're a subscriber to Smarter Every Day you knew

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.150
about this already and you did that too. So if you would, leave me a video response

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.160
to this video and tell me or show me better yet, how you did it, so we have all this

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.180
big compilation of data in one spot. Anyway, so I'll show you what I

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.190
saw, and then after the fact I'll tell you why the transit of Venus is important.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.210
OK so you might laugh at the guy with the welding hood, but he can actually see it better than

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.240
most people here, so it's pretty smart.
See, yep there it is.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.300
Pretty cool.
-You know, even if you stack like six

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.350
pairs of sunglasses on top of each other you can't stare at the sun with that
-yeah

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.370
-Because it's got invisible infrared and ultraviolet light that still goes

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.420
through the glasses.
(Destin) That's pretty awesome, did you build this yourself? Are you with the von Braun

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.450
Astronomical Society? -I am
Pretty awesome man. So why are you not looking

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.500
through your telescope? Why are you letting other people do it? -well

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.550
I can look through it any time right? These guys don't have

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.590
one, so it's nice to share.
(Destin) Oh yeah, but this is the transit of Venus! -It is.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.650
(Destin) The one time you want to use your telescope you're letting other people do it? -That's right.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.710
(Destin) That's awesome man. Way to give back. Give us a bump.
So you aligned with the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.750
sun, the plane that the sun passes across the sky. - Well you're aligning

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.780
the centre of rotation, with the.. you're making

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.820
that parallel to the Earth's centre of rotation.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.860
And then you rotate your base plate up in the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.930
same latitude that we're in, so now this is rotating in one

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.000
axis, just like the earth.
(Destin) That's awesome.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.070
(Destin) This is a pretty good shot of you with the Saturn 5 in the background. Makes you look like some kind of space

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.180
hero. Just letting you know.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.100
So usually you have to pick three

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.150
heavenly bodies right? But this time you only had to do two?

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.190
It's really just the one.
(Destin) It's awesome. Is it OK if I put this up

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.900
here? -Back a little bit.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.920
Oh there we are.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.230
So that's it. Can't really

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.250
see it with this little camera. Oh there it is.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.290
There it is.
But you're having to track it manually

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.340
right? But it's pretty easy because of your mount, right?

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.390
- Well yeah. I'm doing it.. I have another mount I could've, but if anybody kicks it or moves it

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.430
then I've gotta realign it. It'd take 15 minutes of messing around. This way, hey.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.450
It's quick and dirty. The top there is sort of a triangle

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.450
of sun spots or magnetic storms on the sun.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.490
(Destin) Oh that's awesome. They're inspiring the next generation of space explorers.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.560
And of course NASA has to one-up everybody and show up with a trailer that you can see a real

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.570
time display. Solar flares, the whole bit. Just check it out.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.610
Oh glare is killing us. You see that?

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.670
(Destin) Now what are you using here? 
-I am using a parabolic telescope.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.730
-Um. I did this for a project

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.780
on romanticism, where I was focusing on William Herschel who developed

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.820
the first parabolic telescopes, using parabolic mirrors.
(Destin) Wait a second

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.860
you're from Alabama though right? -I am from Alabama.
Well you're supposed to be a stupid redneck

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.890
why are you doing this? 
-Because, I like, I like

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.920
space.
(Destin) You like space? That's awesome. 
(bystander) By the way, he is a stupid redneck.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.990
(Destin) Oh he is a stupid redneck? Just so you know, I do a YouTube show, and

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.060
-I know, I'm subscribed to you.
(Destin)Oh really? - Yes. Nice to meet you Destin. I'm Paul.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.090
Nice to meet you Paul.
-This is a reflecting telescope,

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.120
with a F8 lens, focal length of about 48 inches,

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.150
made out of PVC pipe. I ground the lens myself,

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.190
found the focal length.
(Destin) Wait, what did you grind the lens with, like toothpaste or something?

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.230
-Basically yeah. It's a silicone oxide,

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.240
cerium oxide, all kinds of different stuff.
(Destin) Can I block your lens for a second? -Go ahead.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.260
(Destin) Alright so sunlight's going in, way back down there, I'm getting blind. So just be honest with

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.270
me. Did you do some kind of fist pump or something when you finally focused it? -Oh I was very happy.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.290
-I really did, I fist-pumped.
(Destin) Nice. Nice to meet you man.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.330
-Can you look yet?
-Not really

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.370
-you can try
(Destin) Alright. I saw a guy over there with a piece of PVC

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.410
I think he's doing better than you guys. 
-Yeah I know. -He probably is.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.430
OK so now that we've talked about how to observe the Venus

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.440
transit, who cares? Why is it important? Well it's extremely important. So

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.460
important in fact, in the 1700s Captain Cook left

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.510
Britain, and he went all the way down, through the Atlantic Ocean, around South America

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.540
and all the way over here to this little island, called Tahiti.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.590
Now the point of Tahiti is that it's latitude was different from Britain, so that you could

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.640
make the observation from two separate locations and do some calculations.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.710
Unfortunately today, we don't have data from a different latitude.
-Yeah you do.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.720
Who said that?
-Destin it's me, Derek.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.740
Oh what's up? Where you.. -I'm in your armpit.
Oh, there you are.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.770
Australia, yeah, the armpit of the world. What's up Derek?

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.800
-Hey, that's something coming from a guy who lives in Alabama. [laugh]

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.840
Granted. What's going on? What's up with the shades? -Well

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.860
I'm still checking out the transit of Venus. It's still happening down here. I want to

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.880
talk about parallax, and how we can use different latitudes to

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.900
figure out the distance to the sun.
(Destin) Fantastic, so

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.920
go ahead, you gonna explain it here?
-No no, it's too much for this channel.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.940
-But uh, if you click on my face, I'll take you to the good stuff.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.960
Oh man, this just got awesome. It's like back in Captain Cook's day only we don't have

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.000
to send a guy years earlier to get somewhere to make the observation,

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.020
because he's already there via the internet.
-On the beard.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.040
So go click Derek's face, and we'll learn a little bit about what these observations are for.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.350
-On the beard, that's the best part.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.090
[laugh]

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.110
-Alright let's do it. Follow me.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.940
Go on! Click his face!

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.370
Yeah Yeah. Click here.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.722
On the beard.
