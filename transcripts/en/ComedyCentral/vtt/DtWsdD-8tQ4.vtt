00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.636
No matter what, you stick with
your race. I don't know why I
can't

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.476
have a Mexican friend.. He's in
my cell, I don't know what the

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.640
fuck is going on, but Mexicans
got on boots and I gotta figure

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.360
out what I'm supposed to do now.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.761
Thank you, everybody.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:02.796
On this show, here's what
happens, it's just a bunch of

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.967
comics telling true stories and
thatís all it is. Tonight it's

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.302
all about fights. Please give it
up for Ali Siddiq, everybody.

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:11.238
Let him hear it.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:15.209
My story is about prison,
danger.

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:20.480
Seen it all, looks so menacing,
you know? And I'm black so we

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:26.486
know it's going to be about
crime. Let me tell you, prison

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.126
is an odd place because you do
not know the rules. No matter

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.898
how many prison movies you
watched and documentaries of

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:41.535
Locked Up, you still don't know
the rules of what's gonna

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:46.640
happen. So I'm on my
way to what they called

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.543
"necessities". Necessities is
where, you know, your clothes,

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:54.014
your get your laundry and all
that bullshit. So I'm walking to

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:59.119
Necessities and a dude just
walks by and say, "Mexicans got

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:06.527
on boots." I'm like, "What the
fuck does that mean?" 'Cause

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.830
it's like I've been in prison
like the first day, whatchu

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:11.832
mean, "Mexicans got on boots?"
Everybody got on fucking boots,

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:18.472
so I thought. Dude walk past,
"Mexicans got on boots, Mexicans

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:21.975
got on boots." So I tell
somebody else, "Mexicans got on

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:26.380
boots." Dude looks down,
"Mexicans do got on boots" and

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:36.089
just takes off running.
I'm like, "Was I supposed to run

00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:40.394
'cause the Mexicans have on
boots?" So I asked the old dude,

00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:47.100
I said, "Hey, Mexicans got on
boots." He's saying, "Alright,

00:02:47.134 --> 00:02:50.871
they got on boots." I said,
"What that mean?" He said, "it's

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:57.811
gonna be a riot." I said, "You
pretty calm about a riot." I

00:02:57.845 --> 00:03:00.781
said, "How you know Mexicans got
on boots mean it's gonna have a

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:04.518
riot." He said, "Because
Mexicans don't wear boots on the

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:06.887
wreck yard." I said, "Oh, okay,
what they wear on the wreck

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.424
yard?" He said, "Sneakers, they
play handball all the time." And

00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:15.062
then you look and you see
Mexicans over there playing

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:23.103
handball, but they got on boots.
So I'm like, 'cause it

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:26.406
still don't comprehend. So get
back to my cell I was like,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.478
"Hey," to my celly, I said, "You
Mexican. What Mexicans got on

00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:35.082
boots mean?" He said, "It means
we gonna riot, we gonna stab a

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:44.591
couple of black guys up."
And I asked.. When

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:47.995
you're in prison, you asked
dumbass questions, I'm like,

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:55.903
"Does the riot happen in here?
Like in this cell? 'Cause me and

00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:58.705
you just finished eating
together, what're you mad at me

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.276
about? I don't know. But when
you learn that you stick with

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:06.046
your race in prison, no matter
what, you stick with your race.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.815
I don't know why I can't have a
Mexican friend.. He's in my

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.718
cell, I don't know what the fuck
is going on, but Mexicans got on

00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:20.827
boots and I gotta figure out
what I'm supposed to do now.

00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:24.364
And I still don't know,
I gotta still ask people. Find a

00:04:24.398 --> 00:04:29.369
black dude, I'm like, "Yo, so
what I do now that Mexicans got

00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:34.908
on boots?" He said, "You gotta
find you a knife." I said, "I

00:04:34.942 --> 00:04:38.545
gotta find a knife? You can't
have no knife in prison." He

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:42.082
said, "You just got here, huh?"
I said, "Yeah, I just got here."

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:45.619
He said, "Man, you gonna need to
find a dude named Cece and get

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:50.724
you a knife." It's 3,000 people
on this unit. How the fuck I'm

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:55.929
supposed to find Cece? I don't
know. So I'm just

00:04:55.963 --> 00:05:03.704
walking around, "Mexicans got on
boots, Cece. Mexicans got on

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:13.380
boots, Cece." Dude say, "Hey,
you looking for Cece?" I said,

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:17.351
"Yeah." "You must need a knife."
I said, "Yeah." He said, "Why

00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:21.421
you need a knife?" I said, "You
ain't heard?" He said, "Nah, I

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:23.257
ain't heard shit I've been at
work all day." "Mexicans got on

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:34.701
boots." He take off running.
I take off running

00:05:34.735 --> 00:05:41.275
after him only because he never
told me where Cece was. I catch

00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:44.678
him, he said, "Man, go on the
wreck yard, Cece gonna be on the

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:46.647
wreck yard." I'm like, "I don't
want to go on the wreck yard, I

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.883
just left the wreck yard, it's
how I found out Mexicans had on

00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:58.325
boots." So I'm sitting on the
wreck yard looking around for

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:02.729
somebody who may look like a
dude named Cece. So I'm

00:06:02.763 --> 00:06:04.932
asking, I'm looking, I'm
waiting, I'm saying, "Somebody

00:06:05.032 --> 00:06:10.437
going to speak to Cece, got to."
Dude walk by, "What up, Cece?" I

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.540
said, "Thatís who I'm looking
forward right there." I see

00:06:13.574 --> 00:06:20.447
Cece, I nod, he nods back. I
say, "Can I come over there?" He

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.184
said, "Come on, young blood." I
get over there, I said, "Hey

00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:27.054
Cece, Mexicans got on boots." He
said, "I heard." I say, "I need

00:06:27.054 --> 00:06:32.392
a knife." He said, "Well, come
to my cell in a couple of

00:06:32.426 --> 00:06:37.397
minutes, I'll hook you up."
I get to the cell. I

00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:39.600
say, "Cece I need a knife." He
said.. which shit turned

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:44.438
different. He said, "What type
of knife?" I don't know I just

00:06:44.471 --> 00:06:48.775
fucking got here. He said, "What
type of knife you looking for?"

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:51.345
I said, "Something sharp,
something to poke a motherfucker

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:55.782
with. I don't know." So he put
up a towel and said, "Hold on,

00:06:55.816 --> 00:06:59.686
let me show you some knives."
He put up a towel, went

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.422
under his mattress, took some
shit out, slipped some shit

00:07:02.456 --> 00:07:06.159
back, and now it's eight knives
in front of me. It's like I'm in

00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:07.728
fucking Macy's. I'm like, "Yo."
Like, "You know, what kind of

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:15.669
knife you want?" I said, "Well,
you know, what kind of knife I

00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:17.704
need for a riot? I ain't never
been in a riot before." He said,

00:07:17.738 --> 00:07:25.112
"Well you gonna need something
you can stick multiple people

00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:27.514
and it break off." I said, "Is
that right here on the thing?"

00:07:27.548 --> 00:07:29.883
He said, "No, these are personal
knives. Whatchu want your knife

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:34.655
made out of?" I said, "There's
too many fucking choices, man. I

00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:37.424
just need a knife to protect
myself." He said, "Well, god

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:42.362
damn it, listen to me, man. Do
you want it made out of wood,

00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:48.302
plastic, metal, or what?" I say,
"Cece, listen to me, I don't

00:07:48.335 --> 00:07:51.271
know because I've never been in
a riot before. What's going to

00:07:51.305 --> 00:08:00.013
protect me?" He said,
"Fuck! New ass motherfucker."

00:08:00.047 --> 00:08:05.519
Like it's wrong to be just
getting to prison, I don't want

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:09.223
to be here from the beginning,
so calling me "new" don't mean

00:08:09.256 --> 00:08:16.930
shit to me. So I said, "So, man,
what would you suggest?" He

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:24.171
said, "I suggest something
personal, like a pin top." Pin

00:08:24.204 --> 00:08:26.840
top? I don't want a fucking pin
top knife. I want a real knife.

00:08:26.874 --> 00:08:29.343
Something I can just get in
there with. He said, "No, what

00:08:29.376 --> 00:08:34.281
you get with a pin top is a
knife with a pin, but you push a

00:08:34.314 --> 00:08:38.318
nail through it and then you put
the top on it and just have it

00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:39.887
in your pocket so we could walk
around with it." I

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:46.059
said, "That sounds pretty cool.
Would that sustain with a riot?"

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:49.763
He said, "No, that ain't riot
knives, that's just personal

00:08:49.796 --> 00:08:51.398
walk around." I said,
"Motherfucker, I need a knife

00:08:51.431 --> 00:09:02.042
for the riot 'cause Mexicans got
on boots." I said, "Man, how

00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:04.912
much is a personal knife going
to cost me?" "Two bags of

00:09:05.012 --> 00:09:09.917
coffee, come back a little later
on in the day." I said, "What if

00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:12.619
the riot jumps off before I get
the knife?" He said, "That ainít

00:09:12.653 --> 00:09:17.157
my business, that's on you." I
said, "Cool, Cece." So

00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:22.362
I wait three or four hours and I
knew he was working on my knife

00:09:22.396 --> 00:09:24.665
because I was down the cell and
I heard [inaudible] on the

00:09:24.698 --> 00:09:27.501
ground. I said, "Yeah my knife
gonna be sharper than a

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:33.173
motherfucker." Cause I'm hearing
it, I'm hearing it. I'm like,

00:09:33.207 --> 00:09:36.376
"Yeah, I can't wait." And I'm
practicing in my cell how I'm

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:42.182
gonna use my knife.. practicing
my shit. So then this

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:44.751
dude named Mitch say, "Hey, you
getting your knife?" I say,

00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:48.789
"Yeah, Cece working on my
knife." He said, "What kind of

00:09:48.822 --> 00:09:51.525
knife you get?" I said, "What
the fuck is all the knife

00:09:51.558 --> 00:09:57.431
questions?" I said, "I got me a
nice, little knife, it's long. I

00:09:57.464 --> 00:10:02.736
can hit two, three people." He
said, "Man, you need more than

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:06.840
that." I said, "What I need
now?" He said, "You need to know

00:10:06.874 --> 00:10:08.642
about how to fight in the riot."
I said, "How you fight in the

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:11.144
riot?" He said, "Mexicans got on
boots, this is the reason why

00:10:11.178 --> 00:10:15.115
they have on boots. So they can
kick you in this fucking shin

00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:17.518
while you're fighting. Boots are
made out of metal; it's a metal

00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:21.922
tip boot. So you got to do
this.." This is Mitch

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:25.292
this is in my cell teaching me
how to be in a riot. "Look,

00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:29.630
first of all, when you get out
there, stay close to the wall

00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:31.832
'cause motherfuckers gonna be
trying to stab you." I said,

00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:37.104
"Thatís pretty much what a riot
is." So he's like.. I got that

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:43.544
part off the top, that's why I'm
getting the knife. Okay. So he

00:10:43.577 --> 00:10:46.513
say, "Youíre going to have to do
a rock and lean." I said, "What

00:10:46.547 --> 00:10:48.982
the fuck is a rock and lean?"
"Mexicans gonna come out there,

00:10:49.016 --> 00:10:50.984
they're going to have their
knives, you're going to have to

00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:54.354
have your shirt off with your
knife and when you do this

00:10:54.388 --> 00:10:56.590
you're going to have to rock to
see what foot the Mexican is

00:10:56.623 --> 00:11:00.194
gonna kick you with." I said,
"This is too much, this is too

00:11:00.227 --> 00:11:03.530
much." It's like a fucked
choreographed dance; I don't

00:11:03.564 --> 00:11:05.966
know what the fuck he's doing.
So I'm waiting to get

00:11:06.066 --> 00:11:09.703
my knife, I'm in there fake
rocking, trying to see what foot

00:11:09.736 --> 00:11:11.438
gonna come up. How they do that
when you ain't even in the

00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:16.476
fucking riot yet, I don't know,
but I'm out there practicing. I

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:21.782
go back to Cece, I say, "Yo,
Cece, I gotta go to the wreck

00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:25.552
yard, shit look like it's gonna
get live, I need my knife." He

00:11:25.586 --> 00:11:32.092
said, "Man, I just sold your
knife." I said, "Man, what the

00:11:32.092 --> 00:11:35.863
fuck, Cece? You said it was a
personal knife for me; it cost

00:11:35.896 --> 00:11:38.866
two bags of coffee. Why it's not
fucking personal no more?" He

00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:42.936
said, "Man, it was personal.
Then the dude came in with three

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:46.807
bags of coffee and he made it
business." I said, "So you sold

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.211
my knife?" He said, "Yeah, sold
your knife." I said,

00:11:51.245 --> 00:11:57.351
"The riot about to jump off."
"Hey, man, do what you can do."

00:11:57.384 --> 00:12:01.622
So, moral of the story how it
end up, I fucking get cut cause

00:12:01.655 --> 00:12:09.329
I ain't had a fucking knife and
I forgot the rock. I'm out there

00:12:09.363 --> 00:12:11.498
rocking with no knife. I've been
practicing this shit for two

00:12:11.532 --> 00:12:16.870
hours. Rock. I'm not getting
kicked, but I'm getting cut. I

00:12:16.904 --> 00:12:20.507
got cut down my side from a
Mexican who didn't even have on

00:12:20.541 --> 00:12:22.543
boots.
