situations so these viruses can infect

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600
situations so these viruses can infect
 

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.440
situations so these viruses can infect
humans infected whales secrete more than

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:01.450
humans infected whales secrete more than
 

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.360
humans infected whales secrete more than
10 to the 13th Calissa viruses a day

10 to the 13th Calissa viruses a day
 

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:09.030
10 to the 13th Calissa viruses a day
okay each whale every day is secreting

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040
okay each whale every day is secreting
 

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.100
okay each whale every day is secreting
this into the ocean so this is adding to

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.110
this into the ocean so this is adding to
 

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.110
this into the ocean so this is adding to
the biomass of viruses in the ocean it's

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120
the biomass of viruses in the ocean it's
 

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.940
the biomass of viruses in the ocean it's
a huge number so one of the things I

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:14.950
a huge number so one of the things I
 

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.090
a huge number so one of the things I
want you to get from all

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:16.100
want you to get from all
 

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.610
want you to get from all
this is that when we talk about viruses

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:18.620
this is that when we talk about viruses
 

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.980
this is that when we talk about viruses
the numbers are astronomical they're

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:20.990
the numbers are astronomical they're
 

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.689
the numbers are astronomical they're
bigger than anything else that we know

00:12:22.689 --> 00:12:22.699
bigger than anything else that we know
 

00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:24.970
bigger than anything else that we know
about on earth and in the course of this

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:24.980
about on earth and in the course of this
 

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.400
about on earth and in the course of this
course we will try and understand why

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:27.410
course we will try and understand why
 

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.309
course we will try and understand why
viruses produce such large numbers of

00:12:30.309 --> 00:12:30.319
viruses produce such large numbers of
 

00:12:30.319 --> 00:12:34.809
viruses produce such large numbers of

genomes on the planet right now it's
 

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.490
genomes on the planet right now it's
another big number and this is of course

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:39.500
another big number and this is of course
 

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.990
another big number and this is of course
because millions and millions of people

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000
because millions and millions of people
 

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.230
because millions and millions of people
are infected and each infected person

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240
are infected and each infected person
 

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.559
are infected and each infected person
makes a huge number of particles every

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:47.569
makes a huge number of particles every
 

00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:51.430
makes a huge number of particles every
day with this number of genomes it's

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440
day with this number of genomes it's
 

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.860
day with this number of genomes it's
possible that there are already genomes

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:53.870

drugs we have we have over 20 of them or

00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959
drugs we have we have over 20 of them or
 

00:12:59.959 --> 00:13:01.480
drugs we have we have over 20 of them or
that we'll ever discover if we keep

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:01.490
that we'll ever discover if we keep
 

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.189
that we'll ever discover if we keep
making drugs for years and years and

00:13:03.189 --> 00:13:03.199
making drugs for years and years and
 

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.559
making drugs for years and years and
years somewhere out there there's

00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:05.569
years somewhere out there there's
 

00:13:05.569 --> 00:13:08.379
years somewhere out there there's
already a resistant virus and this is

00:13:08.379 --> 00:13:08.389
already a resistant virus and this is
 

00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:10.110
already a resistant virus and this is
one of the reasons why we have to use

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.120
one of the reasons why we have to use
 

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.699
one of the reasons why we have to use
combination drug therapy to treat a

combination drug therapy to treat a
 

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:14.740
combination drug therapy to treat a
virus like HIV and we'll talk about this

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:14.750
virus like HIV and we'll talk about this
 

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:19.769
virus like HIV and we'll talk about this
in some detail despite all of this

00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:19.779
in some detail despite all of this
 

00:13:19.779 --> 00:13:22.809
in some detail despite all of this
despite the viruses on the doorknob and

00:13:22.809 --> 00:13:22.819
despite the viruses on the doorknob and
 

00:13:22.819 --> 00:13:24.999
despite the viruses on the doorknob and
floating around in this room we're

00:13:24.999 --> 00:13:25.009
floating around in this room we're
 

00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:27.699
floating around in this room we're
pretty healthy most of the time and

00:13:27.699 --> 00:13:27.709
pretty healthy most of the time and
 

00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:29.740
pretty healthy most of the time and
that's because we have a great defense

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:29.750
that's because we have a great defense
 

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.470
that's because we have a great defense
system that has evolved along with

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480
system that has evolved along with
 

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.350
system that has evolved along with
viruses to fight infections viruses has

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360
viruses to fight infections viruses has
 

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.970
viruses to fight infections viruses has
have been with us since the beginning of

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:36.980
have been with us since the beginning of
 

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.249
have been with us since the beginning of
life maybe even before some people

00:13:39.249 --> 00:13:39.259
life maybe even before some people
 

00:13:39.259 --> 00:13:41.769
life maybe even before some people
believe and so life has evolved along

00:13:41.769 --> 00:13:41.779
believe and so life has evolved along
 

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:43.749
believe and so life has evolved along
with viruses infecting them so they have

00:13:43.749 --> 00:13:43.759
with viruses infecting them so they have
 

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:45.730
with viruses infecting them so they have
in order to survive they have to evolve

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:45.740
in order to survive they have to evolve
 

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.470
in order to survive they have to evolve
defense mechanisms so we have great

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:47.480
defense mechanisms so we have great
 

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.960
defense mechanisms so we have great
immune systems that keep us healthy most

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:49.970
immune systems that keep us healthy most
 

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.530
immune systems that keep us healthy most
of the time but if our immune system is

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:53.540
of the time but if our immune system is
 

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.860
of the time but if our immune system is
down if it's defective or suppressed so

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:56.870
down if it's defective or suppressed so
 

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.689
down if it's defective or suppressed so
if you get an organ transplant and you

00:13:58.689 --> 00:13:58.699
if you get an organ transplant and you
 

00:13:58.699 --> 00:14:02.949
if you get an organ transplant and you
receive drugs to immunosuppressed you so

00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959
receive drugs to immunosuppressed you so
 

00:14:02.959 --> 00:14:05.410
receive drugs to immunosuppressed you so
you won't reject the transplant your

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:05.420
you won't reject the transplant your
 

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.540
you won't reject the transplant your
immune system is dampened or if you have

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:07.550
immune system is dampened or if you have
 

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.069
immune system is dampened or if you have
AIDS in which case you're also

00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079
AIDS in which case you're also
 

00:14:09.079 --> 00:14:10.660
AIDS in which case you're also
immunosuppressed because the virus is

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:10.670
immunosuppressed because the virus is
 

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.460
immunosuppressed because the virus is
killing the cells of your immune system

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:12.470
killing the cells of your immune system
 

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:15.429
killing the cells of your immune system
then you have problems with common virus

00:14:15.429 --> 00:14:15.439
then you have problems with common virus
 

00:14:15.439 --> 00:14:17.530
then you have problems with common virus
infections that in bacterial and fungal

hominids before that and it's an
interesting question why do we have

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:02.840
interesting question why do we have
 

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.260
interesting question why do we have
eight percent of our genome as

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:05.270
eight percent of our genome as
 

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.360
eight percent of our genome as
retroviral sequences maybe they are

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:07.370
retroviral sequences maybe they are
 

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.130
retroviral sequences maybe they are
doing something for us that we don't

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:09.140
doing something for us that we don't
 

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.490
doing something for us that we don't
know about so we'll talk about that as

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:12.500
know about so we'll talk about that as
 

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.500
know about so we'll talk about that as
well in another lecture what are the

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:14.510
well in another lecture what are the
 

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.330
well in another lecture what are the
genomes doing there do they help us at

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:16.340
genomes doing there do they help us at
 

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:16.690
genomes doing there do they help us at
all

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:16.700
all
 

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.210
all
you're also a reservoir for viruses that

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:19.220
you're also a reservoir for viruses that
 

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.010
you're also a reservoir for viruses that
have set up residents and your longings

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:21.020
have set up residents and your longings
 

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.170
have set up residents and your longings
in your GI tract your lungs and GI tract

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:23.180
in your GI tract your lungs and GI tract
 

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.150
in your GI tract your lungs and GI tract
are constantly sampling the environment

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.160
are constantly sampling the environment
 

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.040
are constantly sampling the environment
so you have lots of viruses in them a

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:27.050
so you have lots of viruses in them a
 

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:29.110
so you have lots of viruses in them a
few other places as well we're all

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120
few other places as well we're all
 

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.630
few other places as well we're all
colonized by adenoviruses coronaviruses

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:31.640
colonized by adenoviruses coronaviruses
 

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.670
colonized by adenoviruses coronaviruses
rhinoviruses these are common viruses

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680
rhinoviruses these are common viruses
 

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.880
rhinoviruses these are common viruses
that cause respiratory infections as you

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:36.890
that cause respiratory infections as you
 

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.830
that cause respiratory infections as you
know we actually have more bacteria in

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:38.840
know we actually have more bacteria in
 

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.460
know we actually have more bacteria in
us than human cells and a main place

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:42.470
us than human cells and a main place
 

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:43.390
us than human cells and a main place
where that is

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:43.400
where that is
 

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.510
where that is
then cut and these are good for us the

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:46.520
then cut and these are good for us the
 

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.490
then cut and these are good for us the
particular blend of bacteria that we

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:48.500
particular blend of bacteria that we
 

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.410
particular blend of bacteria that we
each have in our guts is important for

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:50.420
each have in our guts is important for
 

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.600
each have in our guts is important for
our well-being and they have their own

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:52.610
our well-being and they have their own
 

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.700
our well-being and they have their own
viruses as well and we're just beginning

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:54.710
viruses as well and we're just beginning
 

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.920
viruses as well and we're just beginning
to study those and understand the

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:56.930
to study those and understand the
 

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:58.810
to study those and understand the
beneficial role of these viruses for

00:16:58.810 --> 00:16:58.820
beneficial role of these viruses for
 

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.080
beneficial role of these viruses for
those bacteria they've been with us as I

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:02.090
those bacteria they've been with us as I
 

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.270
those bacteria they've been with us as I
said since we've evolved and probably

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:04.280
said since we've evolved and probably
 

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.450
said since we've evolved and probably
before that as well now this is a slide

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:07.460
before that as well now this is a slide
 

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.490
before that as well now this is a slide
I just stuck in this morning because we

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:09.500
I just stuck in this morning because we
 

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.470
I just stuck in this morning because we
heard a lecture from a virologist today

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:11.480
heard a lecture from a virologist today
 

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.710
heard a lecture from a virologist today
by the name of Herbert virgin and he

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720
by the name of Herbert virgin and he
 

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.620
by the name of Herbert virgin and he
showed this slide which is the estimated

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:17.630
showed this slide which is the estimated
 

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.660
showed this slide which is the estimated
burden of chronic viral infections in

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:19.670
burden of chronic viral infections in
 

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:21.579
burden of chronic viral infections in
humans now chronic viral infection is

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:21.589
humans now chronic viral infection is
 

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:22.900
humans now chronic viral infection is
one that goes on for years and years

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:22.910
one that goes on for years and years
 

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.120
one that goes on for years and years
we'll talk about the different kinds of

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:25.130
we'll talk about the different kinds of
 

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:28.810
we'll talk about the different kinds of
infections later on but these viral

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:28.820
infections later on but these viral
 

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.370
infections later on but these viral
infections go on for years and years and

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:30.380
infections go on for years and years and
 

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.370
infections go on for years and years and
this is a graph showing on the y-axis

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:33.380
this is a graph showing on the y-axis
 

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.310
this is a graph showing on the y-axis
the estimated number of infected

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320
the estimated number of infected
 

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.250
the estimated number of infected
individuals in the millions so we have

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:38.260
individuals in the millions so we have
 

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.200
individuals in the millions so we have
10 to the 0 up to 10 to the 4th million

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:41.210
10 to the 0 up to 10 to the 4th million
 

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.480
10 to the 0 up to 10 to the 4th million
so population of the world is almost 7

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:43.490
so population of the world is almost 7
 

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.580
so population of the world is almost 7
billion people or so which would be

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:45.590
billion people or so which would be
 

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:49.720
billion people or so which would be
somewhere in here so you can see some of

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:49.730
somewhere in here so you can see some of
 

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:51.040
somewhere in here so you can see some of
these viruses infect everyone the

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:51.050
these viruses infect everyone the
 

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.230
these viruses infect everyone the
endogenous retroviruses are in every one

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:53.240
endogenous retroviruses are in every one
 

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.880
endogenous retroviruses are in every one
so that's the world's population there

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:54.890
so that's the world's population there
 

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:56.980
so that's the world's population there
and then we have an L ov Iris's which

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:56.990
and then we have an L ov Iris's which
 

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.500
and then we have an L ov Iris's which
are curious DNA viruses no one has any

00:17:59.500 --> 00:17:59.510
are curious DNA viruses no one has any
 

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.090
are curious DNA viruses no one has any
clue what they are doing if they cause

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:01.100
clue what they are doing if they cause
 

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.550
clue what they are doing if they cause
any disease but most people seem to be

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:03.560
any disease but most people seem to be
 

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.770
any disease but most people seem to be
infected with them and here here are our

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:05.780
infected with them and here here are our
 

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.490
infected with them and here here are our
herpes viruses look HHV 7 &amp; 8 v zv e bv

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:09.500
herpes viruses look HHV 7 &amp; 8 v zv e bv
 

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.160
herpes viruses look HHV 7 &amp; 8 v zv e bv
c and v all infecting large proportions

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:12.170
c and v all infecting large proportions
 

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:15.010
c and v all infecting large proportions
of the population other herpes viruses

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:15.020
of the population other herpes viruses
 

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.470
of the population other herpes viruses
as well then we go down in prevalence as

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:17.480
as well then we go down in prevalence as
 

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.050
as well then we go down in prevalence as
we reach htlv-1 human t-cell leukemia

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:20.060
we reach htlv-1 human t-cell leukemia
 

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:24.640
we reach htlv-1 human t-cell leukemia
virus one hepatitis delta virus HIV and

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:24.650
virus one hepatitis delta virus HIV and
 

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.160
virus one hepatitis delta virus HIV and
some in between so the burden of chronic

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:27.170
some in between so the burden of chronic
 

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.320
some in between so the burden of chronic
viral infections upon their own is huge

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:29.330
viral infections upon their own is huge
 

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.140
viral infections upon their own is huge
and we think not all of these are bad I

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:32.150
and we think not all of these are bad I
 

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.540
and we think not all of these are bad I
don't want you to end up at the end of

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:34.550
don't want you to end up at the end of
 

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:35.740
don't want you to end up at the end of
this course thinking that all viruses

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:35.750
this course thinking that all viruses
 

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.480
this course thinking that all viruses
are bad some of them are probably good

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:37.490
are bad some of them are probably good
 

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.100
are bad some of them are probably good
in fact many of them are probably good

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:39.110
in fact many of them are probably good
 

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.780
in fact many of them are probably good
for us in a variety of ways and

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:40.790
for us in a variety of ways and
 

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.310
for us in a variety of ways and
hopefully we get to talk about that as

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320
hopefully we get to talk about that as
 

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.900
hopefully we get to talk about that as
well so I think viruses are amazing you

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:45.910
well so I think viruses are amazing you
 

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.640
well so I think viruses are amazing you
probably have some fascination with them

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:48.650
probably have some fascination with them
 

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.860
probably have some fascination with them
or else you wouldn't be here and this

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:50.870
or else you wouldn't be here and this
 

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.900
or else you wouldn't be here and this
course is going to tell you why I think

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:52.910
course is going to tell you why I think
 

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:54.790
course is going to tell you why I think
they're amazing and why they're amazing

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:54.800
they're amazing and why they're amazing
 

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.500
they're amazing and why they're amazing
how do they get to be amazing

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:56.510
how do they get to be amazing
 

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:00.310
how do they get to be amazing
how do they work so I want you to see

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320
how do they work so I want you to see
 

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.900
how do they work so I want you to see
the big picture in this course I don't

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:01.910
the big picture in this course I don't
 

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.600
the big picture in this course I don't
want to teach you 50 different viruses

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:04.610
want to teach you 50 different viruses
 

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:05.890
want to teach you 50 different viruses
and how they replicate and how they

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:05.900
and how they replicate and how they
 

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.240
and how they replicate and how they
cause disease that's not what this

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:07.250
cause disease that's not what this
 

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.460
cause disease that's not what this
course is about that would be a survey

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:09.470
course is about that would be a survey
 

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.530
course is about that would be a survey
course and I don't believe in that kind

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:11.540
course and I don't believe in that kind
 

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.510
course and I don't believe in that kind
of teaching not at this level I want you

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520
of teaching not at this level I want you
 

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.550
of teaching not at this level I want you
to see the big picture the overview so

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:15.560
to see the big picture the overview so
 

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.620
to see the big picture the overview so
you can look at every Veni given virus

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:17.630
you can look at every Veni given virus
 

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.990
you can look at every Veni given virus
and figure out how it replicates and how

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000
and figure out how it replicates and how
 

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.730
and figure out how it replicates and how
it causes disease so I want you to learn

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:21.740
it causes disease so I want you to learn
 

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.010
it causes disease so I want you to learn
general things about replication spread

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:24.020
general things about replication spread
 

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.770
general things about replication spread
and disease-causing I want you to think

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:26.780
and disease-causing I want you to think
 

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.270
and disease-causing I want you to think
about I'll show you how to think about

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:28.280
about I'll show you how to think about
 

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.000
about I'll show you how to think about
virology as an integrated discipline and

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.010
virology as an integrated discipline and
 

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.160
virology as an integrated discipline and
again not a collection of viruses

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:33.170
again not a collection of viruses
 

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:36.790
again not a collection of viruses
diseases genes but the whole picture and

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:36.800
diseases genes but the whole picture and
 

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.800
diseases genes but the whole picture and
this will be clear to you by the end I

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:38.810
this will be clear to you by the end I
 

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.500
this will be clear to you by the end I
think if it is not now I also want you

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:41.510
think if it is not now I also want you
 

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.530
think if it is not now I also want you
to appreciate what viruses do to pervert

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:44.540
to appreciate what viruses do to pervert
 

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.140
to appreciate what viruses do to pervert
pervade the ecosystem to the extent that

we have just talked about today the

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:48.740
we have just talked about today the
 

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.100
we have just talked about today the
numbers that you see and then you'll

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:51.110
numbers that you see and then you'll
 

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.600
numbers that you see and then you'll
also learn the fundamentals about

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:52.610
also learn the fundamentals about
 

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:55.390
also learn the fundamentals about
viruses and these are things that most

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400
viruses and these are things that most
 

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.250
viruses and these are things that most
people don't understand and that is why

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:57.260
people don't understand and that is why
 

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.680
people don't understand and that is why
they are frightened of viruses the

00:19:59.680 --> 00:19:59.690
they are frightened of viruses the
 

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.360
they are frightened of viruses the
unknown is the most frightening thing

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:01.370
unknown is the most frightening thing
 

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.250
unknown is the most frightening thing
and I'm going to help you understand

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:03.260
and I'm going to help you understand
 

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.500
and I'm going to help you understand
viruses so you'll be less frightened

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:05.510
viruses so you'll be less frightened
 

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.760
viruses so you'll be less frightened
about them now virology requires that

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:09.770
about them now virology requires that
 

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.400
about them now virology requires that
you know a little bit about a lot of

unifying principle is that all viruses
 

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.830
unifying principle is that all viruses
have to make messenger RNA and that

have to make messenger RNA and that
 

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.230

messenger RNA has to be able to be
 

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.110
messenger RNA has to be able to be
translated by host ribosomes so no

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120
translated by host ribosomes so no
 

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.140

wouldn't be any viruses so what does

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:55.180
wouldn't be any viruses so what does
 

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.180
wouldn't be any viruses so what does
that mean if the virus is too successful

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:57.190
that mean if the virus is too successful
 

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:59.070
that mean if the virus is too successful
if it kills their hosts then it doesn't

00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.080
if it kills their hosts then it doesn't
 

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.650
if it kills their hosts then it doesn't
have a host to grow in right on the

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:01.660
have a host to grow in right on the
 

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.680
have a host to grow in right on the
other hand if viruses are too passive

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:04.690

and the host defense has overcome an
 

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:10.290
and the host defense has overcome an
infection for example the virus can be

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:10.300
infection for example the virus can be
 

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.300
infection for example the virus can be
eliminated as well so it's a little

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:12.310
eliminated as well so it's a little
 

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.250
eliminated as well so it's a little
paradoxical right you have to have a

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:14.260
paradoxical right you have to have a
 

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:18.090
paradoxical right you have to have a
balance between killing and existing

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:18.100
balance between killing and existing

with the host and this has been debated

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840
with the host and this has been debated
 

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.350
with the host and this has been debated
by many many people for years it's a

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:22.360
by many many people for years it's a
 

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.510
by many many people for years it's a
common misconception that viruses

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:24.520
common misconception that viruses
 

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.760
common misconception that viruses

for a lot of other evolutionary

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:44.690
for a lot of other evolutionary
 

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:46.840
for a lot of other evolutionary
questions but it's a lot of fun to talk

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:46.850
questions but it's a lot of fun to talk
 

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:48.850
questions but it's a lot of fun to talk
about we're gonna talk about evolution

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:48.860
about we're gonna talk about evolution
 

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.750
about we're gonna talk about evolution
and we'll we'll do that so how do you

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:52.760
and we'll we'll do that so how do you
 

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.900
and we'll we'll do that so how do you
balance this survival of the host and

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:55.910
balance this survival of the host and
 

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:58.000
balance this survival of the host and
survival of the virus this is a really

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.010
survival of the virus this is a really
 

00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:00.940
survival of the virus this is a really
important underlying question you'll

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:00.950
important underlying question you'll
 

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:02.740
important underlying question you'll
want to kill the hosts off because then

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:02.750
want to kill the hosts off because then
 

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:04.900
want to kill the hosts off because then
you have no host to multiply in but you

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:04.910
you have no host to multiply in but you
 

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:06.760
you have no host to multiply in but you
can't be wimpy otherwise you're not

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:06.770
can't be wimpy otherwise you're not
 

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:08.440
can't be wimpy otherwise you're not
gonna get anywhere as well so there's an

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:08.450
gonna get anywhere as well so there's an
 

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:09.970
gonna get anywhere as well so there's an
incredible balance and this is one of

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:09.980
incredible balance and this is one of
 

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.919
incredible balance and this is one of
the big questions that viola gist try

00:33:11.919 --> 00:33:11.929
the big questions that viola gist try
 

00:33:11.929 --> 00:33:14.919
the big questions that viola gist try
and understand it's very difficult to

00:33:14.919 --> 00:33:14.929
and understand it's very difficult to
 

00:33:14.929 --> 00:33:17.590
and understand it's very difficult to
study in people so we turn to other

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600
study in people so we turn to other
 

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.799
study in people so we turn to other
models for doing that and all of the

00:33:20.799 --> 00:33:20.809
models for doing that and all of the
 

00:33:20.809 --> 00:33:23.440
models for doing that and all of the
twists and turns that allow viruses to

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:23.450
twists and turns that allow viruses to
 

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:25.270
twists and turns that allow viruses to
propagate and whether it be in a cell or

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:25.280
propagate and whether it be in a cell or
 

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.750
propagate and whether it be in a cell or
a tissue or an entire organism or in the

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760
a tissue or an entire organism or in the
 

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.690
a tissue or an entire organism or in the
whole population this provides insight

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:31.700
whole population this provides insight
 

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.430
whole population this provides insight
into mechanisms that we couldn't study

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440
into mechanisms that we couldn't study
 

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.950
into mechanisms that we couldn't study
any other way and that's another theme

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:35.960
any other way and that's another theme
 

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.980
any other way and that's another theme
in this course we can study aspects of

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:38.990
in this course we can study aspects of
 

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.440
in this course we can study aspects of
life that you can't do without virus

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:41.450
life that you can't do without virus
 

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:44.169
life that you can't do without virus

which is really nice you will have

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:48.220
which is really nice you will have
 

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.410
which is really nice you will have
significantly better insight into how

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:50.420
significantly better insight into how
 

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.750
significantly better insight into how
cells work and how they interact not

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:52.760
cells work and how they interact not
 

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.299
cells work and how they interact not
just viruses because viruses are wedges

00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:55.309
just viruses because viruses are wedges
 

00:33:55.309 --> 00:33:58.060
just viruses because viruses are wedges
or hooks they target processes to their

or hooks they target processes to their
 

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.770
or hooks they target processes to their
advantage so when I explained how a

00:33:59.770 --> 00:33:59.780
advantage so when I explained how a
 

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:01.690
advantage so when I explained how a
virus replicates you're going to better

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:01.700
virus replicates you're going to better
 

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.419
virus replicates you're going to better
understand the cellular process you're

00:34:04.419 --> 00:34:04.429
understand the cellular process you're
 

00:34:04.429 --> 00:34:06.400
understand the cellular process you're
going to have an a better knowledge of

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:06.410
going to have an a better knowledge of
 

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.740
going to have an a better knowledge of
the way information is stored and

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:08.750
the way information is stored and
 

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.440
the way information is stored and
decoded in viral genomes and this is far

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:11.450
decoded in viral genomes and this is far
 

00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:14.080
decoded in viral genomes and this is far
more diverse and complicated than occurs

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:14.090
more diverse and complicated than occurs
 

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:16.720
more diverse and complicated than occurs
in our cells for example many many

can you pack so much information into a
 

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:26.290
can you pack so much information into a
tiny viral genome and have it work we

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:26.300
tiny viral genome and have it work we
 

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.390

able to better understand what's

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:36.350
able to better understand what's
 

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:38.530
able to better understand what's
happening to you when you get sick from

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:38.540
happening to you when you get sick from
 

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.500
happening to you when you get sick from
a viral infection and when your family

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:41.510
a viral infection and when your family
 

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:43.060
a viral infection and when your family
says to you should I be vaccinated

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:43.070
says to you should I be vaccinated
 

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.130
says to you should I be vaccinated
you'll be able to make a better decision

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:45.140
you'll be able to make a better decision
 

00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.100
you'll be able to make a better decision
about that as well so why you get why do

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:48.110
about that as well so why you get why do
 

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:49.930
about that as well so why you get why do
you feel badly when you get a viral

00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:49.940
you feel badly when you get a viral
 

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.870
you feel badly when you get a viral
infection the immunology will explain

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:52.880
infection the immunology will explain
 

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.430
infection the immunology will explain
that and that's one of the things you'll

00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:54.440
that and that's one of the things you'll
 

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.700
that and that's one of the things you'll
be able to do when the course is over in

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:57.710
be able to do when the course is over in
 

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:59.680
be able to do when the course is over in
addition you'll be able to defend these

00:34:59.680 --> 00:34:59.690
addition you'll be able to defend these
 

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.930
addition you'll be able to defend these
assertions but you may disagree with me

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:01.940
assertions but you may disagree with me
 

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.610
assertions but you may disagree with me
which is fine but I think you'll see by

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:03.620
which is fine but I think you'll see by
 

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.770
which is fine but I think you'll see by
the end of the course that viruses have

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:05.780
the end of the course that viruses have
 

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.560
the end of the course that viruses have
more biological diversity than than all

well inherit the earth although they

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:25.070
well inherit the earth although they
 

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.560
well inherit the earth although they
can't get rid of us otherwise they

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:26.570
can't get rid of us otherwise they
 

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:28.230
can't get rid of us otherwise they
wouldn't be able to propagate and

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240
wouldn't be able to propagate and
 

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.480
wouldn't be able to propagate and
despite being very small most viruses it

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:31.490
despite being very small most viruses it
 

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:33.820
despite being very small most viruses it
turns out have less than 15 genes we

turns out have less than 15 genes we
 

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:36.190
turns out have less than 15 genes we
have tens of thousands of genes in us

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200
have tens of thousands of genes in us
 

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.500
have tens of thousands of genes in us
some viruses only have one gene and

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:38.510
some viruses only have one gene and
 

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:40.900
some viruses only have one gene and
that's enough for them to propagate it

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:40.910
that's enough for them to propagate it
 

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:43.030
that's enough for them to propagate it
be very successful they excel at

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040
be very successful they excel at

it's just sensationalism and and

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:32.900
it's just sensationalism and and
 

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.890
it's just sensationalism and and
remember that newspapers and TV programs

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:35.900
remember that newspapers and TV programs
 

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.799
remember that newspapers and TV programs
have to be sensational to make money for

00:36:38.799 --> 00:36:38.809
have to be sensational to make money for

to so here we have a CNN headline from

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:44.900
to so here we have a CNN headline from

to so here we have a CNN headline from
actually one of my readers on the blog

00:36:47.079 --> 00:36:47.089
actually one of my readers on the blog
 

00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:50.230
actually one of my readers on the blog
sent this to me last year this this was

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240
sent this to me last year this this was
 

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.990
sent this to me last year this this was
from last summer I believe a paper came

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:53.000
from last summer I believe a paper came
 

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.400
from last summer I believe a paper came
out in the New England Journal of

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:54.410
out in the New England Journal of
 

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.140
out in the New England Journal of
Medicine where they had infected ferrets

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:56.150
Medicine where they had infected ferrets
 

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:59.230
Medicine where they had infected ferrets
with the new pandemic influenza virus

with the new pandemic influenza virus
 

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.109
with the new pandemic influenza virus
and so they put this headline up without

00:37:02.109 --> 00:37:02.119
and so they put this headline up without
 

00:37:02.119 --> 00:37:04.420
and so they put this headline up without
telling the listeners that this referred

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:04.430
telling the listeners that this referred
 

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:08.079
telling the listeners that this referred
to experiments in a ferret and it can

00:37:08.079 --> 00:37:08.089
to experiments in a ferret and it can
 

00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:09.789
to experiments in a ferret and it can
ravage the lung spreads through

doesn't stay in the head like seasonal

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:14.540
doesn't stay in the head like seasonal
 

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.319
doesn't stay in the head like seasonal
flu I don't know what that means because

00:37:16.319 --> 00:37:16.329
flu I don't know what that means because
 

00:37:16.329 --> 00:37:19.270
flu I don't know what that means because
flu typically is a lower respiratory

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280
flu typically is a lower respiratory
 

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.480
flu typically is a lower respiratory
tract infection the last point survivors

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:22.490
tract infection the last point survivors
 

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:24.910
tract infection the last point survivors
of 1918 flu are immune that's true

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:24.920
of 1918 flu are immune that's true
 

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.380
of 1918 flu are immune that's true
because the virus is quite related

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:26.390
because the virus is quite related
 

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:28.000
because the virus is quite related
antigenically to that and we'll talk

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.010
antigenically to that and we'll talk
 

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:31.030
antigenically to that and we'll talk
about that but an animal model is great

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040
about that but an animal model is great
 

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.549
about that but an animal model is great
for understanding aspects of virology

00:37:33.549 --> 00:37:33.559
for understanding aspects of virology
 

00:37:33.559 --> 00:37:36.430
for understanding aspects of virology
but it turns out that the virus was

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440
but it turns out that the virus was
 

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.620
but it turns out that the virus was
quite benign in people for the most part

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:38.630
quite benign in people for the most part
 

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:40.390
quite benign in people for the most part
and so the animal results did not

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400
and so the animal results did not
 

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.370
and so the animal results did not
predict what was happening in people but

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:42.380
predict what was happening in people but
 

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.440
predict what was happening in people but
it was just a splashy sensationalist

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:44.450
it was just a splashy sensationalist
 

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:46.750
it was just a splashy sensationalist
headline and this is what we're trying

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:46.760
headline and this is what we're trying
 

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.490
headline and this is what we're trying
to combat so I want you to be able to

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:48.500
to combat so I want you to be able to
 

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.740
to combat so I want you to be able to
look beyond this look through this kind

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:50.750
look beyond this look through this kind
 

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:54.069
look beyond this look through this kind
of sensationalism so we're going to talk

00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079
of sensationalism so we're going to talk
 

00:37:54.079 --> 00:37:55.900
of sensationalism so we're going to talk
mainly about animal viruses in this

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:55.910
mainly about animal viruses in this
 

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:58.569
mainly about animal viruses in this
course but we will talk about some

00:37:58.569 --> 00:37:58.579
course but we will talk about some
 

00:37:58.579 --> 00:38:00.549
course but we will talk about some
viruses that infect bacteria because

00:38:00.549 --> 00:38:00.559
viruses that infect bacteria because
 

00:38:00.559 --> 00:38:02.319
viruses that infect bacteria because
they are great model systems not not a

00:38:02.319 --> 00:38:02.329
they are great model systems not not a
 

00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:04.930
they are great model systems not not a
lot but enough to explain certain

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:04.940
lot but enough to explain certain
 

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.420
lot but enough to explain certain
principles and many viruses will not pay

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:07.430
principles and many viruses will not pay
 

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:09.910
principles and many viruses will not pay
any attention to sadly because of time

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920
any attention to sadly because of time
 

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.470
any attention to sadly because of time
constraints but once you take this

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:11.480
constraints but once you take this
 

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.450
constraints but once you take this
course you'll be in love with viral adji

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:13.460
course you'll be in love with viral adji
 

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.339
course you'll be in love with viral adji
and you'll be following viruses for the

00:38:15.339 --> 00:38:15.349
and you'll be following viruses for the
 

00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:17.170
and you'll be following viruses for the
rest of your lives so I'm not worried

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:17.180
rest of your lives so I'm not worried
 

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.089
rest of your lives so I'm not worried
about that so let's talk a little bit

00:38:19.089 --> 00:38:19.099
about that so let's talk a little bit
 

00:38:19.099 --> 00:38:21.579
about that so let's talk a little bit
about viral origins and history how old

00:38:21.579 --> 00:38:21.589
about viral origins and history how old
 

00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:24.609
about viral origins and history how old
are viruses well without with a few

00:38:24.609 --> 00:38:24.619
are viruses well without with a few
 

00:38:24.619 --> 00:38:26.260
are viruses well without with a few
exceptions and we'll talk about the

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:26.270
exceptions and we'll talk about the
 

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:28.359
exceptions and we'll talk about the
exceptions there's no fossil record so

00:38:28.359 --> 00:38:28.369
exceptions there's no fossil record so
 

00:38:28.369 --> 00:38:29.890
exceptions there's no fossil record so
it's very difficult to know how old they

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:29.900
it's very difficult to know how old they
 

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.819
it's very difficult to know how old they
are you can get estimates for how old

00:38:33.819 --> 00:38:33.829
are you can get estimates for how old
 

00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:35.140
are you can get estimates for how old
they are by looking at the sequence

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:35.150
they are by looking at the sequence
 

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.569
they are by looking at the sequence
change so viruses change in their

00:38:37.569 --> 00:38:37.579
change so viruses change in their
 

00:38:37.579 --> 00:38:39.579
change so viruses change in their
sequence a certain amount each year it's

00:38:39.579 --> 00:38:39.589
sequence a certain amount each year it's
 

00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:41.770
sequence a certain amount each year it's
called a molecular clock and you can

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:41.780
called a molecular clock and you can
 

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.140
called a molecular clock and you can
back calculate using a molecular clock

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:44.150
back calculate using a molecular clock
 

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.839
back calculate using a molecular clock

halation and for some viruses it places

00:38:48.079 --> 00:38:48.089
halation and for some viruses it places
 

00:38:48.089 --> 00:38:50.779
halation and for some viruses it places
them among the dinosaurs in 150 million

00:38:50.779 --> 00:38:50.789
them among the dinosaurs in 150 million
 

00:38:50.789 --> 00:38:54.620
them among the dinosaurs in 150 million
years ago and this is all all possible

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:54.630
years ago and this is all all possible
 

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:56.509
years ago and this is all all possible
now because we can sequence viral

00:38:56.509 --> 00:38:56.519
now because we can sequence viral
 

00:38:56.519 --> 00:38:58.069
now because we can sequence viral
genomes and there's a whole new area of

00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079
genomes and there's a whole new area of
 

00:38:58.079 --> 00:39:00.890
genomes and there's a whole new area of
bioinformatics that uses mathematical

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:00.900
bioinformatics that uses mathematical
 

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:04.489
bioinformatics that uses mathematical
algorithms to do these calculations in

00:39:04.489 --> 00:39:04.499
algorithms to do these calculations in
 

00:39:04.499 --> 00:39:07.219
algorithms to do these calculations in
theory as I mentioned earlier viruses

00:39:07.219 --> 00:39:07.229
theory as I mentioned earlier viruses
 

00:39:07.229 --> 00:39:09.469
theory as I mentioned earlier viruses
could predate cellular life they could

00:39:09.469 --> 00:39:09.479
could predate cellular life they could
 

00:39:09.479 --> 00:39:12.499
could predate cellular life they could
have existed in a soup we'll talk a

00:39:12.499 --> 00:39:12.509
have existed in a soup we'll talk a
 

00:39:12.509 --> 00:39:14.569
have existed in a soup we'll talk a
little bit about those early origins but

00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:14.579
little bit about those early origins but
 

00:39:14.579 --> 00:39:16.489
little bit about those early origins but
where my feeling is that probably

00:39:16.489 --> 00:39:16.499
where my feeling is that probably
 

00:39:16.499 --> 00:39:18.799
where my feeling is that probably
viruses were around even before cellular

00:39:18.799 --> 00:39:18.809
viruses were around even before cellular
 

00:39:18.809 --> 00:39:20.690
viruses were around even before cellular
life evolved but I think it will be hard

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:20.700
life evolved but I think it will be hard
 

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:25.099
life evolved but I think it will be hard
to prove we do have lots of early

00:39:25.099 --> 00:39:25.109
to prove we do have lots of early
 

00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:27.890
to prove we do have lots of early
records of virus infections in

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:27.900
records of virus infections in
 

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.870
records of virus infections in
prehistory alright so let me tell you a

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880
prehistory alright so let me tell you a
 

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.190
prehistory alright so let me tell you a
few of those so there are ancient

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200
few of those so there are ancient
 

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.309
few of those so there are ancient
references to viral diseases so here we

00:39:34.309 --> 00:39:34.319
references to viral diseases so here we
 

00:39:34.319 --> 00:39:39.380
references to viral diseases so here we
have from 700 BC from the Iliad and it

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:39.390
have from 700 BC from the Iliad and it
 

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:42.589
have from 700 BC from the Iliad and it
says here this firebrand rabid Hector

00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599
says here this firebrand rabid Hector
 

00:39:42.599 --> 00:39:45.349
says here this firebrand rabid Hector
leads the charge so rabid referring to

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359
leads the charge so rabid referring to
 

00:39:45.359 --> 00:39:48.829
leads the charge so rabid referring to
this virus disease passed on to humans

00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839
this virus disease passed on to humans
 

00:39:48.839 --> 00:39:52.219
this virus disease passed on to humans
by rabid animals and they didn't know it

00:39:52.219 --> 00:39:52.229
by rabid animals and they didn't know it
 

00:39:52.229 --> 00:39:54.410
by rabid animals and they didn't know it
was a virus at the time but it meant

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:54.420
was a virus at the time but it meant
 

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.269
was a virus at the time but it meant
that viruses were around and here's

00:39:56.269 --> 00:39:56.279
that viruses were around and here's
 

00:39:56.279 --> 00:39:59.809
that viruses were around and here's
another one from about 1500 to 1300 BC

00:39:59.809 --> 00:39:59.819
another one from about 1500 to 1300 BC
 

00:39:59.819 --> 00:40:03.170
another one from about 1500 to 1300 BC
it's an Egyptian carving which shows

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180
it's an Egyptian carving which shows
 

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.900
it's an Egyptian carving which shows
this young priest with this leg it's

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:05.910
this young priest with this leg it's
 

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:07.880
this young priest with this leg it's
called drop foot and a withered calf

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:07.890
called drop foot and a withered calf
 

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:10.249
called drop foot and a withered calf
which is very typical of polio so we

00:40:10.249 --> 00:40:10.259
which is very typical of polio so we
 

00:40:10.259 --> 00:40:12.789
which is very typical of polio so we
think this is the first recorded

00:40:12.789 --> 00:40:12.799
think this is the first recorded
 

00:40:12.799 --> 00:40:15.109
think this is the first recorded
characterization of polio myelitis which

00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119
characterization of polio myelitis which
 

00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:17.539
characterization of polio myelitis which
is also caused by a virus so the

00:40:17.539 --> 00:40:17.549
is also caused by a virus so the
 

00:40:17.549 --> 00:40:18.950
is also caused by a virus so the
historical records are full of

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960
historical records are full of
 

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.229
historical records are full of
references to diseases which when we

00:40:21.229 --> 00:40:21.239
references to diseases which when we
 

00:40:21.239 --> 00:40:22.789
references to diseases which when we
look at them now look very much like

00:40:22.789 --> 00:40:22.799
look at them now look very much like
 

00:40:22.799 --> 00:40:25.579
look at them now look very much like
either viral or bacterial diseases and

00:40:25.579 --> 00:40:25.589
either viral or bacterial diseases and
 

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:26.959
either viral or bacterial diseases and
there are entire books written on this

00:40:26.959 --> 00:40:26.969
there are entire books written on this
 

00:40:26.969 --> 00:40:29.749
there are entire books written on this
subject which discussed for example how

00:40:29.749 --> 00:40:29.759
subject which discussed for example how
 

00:40:29.759 --> 00:40:31.849
subject which discussed for example how
battles were lost due to infectious

00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:31.859
battles were lost due to infectious
 

00:40:31.859 --> 00:40:33.380
battles were lost due to infectious
diseases and of course not no one knew

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:33.390
diseases and of course not no one knew
 

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:35.839
diseases and of course not no one knew
what these were but clearly the virus

00:40:35.839 --> 00:40:35.849
what these were but clearly the virus
 

00:40:35.849 --> 00:40:37.549
what these were but clearly the virus
infections were around as long as as

00:40:37.549 --> 00:40:37.559
infections were around as long as as
 

00:40:37.559 --> 00:40:42.759
infections were around as long as as
people were around you can also

00:40:42.759 --> 00:40:42.769
people were around you can also
 

00:40:42.769 --> 00:40:45.680
people were around you can also
understand from looking at the way

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:45.690
understand from looking at the way
 

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:48.529
understand from looking at the way
people prevented virus infections so as

00:40:48.529 --> 00:40:48.539
people prevented virus infections so as
 

00:40:48.539 --> 00:40:51.049
people prevented virus infections so as
long ago as the 11th century there were

00:40:51.049 --> 00:40:51.059
long ago as the 11th century there were
 

00:40:51.059 --> 00:40:53.779
long ago as the 11th century there were
practices in place to prevent virus

00:40:53.779 --> 00:40:53.789
practices in place to prevent virus
 

00:40:53.789 --> 00:40:55.489
practices in place to prevent virus
infections again that wasn't known that

00:40:55.489 --> 00:40:55.499
infections again that wasn't known that
 

00:40:55.499 --> 00:40:58.190
infections again that wasn't known that
they were virus infections without

00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200
they were virus infections without
 

00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:58.850
they were virus infections without
knowledge of the

00:40:58.850 --> 00:40:58.860
knowledge of the
 

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:02.450
knowledge of the
agent and a very famous practice was

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:02.460
agent and a very famous practice was
 

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.770
agent and a very famous practice was
called variolation

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:03.780
called variolation
 

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.380
called variolation
and smallpox is a disease that we can

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:06.390
and smallpox is a disease that we can
 

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.150
and smallpox is a disease that we can
very clearly see in historical records

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160
very clearly see in historical records
 

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.250
very clearly see in historical records
because it has very prominent symptoms

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260
because it has very prominent symptoms
 

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.230
because it has very prominent symptoms
it has a very prominent rash it's fatal

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240
it has a very prominent rash it's fatal
 

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.530
it has a very prominent rash it's fatal
and so we can track it historically now

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:15.540
and so we can track it historically now
 

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.900
and so we can track it historically now
what was noticed very early on was that

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:17.910
what was noticed very early on was that
 

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:19.970
what was noticed very early on was that
once you got smallpox if you weren't

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:19.980
once you got smallpox if you weren't
 

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:21.890
once you got smallpox if you weren't
killed by the disease you survived then

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:21.900
killed by the disease you survived then
 

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.210
killed by the disease you survived then
you never got it again

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:23.220
you never got it again
 

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.240
you never got it again
so people were smart they said hmm I

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:26.250
so people were smart they said hmm I
 

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:28.580
so people were smart they said hmm I
wonder if I naturally infect myself or

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:28.590
wonder if I naturally infect myself or
 

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:31.190
wonder if I naturally infect myself or
give myself this disease can I protect

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200
give myself this disease can I protect
 

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.170
give myself this disease can I protect
myself so the practice of very very

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:33.180
myself so the practice of very very
 

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:35.750
myself so the practice of very very
elation arose where they would take the

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760
elation arose where they would take the
 

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.660
elation arose where they would take the
pustules from a smallpox victim and

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:38.670
pustules from a smallpox victim and
 

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:40.550
pustules from a smallpox victim and
these are full of virus they would grind

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560
these are full of virus they would grind
 

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.320
these are full of virus they would grind
them up and inject them into someone

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:42.330
them up and inject them into someone
 

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:45.200
them up and inject them into someone
else and if you didn't die from that

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:45.210
else and if you didn't die from that
 

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:47.240
else and if you didn't die from that
because you did often you were protected

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:47.250
because you did often you were protected
 

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:49.700
because you did often you were protected
against the disease and this is actually

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:49.710
against the disease and this is actually
 

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:53.360
against the disease and this is actually
something brought to the UK England in

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.270
the 1700s by lady Montague who was the
wife of the Turkish ambassador and she

wife of the Turkish ambassador and she
 

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.190
wife of the Turkish ambassador and she
went to Turkey and found this practice

being done where you would go to a woman

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:03.090
being done where you would go to a woman
 

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:05.630

who had a little room and she would have

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640
who had a little room and she would have
 

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.480

a vial full of ground-up crusts from

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:08.490
a vial full of ground-up crusts from
 

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:11.030
a vial full of ground-up crusts from
smallpox victims and you would give her

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040
smallpox victims and you would give her
 

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.890
smallpox victims and you would give her
a vein and she would shove some into it

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:12.900
a vein and she would shove some into it
 

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.680

and as I said that has a lot of virus in

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:15.690
and as I said that has a lot of virus in
 

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:17.480
and as I said that has a lot of virus in
it and if you didn't die you would be

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:17.490
it and if you didn't die you would be
 

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:19.190
it and if you didn't die you would be
protected so these are the first

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200
protected so these are the first
 

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.830

problem of spontaneous generation so he

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:14.250
problem of spontaneous generation so he

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:45.390
microorganism and in this case rub it on
 

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:49.549
microorganism and in this case rub it on
the leaf well this fellow did this over

00:45:49.549 --> 00:45:49.559
the leaf well this fellow did this over
 

00:45:49.559 --> 00:45:51.710
the leaf well this fellow did this over
and over and what he found was that what

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720
and over and what he found was that what
 

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.210
and over and what he found was that what
caused the infection of the leaf was

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:53.220
caused the infection of the leaf was
 

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.099
caused the infection of the leaf was
actually going through the filter so

00:45:55.099 --> 00:45:55.109
actually going through the filter so
 

00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:56.539
actually going through the filter so
this is what these filters look like

00:45:56.539 --> 00:45:56.549
this is what these filters look like
 

00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:58.789
this is what these filters look like
these are called porcelain filters you

00:45:58.789 --> 00:45:58.799
these are called porcelain filters you
 

00:45:58.799 --> 00:46:01.309
these are called porcelain filters you
basically had a vacuum flask and then

00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319
basically had a vacuum flask and then
 

00:46:01.319 --> 00:46:03.410
basically had a vacuum flask and then
you have this inverted this chamber up

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:03.420
you have this inverted this chamber up
 

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.380
you have this inverted this chamber up
here you could pour in liquid up here

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:06.390
here you could pour in liquid up here
 

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:08.359
here you could pour in liquid up here
that's what the yellow material is and

00:46:08.359 --> 00:46:08.369
that's what the yellow material is and
 

00:46:08.369 --> 00:46:10.670
that's what the yellow material is and
this is the porcelain filter and have

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680
this is the porcelain filter and have
 

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.549
this is the porcelain filter and have
very fine holes in it which would stop

00:46:13.549 --> 00:46:13.559
very fine holes in it which would stop
 

00:46:13.559 --> 00:46:15.589
very fine holes in it which would stop
bacteria from going through so they

00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599
bacteria from going through so they
 

00:46:15.599 --> 00:46:17.299
bacteria from going through so they
learned this empirically by making

00:46:17.299 --> 00:46:17.309
learned this empirically by making
 

00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:19.990
learned this empirically by making
porcelain with different sized pores and

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000
porcelain with different sized pores and
 

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.460
porcelain with different sized pores and
so the bacteria would remain here and

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:22.470
so the bacteria would remain here and
 

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:24.529
so the bacteria would remain here and
what went through was sterile and what

00:46:24.529 --> 00:46:24.539
what went through was sterile and what
 

00:46:24.539 --> 00:46:26.779
what went through was sterile and what
was found with tobacco mosaic disease

00:46:26.779 --> 00:46:26.789
was found with tobacco mosaic disease
 

00:46:26.789 --> 00:46:29.150
was found with tobacco mosaic disease
was that the agent of the disease was

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160
was that the agent of the disease was
 

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:29.960
was that the agent of the disease was
down here

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:29.970
down here
 

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:32.569
down here
it wasn't hung up by the filter and this

00:46:32.569 --> 00:46:32.579
it wasn't hung up by the filter and this
 

00:46:32.579 --> 00:46:34.940
it wasn't hung up by the filter and this
was a fellow named Ivanov skee who did

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:34.950
was a fellow named Ivanov skee who did
 

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:38.480
was a fellow named Ivanov skee who did
this in 1892 he found that the agent of

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:38.490
this in 1892 he found that the agent of
 

00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:40.220
this in 1892 he found that the agent of
the disease tobacco mosaic disease

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:40.230
the disease tobacco mosaic disease
 

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:43.130
the disease tobacco mosaic disease
passes through the filter okay so you

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:43.140
passes through the filter okay so you
 

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:45.950
passes through the filter okay so you
filter it you take this liquid you put

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960
filter it you take this liquid you put
 

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.140
filter it you take this liquid you put
it on a leaf the leaf gets infected and

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:48.150
it on a leaf the leaf gets infected and
 

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:50.089
it on a leaf the leaf gets infected and
that didn't make sense to anyone because

00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:50.099
that didn't make sense to anyone because
 

00:46:50.099 --> 00:46:52.130
that didn't make sense to anyone because
up to that point they everyone

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:52.140
up to that point they everyone
 

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:53.900
up to that point they everyone
understood that microorganisms were

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:53.910
understood that microorganisms were
 

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:56.329
understood that microorganisms were
retained by these filters so Beit Ivanov

00:46:56.329 --> 00:46:56.339
retained by these filters so Beit Ivanov
 

00:46:56.339 --> 00:46:58.039
retained by these filters so Beit Ivanov
skee said well it's a really small

Virology but he really didn't understand

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760
Virology but he really didn't understand
 

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.819
Virology but he really didn't understand
that he was working with viruses it was

00:47:07.819 --> 00:47:07.829
that he was working with viruses it was
 

00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:10.279
that he was working with viruses it was
about six years later Bayer Inc made the

about six years later Bayer Inc made the
 

00:47:10.289 --> 00:47:13.160
about six years later Bayer Inc made the
same finding the filtrate is what causes

same finding the filtrate is what causes
 

00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:15.289
same finding the filtrate is what causes
infection of the leaves but he said ah

00:47:15.289 --> 00:47:15.299
infection of the leaves but he said ah
 

00:47:15.299 --> 00:47:17.870
infection of the leaves but he said ah
this is a distinct pathogen this is just

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:17.880
this is a distinct pathogen this is just
 

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.700
this is a distinct pathogen this is just
not not just the microbe that we've been

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:19.710
not not just the microbe that we've been
 

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:22.339
not not just the microbe that we've been
studying so far this is something new he

00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:22.349
studying so far this is something new he
 

00:47:22.349 --> 00:47:24.079
studying so far this is something new he
didn't know what it was but he made the

00:47:24.079 --> 00:47:24.089
didn't know what it was but he made the
 

00:47:24.089 --> 00:47:26.720
didn't know what it was but he made the
conceptual leap that this is a new kind

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:26.730
conceptual leap that this is a new kind
 

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:28.130
conceptual leap that this is a new kind
of agent and that's really the beginning

00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:28.140
of agent and that's really the beginning
 

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.279
of agent and that's really the beginning
of virology in 1898 the first animal

00:47:31.279 --> 00:47:31.289
of virology in 1898 the first animal
 

00:47:31.289 --> 00:47:33.410
of virology in 1898 the first animal
virus was discovered the agent of

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:33.420
virus was discovered the agent of
 

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:36.200
virus was discovered the agent of
foot-and-mouth disease which is a

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:36.210
foot-and-mouth disease which is a
 

00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:36.680
foot-and-mouth disease which is a

of cattle and the key concept here is

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:40.020
of cattle and the key concept here is
 

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.319
of cattle and the key concept here is
not only that these agents are small but

00:47:42.319 --> 00:47:42.329
not only that these agents are small but
 

00:47:42.329 --> 00:47:44.599
not only that these agents are small but
they need a host to replicate they don't

00:47:44.599 --> 00:47:44.609
they need a host to replicate they don't
 

00:47:44.609 --> 00:47:47.240
they need a host to replicate they don't
grow in broth so pastures microorganisms

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:47.250
grow in broth so pastures microorganisms
 

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:49.339
grow in broth so pastures microorganisms
would grow in broth but if he took these

00:47:49.339 --> 00:47:49.349
would grow in broth but if he took these
 

00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:51.290
would grow in broth but if he took these
filtrates of tobacco leaves they

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.300
filtrates of tobacco leaves they
 

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.000
filtrates of tobacco leaves they
wouldn't grow in any kind of broth you

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:53.010
wouldn't grow in any kind of broth you
 

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:54.950
wouldn't grow in any kind of broth you
had to put them on our cell in the same

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960
had to put them on our cell in the same
 

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.690
had to put them on our cell in the same
with the foot and mouth disease agent

00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:56.700
with the foot and mouth disease agent
 

00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:58.430
with the foot and mouth disease agent
you could only you had to put it in an

00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440
you could only you had to put it in an
 

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.349
you could only you had to put it in an
animal there were no cell cultures back

00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359
animal there were no cell cultures back
 

00:48:00.359 --> 00:48:02.510
animal there were no cell cultures back
then and it would only grow in the

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520
then and it would only grow in the
 

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.420
then and it would only grow in the
animal so very small and Rep needs a

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:05.430
animal so very small and Rep needs a
 

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:07.309
animal so very small and Rep needs a
host to replicate and from that arose

00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319
host to replicate and from that arose
 

00:48:07.319 --> 00:48:10.940
host to replicate and from that arose
the concept of virus and back then they

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:10.950
the concept of virus and back then they
 

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:13.430
the concept of virus and back then they
used these porcelain filters which had a

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440
used these porcelain filters which had a
 

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:16.760
used these porcelain filters which had a
pore size of about 0.2 microns all right

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:16.770
pore size of about 0.2 microns all right
 

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:18.920
pore size of about 0.2 microns all right
a micrometer is one millionth of a meter

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:18.930
a micrometer is one millionth of a meter
 

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:22.970
a micrometer is one millionth of a meter
this is really small and this this held

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:22.980
this is really small and this this held
 

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:25.280
this is really small and this this held
as a definition of a virus until maybe

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:25.290
as a definition of a virus until maybe
 

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:27.079
as a definition of a virus until maybe
five years ago as we'll see now there

00:48:27.079 --> 00:48:27.089
five years ago as we'll see now there
 

00:48:27.089 --> 00:48:29.150
five years ago as we'll see now there
are some viruses that are bigger so

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160
are some viruses that are bigger so
 

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.740
are some viruses that are bigger so
we're not quite sure where to put them

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:30.750
we're not quite sure where to put them
 

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:33.109
we're not quite sure where to put them
anymore but point to micron filters were

00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119
anymore but point to micron filters were
 

00:48:33.119 --> 00:48:36.349
anymore but point to micron filters were
the defining agent for the size of

00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359
the defining agent for the size of
 

00:48:36.359 --> 00:48:38.210
the defining agent for the size of
viruses for many years so here are some

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:38.220
viruses for many years so here are some
 

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:41.030
viruses for many years so here are some
of the years of virus discovery 1901 the

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040
of the years of virus discovery 1901 the
 

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:44.420

discovered in 1915 and then flew not
 

00:48:57.030 --> 00:49:02.329
discovered in 1915 and then flew not
till 1933 and then shortly after the

1940s the first vaccines against those
 

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:10.250
1940s the first vaccines against those
viruses were made so virus means toxin

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:10.260
viruses were made so virus means toxin
 

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.290
viruses were made so virus means toxin
or poison in Latin that's where the name

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:12.300
or poison in Latin that's where the name
 

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:15.290
or poison in Latin that's where the name
comes from and I will use a term many

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:15.300
comes from and I will use a term many
 

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.480
comes from and I will use a term many
times in this course probably every

lecture virion so we'll say virus is a

00:49:20.089 --> 00:49:20.099
lecture virion so we'll say virus is a
 

00:49:20.099 --> 00:49:22.190
lecture virion so we'll say virus is a

we're just talking about the general
 

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:25.970
we're just talking about the general
concept of a virus but a virion is

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:25.980
concept of a virus but a virion is
 

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:28.819

actually the infectious particle okay so

00:49:28.819 --> 00:49:28.829
actually the infectious particle okay so
 

00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:30.920
actually the infectious particle okay so
remember that virion whenever I say

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:30.930
remember that virion whenever I say
 

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:33.559
remember that virion whenever I say
virion it means a specific thing and the

00:49:33.559 --> 00:49:33.569
virion it means a specific thing and the
 

00:49:33.569 --> 00:49:35.180
virion it means a specific thing and the
particle has to be infectious it's not

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:35.190
particle has to be infectious it's not
 

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:38.030

viruses I'm sorry this should be in
 

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.730
viruses I'm sorry this should be in
white because it tells you the chemical

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:56.740
white because it tells you the chemical
 

00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:58.230
white because it tells you the chemical
formula for this virus which is

00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240
formula for this virus which is
 

00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.160

poliovirus
 

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:01.770
poliovirus
you can see it has three hundred and

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:01.780
you can see it has three hundred and
 

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.390
you can see it has three hundred and
thirty-two thousand six hundred and

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:03.400
thirty-two thousand six hundred and
 

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.670

fifty-two carbon atoms and hydrogen
 

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.390
fifty-two carbon atoms and hydrogen
nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and sulfur so

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:09.400
nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and sulfur so
 

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.250
nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and sulfur so
we know the exact chemical composition

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:11.260
we know the exact chemical composition
 

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:14.370
we know the exact chemical composition
because we know the sequence of all of

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:14.380
because we know the sequence of all of
 

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:18.300
because we know the sequence of all of
the proteins of this virus but actually

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:18.310
the proteins of this virus but actually
 

00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:20.670
the proteins of this virus but actually
that chemical formula isn't correct it's

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:20.680
that chemical formula isn't correct it's
 

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:23.190
that chemical formula isn't correct it's
just an average because as you'll see

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200
just an average because as you'll see
 

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.950
just an average because as you'll see
every virus in a solution is different

00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:25.960
every virus in a solution is different
 

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.340
every virus in a solution is different
it has a different genome sequence so

00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:29.350
it has a different genome sequence so
 

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:31.860
it has a different genome sequence so
the precise composition of phosphorus

00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:31.870
the precise composition of phosphorus
 

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:33.660
the precise composition of phosphorus
and carbon and so forth is different

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:33.670
and carbon and so forth is different
 

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:37.320
and carbon and so forth is different
from each virus one to another so this

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:37.330
from each virus one to another so this
 

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:39.810
from each virus one to another so this
brings us to the question what is a

00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:39.820
brings us to the question what is a
 

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:41.550
brings us to the question what is a
virus I've been telling you that some

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:41.560
virus I've been telling you that some
 

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.840
virus I've been telling you that some
history and what we're going to learn

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:42.850
history and what we're going to learn
 

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:44.330
history and what we're going to learn
but what is it what's the definition

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:44.340
but what is it what's the definition
 

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:47.240
but what is it what's the definition
well it's a very small infectious

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:47.250
well it's a very small infectious
 

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:51.240
well it's a very small infectious
obligate intracellular parasite and this

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:51.250
obligate intracellular parasite and this
 

00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:54.420
obligate intracellular parasite and this
definition has held for years the very

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:54.430
definition has held for years the very
 

00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:56.610
definition has held for years the very
small is kind of problematic now because

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:56.620
small is kind of problematic now because
 

00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:59.070
small is kind of problematic now because
there are some pretty big viruses as you

00:51:59.070 --> 00:51:59.080
there are some pretty big viruses as you
 

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.480
there are some pretty big viruses as you
will see that you can actually see in a

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:00.490
will see that you can actually see in a
 

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:03.300
will see that you can actually see in a
light microscope but anyway we'll use

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:03.310
light microscope but anyway we'll use
 

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:05.010
light microscope but anyway we'll use
this as a working death

00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:05.020
this as a working death
 

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.109
this as a working death
a parasite of course is an organism that

00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119
a parasite of course is an organism that
 

00:52:07.119 --> 00:52:09.300
a parasite of course is an organism that
benefits at the expense of a host

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:09.310
benefits at the expense of a host
 

00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:11.520
benefits at the expense of a host
usually a different organism so viruses

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:11.530
usually a different organism so viruses
 

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:12.960
usually a different organism so viruses
are parasites and they're obligate

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:12.970
are parasites and they're obligate
 

00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:15.180
are parasites and they're obligate
intracellular parasites they have to go

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:15.190
intracellular parasites they have to go
 

00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:17.790
intracellular parasites they have to go
inside a cell you know there many kinds

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:17.800
inside a cell you know there many kinds
 

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.859
inside a cell you know there many kinds
of parasites that live in your

00:52:19.859 --> 00:52:19.869
of parasites that live in your
 

00:52:19.869 --> 00:52:21.900
of parasites that live in your
intestines worms of various sorts for

00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:21.910
intestines worms of various sorts for
 

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:23.550
intestines worms of various sorts for
intestines they are not within your

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:23.560
intestines they are not within your
 

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:26.069
intestines they are not within your
cells viruses have to reproduce within

00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079
cells viruses have to reproduce within
 

00:52:26.079 --> 00:52:29.250
cells viruses have to reproduce within
your cells intracellular parasites now I

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:29.260
your cells intracellular parasites now I
 

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:31.680
your cells intracellular parasites now I
do not think that virus particles are

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:31.690
do not think that virus particles are
 

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:37.470
do not think that virus particles are
living I think I shut it off okay I do

00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:37.480
living I think I shut it off okay I do
 

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.089
living I think I shut it off okay I do
not think that virus particles are

00:52:39.089 --> 00:52:39.099
not think that virus particles are
 

00:52:39.099 --> 00:52:41.280
not think that virus particles are
living its objecting to my saying that

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:41.290
living its objecting to my saying that
 

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:45.839
living its objecting to my saying that
to you many people debate this but the

00:52:45.839 --> 00:52:45.849
to you many people debate this but the
 

00:52:45.849 --> 00:52:48.210
to you many people debate this but the
particle not virus the particle the

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:48.220
particle not virus the particle the
 

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:50.130
particle not virus the particle the
virion I should actually have virions

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:50.140
virion I should actually have virions
 

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:52.920
virion I should actually have virions
are not living a virion is just a

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:52.930
are not living a virion is just a
 

00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:55.079
are not living a virion is just a
chemical it's not living and has a

00:52:55.079 --> 00:52:55.089
chemical it's not living and has a
 

00:52:55.089 --> 00:52:56.880
chemical it's not living and has a
potential to live when it goes into a

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:56.890
potential to live when it goes into a
 

00:52:56.890 --> 00:52:58.620
potential to live when it goes into a
cell so maybe you could view the

00:52:58.620 --> 00:52:58.630
cell so maybe you could view the
 

00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:00.569
cell so maybe you could view the
infected cell is living but the particle

00:53:00.569 --> 00:53:00.579
infected cell is living but the particle
 

00:53:00.579 --> 00:53:03.210
infected cell is living but the particle
itself is not living but this is debated

00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:03.220
itself is not living but this is debated
 

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.190
itself is not living but this is debated
and that's just my view and you can have

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200
and that's just my view and you can have
 

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.440
and that's just my view and you can have
your own as well I think there are

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:07.450
your own as well I think there are
 

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:09.180
your own as well I think there are
chemicals and cannot reproduce on their

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:09.190
chemicals and cannot reproduce on their
 

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:12.480
chemicals and cannot reproduce on their
own you need a cellular host in order to

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:12.490
own you need a cellular host in order to
 

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:14.490
own you need a cellular host in order to
reproduce so on my blog I put a poll

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:14.500
reproduce so on my blog I put a poll
 

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:17.400
reproduce so on my blog I put a poll
about a year ago our virus is alive you

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:17.410
about a year ago our virus is alive you
 

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:19.500
about a year ago our virus is alive you
should go take this poll at some point

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:19.510
should go take this poll at some point
 

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:21.180
should go take this poll at some point
when you feel confident in your answer

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:21.190
when you feel confident in your answer
 

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:22.589
when you feel confident in your answer
here's the link

00:53:22.589 --> 00:53:22.599
here's the link
 

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:25.349
here's the link
I had the options where yes no or they

00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359
I had the options where yes no or they
 

00:53:25.359 --> 00:53:27.030
I had the options where yes no or they
are something in between or I don't know

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040
are something in between or I don't know
 

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.800
are something in between or I don't know
now I shouldn't have put this something

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:28.810
now I shouldn't have put this something
 

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:29.990
now I shouldn't have put this something
in between because too many people

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000
in between because too many people
 

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.950
in between because too many people
picked it but we have 1,500 responses

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960
picked it but we have 1,500 responses
 

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.870
picked it but we have 1,500 responses
29% 32 33 so it's pretty evenly divided

00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880
29% 32 33 so it's pretty evenly divided
 

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.540
29% 32 33 so it's pretty evenly divided
among the three so I don't know who's

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:39.550
among the three so I don't know who's
 

00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:41.160
among the three so I don't know who's
answering this I think it's all kinds of

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:41.170
answering this I think it's all kinds of
 

00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:43.230
answering this I think it's all kinds of
people I think there's some biologists

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:43.240
people I think there's some biologists
 

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.849
people I think there's some biologists
here as well as non scientists as well

00:53:44.849 --> 00:53:44.859
here as well as non scientists as well
 

00:53:44.859 --> 00:53:47.700
here as well as non scientists as well
but when you feel you can answer this

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:47.710
but when you feel you can answer this
 

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:48.960
but when you feel you can answer this
question or maybe you already have an

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:48.970
question or maybe you already have an
 

00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:51.800
question or maybe you already have an
opinion go there and take the survey

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:51.810
opinion go there and take the survey
 

00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:54.540
opinion go there and take the survey
now viruses are very small as I said

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:54.550
now viruses are very small as I said
 

00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:57.240
now viruses are very small as I said
here's a picture that gives you some

00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:57.250
here's a picture that gives you some
 

00:53:57.250 --> 00:54:00.569
here's a picture that gives you some
idea of that so here's a carbon atom up

00:54:00.569 --> 00:54:00.579
idea of that so here's a carbon atom up
 

00:54:00.579 --> 00:54:02.940
idea of that so here's a carbon atom up
here so I'll be obviously magnified a

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:02.950
here so I'll be obviously magnified a
 

00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:07.079
here so I'll be obviously magnified a
lot and these are all various structures

00:54:07.079 --> 00:54:07.089
lot and these are all various structures
 

00:54:07.089 --> 00:54:11.069
lot and these are all various structures
in at the right scale for carbon so

00:54:11.069 --> 00:54:11.079
in at the right scale for carbon so
 

00:54:11.079 --> 00:54:14.670
in at the right scale for carbon so
here's a tRNA an antibody myosin actin

00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:14.680
here's a tRNA an antibody myosin actin
 

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.040
here's a tRNA an antibody myosin actin
and here's a ribosome and poliovirus so

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:17.050
and here's a ribosome and poliovirus so
 

00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:18.330
and here's a ribosome and poliovirus so
you can see polio is about the

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:18.340
you can see polio is about the
 

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:21.240
you can see polio is about the
of a ribosome considerably bigger than

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:21.250
of a ribosome considerably bigger than
 

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:26.220
of a ribosome considerably bigger than
carbon now we take this whole panel and

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:26.230
carbon now we take this whole panel and
 

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:28.500
carbon now we take this whole panel and
we we shrink it so it's this size and

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:28.510
we we shrink it so it's this size and
 

00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:30.360
we we shrink it so it's this size and
now we have some other viruses that are

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:30.370
now we have some other viruses that are
 

00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:32.670
now we have some other viruses that are
really big and so that's why we have to

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:32.680
really big and so that's why we have to
 

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:35.220
really big and so that's why we have to
shrink these to go down we have HIV one

00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:35.230
shrink these to go down we have HIV one
 

00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:37.680
shrink these to go down we have HIV one
up here which is quite large tobacco

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:37.690
up here which is quite large tobacco
 

00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:41.220

mosaic virus and then a bacteriophage

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:41.230
mosaic virus and then a bacteriophage
 

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:45.600
mosaic virus and then a bacteriophage
and here's e-coli so e-coli is huge and

00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:45.610
and here's e-coli so e-coli is huge and
 

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:47.250
and here's e-coli so e-coli is huge and
these viruses are quite big but we have

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:47.260
these viruses are quite big but we have
 

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:49.140
these viruses are quite big but we have
another virus which I'll talk about in a

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:49.150
another virus which I'll talk about in a
 

00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:52.500
another virus which I'll talk about in a
moment which is slightly bigger than you

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:52.510
moment which is slightly bigger than you
 

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:56.220
moment which is slightly bigger than you
coli at least in diameter so this gives

00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:56.230
coli at least in diameter so this gives
 

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:58.230
coli at least in diameter so this gives
you some relative ideas about the size

00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240
you some relative ideas about the size
 

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.390
you some relative ideas about the size
of viruses now here is a cell with some

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400
of viruses now here is a cell with some
 

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.640
of viruses now here is a cell with some
viruses near it to give you more of an

viruses near it to give you more of an
 

00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:05.520
viruses near it to give you more of an
idea so here's a eukaryotic cell right

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:05.530
idea so here's a eukaryotic cell right
 

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:08.070

course it's going to be much bigger than
 

00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:35.310
course it's going to be much bigger than
the virus but it gives you some kind of

00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:35.320
the virus but it gives you some kind of
 

00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.980

one of the causes of the common cold you

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:46.030
one of the causes of the common cold you
 

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:48.900
one of the causes of the common cold you
could put 500 million on the head of a

00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:48.910
could put 500 million on the head of a
 

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:51.360
could put 500 million on the head of a
pin but the bigger virus has many fewer

virus was isolated from a water tower in

00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:14.770
virus was isolated from a water tower in
 

00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:18.270
virus was isolated from a water tower in
France and the the individuals who

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:18.280
France and the the individuals who
 

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:19.620
France and the the individuals who
isolated they thought it was they looked

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:19.630
isolated they thought it was they looked
 

00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:20.970
isolated they thought it was they looked
at it under the microscope they thought

00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:20.980
at it under the microscope they thought
 

00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:22.380
at it under the microscope they thought
was a bacterium so they put it in the

00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:22.390
was a bacterium so they put it in the
 

00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:24.420
was a bacterium so they put it in the
freezer and it sat there for a couple of

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:24.430
freezer and it sat there for a couple of
 

00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:25.710
freezer and it sat there for a couple of
years till they went back to it they

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:25.720
years till they went back to it they
 

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:27.180
years till they went back to it they
realized it was a virus it was just

00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:27.190
realized it was a virus it was just
 

00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:30.510
realized it was a virus it was just
really big it grows in a me bait in the

microns in diameter so remember the
 

00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:40.140
microns in diameter so remember the
filter we use to filter out the viruses

00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:40.150
filter we use to filter out the viruses
 

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:43.050
filter we use to filter out the viruses
is 0.2 microns so this will not go

00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:43.060
is 0.2 microns so this will not go
 

00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:45.000
is 0.2 microns so this will not go
through the filter so if you use that

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:45.010
through the filter so if you use that
 

00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:46.620
through the filter so if you use that
kind of filter to look for viruses you

00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:46.630
kind of filter to look for viruses you
 

00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:48.810
kind of filter to look for viruses you
will miss the me me viruses so you can't

00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:48.820
will miss the me me viruses so you can't
 

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:50.400

01:00:30.089 --> 01:00:33.029
classifying the virus but now in the
most recent five years genomics is

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:33.039
most recent five years genomics is
 

01:00:33.039 --> 01:00:34.680
most recent five years genomics is
really taken over in virus

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:34.690
really taken over in virus
 

01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:37.229
really taken over in virus
classification so you can isolate the

01:00:37.229 --> 01:00:37.239
classification so you can isolate the
 

01:00:37.239 --> 01:00:38.489
classification so you can isolate the
new virus you don't even have to isolate

01:00:38.489 --> 01:00:38.499
new virus you don't even have to isolate
 

01:00:38.499 --> 01:00:40.620
new virus you don't even have to isolate
a virus you can get a sequence of a

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:40.630
a virus you can get a sequence of a
 

01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:42.809
a virus you can get a sequence of a
virus and look at it have your

01:00:42.809 --> 01:00:42.819
virus and look at it have your
 

01:00:42.819 --> 01:00:44.700
virus and look at it have your
bioinformatics people look at the

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:44.710
bioinformatics people look at the
 

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:46.499
bioinformatics people look at the
sequence and they'll tell you where to

01:00:46.499 --> 01:00:46.509
sequence and they'll tell you where to
 

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:48.299
sequence and they'll tell you where to
classify it you don't have to think

01:00:48.299 --> 01:00:48.309
classify it you don't have to think
 

01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:49.529
classify it you don't have to think
about any of this other stuff there's

01:00:49.529 --> 01:00:49.539
about any of this other stuff there's
 

01:00:49.539 --> 01:00:51.779
about any of this other stuff there's
actually some controversy about this in

01:00:51.779 --> 01:00:51.789
actually some controversy about this in
 

01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:53.789
actually some controversy about this in
the field but genomics has become very

01:00:53.789 --> 01:00:53.799
the field but genomics has become very
 

01:00:53.799 --> 01:00:56.039
the field but genomics has become very
important at classification so here's an

01:00:56.039 --> 01:00:56.049
important at classification so here's an
 

01:00:56.049 --> 01:00:57.610
important at classification so here's an
example

01:00:57.610 --> 01:00:57.620
example
 

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.860
example
research crew went up went to Antarctica

01:00:59.860 --> 01:00:59.870
research crew went up went to Antarctica
 

01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:02.710
research crew went up went to Antarctica
went down I guess to Antarctica they

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720
went down I guess to Antarctica they
 

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.210
went down I guess to Antarctica they
drilled holes in the ice there

01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:04.220
drilled holes in the ice there
 

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.100
drilled holes in the ice there
apparently freshwater lakes down there

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:06.110
apparently freshwater lakes down there
 

01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:08.290
apparently freshwater lakes down there
and they drilled holes in them and they

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:08.300
and they drilled holes in them and they
 

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.000
and they drilled holes in them and they
sampled the water and they just

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:10.010
sampled the water and they just
 

01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:11.920
sampled the water and they just
sequenced the water they extracted

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:11.930
sequenced the water they extracted
 

01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:13.300
sequenced the water they extracted
nucleic acids from the water and they

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:13.310
nucleic acids from the water and they
 

01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:14.680
nucleic acids from the water and they
sequenced it's called deep sequencing

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:14.690
sequenced it's called deep sequencing
 

01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:18.010
sequenced it's called deep sequencing
and they found 10,000 new virus species

01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:18.020
and they found 10,000 new virus species
 

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:20.500
and they found 10,000 new virus species
just by sequencing it your sequence wit

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:20.510
just by sequencing it your sequence wit
 

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.810
just by sequencing it your sequence wit
and you you search the database and you

01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:22.820
and you you search the database and you
 

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.790
and you you search the database and you
say there are 10,000 sequences here that

01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:24.800
say there are 10,000 sequences here that
 

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.110
say there are 10,000 sequences here that
are all different I don't see any of

01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:26.120
are all different I don't see any of
 

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.490
are all different I don't see any of
them in the database so you have new

01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:27.500
them in the database so you have new
 

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.400
them in the database so you have new
virus sequences and it says here in

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:30.410
virus sequences and it says here in
 

01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:31.870
virus sequences and it says here in
total the viruses were from 12 different

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880

new to science so you can put a virus in

01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:36.860
new to science so you can put a virus in
 

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.320
new to science so you can put a virus in
a family just by looking at the sequence

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:38.330
a family just by looking at the sequence
 

01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:40.420
a family just by looking at the sequence
nowadays so that's an example of what I

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:40.430
nowadays so that's an example of what I
 

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:42.580

was telling you here's an example of how

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:42.590
was telling you here's an example of how
 

01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:45.040
was telling you here's an example of how
you would classify a virus it's a very

genomes and the important breakthrough

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:50.270
genomes and the important breakthrough
 

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:52.540
genomes and the important breakthrough
here occurred in the 1950s when it was

01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:52.550
here occurred in the 1950s when it was
 

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:56.230
here occurred in the 1950s when it was
shown that the viral nucleic acid genome

01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240
shown that the viral nucleic acid genome
 

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.300
shown that the viral nucleic acid genome
carried the information needed to build

01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:58.310
carried the information needed to build
 

01:02:58.310 --> 01:03:00.730
carried the information needed to build
viruses before that we didn't know how

01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:00.740
viruses before that we didn't know how
 

01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.220
viruses before that we didn't know how
new new viruses or organisms were even

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:03.230
new new viruses or organisms were even
 

01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:04.960
new new viruses or organisms were even
built now now this seems very obvious

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:04.970
built now now this seems very obvious
 

01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:07.660
built now now this seems very obvious
but that was one of the building blocks

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:07.670
but that was one of the building blocks
 

01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:10.570
but that was one of the building blocks
of this field called molecular biology

01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:10.580
of this field called molecular biology
 

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:11.500
of this field called molecular biology
you may remember the

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:11.510
you may remember the
 

01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:14.890
you may remember the
in 1944 a couple of investigators at the

01:03:14.890 --> 01:03:14.900
in 1944 a couple of investigators at the
 

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:16.930
in 1944 a couple of investigators at the
Rockefeller showed that the DNA of a

01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:16.940
Rockefeller showed that the DNA of a
 

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:19.650
Rockefeller showed that the DNA of a
bacterium was the genetic information

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:19.660
bacterium was the genetic information
 

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:22.330
bacterium was the genetic information
but for viruses that wasn't known until

01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:22.340
but for viruses that wasn't known until
 

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:27.609
but for viruses that wasn't known until
the 1950s and that was done by these two

01:03:27.609 --> 01:03:27.619
the 1950s and that was done by these two
 

01:03:27.619 --> 01:03:29.290
the 1950s and that was done by these two
investigators alfred hershey and

01:03:29.290 --> 01:03:29.300
investigators alfred hershey and
 

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:33.190
investigators alfred hershey and
Margaret chase in 1952 they took a

01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200
Margaret chase in 1952 they took a
 

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.970
Margaret chase in 1952 they took a
bacteriophage and they labeled it with

01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:36.980
bacteriophage and they labeled it with
 

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.130
bacteriophage and they labeled it with
two different kinds of radioactive

01:03:39.130 --> 01:03:39.140
two different kinds of radioactive
 

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:42.849
two different kinds of radioactive
isotopes one to label the protein shell

01:03:42.849 --> 01:03:42.859
isotopes one to label the protein shell
 

01:03:42.859 --> 01:03:46.030
isotopes one to label the protein shell
or one to label the DNA and then they

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:46.040
or one to label the DNA and then they
 

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:48.460
or one to label the DNA and then they
took these radioactively tags bacteria

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:48.470
took these radioactively tags bacteria
 

01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:50.980
took these radioactively tags bacteria
phages they infected bacteria and they

01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:50.990
phages they infected bacteria and they
 

01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:53.680
phages they infected bacteria and they
asked where does the label go so when

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:53.690
asked where does the label go so when
 

01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:57.130
asked where does the label go so when
they labeled the protein they found that

01:03:57.130 --> 01:03:57.140
they labeled the protein they found that
 

01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:59.470
they labeled the protein they found that
there was nothing left in the cell after

01:03:59.470 --> 01:03:59.480
there was nothing left in the cell after
 

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:01.150
there was nothing left in the cell after
the virus infected that so there was no

01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:01.160
the virus infected that so there was no
 

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.640
the virus infected that so there was no
radioactive protein but if they labeled

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:03.650
radioactive protein but if they labeled
 

01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:06.000
radioactive protein but if they labeled
the DNA you can do that with with

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:06.010
the DNA you can do that with with
 

01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:09.160
the DNA you can do that with with
phosphorous p32 they found that the

specification that means the Strand that
 

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.490
specification that means the Strand that
can be translated so when I say Plus RNA

01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:12.500
can be translated so when I say Plus RNA
 

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:13.840

and minus is the complement and the
 

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:19.120
and minus is the complement and the
strand of DNA that's the plus strand is

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:19.130
strand of DNA that's the plus strand is
 

01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:21.550

mRNA so that's what we talk about when
 

01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:26.920
mRNA so that's what we talk about when
we say plus and minus strand and double

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:26.930
