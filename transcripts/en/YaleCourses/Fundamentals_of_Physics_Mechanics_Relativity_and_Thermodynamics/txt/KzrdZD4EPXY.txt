Speaker 1:          00:00:00       So today it's again a brand new topic. So if you like at relativity, you would be in grief and mourning. If it got to be really nasty, you will be relieved that that's behind us. Now, and let me remind you one more time that the problem set for relativity was quite challenging because I had to make up most of the problems and they're not from the book. So that a little more difficult. The exam will be much more lenient compared to the homework that generally true, but particularly true in this case. Okay, so today I'm going to introduce you to some mathematical tricks. As you probably noticed by now, a lot of physics has to do with the mathematics and if you're not good in one, you're not going to be good in the other. And I just thought I'd spend some time introducing you to some tricks of the trade and then we will start using that first important trick is to know what's called Taylor series. Okay. I see this as greeted by a booze and the hissing sounds. I'm not sure what your past experience with Taylor's city's water is and why it leaves you so scarred. And uh, I'm happy. My experience with Taylor's thesis in positively positive, and I don't think I can carry on any of my things that not only the Taylor cds, but I'll tell it to you Taylor cities as we guys in the physics department tend to use it. The philosophy of the Taylor's CDs is the following. That is some function f of X.

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       And I'm going to drive that function, something like this. But I'm going to imagine that you don't have access to the whole function. You cannot see the whole thing. Uh, you can only zero in on a tiny region around here. And the question is, as you try to approximate as you try to build on a good approximation to the function, oh, how will you set it up so that you can write an approximation, but this whole function valid near the point x equals zero where you know something. So suppose I block out the whole function. You've got mind and mental. I don't show you anything except what's happening here. Now that works. I show you only f of zero.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       That's all you had told. The value of the function is 92 what should we do away from Mexico? Zero. Well, you got no information about this function or you don't know if it's going up. If it's going down. All I tell you is one number what is doing. Now it's clear. The best approximation you can make is a flat line. There's no reason to tilted one way or the other given the information you have. So the first approximation, the function you will say is ffx equal to that. It's not equal to. You can put some symbol or that means approximately equal to,

Speaker 2:          00:03:10       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:03:11       but then if you have, it's like saying temperature, today's mighty to at, what's it going to be tomorrow? Well, if you don't have anything else, you cannot tell what is going to be tomorrow. But if you know that this is fall and the temperature's always going down and somebody tells you, I know the rate of change of temperature, I know that as a up to date. The rate of change of temperature is something that you can use that information to make a prediction on what it'll be tomorrow. That is to say for values of x, not equal to zero, and let's denote by the this falling symbol. F prime of zero is the derivative, which is the FDX at x equals zero and you would multiplied by x and that's your best bet for what the function is away from Mexico zero. What that does is to approximate the function by a straight line with the right intercept and the right slope by right, I mean Matt says what you know about the exact function and if it turns out the function really was the straight line, you're done.

Speaker 1:          00:04:24       It's not even an approximation. It'll track the function all the way through eternity, but it can happen of course, that the function besides to curve upwards as I've shown in this example, and this will not work if you go too far for a while, you will be tangent to the function, but then it'll bend away from you. So it's really good for very small acts and you can say, well, I want to do a little better when I go for the road. Well, what does doesn't tell you this approximation is that the rate of change itself has the rate of change. This assumes the rate of change is a fixed date of change, which is the rate of change at the origin and the rate of change of the rate of change is the second date of it. So if somebody told you, look, here's one more piece of information, I know the second day of it to go the function which I'm going to write this f double prime at zero, what would that information, you can build a better approximation to the function and you will put that in x square.

Speaker 1:          00:05:20       But the key thing is you got to divide by two art. If you like two factorial, where do you d divide by the two factorial? Because your goal is to take this approximation and make sure it has whatever you know about the function built into it, right? Let's check this approximation and see if it satisfies those properties. First of all at x equals zero let's compare the two sites at x equals zero. The lefthand side is f of zero on the right hand side. When you put x equals zero you kill this and you kill this and it matches, so you certainly got the right value of the function. Then you say, what if it take the data to have the function at x equals zero let's take the data to up this try and function are the approximate function on both sides and I take the derivative that being a constant that's not contribute. This didn't ever do have xs one.

Speaker 2:          00:06:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       In the next one they'd ever, two x squared is two x two x cancels the two so I get amped double prime of zero times x but now evaluate the deliberative at x equal to zero. Then that gets rid of this guy and the date of it to all my test function. Matt is the deliberate to what the actual function because this is the actual little bit about the actual function.

Speaker 2:          00:06:43       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       that what follows that. If you want to say, how about the second day they went have this function, uh, let's take the test function I have or the approximation, take it, second date of it too and make sure that comes out right. I don't feel like writing this out, but try to do this in your head. Take to deliver to them the lefthand side and see what happens on the right hand side. Well if you take one day to rid of this guy is gone. If you take two derivative, this guy gone. And then if you take the first day they have a TV, you get to x, take the second derivative, you get to the two cancels the two of you, put x equals zero. If you do, you find that f double prime zero here matches the secondary to go the function on the left hand side.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       So this two factorial is that to make sure that the function you have cooked up has the right value of the function, that the origin has the right slope at the origin as the right rate of change of the slope at the artist. Well, it's very clear what we should do. If you had a whole bunch of derivatives than the approximation we will write will look like f entity limited. I'm cannot Dora and primes there. So and means and sets primes extra the end over end factorial and you go as far as you can. If you know 13 derivatives, put 13 derivatives here, that's an approximation. That's not called a tailor cities. That's the approximation to the function.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       Now it may happen that sometimes we hit the Jackpot and you know all the derivatives. Someone tells you all the databases of the function than white stop. Yes sir, I had them all up. Then you will get the sum going from the zero did ever do all the way up to infinity. And if you do the summation at every value of x, you get a value. And if that summation is meaningful and gives you a finite number, that in fact is exactly the function you are given. That is the tailor series. Tailor cds is a serious with infinite number of terms, which if you sum up and sum up to something sensible will actually be as good as the left side. So let me give you one example. It's famous example one over one minus x is the real function. Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:09:06       You and I know this function. We know how to put it in the calculator. We know how to plot it. You gave me an accent and I stick it to the denominator, subtracted from one inverted. That's the function. But instead suppose this function was reveal to us in status we a trolled f of zero. What does F of zero here put? X Equals Zero F of zero is one. Now let's take the date of it to have this function. The FDX, the FDX has a minus one because it's one minus x to the minus one times square than they did the data do with what's inside this. That gives you a minus one.

Speaker 1:          00:09:49       This is simple calculus. How to take delivery to have this fella here, having taken the date of it, evaluated at x equals zero this vanishes. That becomes one and you get one. If you're not, take the second bit of it to have dysfunction, which I don't feel like doing and I evaluate that at x equals zero and I'll find it as equal to two factorial. In fact, I'll find the date of it to at the origin to be n factorial. Well that's very nice because then my approximation to the function begins as one plus x times the first derivative, which happens to be one plus x squared over two factorial. Time to secondary we'll do it happens to be two factorial plus x cubed over three factorial times three factorial. So you can see, but this guy is going, it looks like one plus x plus x squared, et Cetera. The Taylor series is infinite sound in practice. You may be happy to just keep a couple of terms, so let's get a feeling for what does a couple of times can do for us. So let me take a x equal a 0.1 x equaled a 0.1. The real answer is one over one minus 0.1 which is one over 0.9 which is 1.1111 et cetera.

Speaker 1:          00:11:25       That's that's the target. What do you do with the series? The city starts at one time to one 10th plus one over a hundred plus one over a thousand and so on. And you can see as I keep more and more terms, I keep this filling up. These ones, if you stopped with one over a thousand you stop right there.

Speaker 1:          00:11:48       So this is the exact answer. This is the approximation, but it's clear to you perhaps the simple example that if you kept all the terms in the series, you really will get this infinite number of recurring ones. So that is the function that is a tailor approximation, which is chop it off and I where you want and there's a good approximation. And does the Taylor series the cities means some everything. Now something an infinite number of numbers. Is that the delicate issue? I don't want to go there at all. I discuss that in this math book, but sometimes there's some makes no sense. Then you got to quit. But example, put x equal two to the connect function as one minus two. This minus one I would approximation for next x equal do to look like one plus two plus four plus a what? Eight and first of all this some is going to grow to infinity because the numbers are getting bigger and bigger.

Speaker 1:          00:12:48       This some seems to be all positive, but it's a correct dancers. Negative. Obviously the is doesn't work. So the next lesson about Taylor cds is you can write down the cities but it may not sum up to anything sensible beyond a certain range. So if you're doing the Taylor series at x equals zero and you go to x equal to two, it just doesn't work. So you can ask how far can I go from the origin? Well, in this simple example, we know that a at x equal to one the function just going to infinity. That's why you couldn't go there and you cannot go to the right hand side of that point. The function is well defined on the other side, but this cds, there's knowledge that the function here, it's not enough to get you on the other side.

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       So this is a case where that are obvious problems that x equaled the one. But if I wrote a function like one or one plus x square, that's a nice function, got no troubles anywhere. And yet if you took the sailors cds for it, you will find if you go beyond absolute value of x equal to one, the cds makes no sense. So I don't want to do that mathematical theory of series. I just want to tell you that functions can be approximated by series and if you're lucky or you can do the whole psalm if you know all the data motives and the whole sum maybe converge to give a final answer in with guests, it's as good as the function. One guy can use one over one minus x, the other one can use the infinity cities and Marilee and mathematically and every sin equal as long as they're known, stray outside the region or validity of the infinite series. Okay. So, uh, the most popular example that I've been using in the class you'd remember is one plus x to the end. That's the function we can do it staler series f of zero is one

Speaker 1:          00:14:37       what's the date? Two of the function. It's n times one plus extra the n minus one, right? The FDX is n times one plus extra. The n minus one. If I had evaluated at x equals zero. It just an that's why we get this famous result we've been using all the time. If x is small enough, you stopped it because the next time is going to involve an x squared in the next cube. And if x is tiny, we have no respect for x squared and x cube. We just cut it off. But if you want an extra one of you guys, you want to ask me what happens next? We'll take the second derivative. You can see n times n minus one times one plus actually the n minus two if you put x equals zero n times n minus one x squared. And don't forget the two factorial. So what I've been doing is I've been saying one plus extra the end approximately equal to this, but even if you keep that as still approximate, but it's a good approximation. How many terms you want to keep depends on how tiny exes.

Speaker 1:          00:15:40       Okay, so it's good to know that's an infinite series, but it's also good to know you can chop it off and do business with a few terms. In fact, all of the activity we reduced as follows, the energy of a particle is this, which we can write it as MC squared times one minus B squared over c squared or the minus one half. If you expand this in a power cds, you're going to get mc square plus one half MV squared plus stuff involving B to the fourth oversee to the fourth times the square. We dropped all this and for 300 years we did mechanics keeping just this stroke just kept that first non trivial Terman all of our collisions and so on. But we did just only that up to that point. So, so the approximations that video useful and they described nature approximately.

Speaker 1:          00:16:35       If you say, well, I want to be exact, you can go back and use this. Unfortunately general relativity tells you that that's not exactly that in quantum mechanics still to the whole thing is wrong. So at every stage you will have to give up something. So I have a lot of respect for approximations. If you could not describe the, well approximately you couldn't have come where you've come because no one knows the exact answer to a single question. You can post asked me a question and the answer is I don't know. Second part, the answer is nobody knows. Because if your questions is give an answer to arbitrary position, any question to ask, we just don't know. Newtonian mechanics works for small velocities. Uh, all of the mechanics worked for any velocity but not for very tiny objects. Then you got to use quantum mechanics. So always, uh, theories get way the new theories. And so approximations are very important. So you have to learn this. Okay, so now I'm going to consider the following function. E to the X. No,

Speaker 1:          00:17:47       this guy is something you all know and love because it's one nice thing about the function is every database is e to the x, right? Every child knows you're the has got e to the x assets didn't have it. Why do we like that here? That means all the bit of actives are sitting in front of you. They're eat the x and an x equals zero e to the zero is one so every deliberative is one. Then the function is very easy to write down. It is really one less x plus x squared over two factorial. Let's extra the three over two factorial x the four over four factorial. You can go on like this and if you like to write use the compact notation is extra. The n o n n factorial and going from zero to infinity at zero factorial is defined to be one actually e to the x.

Speaker 1:          00:18:39       If you ever forget the value of e and I need to know the value of e because when I locked my suitcase and check it into the airport, I use either e or Pi because they are the only two numbers I can remember. So if I forget the value of e, I just say he is the same as the one. I got one plus one plus one over two dozen, one over six. And pretty soon I'm telling the guy scanning my luggage. That's my code. And it's much better than any other court because I cannot reconstruct, uh, say my grandfather's name and not get it right out in Minot, construct my house at rest, at my phone at risk. This doesn't change. I've been moving it on all over the world. This is a very reliable number. No Pie is a good number, but rule for computing pyre somewhat more difficult by also can be computed as an infinite series.

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       But this guy is very easy. There's 2.77 something that is he okay now he had a very nice property of the cds. It is good for any x. You remember the CDs for one old, one minus x, crashed and burned at x equal to one. This seat is always good. You put x equals 37 million, you got 37 million, 37 million cube. There's a million. The fourth power, don't worry. These factorials downstairs will tame it down and make it converge and we'll give you either the whatever number I gave. That's something I'm not proving what the seed is. Put either the ex no limits on validity. All right? Then we take the function course, sign x, of course I next we all know and love is this guy.

Speaker 2:          00:20:22       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:20:23       has got a period of two Pi, but we can write a cities for it because it's a function and what do I need to know to write the cities for it? I need to know the value of the function or the origin. So we know coastline of zero is one.

Speaker 1:          00:20:40       If you take the date of it, dude, you get minus sign and it's value of zero is zero. You take the one more derivative, you can minus go signed zero, which is minus one. And I think by, and I have, you get the point. Every other director will vanish at the remaining delivered to, so we'll alternate and sign from one to minus one. That means if you crank it out, you will get one. You won't have anything linear in x because the Coefficient of that is signed zero with vanishes. Then you will get x squared over two factorial plus actually the four over four factorial and so on.

Speaker 2:          00:21:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:18       The Cisco sine x, if you cut it off after some number of terms, it's not going to work in the beginning. One minus x squared looks very good. This is one minus x squared over to look like this, but eventually this approximation will go bad on you because x to the fourth is just x to the fourth and grow without limit. No one's telling you this approximation has a property that coastline is less than one. It doesn't satisfy that because you're not supposed to use it that far out, but if you keep all the terms and in fact even though the exit the fort is taking off, x to the minus six is saying, hey, come down x date. The saying go up, you add them all together. Remarkably you would reproduce this function.

Speaker 2:          00:22:03       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:22:03       that he hard to imagine that the coastline that we know as Oscillatory is really this function and I hope all of you know enough to know how to find the series. You should know the date of it too. Of course sign is minus sign. I did have two of sinus sign and evaluate them or the origin. I say you can build up the series then if it was similar tricks for sine x sine of zero zero did a, we have scientists course sine and cosine of zero is one so the first day of it was one that gives you this term. Next one. One. Give me anything. The one after that we'll give you this and that. This guy would go on like this one.

Speaker 2:          00:22:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:46       Okay, so these have CDs for e to the x cost say annex and Synnex good for all x so there's no restriction on this.

Speaker 1:          00:23:00       One of the really interesting things to do when you are bored are stranded somewhere and the airport is the Taiko sine squared plus science square squared, the whole thing at the square of the whole thing and add them up. You will find by miracle you will get the one from the squaring, the one and every other power of XL. Keep on vantage. Of course you will have to collect powers of x by expanding the bracket, but it will all counsel. That's what I meant by saying this series is as good as this function. It'll be all the identities.

Speaker 2:          00:23:28       No.

Speaker 1:          00:23:31       Okay. Now for the punchline thing, everyone, some of you may know what the punchline is. The punchline is the following. Let us introduce without any preamble. Right now the number I, what's the square root of minus one? All I expected. Why is that? When I squatted I get minus one if I cubit. ICUBED is ice squared times eyes, so that's minus eye. An eye to the fourth is back to plus one cause I the fourth. This ice square times I swear and I squared is minus one so you could take power survive. She'll keep jumping between these values. It'll be, I will become minus one. It'll become minus side and become plus one. That's the set of possible values for power supply. It'll be one of these four values.

Speaker 1:          00:24:24       Well then we are told if you now consider the following rather strange objects, he put the I x o x. You have to agree is really bizarre. He is some number. You want to raise it to two that's fine. Number of times number I s a strange number, right? It's this waiter to minus one and you wanted me to raise e do a complex power. What does that even mean? Multiply e by itself. I x times. Well that definition of powers is no good, but the cts, what he did, the x defines it for all x. Then we boldly defined e to the x or even complex values of x as simply this thing. To the IMX plugged in, place her bags, and by that fashion be defined exponentially. So the exponential function is simply defined as subway, right? He raised two dog used to dog one dog, the dog squared over two, that's the e raised to anything is a cord for this series.

Speaker 1:          00:25:39       And now we raised it to barriers, things, real numbers, complex numbers, matrices, whatever you want your pet, you can put that up. Of course you got to be really careful. You cannot raise erased the dog because the units don't match. There's a dog here and dogs quit. So you should have divided by some standard dog, like the president is doc, take some standard, but Napoleon's dog divided, then you've got something dimensionless, then it will work. So as long as a, that is some dimensional, this object, this is what we mean. But he raised with that Mattson. Fantastic. Uh, leap of imagination. Hope to raise, eat whatever power you like. Take the city as well. Let's do the series. Okay, so I'm going to get one plus x plus x squared over two factorial. That's I x cubed over three factorial. And I'm going to stop after this last term. I actually, the Ford over four factorial. Keep going. Then what do you get? Let's take the one from here. Uh, leave this alone for a minute. You're right. I times x go here. I squared is minus one. So I get minus x squared over two factorial than I come here. ICUBED is minus I. So I right here minus x cubed over two factorial. Then I go back here and write extra foretold four factorial. By now everybody knows what's going on. Everybody knows that this is just of course INX less ice sign next.

Speaker 1:          00:27:17       Okay. This is a super duper formula. Life cannot go on without this. You want to draw a box around it. This one, uh, dry because without this formula we cannot do so many things we do.

Speaker 1:          00:27:36       It says that the techno metric functions and the exponential functions that actually very intimately connected and he did all defined by the poverty cities. You can able, you're able to prove this. So this is the formula proven by oiler and it's considered very beautiful formula. And here is the particularly beautiful special case of this formula. If you put x equals two Pi, I get that it's an e to the IPI equal the cost pie, which is minus one plus I signed pie with the zero. So I get the result either the IPI plus one equal to zero.

Speaker 1:          00:28:16       No, everybody agrees. This has gotta be one of the most beautiful formulas you can imagine involving numbers are in mathematics. Why is it such a great formula? Look at this formula here. Pi defined from the Egyptian times to the ratio of circle to diameter I squared or the minus one one is the basis for all integers. E is the basis for the logarithm. Here's a formula in which all the key numbers appeared in one single compact formula. So people think this and the fact that these numbers would have a relation at all is staggering and this is the nature of the relationship. This is voted Deimos formula most likely to be remembered as formula. Now we are going to use not only the special case, but we're going to use this all the time. So you guys have to tell how many people have seen this. Okay. If you have not seen this, then you've got more work than people who have seen this. You got to go and you got to do all the intermediate steps so you get used to this thing. Now let's do the following two other variations and then I'll move on. If I change extra minor sex, then I get either the minus I x cost center minus x is course sine x and sign of minus X is minus sine x so I can get that to the relation.

Speaker 1:          00:29:41       Then I'm going to combine those two to do the following. I'm going to say that course x is equal to eat the I x e to the minus x over to. You can check that and sign x is equal to eat the I x minus e to the minus IEX over to I.

Speaker 2:          00:30:06       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:30:06       you just add and subtract these two formulas and you get that. Okay, so what does this mean? It means a took not metric functions. You don't need them. You've got exponential functions. You can manufacture trigonomic function out of them. Provided you're not afraid to go to exponents with complex number I in them and all the identities you know about science and coastlines will follow from this. For example, if they call sign square plus Science Square, you're supposed to get one where they can square the right hand side. You can square the lefthand side and you will get one to get the one you bet to the member of the following. Either the IMX names, either the minus IEX is what you don't have. You come by and exponents. You raised it to one power times the same thing. Relation other power is erase. Do I? X minus x either is to zero, which is one.

Speaker 1:          00:31:11       When you raise that number to a power, you multiplied by the number of times a different power. The product is the number two, the sum of the two powers, right powers combined to queue times store the fourth store, the sixth. That's true for two. It's true for me. It's true for everything. Exponents ad when you multiply them, that's why either the IEX and even the minus sign x combined to give you one. Once you know that you can prove this. Okay, now I'm going to do a little more of a complex numbers. Maybe I'll leave this alone for now. So I introduced you the number I by saying it's a squared or the minus one and complex numbers entered our life even though we didn't go looking for them. You can write down equations with real numbers, with no intentionally and working anything fancy like this, and you find that there's no solution to this equation even though everything that is completely real are so you can say, well, x squared minus one and they can manufacture a number I with the property I squared is minus one. Then of course you can have x equal to plus or minus. I as your answer. So complex numbers of errors by trying to solve a quadratic equations. So let me write you a slightly more interesting quadratic equation. X squared plus x plus one equals zero.

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       so there's no funny business. All real numbers. We want to solve this equation. So if we go back to other good old a sandbox days when we knew what the answer for this was a minus three over two and be already have a problem because we don't know what to do with square root of minus three so we will write it as square root of minus three we'll write it as square root of minus one times square root of three squared or than minus one we will call I and we will say this equation has two roots explicit minus one I mean x plus minus the two routes which are minus one plus or minus square root of three I over to, so one root is one minus, one less rude, three I over to the other old route is minus one minus root three over two.

Speaker 1:          00:33:39       These are solutions formally to this equation. In the following sense, take this x that I'm giving you what that into that equation, square the x and IDX. Stuart and I had the one it'll in fact satisfied equation. All you will have to know of when you met it plated is that ice grade is minus one. We've seen the one property you can know solve a quadratic equation, so people realize that if you enlarge the numbers to include complex numbers, then you can solve any polynomial equation with that many number of groups. If it's quadratic, it'll have two routes which Kubik you'll have three routes. They may not all be real. They may involve the complex number nine.

Speaker 2:          00:34:21       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:34:22       no, very important point to notice is that this whole thing minus one plus root three I over to the whole thing is a single complex number. Don't think of it to some of two numbers. It's a single complex number. For example, if this had been plus instead of minus, you'd get something like one plus or minus root three over to take the positive route. You don't think of it as two numbers. This is a single number and that continues to be true even if it's a complex number. So you should think of the whole combination as a single entity which you can add to other such entities and squared. And so on. Okay, so that's what we are going to do. Now we're going to generalize this particular case and introduce now a complex numberZ and we're going to write every complex numberZ as a part that is no I in it and a part that has an I in the example I had here, x is equal to, in this example x was minus one over two and why was a plus or minus root three over two?

Speaker 2:          00:35:34       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:35:35       and we are going to visualize that complex as a point in the x y play. We just met at x horizontally and vertically. Put a dot there that your complex number z. Then we say a new complex number called Z star and it's defined to be x minus I why? It's called the complex conjugate complex conjugate of z is obtained by changing the sign of, I say feel like if z is sitting here is he started sitting there reflected on the x axis.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       Okay, so how does one work with complex numbers? You add them, you subtract them, your new, multiply them and you divide them. If you know how to do that, you can do with complex numbers. Everything you did with real numbers, so if z one is a complex number that is equal x one plus Iwai one and z two is a complex number that is x two plus I white too. We will define z one plus z two to be x one plus y one bless I times I'm Saudi x one plus x two times eight times white, one plus white too.

Speaker 1:          00:37:05       If you drop pictures, then use z one is that number and z two is that number that [inaudible] really it's like adding vectors. This number is z one plus z two it's exactly like adding vectors, but you don't think of this plus that as two disjoint numbers but as forming a single entity in a complex number. Z X is called the real part of z and there's been ordered by symbol. Real Dizzy. If you wanted to get to z, if we want to get the deal part of a complex numberZ , do where there's complex conjugate and divide by two because you are adding explicitly white minus Osi. Why you get to x and divided by two you get that. If you want to get the wife just called imaginary part ofZ , Z minus z star divided by two one it's like saying find the x component of the vector is what automotive place. I wake comprehensive vectors. Water multiply multiplies Jay. Similarly, a complex number can be broken down at the part with Israel and the part that multiplies, I extract the real part, add to it the conjugate and divide by two to extract the imaginary part, subtract the conjugate and divide by two.

Speaker 1:          00:38:34       Again, if you have seen you don't need this, we haven't seen it. It may look a little fast, but that's why I posted on the nords, uh, in the, on the website chapter five from this math book, which has got all this stuff. So you can go home and you can read it.

Speaker 1:          00:38:51       Okay. The next question is what is the one times z too? Now that's very easy to calculate x one plus I y one x two plus I wipe to just open out the brackets and the member I squared is minus one. That's all you got to do. Does that gives me x one x two that'll, let me multiply the Iwai one times the Iwai too and that gives me minus y one white too because I squared is minus one plus I times x one y two x to y one the Soviet multiply two complex numbers. That's something very nice that happens when you multiply a number Z by its complex conjugate. What happens when you multiply Z by its conjugate? You are saying take x plus y multiply by x minus y wife Oh a plus B times a million is bs is square minus B square, but remember these I why? So when you take the square of that should keep track of all the signs and you will find is x squared plus y squared. We denote that as this and this thing is called the modulars.

Speaker 2:          00:40:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       Of Z. It's the length of the complex number z just given by Pythagoras. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:27       You shouldn't have anybody take a complex number. Multiply by age, conjugate by its complex kind you get the result will be a real number equal the square of the length of the complex number because I'm going to use that now to do the last of the manipulations, which is what does the one divided by Z too. How do you divide these crazy numbers on the top? I write x one plus Iya one the bottom. I write x two plus Iwai too. If I only had x two, I know how to divide. It's just the number the way that bay doing that bakes too, but I got the sum of these two numbers in the bottom and you can ask how do you do the division? The trick always when you run into this problem is to multiply the top and bottom by the complex conjugate of get up the bottle multiplied by x two minus y to top and bottom.

Speaker 2:          00:41:22       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:41:25       Then something nice happens. That denominator because nominated then becomes extra square plus white you squared, which is an ordinary real number. Nothing complex about that. The numerator, you can open up the brackets. I don't know if I want to do that. I just going to be x one x two plus y one y two plus I times y one x two minus x one no, don't worry about all the details. All it means is if you know how to multiply two complex numbers, you can also divide by a complex number. That's the key point. Why? Because you've got a complex number, dinner, not matter, you don't like it. Multiply the top and bottom by the complex conjugate of this guy. The denominator turns into purely real number. So this whole thing could be 36 for example. Well, we know how to divide the numerator by 36 right? X One x two plus y one y two is on number, maybe nine. Then you would divide by 36 one forth. This could be eight times 18 it will be 36 you get Iowa too, so this number could have been one fourth less. I over too. So dividing by complex number is not a problem.

Speaker 1:          00:42:40       Okay, so now why did I do all that stuff today about either the IEX, you're going to see that now the rationale for going through that math is the following, so let's take this complex number that goes from here to here. That is explicitly why, and let's introduce just like we would for an ordinary vector, this angle data and that length are

Speaker 1:          00:43:12       whenever they have a vector, you can talk about the Cartesian components, x and y, or we can talk about the length of the vector and the angle it makes. Then it's clear that x physical Arco scientists and why our scientist over data is now an angle associated with a complex number which tells you at what angle is located and art is the length of the complex numbers. So it's called a polar form of the complex number. Then you can see that Z, which is x, bless I, why is it going to our claims go signed data plus ice signed data, which you can know, right? This are fine. Eat the ice data. That's why we did all that work. To tell you that a complex number can be written in this form.

Speaker 1:          00:44:00       You can either write it as explicit, why artists audio with the data. They both talk about the same number one prox about how much real partner, how many imaginary part it has other way of writing. It talks about how long the vector is and at what angled it is located containing the same information so that od is equal to if the inverse of this formula is that are just square root of x squared plus y square and Taito. Yes, 10 in verse. Why are would x, in other words, Stan data y over x. This is why this is rex.

Speaker 2:          00:44:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:39       Now the advantage of writing a complex number in polar form is the following. Suppose I give you two complex numbers. Xe One is odd one either the ITA One and z. Two is art to eat the right data to the product. Z One z two is very easy to calculate in this form because r one r two multiplied to give you this and the exponential is combined. It's a lot easier to multiply them in this form. Then when I multiplied them somebody to hear see threaded in this Cartesian form. It's a big mess in polar formative it easy little list. If you want to multiply two numbers multiplied the lengths to get the length of the new number and add that angles to get the angle of the product. So what I'm telling you is that if z one looks like this guy with some angle theta one and z two is that gave with an angle data to the numberZ one z two has the length equals the product of these two langues and an angle equal the sum of these two angles. So it will look like that. Do go from this to that. You multiply the lengths and you add the angles. So the polar farm is very well suited for multiplying and it's even better suited for dividing. If I say, give me z one over z two

Speaker 2:          00:46:03       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:46:03       well look, we can all do that in your head. It's our one, either the data one divided by r two either the right data to the modulus of the new number is just r one over r two and how broad this eat the Ita one divided by e to the I data too dividing by either the [inaudible]. Same as multiplying by either the minus I Taito. So this is really the, I did a one minus data's too.

Speaker 2:          00:46:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:33       So I'm assuming you guys can figure this part out. One over Edi theater. It's the same as either the minus I data. Well, if you don't mean multiply, Cross multiply and all I'm telling you is that one equals the [inaudible], which you know is true when you combined the angles. So when you got to the, I take her downstairs, you can take it upstairs with the reverse angle. That's a useful trick. I hope you will remember that. Useful trick.

Speaker 1:          00:47:07       So that is one part of this thing that I wanted to carry in your head because very, very important. When you take a complex number, he's got a length and it's got a direction. When you multiply a second by second complex number, you're able to do two things at the same time. You're able to rescale it, they'd be able to rotate it. You'd be scaled by the length of second factor and you rotate by the angle carried by the second fight. The fact that two operations are done in one shot is the reason complex numbers play an incredibly important role in physics and certainly in engineering and mathematical physics.

Speaker 1:          00:47:55       Okay. Uh, I'm going to now change gears, but I want to stop a little bit and answered any questions any of you have. So how many people have seen all of this before? I see. So if you saw something you saw the whole thing would look, that's not such a big number. So I am cognizant of the fact that not many of you have seen it, but you will have to go and learn this today. I'm going to post the problem set for this some time in the day so you can start practicing. Don't weight problems has nothing to do with next Wednesday. It has a lot to do with today. I'm going to ask Santa problem today. I imagine you're going, uh, breathlessly you're out your room, not able to wait, jumping into the problem set and working it out because that's the only way you're going to find out what these things mean.

Speaker 1:          00:48:44       If you've never seen them, I've seen them before in high school route taken a math course and you've got lots of practice then I'm not talking to you, but I'm going to use this at some point. So you should understand complex numbers. And I'm telling you there are very few branches of any science where complex numbers will not be used. Or You may not believe this now, but that is true. They make even an electrical engineer. Absolute must. I have to solve any kind of differential equation which cannot occur in biology and chemistry. That's a must. So it was very, very important. All right, so now I'm going to do, I'm going back to physics. No, laying back from mathematics to physics. And the physics of this topic for today has to do with something very different from the past. So forget all relativity. Now you're going back to Newtonian days.

Speaker 1:          00:49:38       Kinetic energy is one half Mv Square. That's a little difficult to go back and forget what you learned the other hand. For some of you it may not be so hard. If you didn't learn anything, then you're that much ahead of the other guys. Okay, but so I remember now the truth is that a little cubistic theory, we're going to go back to Newtonian days and the reason we do it that way is to give you something interesting. A hopefully compared to what you normally do. So what were you going to study now is what's called small oscillations are simple harmonic motion. It's a ubiquitous fact that if he took any mechanical system, which is in a state of equilibrium and they give it a little kick, it vibrates. And if you've got a pillar ceiling to Florida, hit it with a hammer. It vibrates. If you take a gong and he hit, it also vibrates.

Speaker 1:          00:50:30       If you gotta a rod hanging from the ceiling through a pivot, it's hanging that if you pull it, it goes back and forth. The standard example. Everyone likes to use this. If you got a particle in a ball, it's very happy sitting in the bottom. If you push it up a little bit, it'll go back and forth and the example that we are going to consider is the following. If you have a mass am connected to a spring and the spring is not stretched, our contracted, it's very happy to be there. That's what I mean. But equilibrium equilibrium means the body has all the forces on it, adding up to zero. It has no desire to move. The question is if you give it a little kick, what'll happen? Well, there are two situations you can have. You can have a situation where a particle is on top of the hill, let's call unstable equilibrium because if you give that a kick is going to come down and now going to turn to you. That's equilibrium but unstable equilibrium. I'm talking about stable equilibrium. That's because they're the restoring forces. If you stray away from the equilibrium, there are forces bringing you back and in the case of the mass in spring system, the force m d two m a is equal to minus k x. And what is the equation tells you is if you're straight to the right, x is positive. I love play a force to the left. Remember this is Emma and this is f f efforts such that it always sends you back to your normal position.

Speaker 1:          00:52:06       So we want to understand the behavior of such a problem. You want to solve this problem?

Speaker 2:          00:52:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:13       So how do you solve this problem? Well, I did it for you long back when they gave you a typical paradigm for how you apply Newton's laws. I gave you this example, so I'm going to go through it somewhat fast. Our job is to find the function x that satisfies this equation and we would like to write it as follows. A D two x over DT square is equal to minus Omega squared x, but Omega Square, it's in shorthand for Omega is the shorthand for square root of k or whatever. By the way, I'm using big x and small lakes like crazy. So it's this small likes. I don't mean anything significant between this and this. They're all the same. If you want you can take this.

Speaker 2:          00:52:57       Pardon me?

Speaker 1:          00:53:01       Yeah, this is Kay and this guy is k and other equations do you use, just follow the lecture today. These are all the same. Okay, so don't say what happened there when he moved from one to the other. All right, so what did I say we should do? You can make it a word problem. Let's say I am looking for a function, which one I take to derivatives looks like minus itself exit for this number and we just saw that today. The trigonometric functions, the property that you take to deliberative, they returned to miners themselves. So you can take a guess. That exit looks like co-signed t but it won't work. Then I showed you before so I'm not going to go through that again. You could do this. Yes, but it was his ex is not in number is x is a function of time. If you took this function of time in fact or basis equation provided, the Omega that you put in is the Omega that's in the equation. Why? Because tape take two derivatives. First let me get minus Omega Sine Omega at the second time you get minus Omega squared cost and make a tea with me and says minus Omega squared times the Ux itself and is whatever you like. Then I said let's plot this guy and then you plot this guy. It looks like this is the amplitude.

Speaker 1:          00:54:36       What does Omega Well Omega is related to the time or the frequency of oscillations as follows. If I start with the t equals zero where the x is equal to a how long do I have to wait till I come back to a, I think everybody should know that I have to wait a time. Capital t so that Omega Times t is too fine cause that's when the costs and returns to one. That means the time that you have to wait is two Pi over omega. You can see Omega is two Pi over t it can also write it as two Pi Times frequency, but frequency is what you and I would call frequency. How many oscillations that desperate second. That's the inverse of the time period.

Speaker 1:          00:55:22       So if you pull a mass and you let it go, it oscillates with the frequency we just connected with the forest constant and the mass. If the spring is very stiff and Kay's video, large frequency is very high. If the mass is very big in the motion is very sluggish and is diminished. So all this stuff comes out of the equation. One ready to marketable part of the equation is that you can pick any air you like. Think about what that means. What does the meaning of a is the Amanay with you pulled it when you let it go, you are told whether you pull the spring by one inch Arba tenancies the time it takes to finish a full back and forth motion is independent of a this frequency he has independent they yes,

Speaker 2:          00:56:12       small.

Speaker 1:          00:56:15       This d here, here at that. Ah, very good. That's correct. So let's be careful the stip t, this is a particular time capital t.

Speaker 2:          00:56:26       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:56:32       so that a marketable property of simple harmonic motion is that the amplitude does not determine the time period. If you pull it by two inches compared to one inch, it's got a long way to go. But because you pulled it by two inches, the spring is going to be that much more cans and it's going to exert a bigger force so that it'll go faster for the most of the time. That's very clear what the fact that it goes faster than exactly the right way to complete the trip at the same time as rather miraculous property up. The fact that this equation has this particular form, if you had tampered with this, if you add to this a little bit like one over a hundred times x cubed and all these bets are off, it's gotta be that equation for that result to be true. Okay, so this is simple harmonic motion.

Speaker 1:          00:57:21       Then you can do the following variant of this solution, which I will write down. Now suppose, uh, I set my clock to zero right there. You set your clock to zero yet, but I can say, you know what, I just got up and I'm looking at the mass. I set my clock to zero. When it hits zero, it's not at the maximum, but it's the same physics. It's the same equation. And that really comes from the fact that we had one more latitude here of adding a certain number, Phi, which is called the phase the oscillator.

Speaker 2:          00:57:56       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:57:57       whatever you pick, four or five, the it'll still work. And what did you pick for capital aid and still work? So whenever you have an Oscillator, namely a mass in spring system, and you want to know what is x is going to be at all times, you need to somehow determine the amplitude and the fish. I want you to know that you can calculate exit all future times. So let me give you an example. Suppose an oscillator has x equaled the five and velocity equals zero, uh, t equal to zero. What does that mean? I pulled it by five and then let it go is I tell you the spring constant care and I tell you the mass and I said watch the future of X. You've got to come back to this equation and you got to say five equals a course sine of zero plus fi and how about the velocity?

Speaker 1:          00:58:53       Velocity is supposed to be zero let us minus Omega a sign or make a t plus fi but t is zero so that tells me zero is minus Omega. A signed Phi Omega is not, zero is not zero. That four signed five zero that means five zero you get rid of that. So the subsequent motion is x equal the five core sine Omega t. This is a problem we had. We did not need fi, but it could have been that when you join the experiment, you are somewhere here than the masses actually moving. Then I would say at d equals zero velocity was some other number, maybe six. Then you've got to go back and write two equations. One Fedex, take the date of it. Dude, it looks like this and instead of putting zero, you put six, you've got two unknowns, a and Fi, you've got to juggle them around.

Speaker 1:          00:59:49       You've got to solve for a and five given these two numbers, simple exercise to solve for them and when you do, you have completely fit the problem. In other words, simply to be told, a mass is connected to the spring of [inaudible] mass enforced constant. It's not enough to determine the future of the spray. You have to be told, for example, if nobody pulled the mass, it just want to sit there forever. If you pulled it by 10 it's going to go back and forth from 10 to minus 10 so you have to be told further information to nail down these two numbers. They're called free parameters and the solution on the other hand, no matter how much you pulled it and Javiera listed this Omega and therefore the frequency are not variable. Yes,

Speaker 2:          01:00:32       any time start it.

Speaker 1:          01:00:37       If you started at rest, indeed it will be zero because the velocity at t equals zero is minus Omega a sign fi do you want to kill that? The only way is by equal to zero. You could put five with the pie if you like, but if you put zero that'll do.

Speaker 1:          01:00:55       Okay, so this is the elementary parts of this thing and I already told you the following things. If x of t is equal to a cause, Omega t let's put Phi equals zero in other words it'd be like agree that since there's only one oscillator it is perverse to set your clock to zero at any time other than when the oscillator is at one extreme point. If there are two oscillators oscillating out of step, it's impossible to make five zero for both of them because if you can sync your clock when one of them said the maximum, that may not be when the other one said at maximum but with one oscillator but she was fine other than zero is perverse. It's like saying I'm doing a project title problem. I'll pick the place where the line to predict tile to be x equal to y equals zero you can pick some other crazy origin but it doesn't help so we'll assume fire zero in this problem.

Speaker 1:          01:01:49       If that is x, what is velocity at time t take the data to with this you get minus Omega a sine Omega t that means the is also isolating. Sane is finally, but the amplitude for Oscillation is Omega Times a. So a is the range of variation for x we'll make at time say is that the intubation for velocity. Lastly, we'll go all the way through. Plus Omega I minus Omega a, the acceleration, which is one more bit of it too is minus Omega squared. A cost to make a tea, which is really minus Omega Square Times exit. So so the amplitude for isolation for the accelerations Omega squared times eight, so I think you should understand if will make us very large, they end the velocity will have very big excursions and the acceleration will live even bigger excursions because the range of this AI really means if you plot x is going to look like this going from a two minus eight this is if you plot the velocity is going to look like this. The and we'll go from Omega a minus Omega a. If you plot the acceleration will go from Omega squared eight to minus Omega squared away.

Speaker 1:          01:03:07       Last thing you want to verify is the law of conservation of energy. I think I mentioned this Dubai and I studied energy but let me repeat one more time. If you take in this problem, one half NBS where plus one half k x square. I did that for you. You can also verify this. Okay. Uh, one half k x squared is going to involve [inaudible] squared. Omega t one half MV squared is going to involve something, something, something science where Omega t and by magic the science squared and costs and squared will have the same coefficient. So you can use the identity to set that equal to one and get an answer that does not depend on time. That's the beauty. Even though position and velocity are constantly changing, this combination, if you crank it out, will not depend on time. And what can it possibly be if it doesn't depend on time. I can calculate it whenever I like. So let me go to the incident. When the mass is reached one extremity and this our board to swing back at that instant, it has no velocity. It's only has an x which is equal to the amplitude of motion. So that's the energy of an isolator. One half k square. When x is when V is equal to zero x, it'll be plus or minus a or any other intermediate point. You can find the velocity. If you could give me the x, we did that too.

Speaker 1:          01:04:32       So this is all I want to say about the linear oscillator. Well, let me mention to you another kind of oscillation which is very interesting. The subways, you suspend a rod from the ceiling like this. It's sagging that if you give it a twist then it'll go twisting back and forth like that. That's also simple harmonic motion except watch wedding with time is not linear coordinate, but the angle taper by which that artists being twisted. What's the equation in this case equation here is I need to take over d d square. You guys remember? No, that's the analog of m a. That's going to be equal to the torque.

Speaker 2:          01:05:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:27       Now what will happen in the problems we consider is if data is a small number in the torque will be such that it brings you back to today equals to zero. So this number will be approximately equal to minus some number kappa times state.

Speaker 2:          01:05:48       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:05:48       just the analog of Buenos Kx little k was the restoring force divided by the displacement which produced a distorting force. Literally Kappa is the starting torque divided with the angle at which you twisted it to get that torque. So this isn't always true for small oscillations. Since towel vanishes that [inaudible] equal to zero, it will look like some number of times data if you like. It's the tailor CDs for Tau for small angles.

Speaker 2:          01:06:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:18       If you knew this kappa, you are done because mathematically this equation is the same as MD two x over Dt squares minus Kx Good Omega for this guy will be square root of kappa over the eye. You can steal the whole answer because mathematically mathematicians don't care if you're talking about data. If you're talking about ex, uh, if you compare this equation and this equation MD two x over detainee square, you pulled the minus kappa minus Kx. If the Omega there was root of k over them, the Omega here will be route of kappa over I. So you may be thinking what, give me an example where told looks like capital times status. So I'm going to give you that example. So that example is going to be the following. A simple pendulum take a pendulum like this. It's got a mass m, it's got some length. L is hanging from the ceiling. They said rigid rod, not a string, but a rigid massless rod and the mass numbers at the bottom. So it's happy to hang like this, but suppose you give it a kick so you push it over there, do an angle theta, which is whatever you like.

Speaker 1:          01:07:55       What is the Torque in this particular case, let's find out the force is AMG and the angle between the forest and you're trying to do rotations around this point. This angle here is the same data. So torque is really minus m g l science data. That's the formula for Torque is the force times the distance of the lever arm or the distance over which you, the forces from the rotation axis times the sine of the angle between the direction of the force and the direction of the separation. So the equation of motion for the pendulum, but it really is the following I need to take over. D D Square is equal to minus N G L sine theta.

Speaker 1:          01:08:51       No, we cannot do business with this equation. This equation is a famous equation, but you and I don't know how to solve it with what we know. But we have learned even earlier today. Look at the formula for scion x saying next begins with x minus x cubed over three factorial and so on. So if data is small venue midnight, there's AMG l data. So for small angles, scientists data in the restoring torque in fact is linear in the coordinate, the angular coordinate. So by comparison, now we know that this fellow is Sour Kappa Kappa far the pendulum is MGL. So cap, I may not be universal in every problem. In each problem you got to find kappa. You find that by moving the system, offer equilibrium, finding the restoring torque. And if you're doing it right, they're starting. Torque will always look like something, something, something time state everything. Multiplying data is our kappa. So let's know, calculate Omega. What does simple pendulum I'm showing you. This is kappa over I and Kappa was what? M G L and what's I?

Speaker 2:          01:10:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:10:04       It's equal to moment to finish your of this mass out on this point that artists massless for the single point mass. We know the moment of inertia has just an times elsewhere. Do you find Omega is equal to the square root of g or what l and that is two Pi over t so you get back. The famous formula I learned Ti is two Pi Square root of l over g. This is the audit done up. The formula you learn in school, it comes from small oscillations of a pendulum. So think about this problem. If you pull the pendulum by an angle, so a large, that scientist has no longer approximated but data, but you need a that you build with a six term, it can happen for large enough data. Then the equation to solve is no longer this. And what that means is if you took a real pendulum massless rod and a Bob at the end, the time it takes to finish in isolation in fact will depend on the amplitude.

Speaker 1:          01:11:11       The only for small oscillations when synthetic can be approximated. But data, you will find whether you'd do that oscillation or that oscillation. The time is the same. But if you go too far, the other terms in scientists that will kick in and the result is no longer true. It a pendulum in fact is not just a function of l and g also function or the amplitude only for small amplitudes. You get this marvelous resolve. This one problem I want you to think about. Uh, I may do it myself. [inaudible] I think you should try to read up on it and I will try to explain it next time, which is the following. I will give the problem to you and I will do it for you next time. I want you to think about it. Here's a hoop, like a hula hoop is hanging on the wall with a nail and there's very happy to be wedded to this. Now I come and give it a little push. You'll start oscillating, look like that and sometime later it'll look like that. It's going back and forth. Your job is to find the Omega for that Hoop.

Speaker 2:          01:12:19       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12:21       So you move it a little bit and you find the restoring Torque, then you're done. But you got to do two things, right? To get the right answer. You've got to find a moment to finish. You have a circular loop, not around the center, but I don't own a point on the circumference. So you guys know the magic. Where do you gotta use parallel axes? Theorem and defined? The restoring to here is the part that blows everybody's mind, was that when the loop goes to that position, where does gravity acting? Gravity's acting at the center of mass. Center of mass is somewhere here in the middle of the loop. Even though there is no matter there. So center of mass off a body need not lay on the body. That ring is a perfect example. So if you remember, the center of mass of the loop isn't the center of the loop and put the AMG there, you will get the right target and everything will just fall.

Speaker 2:          01:13:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:13:14       By the way, my offer is always open. If there's something about the class, uh, you want to, and you find this hard, does that you can always write to me, okay, you can, I want your feedback because I just don't know which parts that easy, which parts are hard, which are slow, which are fast. Or if you haven't had enough math and you need some help, so send me some email and I will try my best to answer that.
