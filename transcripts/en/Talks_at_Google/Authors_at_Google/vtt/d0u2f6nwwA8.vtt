CLIFF: Welcome, good afternoon.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.790
Today for Talks at Google
we're very thrilled to have two

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.450
thought leaders from the
Council on Foreign Relations.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.200
They're here to discuss their
latest book, "By All Means

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.850
Necessary: How China's Resource
Quest is Changing the World."

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.610
And so the economic
expansion in China

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.050
is pretty well documented
in the press and news,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.140
but behind it is
a quest for fuel,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.690
or water, and even
land for farming.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.040
And so this book outlines
the ramifications

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.950
behind this massive undertaking.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.390
So we have actually Elizabeth
Economy, the CV star Senior

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.240
Fellow and Director
for Asian Studies

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.790
at the Council on
Foreign Relations.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.350
She's also Vice Chair of the
World Economic Forum's Global

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.490
Agenda Council on
the Future of China,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.480
and she serves on the Board
of the China US Center

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.890
for Sustainable development.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.900
So coming in from the
China prospective.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.930
And also we have Michael Levi,
the David M. Rubenstein Senior

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.180
Fellow for Energy and in
the Environment at the CFR.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.860
And he works primarily on
energy security and climate

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.610
change as well as
nuclear terrorism.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.830
So from arms control
to sustainability,

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.430
they're true experts
in their fields.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.510
We'll also have time
for a Q&amp;A at the end.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.171
But for now, please join me
in welcoming them to Google.

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:12.670
Thanks.

00:01:15.787 --> 00:01:16.870
ELIZABETH ECONOMY: Thanks.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.640
Thanks very much, Cliff.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.223
It's really a pleasure
for me and Mike

00:01:19.223 --> 00:01:21.550
to have the opportunity
to be here at Google

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.140
to share with you our research
on our new book "By All Means

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.540
Necessary: How china's Resource
Quest is Changing the World."

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.100
There were a number of
reasons why Mike and I decided

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.820
to undertake this project.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.220
But chief among
them was our sense

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.120
that we're in the midst of one
of the great transformative

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.560
processes of our time.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.750
Namely, the rise of China.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.360
And yet we have only a
limited understanding

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.660
of what that rise means
for the global economy,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.560
for governance, and for
international security.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.150
And so we decided to
look at one of the issues

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.490
that we believe is really
at the heart of this rise.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.040
Namely, China's resource quest.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.720
Its effort to secure resources
from outside its borders

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.270
in order to fuel
its economic growth.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.100
Certainly there's
been a lot of hype

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.130
in the media
surrounding this issue.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.530
China can be either the
savior of the global economy,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.020
or the scourge of good
global governance,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.580
or it's undermining
international security

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.050
because of its willingness to do
business anywhere at any time.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.840
But Mike and I decided we wanted
to look behind the headlines

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.850
and really explore the
reality of the issues.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.270
And so we looked at four
different sets of commodities.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.410
Oil and gas, water,
land, and minerals.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.910
And we looked throughout
the developing world

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.330
in Southeast Asia, and
Africa, Latin America,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.390
and also in resource rich
advanced industrialized

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.900
countries like the United
States, Canada, and Australia.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.560
And what we found I think
speaks to sort of six

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.680
generally held
assumptions or one

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.150
might call them myths
about this resource quest.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.110
And so we're each going
to talk about a couple

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.330
of these myths for
about 25 to 30 minutes.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.080
And then we're going
to welcome obviously

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.220
your comments and
your questions.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.060
So first, sort of
commonly held assumption--

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.110
perhaps the most basic one--
is that China's resource quest

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.530
is unprecedented in history.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.820
And on the face of it, if
you look at the numbers,

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.070
it is quite striking.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.940
I mean China commands
upwards of 30%, 40%, even 50%

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.180
of global supply of zinc,
iron, nickel, coal, lead.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.020
So clearly its impact on
global resource supply demand

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.670
is profound.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.870
Yet when we look
back through history,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.440
we find that China is
really simply following

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.820
a trajectory that has
occurred time and again.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.720
And in fact that all
rising great powers

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.270
have sought resources
outside their borders

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.690
to grow their economy.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.810
Going back to
ancient Athens, which

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.690
went outside of its borders
to get timber and corn.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.230
Certainly the United
States sought resources

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.300
from outside its borders.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.426
And most recently, Japan.

00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:05.050
Not many of you
probably will remember,

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.620
but perhaps some of you will.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.200
In the early 1970s,
and 1980s, when

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.840
there was a lot of concern
about the rise of Japan.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.240
Interestingly, in
the early 1970s,

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.180
Japan with about
120 million people

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.660
commanded 10% of the
world's oil supply.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.410
And when you look
at China today,

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.190
you see that China
with 1.3 billion people

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.890
commands not much more than
about 12% of the world's oil

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:31.710
supply.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.250
And of course, that speaks
to market supply and demand

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.630
and Mike's going to talk
a lot more about that.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.990
But I think it gives
you some context

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.540
to understand that while
China's rise is quite striking,

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.940
it's not necessarily
unprecedented.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.320
And it's not an unprecedented
in terms of China's own history

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.760
because if you
look back thousands

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.480
of years-- in the book
we really just look back

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.530
about 700 years to
the Ming dynasty--

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.340
you see that many of these sort
of governing traits of China's

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.240
resource quest
that we find today

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.720
were present 700 years ago.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.790
Sort of a strong
central directive.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.080
Who can go out for
resources, where you can go,

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.540
what resources you
should be going out for,

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.430
who can profit from
this resource quest.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.040
Many of these things are
sort of deeply rooted

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.620
from 700 years ago.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.360
In addition, a sort
of sense within China

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.770
of insecurity about
its resources,

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.980
particularly when
it comes to grain.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.960
And again we track
this throughout history

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.190
up until today when we find that
some aspects of this insecurity

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.010
are beginning to change.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.380
Nonetheless, I think overall,
we find in this particular case

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.930
that yes, China's rise
and its resource quest

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.660
is certainly changing things,
but it's not unprecedented.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.750
A second thing that
we tackle-- a sort

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.400
of second myth or
common assumption--

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.480
is that Chinese
firms are somehow

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.450
advantaged in their
competition against what

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.110
Western multinationals-- because
of the very strong engagement

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.340
by the Beijing.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.760
And indeed, when you
read the newspaper--

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.730
when you open a
newspaper-- you'll

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.180
see that President
Xi Jinping may

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.770
travel to Africa, or Latin
America, or to Southeast Asia,

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.720
and he'll be accompanied by
a dozen ministers, or state

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.750
owned enterprise heads,
or representatives

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.070
of the major Chinese banks.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.550
And they will propose a sort
of a vast array of trade,

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.270
and aid, and investment deals
as they approach each country.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.790
And it can look to
the outside observer

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.300
as though she is a conductor of
a very finely tuned orchestra.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.800
With each section playing its
part perfectly and in harmony.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.780
But what Mike and I found
is that much less harmony

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.590
and much more
cacophony, in fact.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.590
In many respects this resource
quest is not exactly a proceed

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.560
as we might believe
it from the outside.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.050
So for example, the National
Development and Reform

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.800
Commission-- which is maybe
the composer of the music.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.000
So it's the one that designs
perhaps the broad plan

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
for the trade and aid in
investment for a given

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.892
country-- may lay this plan out.

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:15.850
But then it's up to the
state owned enterprises

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.499
to decide whether or not
they want to participate.

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:20.040
And in many instances
they don't want

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.890
to participate because
they see participation

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.181
as a money losing
endeavor for them.

00:07:25.181 --> 00:07:26.680
And they want to
make money and they

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.890
want to compete on the
international stage.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.600
We also found that
in many cases,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.340
Chinese-- particularly in the
mining sector which is largely

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.070
not state directed--
Chinese go out on their own

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.370
with no direction from Beijing.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.520
So for example, looking back
about a year ago in March,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.350
the [INAUDIBLE] government
told the Chinese,

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.370
look we've got these thousands
of Chinese gold miners,

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.220
and their here
illegally, and they're

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.750
despoiling our environment.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.690
Could you please take
care of this problem.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.980
And Beijing said, well, no.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.460
This is your problem.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.910
We have nothing to do
with all of these miners.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.750
We certainly didn't send
them out or bring them out.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.710
You need to do a
better job of enforcing

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.850
your own laws and
your own regulations.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.600
And come July, Ghana rounded
up all of these miners-- close

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.520
to 5,000 of them--
and kicked them out.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.740
So this was a black
eye for Beijing.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.130
But they had nothing
to do with this part

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.270
of this outward investment
or this resource quest,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.430
yet it reflects
back upon Beijing.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:36.309
Another aspect of
this disaggregation--

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:39.080
this sort of the lack
of coordination--

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.690
is really when you look at what
China proposes for investment

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.670
and how much of
that is realized.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.920
So dating back to
about 2007-- if you've

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.070
been following for example,
the Chinese investments

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:55.350
in Brazil-- it totals about $70
billion which is substantial.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.400
But then you look at
the realized investment,

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.190
and you find out it's
only 30% of that.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.000
And some of that has to do again
with Chinese firms not wanting

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.680
to participate in what the
Chinese government structured,

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.130
and some of that has to do
with the difficulties of doing

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.830
business in Brazil.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.760
And finally, there's the
sense that somehow China's

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.840
got it right.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.850
That all these Chinese
companies are out there

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.150
making all this money.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:20.900
And that's something
else that we've found

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.980
was actually not the case.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.500
In fact, there's a
recent announcement

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.340
by a Chinese mining
official that over 80%

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.480
of Chinese mining investment
overseas is not profitable.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.560
So when we're reading
the newspapers, when

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.555
we're seeing what's
going on with President

00:09:39.555 --> 00:09:43.100
Xi and these gigantic
deals for investment,

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.810
we've discovered that certainly
some of this is taking place.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:50.560
But it's really much
less than meets the eye.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.470
MICHAEL LEVI: Why
don't I pick up there

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.730
and talk a little
bit about economics.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.530
First though, let me
add my thanks to you

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:57.220
all for hosting me.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.761
It's the first time given a talk
with a pool table behind me.

00:09:59.761 --> 00:10:02.760
It's pretty exciting.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.470
I want to talk
first about what's

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.070
happened with the
prices of commodities.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.340
Because that's the way we feel.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.699
China's resource quest,
most directly-- or at least

00:10:13.699 --> 00:10:15.990
it's the way we think we feel
China's resource requests

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.640
most directly-- If you look
out over the last decade,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:25.140
we've seen a far higher prices
for oil, for gas, for minerals.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.960
And the story is not just
that China has driven this.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.760
But that China will continue
to drive us into the future.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.590
That we've only seen the
tip of what's to come

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:40.670
and we'll continually see
ever rising resource prices.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.270
One of the great
things about being

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.710
able to look at China's rise
through this resource quest

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.210
though is that this isn't just
speculation about the future.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.168
We have a track record.

00:10:48.168 --> 00:10:50.290
We can dig in and
ask what have we seen

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.940
and why has it happened.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.310
And when we dig in on these
different commodities,

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.610
we learn some things that
put a lot more nuance

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.070
into the picture.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.620
So yes, without
China, we would not

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.680
have seen these enormous rises.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.360
Particularly for oil,
for iron, or for copper

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.030
that we saw over
the last decade.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.980
But the simple story ends there.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.250
And let me just flag
a couple pieces that

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.330
strike me as a very interesting.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.360
If you look at
forecaster's projections

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.050
for oil prices
around the year 2000.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.730
They basically said we
will have $20 oil forever.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:36.450
The really worried ones
said we will have $30 oil.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.580
But China's rise isn't
what they got wrong.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.610
If you look across
these projections,

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.680
you find that they
were mostly on target

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.360
when it came to rising
Chinese demand for oil.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.050
What they got wrong
was they assumed

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.140
that the rest of the
world would expand

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.910
oil production to respond.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.510
Essentially, as a friendly
gesture to keep prices low.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.340
That Saudi Arabia, and
Iran, and Kuwait, and others

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.050
would play along and keep
prices low for everyone

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.210
by responding to China's rise.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:11.550
What happened in reality,
Chinese consumption grew,

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.240
the supply didn't
respond in this case--

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.880
probably for political
reasons-- and crisis

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.430
had to rise because someone else
had to consume less in order

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:22.890
to make the pieces add up.

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.250
Who end up consuming less?

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.140
Mostly the developed countries.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.160
So here China is
an essential piece

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.090
of the puzzle in
understanding why prices rose,

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.510
but you can't
understand what happened

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:37.530
without looking at how
the other parts fit in.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:41.260
You have a similar story
on the iron ore front.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.540
When you look at the rise
of China as a consumer,

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.520
it's enormous.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.860
But in principle,
global iron ore supplies

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.530
can rise to catch up.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.170
The issue there is that
it takes a long time.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.950
And that's the case for a lot
of investment other resources,

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:55.660
too.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.560
You can't simply turn
on the tap overnight.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.340
It takes a long time to plan
new mines, to execute them,

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.780
to get political buy-in
the countries where

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.580
those are being developed.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.750
And in the interim, prices
can go through the roof.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:13.240
And that's what we've seen in
that case, a lag in the ability

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:18.089
of the big suppliers
to catch up.

00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:20.380
There's another piece that's
worth paying attention to.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.160
Because even though
we've seen the price

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.320
rises in a lot of places, we
haven't seen them everywhere.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.200
So when you look at aluminum for
example, the price of aluminum

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.980
has not gone up
nearly as much as it

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.730
has for some of these
other resources.

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:33.960
Why?

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.340
Because the market was
already on the upswing.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.142
There was already a lot of
anticipated growth in demand.

00:13:39.142 --> 00:13:40.600
Not just from
developing countries,

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.050
but developed
countries for things

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.140
like lighter frames
for automobiles

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.760
to become more efficient
and pieces like that.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.670
You also saw the market--
this particular market-- more

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.960
flexible and more
easily able to respond.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.860
And on the food front,
you saw big price rises,

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.480
but if you drill down there
are a host of other drivers.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.980
A lot of other developing
countries with rapidly growing

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.260
food demand, some
severe droughts

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.470
that cut into supply, and on
top of that political reactions

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.140
to some of those developments
that intensified the price

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:11.640
impacts.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.740
When we look out at the
future, all of those dynamics

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.290
need to come into play.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.820
What we're seeing in particular
is the system start to respond.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.730
Both outside of China
and inside of it.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.860
We've seen a lot more effort
to become more efficient

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:29.960
in our use of resources.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.820
In general, slowing
the growth of demand.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.710
Not reversing it,
but slowing it.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.800
We've seen the
supply side respond.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.750
So if you look in oil
and gas for example,

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.140
enormous transformations
in technology

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.910
that have allowed a
lot more production.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.110
Not at the kinds
of $20 prices we

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.320
saw or expected a decade
ago, but without having

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.270
to go from 20 to 100 and then
to 200 and 300 and so on.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.520
So the system is
starting to respond.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.030
And again I'd emphasize
particularly in China,

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.860
not only through
adoption of technology,

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.220
but through an effort to shift
the sources of Chinese growth,

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.780
to rebalance the economy
happening in fits and starts.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.450
Certainly not accomplished yet
but responses across the board

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.480
that I think limit
the big potential

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.884
for really large
increases in resource

00:15:15.884 --> 00:15:17.300
prices due to China
in the future.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.120
We're not going back
to the year 2000,

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.640
but we're probably not going
to repeat the last decade

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.587
all over again either.

00:15:24.587 --> 00:15:26.420
So that's one side of
the economics picture.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.080
What's the price?

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.340
The other side is in
some ways a deeper--

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.330
and if you look at a decade
ago-- more troubling.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.580
And that's this question of
whether markets will continue

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.430
to dominate the way we allocate
resources the way we trade.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.930
The way we decide who gets
what around the world.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.490
And the reason that
markets are important

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.100
is because they let you take
politics out of the equation.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.960
So is it bad to pay more
for oil or for ores?

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.680
Sure.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.580
It's a lot worse to have
to fight wars over them.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.220
If you are allocating
things politically.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.070
And a decade ago, that's what
the big claims about China

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:02.710
were.

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:06.310
China is going to take us away
from a market-based system

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.870
which has tended to prevail
and toward a political system--

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:13.480
a mercantilist system-- where
you use at best politics

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.470
and at worst force to
allocate the world's

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.850
supply of resources.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.920
This is the sort of world that
developed before World War II

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.170
and we know that
didn't end well.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.570
So what's the decade
of experience tell us?

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.440
What it tells us is
that not only has China

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.700
been remarkably
unsuccessful in transforming

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.110
the world to a different
system, it actually-- and not

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.080
on purpose-- but in some
cases, has actually moved it

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.980
to a more flexible, more
market-based, less political

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.010
system than it was in before.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.240
Let me tell you a
few reasons why.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.990
But let me start by
flagging the exceptions.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.300
The big exception the
stands out is rare earths.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:58.660
That's because China has a
dominant market position.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.990
95% of global rare
earth production.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.580
Starting to shift gradually,
but those responses are slow.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:07.520
So when China controls the vast
majority of what's out there,

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.270
it's able to make the
market work differently.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:14.829
But in most cases, China doesn't
control the vast majority

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:15.920
of what's out there.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.960
There are other
places where it looks

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.400
like China is
controlling everything,

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.319
but that's mostly superficial.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:26.190
So do you see a huge volume
of iron ore being produced

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.020
in mines that China has
relationships with and sent

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.200
back to China?

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.420
Yes.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.840
But that's not
necessarily so exciting.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.580
You don't need to
depart from markets

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.050
to have a lot of copper or
iron sent back to China.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:42.030
All you need is the fact that
China is a dominant consumer

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.870
of these resources
around the world.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.650
Even if others were
producing them,

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.790
they would be making
their way back to China.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.800
In the iron ore piece, most
of the world's iron ore market

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.900
is structured around
vertically integrated firms.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.730
You own the mine upstream,
you produce, you send it

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.852
to your steel mills downstream.

00:17:58.852 --> 00:18:00.310
And Chinese companies
in that sense

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:04.890
are no different from
how others have behaved.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.510
On the oil front-- where I
think most of the controversy

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.720
has come-- people
worried about China

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.800
buying equity oil-- investing
in oil around the world--

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.290
and then shipping it back home.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:18.090
In some sense, taking it
away from the global market.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:21.810
What you find out when
you drill down on this

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.070
is that the bulk
of Chinese equity

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.650
oil-- the bulk of
Chinese produced

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.010
oil-- is not shipped
back to China.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.030
It's shipped on to
the global market.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.420
And it's not shipped to China's
favorite political partners.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.860
There's a guy in
London or New York

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.360
that the Chinese company
hires, and they trade it

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.080
just like they do any
other source of oil

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.280
to the highest bidder.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.320
There are even places in China's
periphery in Central Asia that

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.600
have pipelines going
straight into China.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.120
They will sell it into other
pipelines going elsewhere

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.840
if that's where the profits lie.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.470
Let me give you one last
piece where China in some ways

00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.380
accidentally encouraged
the creation of a market,

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:01.300
and that's iron ore.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.490
I'll tell you in the
list of different things

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.550
that surprised me when we
were writing this book.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.440
The biggest is
that I've ended up

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.280
finding iron ore
really interesting.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.740
I never really anticipated that.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.310
It turns out-- I know
you'll be shocked--

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.960
iron ore is a kind of
an interesting world.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.360
Until a few years ago, there
were three big companies

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.730
that controlled most of the
world's iron ore markets.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:26.040
They sat down with the
biggest buyer in Japan,

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.750
they had a little
negotiation among them,

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.630
they picked a price,
and then everyone

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:33.720
had to agree to use that price
for the entire next year.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.310
That's not the
kind of marketplace

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.686
we're used to using.

00:19:36.686 --> 00:19:38.060
China, when it
came on the scene,

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.990
said, this is a good system.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.400
We can be that guy in the
room instead of the Japanese.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.210
We'll get an even
better deal out of them,

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.560
and this will work
out well for us.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.070
What happened
though, was you had--

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:49.380
and this goes to Liz's point.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.850
It's not all about
the state-- you

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:56.350
had huge numbers of small steel
mills scattered around China

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.880
all trying to do
their own thing.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.640
They didn't want
to play that game.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.190
They went out, whether
the state like it or not,

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.250
and bought their iron
ore at whatever price

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:05.680
they could get it at.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.800
And over time, that built
up into a large market.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.570
And when the world went through
the financial crisis in 2008,

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:16.510
and there was an enormous amount
of turmoil in the markets,

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.150
people started to say, we don't
like this political negotiating

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:19.690
system.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.110
We don't like this every
year changing thing.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.946
They said, well,
there's a market.

00:20:24.946 --> 00:20:25.820
It's being developed.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.270
Not on purpose, but
by accident by all

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.300
of these entrepreneurial
Chinese firms.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.390
And they shifted to that.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:32.848
And today-- a few
years later-- you

00:20:32.848 --> 00:20:34.790
have a fundamentally
transformed market,

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:38.350
a lot less political power
involved, a lot more open

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.019
trade.

00:20:39.019 --> 00:20:40.810
The kind of thing that's
good for economies

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:44.022
but also good for
international security.

00:20:44.022 --> 00:20:47.770
ELIZABETH ECONOMY: So if prices
are one of the flash points

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:50.110
and sort of the
media headlines when

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:53.420
it comes to China's
quest for resources,

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.250
the other is probably
China's impact

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.550
on the ground in the countries
where it's doing investing.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:03.300
So what is China doing in terms
of the environment, and labor,

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.950
and just good governance,
corruption, and transparency?

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:11.900
So what we've taken away from
actually pretty detailed set

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:16.110
of cases and research
studies on this front,

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.670
is that the best way to
understand China's impact

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.530
abroad, is really
to look at what

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.840
China's doing on the home front.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.830
So for example, if
we can look at China

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:29.150
today and the pollution
catastrophe that it's facing.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.940
In part, that's because
a lot of Chinese firms

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.619
don't undertake environmental
impact assessments

00:21:34.619 --> 00:21:35.660
and they're not enforced.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.451
Well you know what.

00:21:36.451 --> 00:21:39.750
When Chinese firms go to
Zambia, oftentimes they also

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.980
don't undertake environmental
impact assessments.

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:47.520
So China tends to do abroad
what it's doing at home.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.800
On the labor front, there
were a number of issues

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.630
that we discovered that were
somewhat problematic in terms

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.480
of Chinese investment.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.630
Whether we're looking at
Papua New Guinea or Peru,

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.070
miners there tended to complain
that Chinese mining practices

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.910
were sort of bottom
of the barrel when

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.670
it comes to labor and safety.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.270
In some cases, it
was absolutely true.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.800
In most cases, it was true.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.080
But in some cases, there
are also other Western firms

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.620
that were bottom of
the barrel as well.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.970
But by and large you did
not find Chinese firms

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:21.570
who were acting to raise
labor and safety practices.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.840
So basically, on the pay
front and on the safety front,

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.550
Chinese firms were below par.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:28.680
This is not surprising.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:32.610
That mining industry in China
is one of the most dangerous

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:33.540
in the world.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.880
More mine fatalities per
capita than anywhere else

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.720
in the world.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.520
So again, not surprising to
find that when Chinese mining

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.370
companies go abroad, they're
bringing those same practices.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.890
In terms of governance and
transparency in corruption,

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:51.400
one of the interesting trips
that I took was to Brazil.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.340
And I met with a
lot of officials

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.910
there who were dealing
with a vast number

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:57.370
of Chinese delegations.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.650
Who were going to Brazil
to invest in land.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.446
They wanted to buy land-- which
eventually became impossible

00:23:03.446 --> 00:23:05.070
for a set of different
reasons but they

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.610
wanted to buy land--
mostly to grow soybeans.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.320
And the Brazilian officials
said when these delegations come

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.440
here, they basically think
that we officials can simply

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.340
sign away the land.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.680
They come to us and say OK,
we want to do this deal.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.990
Just sign on the dotted line.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.200
But of course, that's
not the way things work.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.350
But in China, that
is the way it works.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.100
Land deals are done
between local officials

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.750
and local businesses in the
back room illegally expropriated

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:32.310
land.

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.370
And that's why illegal
land expropriation

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:37.330
is one of the largest
sources of social unrest--

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:41.780
of the 180,000 or more protests
now that China faces annually.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.850
So again, what we see
on the home front,

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.840
is largely what we see
China doing abroad.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.490
But the story doesn't end there.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.820
And it can have a much
more positive ending.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.530
And that's something
we also discovered

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.440
in the course of our research
which is to the extent

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.820
now that China is
beginning to develop better

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.880
corporate social
responsibility practices.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.510
It's going to be
exporting those as well.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.920
There's pressure coming from
Beijing itself on Chinese firms

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.890
to do a better job.

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.170
So they're putting in place
laws and regulations that

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.160
say, if you don't undertake
an environmental impact

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.130
assessment in Zambia,
you're not going

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.370
to get any money from
China [INAUDIBLE] Bank.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:25.240
Or you can't go public on
the Shenzhen stock exchange

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.740
if you have some sort of
environmental black mark

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.244
against your firm.

00:24:29.244 --> 00:24:31.160
So they're starting to
put in some regulations

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:31.900
and strictures.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.160
I would say spottily enforced,
just as they are spottily

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.430
enforced on the home front.

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:37.990
But nonetheless,
this is the trend

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:39.810
within the Chinese
government is to begin

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:43.350
to hold these Chinese
firms to a higher standard.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.880
We also find the Chinese
firms themselves often

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.320
want to do a better job.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.630
They want to compete against
Western multinationals.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.700
They want to be
world-class companies.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.120
And they learn from each other.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.140
So in Peru, for example,
we saw that early entrance

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.640
into the mining industry--
early Chinese entrance-- really

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.320
work bottom of the barrel.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.400
And for 10 or more
decades, these firms

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.330
continue to have
protests against them

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:12.080
from Peruvian miners and local
people-- local communities.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.240
But gradually, later
Chinese entrance-- later

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.300
Chinese mining
firms have learned.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.190
They hire Western CEOs, or
they hire local Peruvians

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.250
to help with
community relations,

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:25.810
they hire outside firms
to do environmental impact

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:29.380
assessments-- real environmental
and social impact assessments.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:34.300
So again, beginning to transform
the way that they do business

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.340
as a result of wanting
themselves to be world class

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.840
competitors.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.500
And I think it's
important to remember

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.370
that it takes two to tango.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:48.067
So we found very different
Chinese experiences

00:25:48.067 --> 00:25:49.900
depending on where they
were doing business.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.350
So stronger state capacity
in a resource rich country

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.410
generally meant that
you had a better

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.470
result in Chinese investment.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:01.450
So we found in countries like
Mongolia, for example, putting

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:03.510
in place laws that
said look, we're

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:06.520
worried about the Chinese
exporting their labor.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.710
That's also a very
big concern when

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:11.550
China comes calling
primarily for infrastructure,

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:13.400
not so much for resource
quest, but a lot

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.510
of infrastructure development
surrounds resource development.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:23.210
So the Mongolians said
every Chinese miner

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.060
you have to hire nine
Mongolian miners.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.580
And now, maybe this is
not so strongly enforced,

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.130
but the idea is there.

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:35.280
There's an awareness of how they
want to negotiate and navigate

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.130
with the Chinese government.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.820
So that kind of
state capacity maybe

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.540
missing in a
country like Zambia,

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.680
for example, and
therefore Zambia

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.390
will suffer more in terms of
a Chinese investment on sort

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.310
of labor, environmental front.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:53.800
And finally, I think probably
the newest development

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.310
that we've seen is the
beginning of grassroots pressure

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.240
within China on Chinese
firms to do a better job.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.610
Of course, there's been
that for a few decades

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:06.170
now when it comes to domestic
environmental issues in China.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:09.160
But we're just beginning to see
Chinese domestic environmental

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.520
NGOs trying to hold
Chinese firms to count

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.240
when they go abroad.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.470
So for example, a
Chinese NGO that

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.020
goes to Burma/Myanmar
in interviews

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.920
spends two weeks
traveling around talking

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.410
to local communities there
and then comes back and tells

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:27.040
the Chinese firms you
need to do a better job.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.110
You need to engage
with local communities.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:33.520
It's not enough simply to strike
a deal with the local officials

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.300
because you're losing
out on the best deals.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.170
You are losing out because
you have no public support.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.380
So I think there are
all these pressures now

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.690
that are being exerted on
Chinese firms-- some of them

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.610
internal to the firms themselves
but many others coming

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:52.290
from outside-- that I think
are propelling a Chinese firm

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:55.070
behavior-- sort of general
corporate social responsibility

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:58.370
practices-- in the
right direction.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:00.990
It's too early frankly
to say that China

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:03.770
has turned the corner
in this regard.

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:07.866
But I think the trend line is
moving in a positive direction.

00:28:07.866 --> 00:28:10.150
MICHAEL LEVI: You've heard
so many things about Zambia

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:13.290
and the environment that I have
to give one little anecdote.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.070
When I was in Zambia
a couple years ago

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:17.740
doing research for
this book, I spoke

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.170
with someone who told me
about a company that actually

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:23.000
had submitted its environmental
impact assessment.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.200
It was in Chinese.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.210
It was approved despite the
fact that no one in the Zambian

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.000
government spoke Chinese.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.590
I don't know maybe they put
it through a Google Translate.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:33.910
I'm suspicious.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:36.210
But this is the
sort of thing that

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.880
happens when your capacity
isn't up to scratch.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.480
I want to talk about a last
myth-- or misunderstanding--

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.730
that surrounds China's
impact on global security

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:47.440
and international politics.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.710
It's pretty easy to see
China's resource quest

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:54.730
as fundamentally changing
political relationships,

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:58.580
deeply undermining global
security, inflating bad guys,

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.690
change relationships leading
to military confrontation.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:06.140
You certainly see the image
of China's state presence

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.020
in a lot of resource
rich countries.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:11.810
When I was doing research on
the book I went to Mozambique.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.030
It is not difficult
to figure out

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:16.680
that China has a strong
political relationship

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:21.780
with Mozambique because the roof
the Mozambique Foreign ministry

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.600
is a pagoda style roof.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.000
And the Chinese company
that built it decided that

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.530
would be a really nice touch to
put on the Mozambique Foreign

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:30.290
Ministry.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:31.520
This is not the embassy.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.960
This is Mozambique's
own foreign ministry.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.840
And it's true that as you
look around the world,

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.270
you see places where China
has resource investments

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:47.270
and is distorting the way the
world deals with its problems.

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:50.340
China certainly has
not bent over backward

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.020
to be helpful on Iran.

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:55.805
Less because imports--
well from their end more

00:29:55.805 --> 00:29:58.000
because it wants to
preserve opportunities

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.750
as an investor in
Iranian oil and gas.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:03.600
You see in Sudan-- one
of the earliest places

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:08.540
where China invested in
resources-- the Chinese have

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:13.640
tried at least to weaken
the Security Council

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.730
response during the last
decade to internal conflict.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:21.060
On the military front,
there is undoubtedly

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:25.440
a desire within pieces
of the Chinese military

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.949
and senior political leadership
to play more of a direct role

00:30:28.949 --> 00:30:30.990
in providing security for
its own resource flows.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:34.600
To have a stronger Navy,
to have a military that's

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.010
able to operate more
effectively abroad.

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:39.200
And when you add
more and more strong

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.020
militaries to a small
area, you inevitably

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.690
raise the risks of conflict.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:48.420
When you drill down these
pieces though, what you find

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.540
is that there are severe
limitations-- at least

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.940
for the time being--
to Chinese leverage.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.590
And let me flag
a couple examples

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.340
I think drive this home.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.050
The first is in Iran.

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:02.850
There was a big fear
that as Western companies

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.890
tried to gain leverage over
the Iranian nuclear program

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:08.420
by telling their oil and gas
companies that they couldn't

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.640
invest, that China would
just come in and take over

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.220
the leases, pump
out the oil or gas,

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:19.160
and make this essentially
painless for the Iranians.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.040
And what happened?

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.120
Two really striking
things happened.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.300
First is that, it turned
out that for a lot

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.320
of the developments
in Iran, China either

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.421
didn't have the technical
capacity by itself--

00:31:29.421 --> 00:31:31.170
so actually, if you
look around the world,

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:33.200
China's often partnering
with Western companies.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.620
Not operating alone.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.750
So they couldn't step
in because of that.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:39.360
There were other
technical limits

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.300
where the Chinese had 90%
of the pieces they needed

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:47.690
to do a development, but there
were some high tech or elements

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:50.680
that required specialized
materials that they could only

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.330
get from a European supplier.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.160
And that European
supplier was saying

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.460
we're not allowed to play
ball with you on this front.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:01.530
So they weren't actually able
to step in as effectively

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:03.290
and fill that gap.

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:05.730
At the same time that
they weren't able to,

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.920
they were being
deterred from doing it.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.290
So you had one instance
where Chinese companies

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:13.200
we're looking at two
sorts of possibilities.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.450
One was stepping in
for some Western firms

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:17.650
that were moving out of Iran.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.410
The other was investing
more in the United States.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.310
There's been a lot of Chinese
activity in the last few years

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:27.270
doing joint ventures in
American all gas production.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:29.800
And they got a subtle--
not a big broadcast,

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.730
but subtle-- message that they
might have to make a choice.

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:35.230
That if they invested
more in Iran,

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:39.470
people here might be
politically concerned

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:41.060
about their own
investments here.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.100
And ultimately, the
predominant choice

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.020
was to invest in
the United States

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.790
rather than to invest in Iran.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:50.470
A second thing that
we see is that China

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:54.220
may want to be hands-off
to essentially stay out

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.410
of internal politics in
countries where gets involved.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.260
But sometimes it
doesn't have the choice.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.780
And its found
increasingly, for example,

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.140
in Sudan and South
Sudan that it may

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.410
want to stay out of
what's happening there.

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:08.530
But it's investments
are worthless when

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:10.550
conflict means that
it can't produce.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.530
And in particular,
when conflict means

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:14.750
that it can't operate the
pipelines to get the oil

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.500
it's producing out.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:21.540
And so China may intend to have
a we don't interfere policy,

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.870
but that may not be tenable.

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:24.310
And it's learning
that as it goes

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:28.450
through some of its
engagements around the world.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.480
Last front worth
paying attention to

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.387
is this military front.

00:33:34.387 --> 00:33:36.720
The United States wouldn't
feel particularly comfortable

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.510
if the Chinese military was the
one responsible for security

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:43.950
of all the resources that
come back to this country.

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:47.380
If we were in a situation where
we depended on China for all

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.124
that security, we
would be agitating

00:33:49.124 --> 00:33:50.790
to build up our own
military and provide

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.530
that security for ourselves.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:53.930
That's what China's doing.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:55.360
China relies on
the United States

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.969
for security in the Middle East.

00:33:56.969 --> 00:33:58.760
It relies on the United
States for security

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.266
much closer to home.

00:34:00.266 --> 00:34:01.640
And a relies on
the United States

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.202
to not decide to cut off
its own access to resources.

00:34:05.202 --> 00:34:07.410
So if you're China, you want
to build up the capacity

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:09.699
to provide some of the
security for sea lanes

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:13.160
that critical resources
travel through for yourself.

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.909
The problem is there
a lot of other things

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:17.420
are the Chinese
military wants to do.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.639
China has one aircraft
carrier at this point.

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:22.850
So even if right now it wanted
to provide all the security--

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:24.350
to kick out the
United States, do it

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:26.734
for itself-- it
wouldn't be able to.

00:34:26.734 --> 00:34:28.150
And as we move out
into the future

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:30.820
and China does build
up a greater capacity,

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.239
it will be looking at a host of
different ways it can use it.

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:38.774
Will it want to use it
for defense for capacity

00:34:38.774 --> 00:34:40.190
in case of a
conflict over Taiwan?

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:43.230
Will it want to use
it in the sea lanes

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:46.900
close to home where it's
most capable of operating?

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.280
Those are the places
where resources

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.679
will get pulled to
in the short run.

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:53.800
Not sending ships off
to the Strait of Hormuz

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:58.200
to replace the United States
and others in the middle east.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.980
I want to move pretty quickly
to questions and answers,

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.910
but let me quickly
recap three themes that

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:08.820
help us at least organize how
we think about China's resource

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.320
quest.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.810
Just run through a lot of
what we've been talking about.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:16.670
The first is that to understand
what China does abroad,

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.350
you have to really look at
how China behaves and operates

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.500
at home.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.250
Whether it's-- like Liz said--
how they do environmental

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:25.930
impact assessments,
or handle labor,

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:28.910
or whether it's this broader
question of state control

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:32.880
versus limited administrative
capacity that allows companies

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.740
to often do their own thing.

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:38.220
That same scene that prevails
at home prevails abroad.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.980
There are other
influences abroad,

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.360
but that's a critical
starting point.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:46.000
The second is that regardless
of whether the Chinese state is

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.700
controlling or is not, or
whether it's intentions are

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:52.820
nefarious or not, that the
China is an enormous and growing

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.410
economy means that what
it does consequential.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:58.360
There's a habit of saying
if China's well intentioned,

00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.450
there is no problem.

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:01.600
And if China is ill
intentioned, there is.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.780
Intentions aren't the only
thing that matter here.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.410
China has consequences
whether it's

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:08.680
for markets, or for security,
or for prices in economies

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.140
regardless of what
its intentions are.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.345
The third piece I
drive home as sort

00:36:13.345 --> 00:36:14.920
of the counterpart of the first.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:18.210
Yes, China brings its own
approach to the world.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:21.260
Yes, China has different
ways of doing things.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.990
But the global system
is pretty resilient.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:25.900
It responds in some strong ways.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:30.170
When China tried to put
quotas on rarest materials,

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:32.420
those got struck
down in the WTO.

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.990
Still a work in progress, but
the system started to respond.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:38.270
When China has pushed
prices up, the system

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.820
has responded by
encouraging more production,

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:44.340
cutting consumption, and
driving technology development.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:49.310
When China has tried to change
the way politics and economics

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:51.940
mix in some of the
countries where it invest,

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:55.400
it hasn't been able to
sustain that all the time.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.910
And as China has gained exposure
to the rest of the world,

00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:58.868
is it's learned things.

00:36:58.868 --> 00:37:01.990
It's learn ways to do things
better that are good for itself

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.520
but also good for the
rest of the world.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.910
And I think we'll
continue to see

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:08.150
this interplay between
China bringing something

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:12.430
new to the world, and the
world adapting and influencing

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.550
China itself in
pretty strong ways

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:16.680
not just over the next
few years but really

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.620
over the next few decades
as China's rise continues.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.880
Thank you all for
your attention.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:32.800
AUDIENCE: One of the myths
I have at least about China

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.580
that I'm curious to
hear you talk about

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:39.470
is I often get the impression
that parts of China

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:42.630
are desperately
poor and desperately

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:44.210
resource constrained.

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:47.020
And so to some extent
China has to do

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.540
what it's trying
to do to import all

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.830
these resources from
outside of the country.

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:52.430
Because not only do
they want to grow,

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:55.130
but they have to figure out
how to feed people and raise

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:57.720
these desperately poor
people out of poverty.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.680
Which is perhaps
different than-- certainly

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.260
different than what the US
would have been in a situation.

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.235
Probably even different than
what Japan and Britain, who

00:38:06.235 --> 00:38:08.506
were much more resource
constrained were.

00:38:08.506 --> 00:38:10.380
And I was wondering you
can talk a little bit

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:12.620
about to what extent are
they doing what they're

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.230
doing because they feel like to
have to lift their society up

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:17.562
versus just seeking
to grow their economy?

00:38:17.562 --> 00:38:19.520
ELIZABETH ECONOMY: Let
me say a couple of words

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.130
and maybe Mike
wants to chime in.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:25.840
I think one of the commodities
we looked was water issues.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:30.089
And I think there's probably
no greater concern in China.

00:38:30.089 --> 00:38:31.630
You think air
pollution as a problem.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:33.180
Actually, the water
scarcity issue

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.450
is a much bigger problem
for China and particularly

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:37.930
in the north and the
west of the country.

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:43.320
And so we looked at
how China is actually

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.800
water rich but because
of its pollution

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.390
and because of it's
degradation of its resources.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:56.070
Half of the 50,000 river in
China have simply dried up

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:59.720
and disappeared over
the past few decades.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:04.320
It's being forced to undertake
major river diversions.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.280
It seeks to control
the water resources

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.460
that flow into places
like Kazakhstan,

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:14.510
or India, or down
into the Mekong.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:18.150
And so it encounters some
battles with these countries

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:21.940
because, in fact, they
need this water as well

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.890
to grow their own economies.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:26.560
But China is not interested
in negotiating in part

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.440
because this water
still very desperately

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.970
needed by China itself.

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:36.080
When you're asking whether
China's seeking resources

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.550
to grow its economy or to
lift another 100 to 200

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:43.370
million people out of poverty,
they're kind of the same thing.

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:45.950
Because that has
always been the mission

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:47.520
of the Chinese government.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.050
To continue to lift
hundreds of millions

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:51.800
of people out of
poverty as they have

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.950
done over the past
several decades.

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:56.230
One of the things
that Mike raised

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.480
was this issue of
rebalancing the economy

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.210
and the urbanization
processes taking place.

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:03.490
So moving a lot of those
desperately poor people--

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:05.799
migrant workers-- into cities.

00:40:05.799 --> 00:40:07.340
That's how they
believe they're going

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.980
to develop a middle class.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.610
While that may have some
positive ramifications

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:13.400
for China's resource
quest, the truth

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.360
is that urban residents
use four times the energy

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.480
and three times the water
that rural residents do.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.080
So some of that
rebalancing of the economy

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.660
could actually prove
even more challenging

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:27.090
for China's resource quest.

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:31.290
So I think absolutely they're
out there seeking resources

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:33.510
to continue to fuel the
excellent lifestyles

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:36.020
of the urban residents
on the coastal China.

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.570
But they're also
seeking those resources

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:42.360
to lift up those other 200
to 300 million people who

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.480
are not living the coastal life.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.910
MICHAEL LEVI: Just
to build on that.

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:49.800
I think it's both.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:53.650
When you to import a lot of
iron ore and use a lot of energy

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:55.660
in order to produce
steel to build up cities

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.739
so that you can bring people in
and lift them out of poverty,

00:40:58.739 --> 00:41:00.530
that's certainly what
you're talking about.

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:03.880
When you do it to ship that
steal to somewhere else

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:07.156
and sell it, these are
capital intensive, not

00:41:07.156 --> 00:41:08.280
labor intensive businesses.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.510
This does not bring a lot
of people out of poverty.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:12.430
That's not to say
that it's good or bad.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:15.210
But different pieces
of the resource dynamic

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:18.260
can be more or less about
poverty alleviation,

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:21.500
broad-based growth
versus return to the top.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.290
I think it's also worth
separating the trade

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.810
piece from the others.

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:30.780
The drive for trade, the
drive to have resources

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.460
to fuel growth and to fuel
a move into the middle class

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.880
is certainly there.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:40.990
The investment imperative
abroad I think is different.

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:42.990
It's more similar
to what you saw

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:45.820
in Japan, what you saw in
the United States, what

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.230
you saw in Britain.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.470
Partly driven by the fact
that you have big companies

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:50.800
with the capacity to invest.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.200
What the big companies with
the capacity and opportunity

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.310
to invest do?

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:55.820
They typically invest.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.900
And so not a shock
the Chinese companies

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.112
are doing that as well.

00:41:59.112 --> 00:42:01.320
On top of that, to the extent
that they're vertically

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.570
integrated-- so they have
these responsibilities

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:06.780
downstream, whether it's in
refineries or steel mills--

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:09.229
they often want some
security of supply

00:42:09.229 --> 00:42:10.770
even if they're not
physically moving

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:12.770
it, at least some
financial security

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:14.740
through upstream ownership.

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.840
And so you see some
of that happening.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.910
So I think it depends on
the particular dynamic

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:20.180
that you're thinking about.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.542
How much you tie that to the
rise of people out of poverty

00:42:23.542 --> 00:42:25.000
into middle class
and how much this

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.865
is about making
rich people richer.

00:42:28.865 --> 00:42:31.020
AUDIENCE: So I actually
have a question.

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.900
I did my thesis actually
on Chinese carbon emissions

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:34.510
and US GDP.

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:38.060
So kind of focusing on the
Chinese resource consumption

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.880
and trade piece on all these
emissions embodied in trade.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.574
Could you just
speak a bit on how

00:42:42.574 --> 00:42:44.990
we're putting the onus on China
even though we're probably

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:48.546
indirectly consuming a lot
in driving these prices?

00:42:48.546 --> 00:42:51.170
AUDIENCE: So it depends on which
research you're talking about.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:56.090
So for people here who didn't
do their thesis on this issue,

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.300
the way we typically count
emissions and resource

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.800
consumption is where
the smoke stack is

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.780
or where the resource
gets transformed.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:07.684
So if I have a factory in
China producing widgets

00:43:07.684 --> 00:43:09.850
for some of the United
States, it's their emissions.

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:13.500
Is their energy consumption
even those my widget.

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.410
And you get into a
lot of discussions

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:16.720
about responsibility.

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.370
Particularly, in
the climate space

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:20.580
because the climate
space immediately

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:23.760
runs you into a discussion
of responsibility.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:26.840
The problem there--
and certainly a lot

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.460
of our emissions
reductions-- not

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.960
all them but a substantial part
of our missions reductions--

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.330
have come from
offshore manufacturing

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:34.700
to places like China.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:38.660
The problem there is that the
way to take responsibility

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.780
for that is for us to say
well we will pay a fee.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.680
Just like we might want to
charge a fee on US emissions,

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.290
we'll pay a fee on
activities, on products

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:50.900
that ultimately come
from Chinese emissions.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.620
Politically, the
Chinese hate that.

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.740
So they like the
responsibility idea.

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.620
They hate the solution to it.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:44:00.080
And in the practical
world, it's the solution

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.790
that ends up having
the consequences.

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:05.360
So that's a tricky
piece to navigate.

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.940
I think on the broader
resource question, look,

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.890
we all feel the consequences.

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:12.280
I don't think it's
particularly useful, especially

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.790
when you're talking about who's
contributing to price rises

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:19.350
to have it as a sort of blame
game at least at a moral level.

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:21.030
I do think it's
useful to understand

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:22.730
what drives these
changes and that

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:24.870
gets back to this previous one.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:29.020
Most Chinese steel production
is driven by demand

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:31.130
from the Chinese
domestic economy.

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:33.380
That is not about export
with United States

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.524
except in a second
order kind of way.

00:44:35.524 --> 00:44:37.940
You need cities in order to
have people working and people

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.540
working in order to ship things.

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:42.750
But some of it is sent
to the United States.

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:48.310
And trying to differentiate
between these pieces is useful.

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:52.360
There's a paper-- a guy who I
like a lot at Princeton who's

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.420
a mechanical engineer but also
studies climate policy issues

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:57.595
together with a couple folks.

00:44:57.595 --> 00:44:59.720
I'm trying to remember
which California university,

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.678
but one of them is doing--
trying differentiate

00:45:01.678 --> 00:45:02.640
between these pieces.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:06.010
How do you go a level beyond
is it ours or is it theirs.

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:08.924
And think about which resource
consumption, which emissions

00:45:08.924 --> 00:45:10.590
are for building up
the domestic economy

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:13.960
and which are really just
to send it back to us.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.060
CLIFF: Thank you all for
speaking with us today

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:18.320
and we will have time to
sign books at the end.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.040
Thank you.
