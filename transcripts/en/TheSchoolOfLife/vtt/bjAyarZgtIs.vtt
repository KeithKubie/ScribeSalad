00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:04.900
Sam?

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.220
Sam?

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.200
Where are you?

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.600
There you are.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.880
I can't believe you thought you could get away with this.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.700
No-I want to say look, if we're gonna have another argument, how about we finally talk about the fact that

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.420
Carefull

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.860
Remember... looking for my taste

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.780
I told you specifically if you could put the tennis cube in and I know that you didnt do this

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.660
Wait from it

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.240
And I'm never allowed to talk about that; you always change the subject when we try to talk about that.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.560
Dont try to sound reasonable, either

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.460
I know how this must have made you feel, and I fully understand your emotional response to the situation.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.480
Never suggest they calm down.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.960
Look, I think you've just had a hard day at work...

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.840
i have today

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.800
...and these shoes were giving you grief...
I think the best thing to do is I'll make a nice cup of tea...

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.440
we'll just relax and you can just calm...

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.720
DON'T YOU DARE TELL ME TO CALM DOWN!
DON'T YOU DARE!

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.580
Don't offer a politician's apology.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.320
I can see that what happened would have upset you from where you're standing...

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:32.060
and that my behavior was not, at least in your eyes, what was expected of me and of what I expect of myself.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.880
Try some of these things instead

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.780
A genuine apology ( they 're always free )

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.340
But I'm sorry, I really am sorry...

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.280
like if there was something that I could do-- like, anything just to make it fine-- like, I would.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.280
They 're not nasty

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.440
If I have the ability to just go back and not ever meet you,

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.760
I would because it's just been a CONSTANT, CONSTANT DISAPPOINTMENT. Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.580
You're a spoiled little brat.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.800
Think of yourself standing outside the planet

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.240
Things look quite small from up here.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.800
There's no consideration for anybody else-- it's literally you're one-trap-minded-- and I am sick of it!

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.060
Think of them as a child

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.600
You can always , if it becomes truly unbearable, run away

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.120
Remember you have been impossible too. Quite often

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.420
Yes, my phone is broken, and it's your fault.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.640
&gt;&gt; It's my fault?
&gt;&gt; Yes!

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.560
Even though

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.460
Yea, like--
God, I need to get to the airport 9 in the morning.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.380
&gt;&gt; No, i-it's fine... you'll get it fixed.
&gt;&gt; No, it's not fine, it's 9 in the morning, that's not fine,

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.260
when are you gonna get it fixed now? There's no time. There's no time.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.340
Come here... come on.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.200
It's gonna be fine. Just don't worry, kay?
