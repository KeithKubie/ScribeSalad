00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
All right. Our penultimate question on regular expressions.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Which of the following sentences are true? Check all that apply.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Any regular expression written using + could be rewritten without +

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but match exactly the same set of strings.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
There is no regular expression that catches all strings that look like a^n.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Remember this exponentiation here means copies so this would be a, aa, aaa.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
There's no regular expression that gets that whole infinite set.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Here, there's no regular expression for a^n b^n,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so this would be ab, aabb, aaabbb

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and then down here every regular expression has an associated finite state machine

00:00:40.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that recognizes the same strings.
