DANA HAN-KLEIN: Hi everyone,
welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.470
Today is my absolute pleasure to
welcome Paul Scheer, David Wain

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.085
and Jonathan Stern.

00:00:16.085 --> 00:00:21.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:27.364
Hello!

00:00:27.364 --> 00:00:29.102
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:30.810
PAUL SCHEER: Thank
you for all coming out

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.279
from your desks to be here.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.570
JONATHAN STERN: And their
bikes, probably a lot of them

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.130
biked here, I think.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.650
PAUL SCHEER: I wish everyone
was on an elliptical here.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.380
I think that would
be really fun.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.470
DANA HAN-KLEIN: We
have a treadmill desks.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.678
PAUL SCHEER: I want all the
audiences to be that way.

00:00:43.678 --> 00:00:44.880
Wouldn't that be great?

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.796
You go to a movie, but
you also get a workout.

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:47.914
These movies are long!

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:50.080
"Guardians of the Galaxy
2," what was it, two hours,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.657
20 minutes?

00:00:50.657 --> 00:00:51.990
Get on a treadmill, work it out!

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.120
DAVID WAIN: Not to
mention, I think Hollywood

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.480
is riddled with sequelitis.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.090
How many "Rocky"s
are we going to have?

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.840
Is he going to do it
when he's an old man?

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.630
JONATHAN STERN: Well apparently.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.390
DAVID WAIN: Oh.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.848
JONATHAN STERN:
Apparently, he did.

00:01:04.848 --> 00:01:06.486
DAVID WAIN: I guess he did.

00:01:06.486 --> 00:01:08.360
PAUL SCHEER: But it was
really well received.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.818
So you shouldn't
feel bad about it.

00:01:09.818 --> 00:01:11.190
DAVID WAIN: Forget it.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.860
PAUL SCHEER: I do think
it redeemed itself.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.193
DAVID WAIN: I'd like to drop it.

00:01:13.193 --> 00:01:14.091
PAUL SCHEER: OK.

00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:16.646
DANA HAN-KLEIN: It's not going
to go on the internet at all.

00:01:16.646 --> 00:01:18.270
DAVID WAIN: I just
can't believe people

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.680
take time, when they
could just have free time,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.280
and come and share it with
us-- that's really awesome.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.850
PAUL SCHEER: Well maybe
they're not taking free time.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.434
But maybe because
the company is like,

00:01:25.434 --> 00:01:27.433
hey, you don't have to
do work if you come watch

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:28.930
these idiots for a little bit.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.690
And they're like, oh, that's
kind of like goofing off,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.810
so they're getting
double free time.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.643
DAVID WAIN: Or maybe
some people have to go,

00:01:33.643 --> 00:01:35.080
like it's court-ordered.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.580
PAUL SCHEER: Like,
this is like what

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.340
you get when you do a demerit.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.554
Like, if you wore
the wrong thing,

00:01:40.554 --> 00:01:42.220
your demerit is, you
have to watch them.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.780
Like, oh these guys?

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.650
I want to see the-- I don't
know, the development people

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.607
panel.

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:50.190
JONATHAN STERN: I
think you'd probably

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.910
be signing a lot of
people up to Gmail

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.201
right now if they weren't here.

00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:56.020
There's probably 10,000 people
that would have been signed up.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.269
DAVID WAIN: That's what
Google employees generally do,

00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:59.600
is sign people up for Gmail.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.520
PAUL SCHEER: Google
employees are

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.860
like the new Jehovah Witnesses.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.540
They just come,
knock on your door,

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.700
have you heard about Gmail?

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.290
Can we sign you up?

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.380
Take your credit
card information?

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.240
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So you
guys know all about it,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.130
so we don't need
to be here, right?

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.376
We can wrap this up!

00:02:10.376 --> 00:02:10.915
All right.

00:02:10.915 --> 00:02:11.790
PAUL SCHEER: Exactly.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.010
I am getting all my Gmail
delivered now, it's nice.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.775
It's kind of retro now, I
get it in a little package,

00:02:17.775 --> 00:02:18.402
I open it up.

00:02:18.402 --> 00:02:20.860
JONATHAN STERN: Are any of you
working on the Google rocket

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.664
ship?

00:02:21.664 --> 00:02:22.830
There must be a rocket ship.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.680
PAUL SCHEER: They can't tell
you that, it's a secret, right?

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.930
JONATHAN STERN: I was going
to see if anyone flinched.

00:02:28.605 --> 00:02:30.730
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So I'd love
to know, how do you all

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.760
know each other?

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.475
PAUL SCHEER: Well, I think
that all of our paths

00:02:35.475 --> 00:02:37.690
have crossed at different
times, but David and Jon

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.100
know each other
probably the longest.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.997
DAVID WAIN: I met
Jon, I don't know--

00:02:42.997 --> 00:02:44.830
JONATHAN STERN: All
right, the boring story.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.600
20 years ago, we were both
in an armed robbery together.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.660
David and Michael
Showalter were looking

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.230
for a producer of "Wet Hot
American Summer," the movie.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.400
And I walked in the door,
and tried to produce it

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.430
and didn't-- until it became
a TV series years later.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.180
But that was the beginning
of a long and fruitful

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.570
creative friendship
and partnership

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.322
that continues to this day.

00:03:06.322 --> 00:03:07.530
And started back in New York.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.113
DAVID WAIN: By the
way, I put you down

00:03:09.113 --> 00:03:12.130
as an emergency
contact at the doctor.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.300
JONATHAN STERN: Oh,
great, which doctor?

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.800
Kurtz?

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.400
DAVID WAIN: Doesn't matter.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.790
PAUL SCHEER: And I met
Jon about six years ago.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.930
I was pitching him a movie
called "Dry Canadian Winter,"

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.820
and we met together, and
he was interested at it,

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.180
and that's how we got together.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.290
No, but Jon and I met
when he moved out to LA,

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.860
and we started working together.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.817
And we've worked together
in many projects.

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:40.150
I think we all started-- we
all are in the comedy scene.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.680
So there's a lot of overlap.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.510
Even if we're not working
directly together,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.010
there is a lot of
overlap in the people

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.890
that we use in our crews, to
the people behind the scenes,

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.799
to the people in
front of camera.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.090
JONATHAN STERN: A lot of
collaborate-- the three of us,

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.700
and other people that could
easily be sitting here today.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.260
Like Rob Corddry,
and Rob Huebel,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.170
who we collaborate a lot with.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.670
DAVID WAIN: You and
I, I don't think

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.020
have ever worked as actual
creative partners on anything

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.430
big--

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.790
PAUL SCHEER: No.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.790
DAVID WAIN: But we've
probably both participated

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.780
in dozens and dozens
of the same projects.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.630
PAUL SCHEER: One of my
first things with David

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.029
that I remember--
and it lives with me

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.779
as a terrible moment
in my life, because I

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.300
was a huge fan of "The State."

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.490
I thought it was amazing.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.330
And David had this very--

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.730
DANA HAN-KLEIN: That's a
good producer, right there.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.120
PAUL SCHEER: And
I loved that show.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.730
And David was doing
this very cool show

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.180
in this venue downtown.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.247
It's was Stella,
essentially right?

00:04:37.247 --> 00:04:38.080
JONATHAN STERN: Fez.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.790
DAVID WAIN: Yeah, totally.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.210
Fez in New York City, yes.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.250
PAUL SCHEER: So they
were doing this show.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.390
And all the biggest comedians
at that time-- people

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.530
that no one knew, but now
everyone knows, like the Louis

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.990
CKs and Sarah Silvermans.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.540
Everyone was doing shows down
there, it was so much fun.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.100
And they asked our
group to do a bit.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.080
And we're like, OK,
we can't fuck this up.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.660
We've got to do the best bit.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.130
It was like, me and Rob
Riggle, and Rob Huebel

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.400
and a bunch of us.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.440
We were like, all right,
what are we going to do?

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.650
And we came up with this
bit, because Blue Man Group

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.470
was across the street,
that we were going to be

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.740
members of Blue Man Group.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.025
So we painted
ourselves blue, and we

00:05:10.025 --> 00:05:13.300
were going to do all
this dumb, weird stuff.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.580
And then we pull a member of
the audience up, who is a plant.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.050
And then we take them backstage,
and we just beat the shit out

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.380
of them.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.872
And it becomes this
bloody murder, and all

00:05:23.872 --> 00:05:24.580
this other stuff.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.105
So we shot this video.

00:05:27.105 --> 00:05:29.230
We were all ready to do
it, and we get up on stage,

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.950
and we do our dumb Blue Man,
like throwing marshmallows.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:32.996
And it's working OK.

00:05:32.996 --> 00:05:34.370
It's not great,
but it's working.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.110
And then we pick the audience
member up from the crowd,

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.790
and then the video starts.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.060
It's supposed to play, but
there was a malfunction.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.900
And it just never played, and
we didn't know what to do,

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.140
because we had no more bits.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.820
So we covered ourselves in
blood for the end of the bit,

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.130
waiting.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.650
So then, it was
like, what do we do?

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.950
And we just came
out onstage bloody.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.556
But there was no connective
tissue to what happened.

00:05:59.556 --> 00:06:03.120
So it was this great bit that
just failed so miserably.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.240
We had no comeback from
just being covered in blood,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.646
and blue.

00:06:07.646 --> 00:06:10.710
We just all were at a
bar, like, slightly blue,

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.876
with blood under
our fingernails.

00:06:12.876 --> 00:06:14.450
Like, oh I hope
they ask us back.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.760
DAVID WAIN: That sounds awful.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.337
Oh no.

00:06:16.337 --> 00:06:18.420
PAUL SCHEER: But yeah,
your video projector broke.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.300
DAVID WAIN: Yeah,
sorry about that.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.300
PAUL SCHEER: No problem.

00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:24.230
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So one of the
great things about all of you,

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.780
is that you guys were all sort
of early adopters of embracing

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.900
the digital medium for
distributing comedy.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.466
Your project lists
go on and on and on.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.490
DAVID WAIN: When we did
our "Stella" shorts that

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.180
were part of this
thing, that was

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.591
a series of shorts-- it
was basically a web series,

00:06:43.591 --> 00:06:45.340
but it was on a thing
called comedynet.com

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.890
and it was the size of like, a
postcard stamp, was each video.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.669
And this was in 1998
that we started that.

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:56.210
JONATHAN STERN: So,
first web series.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.626
DAVID WAIN: First web series,
I would like to hope to say.

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:00.689
Thank you very much.

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:02.230
PAUL SCHEER: But
then, the way that I

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.010
got "Human Giant" or the way
that "Human Giant" came to be,

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.150
was because we started
doing shorts downtown.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.060
And we were part of this
bigger collaborative

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.660
thing called "Channel 101."

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.470
That was in LA, and what you'd
do is make these little pilots.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.120
And every month, the
audience would vote.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.030
And if they liked your
stuff, you came back

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.310
and you did another episode.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.237
And we did channel
102, And that's

00:07:22.237 --> 00:07:23.320
how "Human Giant" started.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.425
And that was basically
again, it was before YouTube,

00:07:27.425 --> 00:07:28.300
this was pre-YouTube.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.350
Because the shorts were
hosted on this weird site,

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.300
and it was hard to download them
and find them and everything.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.130
But that's like, how
we kind of all started.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.127
JONATHAN STERN: And then
one of the first web series,

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:42.710
that I was aware of,
was the one David

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.615
and I did together, that
you worked on, Dana.

00:07:44.615 --> 00:07:45.990
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
I did work on it.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.850
JONATHAN STERN: And
right after, Dave and I

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.670
had done a movie together called
"The Ten," with Ken Marino,

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.322
and it was an indie film.

00:07:52.322 --> 00:07:54.030
PAUL SCHEER: Why would
you lead with Ken?

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.030
Ken is one of my favorite
people, and hilariously funny.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.960
There's a lot of other people--
you could be like, "The Ten,"

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.645
with like--

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.770
JONATHAN STERN: Well, he
was-- Ken was a co-writer.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:01.770
PAUL SCHEER: Oh, got it.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.962
DAVID WAIN: But I mean,
I was thrown, too.

00:08:03.962 --> 00:08:05.920
I'm like, there were a
lot of great people in--

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.044
JONATHAN STERN: Sure, sure.

00:08:07.044 --> 00:08:08.632
Adam Brody, Liev
Schreiber, Paul Rudd.

00:08:08.632 --> 00:08:11.090
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah, Paul Rudd
you would lead with, probably.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:19.820
"The Ten," with Paul Rudd,
who is the lead of "The Ten."

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.070
JONATHAN STERN: Famke Janssen.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.445
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah, another
big person who's in the movie.

00:08:23.445 --> 00:08:26.775
JONATHAN STERN: And
after this movie,

00:08:26.775 --> 00:08:28.900
that not that many people
actually saw in the movie

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.540
theaters, is-- an opportunity
came from a site called "My

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:37.130
Damn Channel"-- which was an
early channel of all-original

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:42.309
web program content-- approached
David and me about doing a web

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:44.230
series about whatever
David wanted.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.096
So surprisingly,
it was about him.

00:08:47.096 --> 00:08:48.850
DAVID WAIN: That's right.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.930
Each episode was about
meeting a different girl

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.513
and then making out
with her, and then

00:08:52.513 --> 00:08:54.000
screwing it up in some way.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.410
JONATHAN STERN: Like life, yeah.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.842
And we ended up ultimately
doing 45 of these things

00:09:00.842 --> 00:09:02.300
over the years,
kept on doing them.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.090
But right at the beginning,
we were treating it

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.020
like a TV series, a very
low-budget TV series.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.290
And short episodes,
five minutes each.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.820
But for all intents
and purposes,

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.570
we were making a TV series
that was going up on the web.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.560
And very quickly, we
discovered that more people

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.830
were watching a single
episode of this web series

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.180
that we spent a third of a
day shooting than this movie

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.550
that we spent a year making.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.550
PAUL SCHEER: Was that the
movie with Ken Marino?

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.830
JONATHAN STERN: Ken Marino
co-wrote it, and he was in it.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.482
Corddry was in that, too.

00:09:31.482 --> 00:09:32.287
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:09:32.287 --> 00:09:33.870
DAVID WAIN: If you
want to see it now,

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:38.872
you go to www.YouTube.com.

00:09:38.872 --> 00:09:41.330
JONATHAN STERN: But also, the
movie-- this ties in-- Google

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.290
and YouTube are kind
of related, right?

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.120
So what ties into that is, it
still didn't really break free.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.430
Back in that time, there
was curators on YouTube

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.010
that would decide what the
videos of the day were.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.340
And they put up five or 10
videos of their favorite-- I

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.396
don't even know how they
found it, or decided.

00:09:57.396 --> 00:09:59.770
PAUL SCHEER: There was only
about 25 videos at that time,

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:00.020
so it's the cap.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.228
JONATHAN STERN: That's right.

00:10:01.228 --> 00:10:03.578
We were submitting
videos every week.

00:10:03.578 --> 00:10:05.786
PAUL SCHEER: Oh, I remember
that curator thing, yeah,

00:10:05.786 --> 00:10:06.952
now that you talk about it--

00:10:06.952 --> 00:10:09.990
JONATHAN STERN: And some curator
picked our sixth episode up,

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.590
and then it went
through the roof.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.500
We had a million
hits in 24 hours,

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.170
and they kept
picking up episodes.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.997
And that's actually what
helped "Wainy Days" take off.

00:10:17.997 --> 00:10:20.330
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah, and I think
that for a "Human Giant,"

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.413
when we first started, it
was a great way--- like,

00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:25.590
MTV was like, no, we only
want to host your videos

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.370
on our site.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:30.450
And if the MTV site from
back then, in the early 2000s

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.490
to now, is exactly the same.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:33.690
It is awful.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.040
It is like, the most
unappealing visually, it's

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.340
hard to navigate, like, menus.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.920
You feel like, you have to have
two hands trying to open up

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.670
menus, like, why'd it go away?

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.700
And we were like, no.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.406
We made a very
firm thing, we were

00:10:46.406 --> 00:10:48.530
like, we don't want any of
our videos hosted there.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.100
Or if you do host
your videos there,

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.000
we want to be able to
put them on YouTube.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.570
And they fought us so hard.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.930
And we basically-- we got
all of our videos on YouTube.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.777
They have now, in
the last four months,

00:10:58.777 --> 00:11:00.860
been taken off YouTube for
copyright infringement,

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.760
slowly but surely.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.940
But we had made a
deal with Viacom

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.880
that we could host our
videos on that site,

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.630
because it was really
important for us to get people

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:09.980
to see our videos that way.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.180
We knew that that
was our audience.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.686
And that was a big
thing in the beginning

00:11:15.686 --> 00:11:19.290
JONATHAN STERN: So, Dana
complete coincidence,

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.910
before she even put
two and two together,

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:26.180
she was a PA back in Brooklyn,
in the early seasons of "Wainy

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:26.945
Days."

00:11:26.945 --> 00:11:29.080
PAUL SCHEER: What
episode did you work on?

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.170
JONATHAN STERN: Do you
remember the guest stars?

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:31.300
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Ken was not there.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.410
Kerry Kenney-Silver was at
one of the ones I was at.

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.285
JONATHAN STERN: Sure.

00:11:34.285 --> 00:11:37.130
You also worked on the very next
web series that I did-- sadly,

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:41.410
David only was a cameo on that
one-- called Horrible People,

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.280
created by A.D
Miles, starring him

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.200
and Joe Lo Truglio, which was
also on "My Damn Channel."

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.080
And that was a 10-episode web
series, five minutes each.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.442
But where it was one
continuous story,

00:11:52.442 --> 00:11:54.400
we were treating it-- we
had a one-hour script.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.120
It was basically
a one-hour comedy.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.870
And so then, it was,
how to make a web

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.870
series that was not a short
format, but was long format.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:03.869
And Dana worked on it.

00:12:03.869 --> 00:12:05.410
DANA HAN-KLEIN: And
I think the thing

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.950
I remember the most is that,
we shot it in what, a weekend?

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:08.910
JONATHAN STERN: Three days.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:09.820
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah,
and we were just like,

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.300
stuck in one apartment.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.030
But it was cool
seeing, I think sort

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.010
of what you touched
on-- where it's like,

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.520
hey OK, we have
this amount of time,

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.603
let's collaborate with as
many people as possible.

00:12:17.603 --> 00:12:20.960
Dave was there, Joe Lo
Truglio was there-- well,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.860
he was in it-- but it
was just interesting

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.350
that you guys were able to
get so many people to appear.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.390
Just because we were shooting it
in such a short amount of time.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:30.370
PAUL SCHEER:
Basically, everything--

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.090
this is what I've
kind of learned now.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.631
In the beginning, you start off
your career, and you're like,

00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:37.280
let's get our friends,
we'll do it for cheap.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.260
We'll just do it down and
dirty, and then the big money

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:41.910
will come.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:42.410
Never.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.090
That big money never comes.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:47.150
It's still fucking-- you go,
whose favor can I call in?

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.070
Who has a house?

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.517
How can I shoot this thing?

00:12:49.517 --> 00:12:51.100
JONATHAN STERN: But
then, the next one

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:51.890
will lead to something.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.080
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah, finally.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.700
I literally just
did a show for FOX.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.474
FOX, the network, FOX,
and it was the same thing!

00:12:58.474 --> 00:13:00.390
It's like, all right,
we'll shoot the whole 10

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:01.900
episodes in two weeks.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.770
Like, let's go, you know,
because like, no one gives up

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:06.380
any money.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.030
Gone are the days where like,
"Will and Grace," or something

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.610
like that--

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:10.600
DAVID WAIN: They give it
to some people, I think.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.000
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah, right.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.124
DAVID WAIN: I'm going on
30 years in this business,

00:13:14.124 --> 00:13:16.840
and it's every time, do this
now, for nothing, next time,

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.520
woo!

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.270
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.400
And your friends are like,
how many favors, dude?

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.108
Like, yeah, you start
to be a bad friend.

00:13:22.108 --> 00:13:23.560
Like, please, just
one more time.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.460
JONATHAN STERN: Did you ever
think you would say the phrase,

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.600
I'm going on 30 years
in this business?

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.260
Now you are.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.467
DAVID WAIN: No, and
God bless us all.

00:13:30.467 --> 00:13:32.800
PAUL SCHEER: But it does kind
of work out in a cool way.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.570
Like, I just went to
Sundance with a VR short,

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.960
and that was the same
kind of mentality.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.249
My friend was like,
hey, we have this guy,

00:13:40.249 --> 00:13:42.790
he is making these VR shorts,
you want to come in and do one?

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:45.000
And I didn't think
anything of it.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.730
We just went there, me and
Rob Huebel, in an afternoon.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.620
Shot this dumb, fart
sketch, which is really

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.650
pushing the boundaries of VR.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:55.030
And that's what
I'm always about.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.920
Really getting to the--

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.836
JONATHAN STERN: Because
the fart's everywhere.

00:13:58.836 --> 00:14:00.900
PAUL SCHEER: Oh, the
fart is-- it's in 360.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.630
You can experience it in
any way that you want.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.590
It really uses technology
to the best way.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:07.480
But it is--

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.479
JONATHAN STERN: Well,
think about-- a fart, just

00:14:09.479 --> 00:14:10.940
slash off the F,
and what's left?

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:11.440
Thank you.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.034
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah,
it's totally true.

00:14:14.034 --> 00:14:16.200
JONATHAN STERN: Continue
that, what you were saying.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.890
PAUL SCHEER: But I
think that we all

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.110
are ready to kind of
jump up and do something.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.260
Because the biggest
paychecks, I will

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.310
say, that I've ever
gotten, don't often

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.600
lead to the most
fulfilling experiences.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.530
And not to say that there
aren't-- but you should be

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:31.210
having fun.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:33.620
And I think that some people
sometimes are just motivated

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.180
by, oh, what about that?

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.680
But it's like, if
you're just having

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.240
fun, success and those
things come from that.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.824
And also, it's like,
life's too short.

00:14:41.824 --> 00:14:43.614
DAVID WAIN: Or you can
be like these people

00:14:43.614 --> 00:14:45.321
and be rich, probably.

00:14:45.321 --> 00:14:46.570
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah, super rich.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.750
We'd be super rich, come
up with a great idea.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.030
DAVID WAIN: And have
fun, I don't know.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.988
JONATHAN STERN: What was
your biggest paycheck?

00:14:51.988 --> 00:14:53.730
I mean, not the amount,
but on what job?

00:14:53.730 --> 00:15:01.784
PAUL SCHEER: It was for
$175, and-- no, yeah.

00:15:01.784 --> 00:15:03.950
JONATHAN STERN: "Fresh Off
The Boat" is probably OK.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.650
PAUL SCHEER: No, "Fresh
Off The Boat" is normal.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:12.960
I made my first four million
probably on "Best Week Ever,"

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.780
talking about "The Bachelor."

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.730
I'm pretty sure
that's probably it.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.230
No, but it's like, I
think part of the thing

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.740
is, I come from the background
of the UCB Theater, which is

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.040
the Upright Citizens Brigade.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.470
And I'd done shows
there for years.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.510
For literally, since
they opened up the doors

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.380
and I was still in
college, till this, like,

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.400
I'm missing my show
tonight because I'm here.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.580
Ken Marino has performed
at the UCB Theater.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.644
But those shows, we've never
gotten paid for those shows.

00:15:43.644 --> 00:15:45.560
But those are the
relationships and the people

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.110
that I work with all the time.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.500
It's just fun to
get up and do stuff.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.447
Yeah, there are things
that are for paychecks,

00:15:52.447 --> 00:15:54.030
but there are just
things for the love

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.260
of doing what you're doing.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.000
And I think that's always
an important distinction.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
And it's something I think
we all kind of share.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.690
Just to roll up your sleeves and
just kind of try something out.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.040
And if it works, great.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.460
JONATHAN STERN: I bet you
guys do that kind of thing,

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.030
I'm sure, in a different way?

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.530
Right?

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:08.277
Yeah.

00:16:08.277 --> 00:16:09.610
PAUL SCHEER: There's got to be--

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:10.980
DANA HAN-KLEIN: That's
a resounding yes!

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:11.938
DAVID WAIN: She nodded.

00:16:11.938 --> 00:16:14.739
She does things that are for the
joy or the fulfillment of it.

00:16:14.739 --> 00:16:16.280
AUDIENCE: We call
it the 20% project.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.000
DAVID WAIN: That's
what I heard about.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.500
Yeah.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.090
PAUL SCHEER: So 20%-- so only
devote 20% of your energy

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.965
on it, because it won't
pay off in a big way?

00:16:22.965 --> 00:16:24.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.440
It's like, 80% of the
time, make us money.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.130
20%, dick around with your
animated Heathcliff or Garfield

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.280
cartoon.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.856
DANA HAN-KLEIN: That's
exactly what the project is--

00:16:35.856 --> 00:16:37.980
PAUL SCHEER: Virtual
Garfield, you feed him a line,

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.210
he'll respond sarcastically.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:42.645
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Coming soon.

00:16:42.645 --> 00:16:45.009
PAUL SCHEER: I want
dibs on that idea.

00:16:45.009 --> 00:16:47.300
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But it seems
like also a really fun way

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.070
to stay creatively challenged.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.440
Because you're not
being constrained by,

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.452
OK, you have to have a 23-minute
episode every week for air.

00:16:54.452 --> 00:16:55.660
You can do whatever you want.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.280
PAUL SCHEER: I just did
a six second Vine series.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.780
We did the first-ever
animated Vine series

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.060
they called "White Ninja."

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.569
And I only made 60 of them,
they're all six seconds long.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:06.880
And they're like, that's it.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.880
I made a fucking
animated Vine series.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.819
That's crazy, six seconds.

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:14.950
Sometimes I just
grunt and it's over.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.980
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
That's what she said?

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.699
One of the other
things-- I'm sorry.

00:17:19.699 --> 00:17:22.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.400
I'll put in my notice now!

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.810
One of the great things about
the culture of the internet

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:32.880
and being fans of comedy
and stuff like that,

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.026
is that you get to sort
of bring projects back.

00:17:35.026 --> 00:17:37.400
And I'd love to talk very
quickly about "Wet Hot American

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:43.930
Summer: First Day of Camp."

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.100
Because the first film
was successful in it--

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.380
it has a huge cult following.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.589
DAVID WAIN: In so much as
that it was not successful.

00:17:50.589 --> 00:17:52.505
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But it's
successful in that it

00:17:52.505 --> 00:17:53.590
made lots of people happy.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.381
DAVID WAIN: It was
successful if you add on

00:17:55.381 --> 00:17:56.993
that thing, that unsuccessful.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:02.779
Sorry.

00:18:02.779 --> 00:18:04.320
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But
you have a chance

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.230
to sort of revisit
something, with hopefully

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:10.120
a bit more of a budget this
time, that people really loved.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.209
PAUL SCHEER: I thought you shot
the series before the movie.

00:18:13.209 --> 00:18:15.250
DAVID WAIN: Well, it took
place before the movie.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.874
But the secret is--
and I'm saying this

00:18:16.874 --> 00:18:19.520
for the first time in public--
we shot it after the movie.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.270
PAUL SCHEER: What?

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.020
DAVID WAIN: 15 years.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.311
PAUL SCHEER: Now that's kind
of crazy, because everyone

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.730
looked almost identical.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.410
DAVID WAIN: Almost
identical, amazingly.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.950
PAUL SCHEER: Wow, I thought
you had unearthed it,

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.230
like no one bought that--

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.688
DAVID WAIN: We
pulled it off, Paul,

00:18:31.688 --> 00:18:33.459
and I'm glad you didn't notice.

00:18:33.459 --> 00:18:34.750
And you were in it, by the way.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.190
PAUL SCHEER: I was in it!

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.709
That's the hardest part.

00:18:37.709 --> 00:18:38.750
That's the weirdest part.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.630
JONATHAN STERN: Yeah,
how did we get Paul back?

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.430
PAUL SCHEER: I thought
I shot that ages ago.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.471
DAVID WAIN: It was before
you lost all that hair.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:46.850
But yeah, we did do that.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:51.000
And actually, with adjusted
dollars and realities

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.280
of production, it was
actually not really much more

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.550
than the original.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.160
And in fact, I calculated
once, in discussing

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.240
how we're going to do
it again maybe someday,

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.580
that we had to shoot it
actually pound-for-pound.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.489
Much faster than
the original movie.

00:19:05.489 --> 00:19:07.530
JONATHAN STERN: But we
had two cameras this time.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:08.960
DAVID WAIN: We did
have two cameras.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.459
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Less rain this time?

00:19:10.459 --> 00:19:11.870
DAVID WAIN: And
less rain, but we

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:15.870
had more cold, because we shot
it in California in the winter.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.640
PAUL SCHEER: It does seem like
there is this ability though,

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.770
to kind of go back
and revisit stuff--

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.392
that people like
us, when you get

00:19:23.392 --> 00:19:25.600
to be in charge of something,
you'd be like, oh yeah,

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.400
bring it back.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.900
I mean, "Full
House"-- bringing back

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.130
"Full House" is a dumb idea.

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:34.697
But it's also-- that wasn't
the bastion of quality.

00:19:34.697 --> 00:19:36.280
I like "Saved By The
Bell," too, but I

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.936
don't need to go see it now.

00:19:38.936 --> 00:19:40.740
But this is a perfect
example of it.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.950
Like to kind of bring back
something because you have fans

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.810
that are people who
grew up on that.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.570
Or people who found that as a
pivotal point in their life.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.695
DAVID WAIN: And for me
though, that was terrifying.

00:19:51.695 --> 00:19:53.860
I care about the fans
of the movie so much.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.510
And I'm a fan of it, and so to
go back and open it up again,

00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:00.570
and maybe screw it up
or taint the legacy--

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:03.080
I really wanted to make
sure that it was going to--

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.070
PAUL SCHEER: You didn't
want to "Rocky" it.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.861
DAVID WAIN: --Do whatever
I could do, yeah,

00:20:05.861 --> 00:20:08.850
to deliver to fans what they
want, but also do something

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.190
new, and not have a retread.

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.570
There's so many pitfalls when
you do something like this.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.370
But we just kind
of tried to keep

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:18.070
the rudder of, do something
that's funny to us today,

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.990
and day-by-day, make it as
good as we could make it.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:25.500
And then the fact
that a lot of people

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.860
had such good response to
it made me feel wonderful.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.901
PAUL SCHEER: Kind of funny
too, because I imagine

00:20:29.901 --> 00:20:32.808
that there is a large group of
people on Netflix, who probably

00:20:32.808 --> 00:20:34.224
watched "The Hunger
Games," and it

00:20:34.224 --> 00:20:37.150
was like, if you like Elizabeth
Banks, you'll like this.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.040
And oh!

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.520
And I would love to
see those fans, too.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.704
They're like wait,
what is going on?

00:20:44.704 --> 00:20:45.370
Just trying to--

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.661
DAVID WAIN: What's that new
series with Bradley Cooper?

00:20:47.661 --> 00:20:48.910
Yeah.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:52.600
PAUL SCHEER: But it
seems like this time,

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:57.807
the show got such a great
kinf-- of all the fans

00:20:57.807 --> 00:20:58.890
really got behind it, too.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.390
DAVID WAIN: Yeah,
well I loved also,

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:05.030
the retro con of the press,
where they're like the big,

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.170
unanimously supported hit
movie "Wet Hot American Summer"

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:08.670
is back.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.920
And it's like, wait a minute,
no one was supporting us

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.230
when it came out at all.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:16.490
PAUL SCHEER: But I do think that
that is only apparent to us.

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.040
I could say to
you, something that

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.129
was a total-- it's the
Donald Trump of it all.

00:21:20.129 --> 00:21:21.420
You just say it was successful.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.935
Like yeah, "Wet Hot American
Summer" was a huge hit.

00:21:23.935 --> 00:21:25.060
They're like, yeah, it was.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.610
All of a sudden, no
one questions it.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:30.480
Like, no one looks--
only you know the secret.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.260
Because you could be like,
"Wet Hot" was a giant hit,

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.530
and then the sequel came,
and then that was it.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.610
And we shot it for $15 million.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.610
DAVID WAIN: Well in fact,
I have had experiences

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:42.411
where we've tried to
get projects going,

00:21:42.411 --> 00:21:43.910
and people were
excited because, oh,

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:45.760
the guys who did "Wet
Hot American Summer."

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.610
But then the actual
companies that

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.610
want to hire us, we go
down the road with them.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:51.109
Because they're
like, this is great,

00:21:51.109 --> 00:21:52.600
you know, the
classic comedy maker.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.183
And then they went
and actually looked

00:21:54.183 --> 00:21:57.530
at the numbers,
which are public,

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.420
and they've cut the project off.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:03.610
They're like, oh, we didn't
know it was a bomb, goodbye.

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:04.347
Pass.

00:22:04.347 --> 00:22:05.930
PAUL SCHEER: But
it's so funny though,

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:10.570
because it's not a
bomb if people see it.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:13.500
Even on this podcast I do,
"How Did This Get Made?",

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.449
we did a thing about
"Teen Witch," thank you.

00:22:16.449 --> 00:22:18.490
JONATHAN STERN: I do
sincerely love that podcast.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:18.830
PAUL SCHEER: Thank you.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:20.160
DAVID WAIN: I'm also
applauding podcasts.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.440
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah, podcasts.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.350
We did a thing about "Teen
Witch," and "Teen Witch"

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.470
is this giantly popular movie.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.880
It was only released
in 17 theaters,

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.900
but it played on
HBO like, nonstop.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.669
So that's how people know it.

00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:35.210
So it's like, you
can't just judge it

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.710
by who saw it at the time.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.400
Certain things I
like, I don't know--

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.430
"MacGruber" is, I think, one
of the funniest movies ever,

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.090
but it made no money
at the box office.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:45.970
It's not indicative of
quality, it's just like--

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:46.260
DAVID WAIN: No, it's a classic.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.010
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:50.090
JONATHAN STERN: Well now
you've identified the dichotomy

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.460
in all platforms now.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.530
Which is there's not a
one-to-one comparison

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:56.554
between how many
people see something,

00:22:56.554 --> 00:22:57.720
and how much money it makes.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.020
And that used to be more direct.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.186
You might have that, if
everyone saw everything just

00:23:01.186 --> 00:23:03.360
by buying it and downloading
it off of iTunes.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.350
But that's not the case.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.210
DAVID WAIN: And one of the great
examples in our world right

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:10.960
now is the state
of Comedy Central.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.670
Which has all these shows that
are huge in the zeitgeist,

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:15.980
and hugely talked
about and loved,

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.790
and kind of steering
comedy in many ways.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.260
And nobody watches them.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.135
They have no ratings.

00:23:21.135 --> 00:23:23.718
JONATHAN STERN: Well, they don't
watch them on Comedy Central.

00:23:23.718 --> 00:23:25.800
80% of the people--
"Portlandia," for example--

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.660
I did a series with
IFC, and I found out

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.990
that, I think 80% of the
people who watch "Portlandia"

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.227
watch it on Netflix.

00:23:32.227 --> 00:23:34.310
So everyone knows "Portlandia,"
everyone loves it.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:36.116
Netflix is getting
lots of people up--

00:23:36.116 --> 00:23:37.490
DAVID WAIN: And
80% of the people

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.850
who watch "Key and Peele,"
watch it on YouTube.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:41.850
JONATHAN STERN: Yeah.

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:43.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.150
They also watch in in clips
and segments on YouTube.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.420
PAUL SCHEER: But that's one of
the things for us, Aziz and Rob

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.910
and I, we always are bummed
out because we have this thing,

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:55.550
like "Human Giant,"
which is like,

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:58.980
we are the only ones that--
we have these hard drives.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.330
We these clips, but
because-- I mean,

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.540
that's the bummer of
YouTube-- sorry, guys--

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.380
that there are those
copyright robots that

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.550
are taking stuff down.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.340
Because you want to
get it out there.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.421
Copyright sucks
sometimes, I don't know.

00:24:12.421 --> 00:24:14.420
I have nothing more to
say about them then that.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.960
It sucks, because it's like, you
want to go back and watch like,

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.140
"Battle of the Network Stars"--

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.570
DAVID WAIN: I thought that
was a nuanced argument

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:21.340
about the complexities
of copyrighting.

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:21.890
That was interesting

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:22.800
PAUL SCHEER: Come on.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.800
Because like I said, I
guess the other thing too

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.350
is, who are you taking the
money out of if someone

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:33.370
can't watch a clip from a
1972 Johnny Carson appearance?

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.562
Who's not making a shitload
of money from that?

00:24:36.562 --> 00:24:37.270
I guarantee you--

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:38.160
DAVID WAIN: The Carson
Estate was going

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.450
to sell a DVD to that guy.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.252
PAUL SCHEER: I'm a big believer
in just getting your stuff out

00:24:47.252 --> 00:24:48.710
there in the best
way that you can,

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.637
like in the most accessible way.

00:24:50.637 --> 00:24:52.970
And I think that that's what's
been great about YouTube,

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:54.000
for the most part.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.040
And when you sneak it in
and you can watch stuff.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.760
I was able to watch the
"Star Wars Christmas Special"

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.530
on YouTube, which is great.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.990
George Lucas wants to
destroy every copy of that.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:12.640
I was psyched that I was able to
watch it in two long-ass parts.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.460
We need that.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.390
We need to have the ability to
go and watch our huge mistakes,

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.580
along with our giant successes.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.020
DANA HAN-KLEIN: How else will
we learn no to repeat them?

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:22.895
PAUL SCHEER: Exactly.

00:25:22.895 --> 00:25:25.311
DANA HAN-KLEIN: We'll take
audience questions in a moment,

00:25:25.311 --> 00:25:26.490
if anyone wants to line up.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:29.540
So you all have some
new projects coming out.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.270
Well, one isn't new,
it's continuing,

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.104
"Children's Hospital."

00:25:33.104 --> 00:25:35.770
JONATHAN STERN: Yes, the seventh
season of "Children's Hospital"

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:39.261
is currently up on Adult Swim,
Friday nights at 11:00 PM.

00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:41.260
DAVID WAIN: Every Friday
night is a new episode.

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:42.468
PAUL SCHEER: With Ken Marino.

00:25:42.468 --> 00:25:43.860
DAVID WAIN: Ken Marino's in it.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:44.735
JONATHAN STERN: Yeah.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.110
Paul and I created a show called
"Filthy, Preppy Teens," that

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:55.465
goes up on a new SVOD site
that's about to launch,

00:25:55.465 --> 00:25:56.215
called Fullscreen.

00:25:56.215 --> 00:25:58.090
It goes up sometime
in the spring.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:59.160
PAUL SCHEER: Hopefully.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.120
We'll see.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.190
JONATHAN STERN: We
finished it a while ago.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.939
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:26:01.939 --> 00:26:04.420
They were about launching
every five minutes.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.860
They're like, next month
we're launching, great.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.320
Two years later, we'll see.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.870
DAVID WAIN: It's the startups
here in Silicon Valley.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.370
JONATHAN STERN:
There are definitely

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.420
some projects we can't
announce, including

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:18.310
one kind of high-profile
reboot that we'll

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.376
announce in a few weeks.

00:26:21.982 --> 00:26:25.498
You're not part of
that one, sorry.

00:26:25.498 --> 00:26:27.641
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:27.641 --> 00:26:29.640
DAVID WAIN: I'm going to
be in the second season

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.680
of "Another Period,"
which comes out next year.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.680
JONATHAN STERN: Oh yeah.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.350
PAUL SCHEER: Next year?

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.970
DAVID WAIN: A
Comedy Central show.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:34.620
Or sometime-- thisyear.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.245
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah,
I imagine this year.

00:26:36.245 --> 00:26:37.460
This year you started.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.270
I have a new show that I
created with The Lonely Island

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:44.290
on FOX, that starts airing
next Saturday night.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:47.085
It's going to be
from 11:00 to 11:30.

00:26:47.085 --> 00:26:49.460
It's a new sketch comedy show
with a Nicole Byer, Jessica

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.030
McKenna and Allison Rich.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.820
So it should be fun I hope.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.444
DAVID WAIN: Fine, I'll tape the
news, and then I'll watch that.

00:27:03.159 --> 00:27:03.700
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.450
First of all, what's
your new show called?

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.420
PAUL SCHEER: Oh, it's
called "Party Over Here."

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.610
AUDIENCE: Thanks,
thanks for coming.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.235
PAUL SCHEER: Thank
you for reminding me

00:27:10.235 --> 00:27:12.860
of that giant part of
advertising my own show.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.600
Yeah-- I should
tell you the title.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.448
I should tell you
the title of it.

00:27:16.448 --> 00:27:18.864
AUDIENCE: How else am I going
to search for it on YouTube?

00:27:18.864 --> 00:27:20.344
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:27:20.344 --> 00:27:21.760
AUDIENCE: So what
I was hoping you

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.470
guys could give us
some advice on is-- me

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.520
and a bunch of my friends
try and write comedy.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.662
And there's a big group of
Googlers that do it as well.

00:27:28.662 --> 00:27:29.930
JONATHAN STERN: His
name's Neil, you said?

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:30.420
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry?

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.590
JONATHAN STERN: His name's Neil?

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:32.110
You said your--

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.910
PAUL SCHEER: She
didn't say any names.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:34.576
AUDIENCE: Oh no, just
me and my friends.

00:27:34.576 --> 00:27:36.042
JONATHAN STERN: Oh, OK.

00:27:36.042 --> 00:27:37.750
AUDIENCE: There's a
big group of Googlers

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.720
as well, that do these
types of projects.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.450
And for people who don't have
your type of clout, how would

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.940
you recommend getting viewers?

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.759
Getting people who
want to go on YouTube

00:27:46.759 --> 00:27:47.800
and check out your stuff?

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.670
Or listen to podcasts of
people they don't know?

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.020
What's your ground
zero for starting

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.450
with internet-based comedy?

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.761
PAUL SCHEER: You know, I
have a quick answer for that,

00:27:56.761 --> 00:27:57.260
ultimately.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.320
Which is just, you have
to just do what you like,

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.486
and what you think is funny.

00:28:00.486 --> 00:28:02.560
And hopefully people
will find that.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.530
Like when we were doing "Human
Giant" in the very beginning.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:07.937
We had no clout, Aziz had
no clout, I had no clout.

00:28:07.937 --> 00:28:10.020
But we made these videos,
we were putting them up.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.728
And then that got word
of mouth, and then

00:28:11.728 --> 00:28:14.990
some executives saw it, and
that helped us get the show.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.927
There's a podcast-- this is a
good example of the podcast.

00:28:18.927 --> 00:28:20.760
I do this podcast, "How
Did This Get Made?",

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.385
and someone's like,
oh my God, you guys

00:28:22.385 --> 00:28:24.052
need to listen to
"The Worst Idea Ever."

00:28:24.052 --> 00:28:25.885
And it was just a tweet
that was sent to me.

00:28:25.885 --> 00:28:28.350
And "The Worst Idea Ever"
is these two Australian guys

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:33.120
who decided to watch "Grown
Ups 2" every week for 52 weeks.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.080
And it's kind of their
descent into madness.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.080
They'd just finished doing "Sex
and the City 2" for a year.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.280
And they go insane,
because they have

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.920
to talk about the same
movie week after week,

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.200
and it's hilarious.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.880
But someone tweeted at
me-- the concept of it

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.150
was funny enough that
I listened to it.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:53.237
And then I talked about
it on an interview

00:28:53.237 --> 00:28:54.820
that I did in The
Onion, and then they

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.101
got these tons of
listeners from that.

00:28:57.101 --> 00:28:59.600
Because I think people are still
engaged on that same level,

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.910
and they've kind of used that.

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:03.230
So I feel like, if you
make something that's good,

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.579
and you feel like you're
passionate about it,

00:29:05.579 --> 00:29:07.870
and you're not just waiting,
just don't make one thing.

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.980
Make a bunch of things,
keep on making things,

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.612
and then someone
somewhere will see it.

00:29:11.612 --> 00:29:13.820
And that will lead to the
next thing, the next thing,

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.160
and the next thing.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.130
There's no short
cut, I feel like.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:18.740
Just collaborate and work with
people that you really life.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.031
DAVID WAIN: And I agree with
the part about don't wait.

00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:24.099
Just do it, make the next thing,
then write the next thing.

00:29:24.099 --> 00:29:25.890
Don't be like, oh, I've
got this one thing,

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.370
if only somebody
would finance it.

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:29.450
Or if only people would discover
us and give us the work,

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:30.250
or give us the money.

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:31.000
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.190
DAVID WAIN: Don't think in
term-- I'd say, just make it.

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:37.845
Just to give some
perspective, I'm 46 years old.

00:29:37.845 --> 00:29:38.720
JONATHAN STERN: What?

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.717
DAVID WAIN: Thank you.

00:29:40.717 --> 00:29:42.800
PAUL SCHEER: You really
have been in this business

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.500
for 30 years.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.200
DAVID WAIN: When I
was in high school,

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.940
I was making videos
all the time.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.690
And I was excited, but
there was literally

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:50.510
no possible technical chance
that anyone would ever

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:51.922
see them, no matter what.

00:29:51.922 --> 00:29:53.380
JONATHAN STERN:
They're all up now.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.671
DAVID WAIN: They're all up now.

00:29:54.671 --> 00:29:59.110
But the fact that we do have
this incredible democracy

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.490
that people can watch
anything they want,

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:05.300
any time, from anywhere, it's
really-- gives you that chance.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.740
And then, I agree, word of
mouth can spread at any time,

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.320
in any way.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.920
And that's very exciting.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.420
And also, if the
means of production

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.560
are available to everyone.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.700
You can have a good
quality camera and editing

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.201
equipment without spending
any money, it's great.

00:30:19.201 --> 00:30:20.950
JONATHAN STERN: What
I learned from David,

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:22.710
and in that first
season of "Wainy Days,"

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:26.140
is not to the half-ass it
when you're doing anything.

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.770
Because you don't
know what suddenly

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:29.090
everyone is going to watch.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:30.590
And if you do
half-ass it, well then

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:31.570
it's not going to go anywhere.

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:33.810
Or if it does, it's not
going to reflect well on you.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:35.851
DAVID WAIN: And it'll be
on the internet forever.

00:30:35.851 --> 00:30:37.860
JONATHAN STERN: Yes.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.889
Don't let the money decide.

00:30:39.889 --> 00:30:41.680
Don't say, oh, it's
low budget, so I'm just

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.150
going to do a mediocre job.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.060
What you're doing is
being put out there.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.080
No one cares how much
money you spent on it.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.380
But also, if there's one secret,
apparently just email Paul

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.332
and get him to tweet about it.

00:30:54.332 --> 00:30:56.290
DAVID WAIN: But I have
to say, I can't tell you

00:30:56.290 --> 00:31:00.674
how many people have contacted
me anonymously and said, hey,

00:31:00.674 --> 00:31:02.340
I'd love you to watch
this video I made.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.920
I mean, it's not great
because I didn't really--

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.610
I rushed through it, and I
didn't bother editing it down,

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:11.436
or the sound sucks,
and I didn't really

00:31:11.436 --> 00:31:13.560
write it very carefully
because I didn't have time.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.809
And I mean it's like, no,
I'm not going to watch that.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.020
PAUL SCHEER: The
other thing too is,

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.550
you can track anyone's
success to one thing,

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:23.949
where someone discovered
them or something.

00:31:23.949 --> 00:31:24.990
So it's always like that.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:26.364
But when you do
have that moment,

00:31:26.364 --> 00:31:28.790
I think what Jon saying
is, then if they look back

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:31.540
on your other stuff, it
should be on the same level.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.950
Then you have a
reason for people

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:37.380
to continue, and not be the
"Gangnam Style" of comedy,

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:38.840
that one hit and it's over.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.548
DAVID WAIN: Although,
have you seen that?

00:31:40.548 --> 00:31:41.980
It's so funny.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:42.825
Gangnam style!

00:31:42.825 --> 00:31:45.998
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah
yeah, he's a funny guy.

00:31:45.998 --> 00:31:47.952
DAVID WAIN: It's a video.

00:31:47.952 --> 00:31:49.410
JONATHAN STERN:
You showed it to me

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:51.840
literally 50 times in
the "Children's Hospital"

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.890
writer's room.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:54.515
DAVID WAIN: Have you
seen this, though?

00:31:54.515 --> 00:31:57.644
It's on YouTube,
I'll show it to you.

00:31:57.644 --> 00:31:59.480
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.520
DAVID WAIN: Www.YouTube--

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:05.020
JONATHAN STERN: You can say
goodbye when you're done.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.314
PAUL SCHEER: She said thank you!

00:32:07.314 --> 00:32:08.730
DAVID WAIN: Here
comes someone who

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.555
is either returning from the
bathroom, or has a question.

00:32:11.555 --> 00:32:12.280
PAUL SCHEER: No,
she was getting up.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:12.760
JONATHAN STERN:
Maybe the question

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.420
is, where's the bathroom?

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.990
PAUL SCHEER: It's weird they
put the bathroom right behind us

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.490
on stage.

00:32:19.109 --> 00:32:19.900
AUDIENCE: Hi, guys.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:20.360
PAUL SCHEER: Hi!

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.850
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:24.610
I'm a huge fan of all
of your many things.

00:32:27.406 --> 00:32:29.530
There's a lot of them,
you've got a lot of credits,

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.050
and we don't have a lot of time.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.440
I want to know what your--

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.690
JONATHAN STERN: We have time
if you want to list them.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:35.620
PAUL SCHEER: No.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.203
AUDIENCE: All of the
things with "hot"

00:32:37.203 --> 00:32:39.148
in them, "Wet Hot,"
"Hotwives," "NTSF,"

00:32:39.148 --> 00:32:40.540
et cetera, colon, colon--

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.945
JONATHAN STERN: "Burning
Love," also on Hulu.

00:32:42.945 --> 00:32:44.340
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:47.680
PAUL SCHEER: Let her
ask her question.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.980
AUDIENCE: I want to know
what your favorite thing is

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:50.730
that you've done?

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:55.990
I'm so sorry.

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:58.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:03.840
DAVID WAIN: I really--
I always heard people

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.490
say this when I was a kid.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:08.520
People I was fans of, and I
thought it was such bullshit.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:12.690
But now that I am where I am, at
this time in my life, I guess,

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:13.700
it's not bullshit to me.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.180
I don't really look
back that way so much.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.760
So I'm very excited about
what I'm doing right now.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:24.210
And maybe what I just
did, but it's weird.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.940
I'm speaking for myself, I love
all the things that I've done.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.239
And I'm very proud of
it, and if I do see it,

00:33:29.239 --> 00:33:31.280
or people talk about it,
I'm psyched and thrilled

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.113
that people like it.

00:33:32.113 --> 00:33:35.240
But I don't know, I sort of
disconnect in a certain way,

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.200
though, and I'm most
jazzed about what

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.242
I'm currently working on.

00:33:39.242 --> 00:33:41.450
JONATHAN STERN: So you're
just speaking for yourself,

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:42.030
you said?

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:44.010
Because that seems
self-evident, at that point.

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:47.232
DAVID WAIN: Right, I should
have-- that was obvious.

00:33:47.232 --> 00:33:48.690
Sometimes you have
to underline it.

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:51.106
PAUL SCHEER: I do think it's
tough to kind of narrow down,

00:33:51.106 --> 00:33:53.304
like, that was my
favorite thing.

00:33:53.304 --> 00:33:54.720
Because I think
we're lucky enough

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.015
to continue to work with
really great people.

00:33:57.015 --> 00:33:59.390
We've all worked together,
and I think the relationships,

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:02.500
and the times-- I can
pinpoint one great moment

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.770
on every project.

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:07.580
I think every now and then
I'm surprised to get money

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:12.219
to do something, and those
are fun, weird victories.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:15.460
Like when I met
with this guy, he

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.364
was like, whatever you
want to do, we have money.

00:34:18.364 --> 00:34:20.239
Doesn't matter how weird
it is, and I'm like,

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:23.620
oh I'd like to re-enact old
episodes of "The Arsenio Hall

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.179
Show," and do that,
word-for-word.

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:27.392
And he was like, great.

00:34:27.392 --> 00:34:29.350
And then all of a sudden,
someone built the set

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:32.610
and we were shooting it, and I
was dressed like Aresnio Hall.

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:35.620
That, to me, was amazing.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.739
And only better then that I got
invited on "The Arsenio Hall

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:43.770
Show" as Arsenio Hall, to
sit with Arsenio Hall-- who

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:46.510
didn't even get the joke
that I was Arsenio Hall!

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:50.120
So that culmination
of that one thing

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:53.825
was so crazy, because that
was something that was never

00:34:53.825 --> 00:34:55.199
an idea that I
would pitch, never

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:56.730
an idea that I would chase down.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:59.700
But someone was like, what's
the craziest idea that you want?

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:00.790
And I was like, this.

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:03.260
And then he was like, great.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.911
Then that led to-- and then
what I love about that too,

00:35:06.911 --> 00:35:09.160
is that's something that you
can't monetize or put out

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.140
in any other way.

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.890
Where is there a
market for recreations

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:14.930
of Arsenio Hall's talk show?

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.340
Nowhere.

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:19.580
So it was great, it's on
YouTube, it's awesome.

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:22.900
And I did it again for
Carson Daly, for TRL.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:26.250
It just exists in this
thing, and I think

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:27.480
that that's really fun too.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.625
To be able to try things
for different media.

00:35:29.625 --> 00:35:31.750
Not to be like, not everything
has to be a TV show,

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:33.680
not everything has to
be a movie or anything.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.660
So that was really fun.

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:37.010
And again, to meet
Arsenio Hall and for him

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:40.460
to tell me backstage,
hey man-- I

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:44.100
think he thought I was a kid who
did this in my basement-- like,

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:44.640
keep it up.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.167
You come out here to
Hollywood and opportunities

00:35:46.167 --> 00:35:47.158
will be open to you.

00:35:47.158 --> 00:35:48.654
I was like, all right.

00:35:48.654 --> 00:35:51.070
You realize, that some of the
people in this Arsenio thing

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.499
were like, Seth Rogen,
Max Greenfield-- I

00:35:53.499 --> 00:35:54.540
got some big celebrities.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.831
And then he was like, yeah
man, keep it up, keep it up.

00:35:56.831 --> 00:35:58.159
I said, all right, I will.

00:35:58.159 --> 00:36:00.700
JONATHAN STERN: I'd say anything
I've done over the last five

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.490
years, I've really enjoyed.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:05.750
Literally joyful going
to set, being part of it.

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:08.680
Prior to that was
ups and downs, a lot

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.560
of really stressful
situations a lot of times,

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.369
that I was saying, I'm never
going to do this again.

00:36:15.369 --> 00:36:16.785
DAVID WAIN: I say
that every time.

00:36:16.785 --> 00:36:18.090
JONATHAN STERN: Yeah.

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:21.600
But similar to your story
about ArScheerio Paul,

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.960
there's a 4:00 AM
slot on Adult Swim

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.590
that the head of Adult
Swim calls "DVR Theater."

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:31.570
And we and my company
do a bunch of these,

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:35.380
sometimes fake infomercials, or
just short films or weird shit,

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.690
that goes up, they're quarter
hours, there's no advertising.

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:43.350
We get a tiny budget and no one
is looking over our shoulder.

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:48.199
Did one with Paul, "Hotel TV."

00:36:48.199 --> 00:36:49.740
PAUL SCHEER: The
one that we did was,

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.462
the TV turned into
a hotel TV screen,

00:36:52.462 --> 00:36:53.920
and it was like,
select menu, this.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.726
And it just became like
you were in a hotel,

00:36:56.726 --> 00:36:59.400
and it clearly-- it became very
clear the hotel was haunted

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.200
by Indians who were
trying to kill you

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.110
for gambling on their land.

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:06.320
And it was hosted by Ray
Wise from "Twin Peaks."

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.206
It was the most insane
thing, again, up on YouTube.

00:37:10.206 --> 00:37:11.830
JONATHAN STERN: We
just shot last week,

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:15.240
one with Rob Huebel that's
all fake news fails.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.920
And one with Showalter that's
kind of a Winnebago man thing.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.970
We did a series
called "You're Whole,"

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:21.560
starring Michael Ian Black.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:25.010
And a million people watch
these at four in the morning,

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:26.820
because, I think,
nothing else is on.

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:30.100
But it's such a bubble.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.410
What Paul said about
ArScheerio Paul,

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:34.360
OK, do whatever you want to do.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.280
Because the stakes are so
low for this particular time

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.840
slot and project.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.550
PAUL SCHEER: It's the
closest thing to art.

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:44.440
It's whatever you want to do.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:47.230
There's no parameters.

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:48.897
You don't have to fit
in any box at all.

00:37:48.897 --> 00:37:50.355
DAVID WAIN: I felt
that way when we

00:37:50.355 --> 00:37:52.110
were doing our
"Stella" shorts, which

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.230
were for literally nobody.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.420
I mean, we showed
them at a nightclub

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.355
with about this many
people every week,

00:37:58.355 --> 00:38:00.730
and thought that was the last
that we would hear from it.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.880
But then we didn't know
the internet would still

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.540
be going at this point.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:09.070
But I have often thought
that the fun and enjoyment

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:11.826
of doing something is an inverse
relationship to the budget.

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:16.430
JONATHAN STERN: I.e, the steaks.

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:18.660
DAVID WAIN: I love steak.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.860
PAUL SCHEER: Donald Trump
steaks, did you see this?

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:21.735
JONATHAN STERN: What?

00:38:21.735 --> 00:38:23.920
PAUL SCHEER: He had a line
of steaks available only

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.890
at Sharper Image.

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:28.600
I learned that from "The
John Oliver Show" this week,

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.818
it was amazing.

00:38:29.818 --> 00:38:32.500
AUDIENCE: Can I ask a question?

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.574
I mean this in the most
endearing way possible.

00:38:34.574 --> 00:38:35.490
JONATHAN STERN: Uh oh.

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:36.710
AUDIENCE: That's not the
best way to start, right?

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:37.340
But--

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.820
DAVID WAIN: We're out of
time, is that what it is?

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:43.700
AUDIENCE: You guys do
some really weird stuff.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.910
And I'm just curious,
especially for having done it

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:50.500
for so long, how do you feel
like your comedy tastes,

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.250
and what you guys have
tried to experiment

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:56.080
with has changed or grown
over all of the years

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.930
that you've been doing it?

00:38:57.930 --> 00:38:59.710
And I'm going to sit down.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:03.680
DAVID WAIN: I could say
that my taste in comedy

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.800
has changed surprisingly little.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.070
And my, what you would
call sensibility I guess,

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:14.570
has changed very little from
what I was even like, 12.

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:20.360
And particularly--
it's just interesting,

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.900
I think that might be
a good thing somehow.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.420
Something locked in about
what makes sense to me.

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.560
And then I've evolved
how I do things,

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:33.210
and I've evolved the craft
and the many, many things

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:34.390
around it.

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:37.450
But the actual, your
question, I don't know

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.190
if it's changed all that much.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.470
PAUL SCHEER: I think that's
one of the cool things

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:42.260
about everything
that you do, though.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.315
It's in the vein of
a Woody Allen thing.

00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:45.440
DAVID WAIN: It's infantile.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.200
PAUL SCHEER: No, but
you always know--

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.690
JONATHAN STERN: It's like
locked in a box in time.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:51.470
PAUL SCHEER: But
I think that there

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.760
are a handful of
directors that you know,

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.290
and writers and performers.

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:58.830
But you have such a
distinctive stamp on stuff.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:03.750
I love what you do, but it's
so unlike anybody else's stuff.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:06.710
And even on something that
is a bigger, mainstream

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:08.520
stuff that you did,
like "Role Models,"

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.490
it still feels like
a David Wain movie.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:15.060
And I think that that's
a very hard thing to do.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:18.910
Especially with this new voice
of all these big budget movies.

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:21.750
It's hard to be like,
oh, that's a blank movie,

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:22.964
or that's a blank movie.

00:40:22.964 --> 00:40:23.630
It's much like--

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.220
DAVID WAIN: And particularly,
because comedies today so often

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.970
are written by huge
numbers of people

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:31.360
that all toss in at
different points.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.550
And without some
strong voice taking it

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:37.800
from beginning to end,
that's the trap I think,

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.466
that can happen.

00:40:38.466 --> 00:40:40.470
JONATHAN STERN: This is
a great point for you.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:43.580
And yes, one of-- I think--
your extreme strengths.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.450
It's the commitment
you have to your voice,

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:48.150
and how people recognize it.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:51.090
Now you see people pick up, oh,
I'm doing a David Wain thing.

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:53.500
We can't help ourselves, when
we're in the writers room,

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.700
starting to make
David Wain jokes

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:56.920
and we're called out on it.

00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:03.120
But that specificity
of voice is something

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.310
that you have the
opportunity to do when

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:06.830
you're doing your own project.

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:13.760
And my own personal advice is
rather than trying emulate some

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:20.050
other style and say, hey I'm
doing a "Seinfeld"-type show.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.260
If this is your opportunity--
and hopefully not

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:27.250
your only opportunity in your
life-- but to do something

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:29.480
that is so specifically
your voice.

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.710
And that's what gets it
out there more than, great,

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:34.906
you did a great job of
sounding like the big boys.

00:41:34.906 --> 00:41:36.530
DAVID WAIN: Although
on the other hand,

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:39.380
so many great artists
and musicians,

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.740
and anyone that I
follow-- you start often

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.820
by imitating your
favorite people.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:48.940
And then over time, your
particular thing emerges.

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:52.202
I mean for me, it was
always there, but you know--

00:41:52.202 --> 00:41:54.660
PAUL SCHEER: But to answer your
question too, I feel like--

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:55.701
DAVID WAIN: Just kidding.

00:41:55.701 --> 00:41:57.482
PAUL SCHEER: --for
me, I definitely

00:41:57.482 --> 00:41:58.440
had things that I love.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.550
And I still love those
things-- when I first

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:02.870
started enjoying comedy.

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:05.543
But then I think my taste--
when I got to college,

00:42:05.543 --> 00:42:10.910
and I went to NYU, my tastes
kind of opened up a little bit.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:12.410
We all went to NYU,
all three of us.

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.830
But I feel like that opened
my worldview a little bit.

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:19.880
And I think the one
thing that I'm always

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.360
conscious of--
there's two things.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:25.010
One, to always watch
stuff of new stuff.

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:28.670
I feel like that's the quickest
way to feel or get older,

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:34.710
get stagnant, is not keeping up
on what is currently out there.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.250
Right now, "Broad City"
is my favorite show.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:40.960
I think that's so amazing
and they're great.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.930
I love that, but
I'm not like a guy

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:46.404
that-- I feel like I've run
into a handful of people who've

00:42:46.404 --> 00:42:47.820
achieved a certain
status and they

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:50.560
kind of wall themselves
off into their own world.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.800
And I think that's a problem.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.510
And then for me, I think I want
to challenge myself to always

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:58.880
be like, all right, I've done
that, now let me do this.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.970
Let me try this.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.260
So I always am trying
to self regulate.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.840
Like, I've done something
like that, let me do this now.

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.264
And also not tread
the same ground.

00:43:07.264 --> 00:43:08.930
I always go back and
do something weird,

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:11.240
like Hotel TV or
something like that.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.800
But I also, for the long
term, I want to make sure

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.560
that's not repeating a pattern.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.546
And I think to your
credit, that's something

00:43:17.546 --> 00:43:18.545
that you do really well.

00:43:18.545 --> 00:43:22.950
You keep your voice consistent,
but your projects very varied.

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:25.730
DAVID WAIN: It's just fueled
by getting bored really easily.

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:28.784
And I know that if I went
back, and do something that's

00:43:28.784 --> 00:43:30.700
not interesting to me
because I did it before,

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.615
I will be miserable.

00:43:32.615 --> 00:43:34.740
JONATHAN STERN: I remember
once a few years ago, it

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.950
was between projects,
and you said,

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:40.230
I'm going to take a month
off and just get input.

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:43.270
See plays, read, do whatever.

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:46.501
Which had never occurred to
me as a practical use of time

00:43:46.501 --> 00:43:47.000
before.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.850
And of course, it's a
super smart thing to do.

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:52.800
PAUL SCHEER: I do that at
the end of every big project.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.100
It's the best time to
be like, and now I'm

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.970
going to just like veg out
and just suck in everything

00:43:57.970 --> 00:43:59.080
that you can possibly do.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.200
Because you need that,
you need to be inspired.

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:07.020
I saw "Hamilton," and it was one
of the best things I've seen.

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.440
Movie, TV, anything--

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.090
DAVID WAIN: It's the
best thing that's

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:13.479
happened in the arts
in the last 10 years.

00:44:13.479 --> 00:44:16.020
PAUL SCHEER: And I feel like
you need to see stuff like that.

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:19.830
Because I may not be
making a rap musical,

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:25.200
but just seeing someone
reenvision a form of Broadway

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.550
is like, oh, that's inspiring.

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:31.900
It's invigorating, it's
a very energizing thing

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:35.380
to let other people's
amazing ideas inspire you.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.880
DAVID WAIN: And the truth is,
the last thing I tend to watch

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.160
is comedy of any kind.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.314
I get inspired by and
entertained by things that

00:44:43.314 --> 00:44:44.480
don't feel like I'm at work.

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.320
PAUL SCHEER: I agree,
comedy is probably

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.900
lower on my list of things to
watch, besides "Family Feud."

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:49.775
You gotta watch that.

00:44:49.775 --> 00:44:52.080
Steve Harvey is a genius!

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.600
DAVID WAIN: And
"Nathan For You."

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.400
PAUL SCHEER: Oh, "Nathan
For You" is so great.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.108
JONATHAN STERN: But
that's beyond comedy.

00:44:57.259 --> 00:44:59.050
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Well,
thank you all so much

00:44:59.050 --> 00:44:59.925
for joining us today.

00:44:59.925 --> 00:45:02.420
We look forward to seeing
all of your various projects,

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:04.340
and the next evolution
of your work.

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:04.480
DAVID WAIN: Thank you, Dana.

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:04.860
This has been awesome.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.320
JONATHAN STERN: Dana!

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.090
PAUL SCHEER: Thank
you, everybody.

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:06.690
Thank you.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:10.174
