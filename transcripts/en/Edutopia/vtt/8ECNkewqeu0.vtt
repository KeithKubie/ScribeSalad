&gt;&gt;Pat Ryan: Schools that close the
achievement gap do things differently,

00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:24.246
and there are three conventional
wisdoms they do not subscribe to.

00:00:24.246 --> 00:00:25.886
They realize they're actually wrong.

00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:31.566
There are three counter-intuitive
truths that they understand,

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.346
internalize and drive their success.

00:00:39.686 --> 00:00:43.576
&gt;&gt; So the first conventional wisdom
is that the thing that matters most is

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.476
to have a highly-skilled teacher.

00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:48.316
Now, that's true, you want
a highly-skilled teacher.

00:00:48.316 --> 00:00:49.536
There's no question about it.

00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:53.376
But, in practice, great
schools are built by teams.

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:57.686
That team that's highly
aligned, that's focused,

00:00:57.686 --> 00:01:00.926
that has a passionate commitment
to working together to achieve it,

00:01:01.286 --> 00:01:02.606
all the great schools have that.

00:01:02.756 --> 00:01:05.956
If we don't have alignment on
how we want to run the school,

00:01:05.956 --> 00:01:08.576
what are the philosophies
and beliefs and practices

00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:10.676
that we have, then it won't work.

00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:13.436
It's more than just great
teaching that matters.

00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:16.216
It's this highly-aligned
team, committed, passionate,

00:01:16.216 --> 00:01:18.376
behind the right plan,
executing it well.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.016
&gt;&gt;The best schools spend more
time up front on core academics.

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:26.136
You may have envisioned to have the
greatest writing program in the world,

00:01:26.876 --> 00:01:30.546
but if your kids don't have basic
literacy skills you can't move

00:01:30.546 --> 00:01:31.366
on to the next level.

00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:34.196
You have to build one level at a
time, starting with the foundation.

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:35.786
That allows you to focus.

00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:39.076
In the end, you want to
be great across the board,

00:01:39.476 --> 00:01:41.386
but that's not how greatness is created.

00:01:41.806 --> 00:01:43.336
You need that hyper focus.

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:46.936
You need to understand the sequence of
how things work and how to build it.

00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:49.886
If you do that, then it's achievable.

00:01:52.196 --> 00:01:55.956
&gt;&gt; The third conventional wisdom
is we're very focused on inputs.

00:01:56.056 --> 00:01:57.256
We want to see good teaching.

00:01:57.256 --> 00:01:58.896
We want to see good implementation.

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:03.056
We want to see that schools
are using best practices.

00:02:03.436 --> 00:02:09.496
It turns out that the focus on inputs
fails to put us in a position to learn.

00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:13.176
The great schools ask the
question, is it working?

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:16.676
Is our plan, the way we're
teaching, what we're teaching,

00:02:16.676 --> 00:02:18.226
how we're teaching, is it working?

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:19.956
They're sitting down
together going, "Did it work?"

00:02:20.376 --> 00:02:22.996
If not, hey, what are we going
to do different next month.

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:24.576
Oh, and by the way, how
do we help the kids

00:02:24.576 --> 00:02:26.796
to make sure nobody gets left behind.

00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:33.586
That continuous improvement cycle is the
secret to elite performance in anything.

00:02:33.856 --> 00:02:37.256
If you look to get better,
you can create great things

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:39.706
where kids can achieve
whatever they're capable of.
