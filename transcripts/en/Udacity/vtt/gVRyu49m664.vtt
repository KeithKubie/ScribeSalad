00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.450
You have been setting up event
listeners using jQuery's on method.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.840
Now this works really well, but

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.600
jQuery also has some convenience
methods that you can use.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.930
Let's take a look.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.460
This is how we would set
up an event listener for

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.730
a keypress on every input field.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.310
We could rewrite this using jQuery's
convenience method by replacing the on

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.230
with the keypress.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.470
And now we don't have to specify
the event type because the convenience

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.830
method implies it.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:27.870
See?

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.440
Much nicer.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.210
Looking at the keypress documentation,
you'll see jQuery point out

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.130
that the keypress function
is actually a shortcut for

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.030
the on method,
passing keypress as an argument.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.450
It's important to know that there
aren't convenience methods for

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.020
every event type.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.192
Take a minute to look up what methods
are available on jQuery's API site.

00:00:48.192 --> 00:00:50.460
I have linked to the appropriate
page in the instructor notes.
