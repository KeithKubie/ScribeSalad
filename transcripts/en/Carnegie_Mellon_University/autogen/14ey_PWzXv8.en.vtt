trying to capture that persona right
modcloth we don't have that because we

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:26.780
modcloth we don't have that because we
 

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.960
modcloth we don't have that because we
we cover such a broad spectrum of style

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:28.970
we cover such a broad spectrum of style
 

00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:31.720
we cover such a broad spectrum of style
you know from everything from like emo

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:31.730
you know from everything from like emo
 

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:35.020
you know from everything from like emo
to retro to indy to vintage so all those

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:35.030
to retro to indy to vintage so all those
 

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:37.000
to retro to indy to vintage so all those
things are really difficult to capture I

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:37.010
things are really difficult to capture I
 

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:39.810
things are really difficult to capture I
mean are buying ranges anywhere between

00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:39.820
mean are buying ranges anywhere between
 

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:44.470
mean are buying ranges anywhere between
i'd say like 15 to 35 but that's really

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480
i'd say like 15 to 35 but that's really
 

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.030
i'd say like 15 to 35 but that's really
not I mean that's such a broad spectrum

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:46.040
not I mean that's such a broad spectrum
 

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.910
not I mean that's such a broad spectrum
of women and so it is difficult for us

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:48.920
of women and so it is difficult for us
 

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.350
of women and so it is difficult for us
to profile but we intentionally don't

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:50.360
to profile but we intentionally don't
 

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.640
to profile but we intentionally don't
profile because that would actually

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:51.650
profile because that would actually
 

00:53:51.650 --> 00:54:00.500
profile because that would actually
limit the type of products that we buy

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:00.510
 

00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:02.730
yeah that's a great question so what's

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:02.740
yeah that's a great question so what's
 

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:05.610
yeah that's a great question so what's
our average order by I would say you

00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:05.620
our average order by I would say you
 

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:07.860
our average order by I would say you
know it there's obviously a huge

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:07.870
know it there's obviously a huge
 

00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:10.950
know it there's obviously a huge
variance but in the beginning of the

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960
variance but in the beginning of the
 

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.720
variance but in the beginning of the
year you know our average buys would be

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:12.730
year you know our average buys would be
 

00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:15.690
year you know our average buys would be
like 70 pieces per unit upper product

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:15.700
like 70 pieces per unit upper product
 

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:18.120
like 70 pieces per unit upper product
and then you know right now going into

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:18.130
and then you know right now going into
 

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:19.710
and then you know right now going into
holiday you know we're trending anywhere

00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:19.720
holiday you know we're trending anywhere
 

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:23.460
holiday you know we're trending anywhere
around like 300-400 be the buyers even

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:23.470
around like 300-400 be the buyers even
 

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:24.960
around like 300-400 be the buyers even
more because it's already been voted in

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:24.970
more because it's already been voted in
 

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:26.580
more because it's already been voted in
so those be the buyer items can be

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:26.590
so those be the buyer items can be
 

00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:29.100
so those be the buyer items can be
anywhere for like 500 600 it's

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:29.110
anywhere for like 500 600 it's
 

00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:30.420
anywhere for like 500 600 it's
interesting because you know we want to

00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:30.430
interesting because you know we want to
 

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:32.550
interesting because you know we want to
always retain that scarcity model but

00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:32.560
always retain that scarcity model but
 

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:34.350
always retain that scarcity model but
how do you retain a scarcely model when

00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:34.360
how do you retain a scarcely model when
 

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:35.640
how do you retain a scarcely model when
you're trying to buy to demand and

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:35.650
you're trying to buy to demand and
 

00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:37.980
you're trying to buy to demand and
demand is always increasing so it is a

00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:37.990
demand is always increasing so it is a
 

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:40.110
demand is always increasing so it is a
challenging it's a challenging framework

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:40.120
challenging it's a challenging framework
 

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.250
challenging it's a challenging framework
that we're trying to we're still

00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:41.260
that we're trying to we're still
 

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.140
that we're trying to we're still
navigating you know we have some pretty

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:43.150
navigating you know we have some pretty
 

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:44.940
navigating you know we have some pretty
advanced statistical models that we use

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:44.950
advanced statistical models that we use
 

00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:47.550
advanced statistical models that we use
to try to predict our byes and and so

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:47.560
to try to predict our byes and and so
 

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:48.390
to try to predict our byes and and so
we're trying to solve it in different

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400
we're trying to solve it in different
 

00:54:48.400 --> 00:55:00.910
we're trying to solve it in different
ways but yeah it's a great question

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:00.920
 

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:02.650
so you probably need to ask someone

00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:02.660
so you probably need to ask someone
 

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:05.830
so you probably need to ask someone
who's closer to our demographic than I

00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:05.840
who's closer to our demographic than I
 

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:33.450

00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000
challenges we have a certain style that
 

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.540
challenges we have a certain style that
we're trying to you know continue to go

00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:29.550
we're trying to you know continue to go
 

00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:31.580
we're trying to you know continue to go
down that line that it's actually very

point and so that's one of the
 

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.450
point and so that's one of the
challenges I mean it's actually it's

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:38.460
challenges I mean it's actually it's
 

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:40.130
challenges I mean it's actually it's
it's not it's not so broad in terms of
