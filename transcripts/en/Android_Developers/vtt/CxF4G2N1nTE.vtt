&gt;&gt; KANNINEN: Hi, I'm Mike Kanninen. I built
the MySpace Application for Android.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.940
&gt;&gt; TOMAS: Hi, I'm Tomas. I built the Shazam
Application for Android.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.100
&gt;&gt; LONGAN: Hi, I'm Casey Longan(ph). I built
the Amazon MP3 Store for Android.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.349
&gt;&gt; TOMAS: So when you use the Shazam Application
after you've tag a sound, you have access

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.599
to some other applications. So you can click
on MySpace, you can open the MySpace application,

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:25.099
you can click on Amazon MP3 and you open the
Amazon MP3 application. All of that was really,

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.050
really easy to develop, so.
&gt;&gt; KANNINEN: Yeah, for MySpace, we just specified

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.960
a UI pattern so that they can send the View
Intent to open a MySpace profile with our

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.780
new application the upcoming shows and whatnot.
&gt;&gt; LONGAN: For Amazon MP3, you just create

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.559
a new Intent with the explicit package name,
activity name, stuff, a couple key value pairs

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.329
in a bundle and fire the Intent.
&gt;&gt; TOMAS: So, using an Android, linking between

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.359
applications is very easy using the Intents.
So it was just so straightforward as having

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.829
the Intents specification and just using it.
