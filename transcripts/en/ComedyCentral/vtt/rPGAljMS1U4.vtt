00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:32.599

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:41.642
&gt;&gt; WHAT THE [BLEEP] IS WITH
THIS.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:43.610
&gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO KNOW WHO TO
PAY, MAN.

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:45.412
&gt;&gt; FIRST GUY TO SAY BROWS ON
FLEEK.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:50.384

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.294
EDDIE.

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:06.633
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE FIRST GUY TO
BE EATEN BY HIS OWN CHAIR.

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:09.937
&gt;&gt; Chris: POINTS.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.372
