00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's go through it.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is, again, a tricky quiz because it requires two kinds of reasoning.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
each string, we have to figure out whether it's in r or not and also whether it's in P or not.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We just saw in the previous quiz that unbalanced parentheses, like this single open,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
are not in P. This is looking good so far.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For it to be part of the answer we want, we'd have to show that it is in r.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If we look carefully, in fact it is. Here's how I'm going to do it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
For this first opening parentheses for this star, I'm going to repeat it one time.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Then for this closing parentheses for this totally different star,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm going to repeat it zero times.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm going to end up with one open and zero closes.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This unbalanced open parenthesis is in the regular expression,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but not in the language of the grammar.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
How about this balanced open followed by close?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Well, that is in the language of P.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I apply rule one and then rule two to get rid of the P. I fails our second clause.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
How about this? Open close close? This is unbalanced.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The scales would be tipped to the right. It's not in P. We're looking good so far.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Is it in r? Yes. For this star, I'm going to repeat is once.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
For this totally unrelated star, I'm going to repeat it twice.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Both of these--open-open-close-close and open-open-open-close-close-close--

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
they're all in P, so they're disqualified because of clause 2.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
In fact, all of the strings here are in the language of r.

00:01:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
It's just that these three are also in the language of P.
