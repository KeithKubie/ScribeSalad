00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.505
No, 2.5 is not part of the solution
set for both of these.

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:11.055
2.5 falls right here, which is in
the solutions set for x is less than 3,

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:15.760
but it's not on the solution set for
x is less than or equal to 2.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.970
So plugging 2.5 in for

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.220
x and x is less than 3 is only
true here, it is not true here.
