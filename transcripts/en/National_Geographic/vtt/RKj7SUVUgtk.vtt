00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:03.900
Our thirst for exploration
has transformed our species

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.433
from nomads into astronauts,
spurring new innovations,

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:11.300
opening up the globe,
and clearing the path

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.533
to new and distant worlds.

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.934
We explore, not just
to reach new lands

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:20.367
but for the journey itself.

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:23.266
It is in the adventure that
we discover who we really are.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.266
Our discoveries
about the world are

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:31.100
rivaled only by what
has been revealed

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.934
about the human condition.

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:35.500
We are a race of explorers.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.867
We risk our lives in the
pursuit of new frontiers, new

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:44.734
experiences, and new knowledge.

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:48.300
The spirit of discovery
is built into our biology,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.066
our culture, and our mythology.

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:57.033
No man can fully grasp how
far and how fast we have come.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:59.867
[music playing]

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.433
Wherever adventure takes us in
the future, whatever challenges

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:16.266
we face, we know that
the spirit of discovery

00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:19.400
will always guide us.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.867
Our journey has only just begun.

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:28.800
We set sail on this
new sea because there

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.166
is new knowledge to be gained.

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:39.133
Because that goal will serve to
organize and measure the best

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:43.000
of our energies and skills.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.100
Because that challenge is one
that we're willing to accept.

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:55.467
The vast stretches of the
unknown and the unanswered

00:01:55.467 --> 00:02:00.667
still far outstretch our
collective comprehension.
