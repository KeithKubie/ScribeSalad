00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:03.353
- Today Ebuka opened a new cereal box.

00:00:03.353 --> 00:00:04.816
He ate a bowl of the cereal,

00:00:04.816 --> 00:00:08.940
which was 8 percent of the
cereal in the entire box.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.224
It Ebuka continues to eat
this much cereal in each bowl,

00:00:13.224 --> 00:00:15.723
approximately how many
more bowls of cereal

00:00:15.723 --> 00:00:19.279
can he expect to get from this box?

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.139
So, when the box is new,
he eats 8 percent of it.

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:25.374
But we're assuming that
he eats that same amount.

00:00:25.374 --> 00:00:27.101
So this is the bowl.

00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:29.031
So this is his cereal right over here.

00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:31.327
On the first day, this
is going to be 8 percent.

00:00:31.327 --> 00:00:33.886
When he eats that same
amount the next day,

00:00:33.886 --> 00:00:35.136
when he eats that same amount the next day

00:00:35.136 --> 00:00:36.599
it's gonna be more than 8 percent.

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:38.773
So this is 8 percent of a new box.

00:00:38.773 --> 00:00:42.389
8 percent of a new

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:45.294
of a, of a new,

00:00:45.294 --> 00:00:47.570
of a new box.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.319
So how many times can he do that?

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:52.893
How many times can you take
8 percent of that new box?

00:00:52.893 --> 00:00:55.596
Well, if the new box is 100 percent,

00:00:55.596 --> 00:00:59.099
well how many groups of 8
can you divide that into?

00:00:59.099 --> 00:01:02.629
Well, let's just take
100 and divide it by 8.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:03.503
One way to think about it,

00:01:03.503 --> 00:01:04.376
you can just pick a number,

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:08.904
maybe the original box
is some hundred units,

00:01:08.904 --> 00:01:12.224
and then on each day he's
gonna eat 8 percent of that.

00:01:12.224 --> 00:01:14.644
Which is gonna be 8 units.

00:01:14.644 --> 00:01:15.820
And I don't know what the units might be.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.999
It might be milligrams,

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:19.297
or actually it would probably be grams,

00:01:19.297 --> 00:01:23.195
or even, or ounces, or
whatever else it might be.

00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:24.983
But then you just get 100 divided by 8,

00:01:24.983 --> 00:01:26.263
how many servings of 8 can he get

00:01:26.263 --> 00:01:28.031
if he starts off with 100?

00:01:28.031 --> 00:01:30.286
Well, 100 divided by 8 is, let's see,

00:01:30.286 --> 00:01:31.953
12 times 8 is 96.

00:01:31.953 --> 00:01:35.466
So it's gonna be 12 and four-eighths,

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:38.026
or 12.5.

00:01:38.026 --> 00:01:39.514
So, he's gonna be able to get

00:01:39.514 --> 00:01:43.350
approximately 12 and-a-half bowls.
