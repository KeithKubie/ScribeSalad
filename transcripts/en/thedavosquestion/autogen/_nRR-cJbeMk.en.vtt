hello I'm Julia King from Aston
University in the United Kingdom and I'm

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319
University in the United Kingdom and I'm
 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.889
University in the United Kingdom and I'm
on the automotive Council and we've been

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899
on the automotive Council and we've been
 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.049
on the automotive Council and we've been
having a very lively debate and we've

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059
having a very lively debate and we've
 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.600
having a very lively debate and we've
come down to three areas where we are

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610
come down to three areas where we are
 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.070
come down to three areas where we are
taking things forward and one is in

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080
taking things forward and one is in
 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.429
taking things forward and one is in
trying to put together a whole economy

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439
trying to put together a whole economy
 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.240
trying to put together a whole economy
framework probably based on the work of

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250
framework probably based on the work of
 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.830
framework probably based on the work of
the International Energy Agency to which

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840
the International Energy Agency to which
 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.230
the International Energy Agency to which
we would try and get some agreement from

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240
we would try and get some agreement from
 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.659
we would try and get some agreement from
the automotive industry about where

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669
the automotive industry about where
 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.110
the automotive industry about where
we're trying to get to in 2050 that's a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
we're trying to get to in 2050 that's a
 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.760
we're trying to get to in 2050 that's a
that's really quite a challenging

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770
that's really quite a challenging
 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.660
that's really quite a challenging
long-term position but the other two

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
long-term position but the other two
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.170
long-term position but the other two
shorter term areas are we are going to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
shorter term areas are we are going to
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.299
shorter term areas are we are going to
need to see over the next 20 years kind

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309
need to see over the next 20 years kind
 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.850
need to see over the next 20 years kind
of high rate of change of Technology and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860
of high rate of change of Technology and
 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.170
of high rate of change of Technology and
yet we have standardization processes

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180
yet we have standardization processes
 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.779
yet we have standardization processes
and approval processes for new safety

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789
and approval processes for new safety
 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.880
and approval processes for new safety
measures and things which are done by

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890
measures and things which are done by
 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.799
measures and things which are done by
committee structures where agreement can

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809
committee structures where agreement can
 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.680
committee structures where agreement can
take many years to agree to a change and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690
take many years to agree to a change and
 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.170
take many years to agree to a change and
if we're going to manage to absorb this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180
if we're going to manage to absorb this
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.090
if we're going to manage to absorb this
high rate of change of technology for

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
high rate of change of technology for
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.859
high rate of change of technology for
the benefit of mankind in the automotive

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869
the benefit of mankind in the automotive
 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.410
the benefit of mankind in the automotive
area we need to radically reduce the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420
area we need to radically reduce the
 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.570
area we need to radically reduce the
time it takes us to get those brings so

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580
time it takes us to get those brings so
 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.190
time it takes us to get those brings so
we need new models and new processes

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
we need new models and new processes
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.130
we need new models and new processes
there and the third row exciting area is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140
there and the third row exciting area is
 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.440
there and the third row exciting area is
going to be the impact the potential

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
going to be the impact the potential
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.560
going to be the impact the potential
impact of connectivity on things like

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
impact of connectivity on things like
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.960
impact of connectivity on things like
safety and congestion and the way we

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970
safety and congestion and the way we
 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.140
safety and congestion and the way we
drive and share our cars and that's

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
drive and share our cars and that's
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.060
drive and share our cars and that's
something we can look at immediately

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070
something we can look at immediately
 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.149
something we can look at immediately
because almost every driver whether in

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
because almost every driver whether in
 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.370
because almost every driver whether in
the in the rich world or the rapidly

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
the in the rich world or the rapidly
 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.140
the in the rich world or the rapidly
developing world almost every driver has

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150
developing world almost every driver has
 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.530
developing world almost every driver has
a mobile phone so thinking not about you

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
a mobile phone so thinking not about you
 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.350
a mobile phone so thinking not about you
say about the very futuristic autonomous

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
say about the very futuristic autonomous
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.389
say about the very futuristic autonomous
vehicles but thinking now about the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399
vehicles but thinking now about the
 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.940
vehicles but thinking now about the
radical effect that that connectivity we

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
radical effect that that connectivity we
 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.450
radical effect that that connectivity we
already have can have in the next 10 or

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460
already have can have in the next 10 or
 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.940
already have can have in the next 10 or
even 15 years so some very immediate

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
even 15 years so some very immediate
 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.049
even 15 years so some very immediate
exciting and beneficial in cups
