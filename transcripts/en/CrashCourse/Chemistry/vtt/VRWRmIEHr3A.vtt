00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.330
Some of the best moments of my life have happened
in labs. Also some of the worst.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.270
Like the time that I took a week to prepare
a sample for NMR analysis,

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.499
and then a classmate washed out the vials
while I was sleeping for the first time in 3 days.

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.740
Because he "couldn't find anything else" to
use for his experiment.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.020
Interestingly, that resulted in my personal
most significant laboratory injury.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.260
We all have one; I cut my hand while punching
a paper towel dispenser in frustration.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.720
No one ever brought it up again.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.560
Today, we're going to talk about how to avoid
injury in the lab,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.660
and some good techniques for using laboratory
equipment correctly.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.200
First two lessons already learned:

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.580
never wash out a vial you aren't familiar
with and don't punch paper towel dispensers.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:50.840
[Theme Music]

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.079
Let's start with some very basic safety stuff;
your hair.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.760
If your hair is long, it shall always be up
in the lab.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.130
If it is not, it will catch on fire.
I've seen it happen.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.370
It can also knock stuff over, and occlude
your vision, and droop into your flasks.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.880
Same thing goes for anything that might hang
off your body in the lab.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.960
Droopy clothing, especially sleeves, are a
total disaster.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.200
Clothes should cover your body as much as
possible; I like to go long-sleeve even.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.100
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever wear sandals
in a lab.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.090
Long pants, closed-toed shoes, and socks;
clothing that covers your entire torso. Always.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.680
I'm sure you look hunky in your muscle shirts,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.960
and I have nothing against exposed midriffs
as a principle, but not in the lab.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.840
Of course your eyes are your most vulnerable
organ.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.390
Always wear eye protection, and no, just glasses
do not count.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.759
And if you feel like your eyes are starting
to tingle, or hurt,

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.650
or even if you don't know how something might
have gotten in there, use the eye wash.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.920
Because it never hurts to be careful, and,
you know, we've all wondered what it feels like.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.670
I've actually never done this, so this will
be a new experience for me. Aaagh.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.159
Gah! It does not feel particularly pleasant,
but it's better than having your eyes burned out.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.509
Do not eat or drink in the lab.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.250
Despite our best efforts, stuff does sometimes
get where we don't want it to be,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.450
and if it gets in your food, or you accidentally
pick up the wrong cup,

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.250
that's just a really embarrassing story for
your obituary.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.140
Also I would generally suggest avoiding working
alone in a lab,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.480
especially if you're working with any machinery
or hazardous substances.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.120
But it will be up to you and your advisers
to make that decision when the time comes.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.450
You may have seen this little symbol before,
here.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.040
It's the Hazardous Material or HazMat diamond,
and it's got some useful information in it.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.180
Each little box is rated 0 to 4. Zero being "no big deal," and four being HOLY MONKEY BE CAREFUL.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.230
Blue is for health, the red is for flammability,
and yellow is for chemical reactivity.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.879
A 4 in health means certain kinds of exposure
will kill you.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.319
A 4 in fire is both very flammable and gaseous, so impossible to control outside of a closed container.

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.120
And a 4 in reactivity means that it is capable
of exploding at room temperature.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.340
The little area underneath is for any extra
information like if it's radioactive,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.140
or reacts violently with water or something.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.340
If you ever need to know more about a chemical
and what it might do to you or to the world,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.250
there is the good 'ole MSDS, the material
safety data sheet.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.040
Every chemical has one, and it'll tell you
all the terrible things that it might do to you.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.550
If you ever need to find one really fast,
you don't need to go to the cabinet anymore;

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.820
you can just Google 'MSDS HCl' or whatever chemical you think is in the process of killing your friend.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.340
There will be information on how best to treat
the person who got exposed.

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.589
Of course, you should have always read the
MSDS before you even touch a chemical.

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:37.560
Also, you should probably assume that every
liquid in a lab that is not water is flammable.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.629
This baby here is a fume hood.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.829
It sucks all the air in there out, so you don't have to breathe whatever is going on in there.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.950
It's also why it's impossible to keep chemistry
labs at the proper temperature,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.239
because the A/C units and heating units are
constantly pumping in controlled air,

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.500
and these are constantly sucking it out.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.620
So if you're doing some chemistry that might
contain some noxious fumes, that goes on in here.

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.319
And if you want it to work properly, first
you gotta turn it in.

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.670
That's the vent and that's the blower.
Now it is sucking air.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.780
The second thing you want to do is make sure
the sash is at the right level.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.239
This has a little thing that tells you where
the sash is supposed to go.

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.370
If you go above that, on this model,
[machine buzzes] it'll buzz at you.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.970
If the sash is higher than that, it's not
gonna properly vent all the stuff to the outside;

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.319
some of it might get into your face and that
would be bad.

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:26.939
As a side note here, if something happens
to you in the lab and if you don't know whether it was serious or minor;

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.900
you're not sure, just tell your instructor.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.839
I once inhaled a bit of nitric oxide which, though initially extremely unpleasant, seemed to subside after a while.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.940
But it can have longer term effects: headache, nausea, disorientation, dizziness, pulmonary edema, death.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.020
So I'm glad I fessed up, so that I could get
taken care of.

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:49.539
Speaking of, if you want to know what something
smells like, do not stick your face in it.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.569
Waft, waft it toward your face.

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:56.550
Also never test something by tasting it, obviously.
And never pipette by mouth.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.909
I hear people say that and like who would,

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:02.199
but then I just found out that Heiko, the
chemistry consultant for Crash Course,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.860
has twice gotten HCl in his mouth by-from pipetting by mouth, which I will never forgive you for.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.740
That is what these things are for.

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:13.800
You put that on the end there, and then you
go one; you draw the liquid up with this thing.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.819
That's what that's for! Also, these days, most pipetting is done by these guys, which are way cooler anyway.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.500
Pipetting is one way to move a substance from one container to another, and it's a pretty good one.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.600
But if you want to pour, you can pour, but
let me just give you a tip: commit.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.620
We tend to get all nervous when pouring stuff in the chemistry lab and go all slow with it, but that's terrible;

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.340
you won't overcome the surface tension and it'll dribble down the side of the container, so just commit!

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.839
At the beginning and at the end.
Destroy that surface tension!

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:40.999
OK, back to safety.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.740
The most common lab injuries are cuts and
punctures,

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.520
and the most common source of those is cleaning up broken glass, which you should not do with your hands,

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.240
but with a broom and a dustpan, and then deposit
the results into a bin specifically for sharp stuff.

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:59.020
But the worst thing, and it has happened so
many times and it's so terrible,

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.309
is forcing a glass rod, or thermometer, or
a piece of tubing through a stopper

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:08.179
and then it breaks and then right into and
through your hand.

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:12.669
And it's -- you're in the hospital and you're
in pain for the rest of your life, probably.

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.179
So when you're doing this, and it is sometimes
necessary,

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:20.339
you can use a bit of water or lubricant or some kind of Vaseline to make it easier to go through,

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:23.719
and then you hold it close and make sure your
hand is not on the other side.

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:30.990
So very close to make it go through like that;
not like this, 'cause that's...no.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.379
When you're done with an experiment, do not
just dump the results into the sink,

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:38.999
unless this has been explicitly approved by
the person in charge of chemical safety.

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:44.240
For some chemicals, like common acids or bases,
dilution is the solution to pollution.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.399
When they get diluted, all that's left is
common ions like chloride ions from HCl or

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:50.719
sodium ions from sodium hydroxide,

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:54.649
in addition to some protons or hydroxide ions
that are neutralized by buffer ions that are

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:56.559
present in your sewage system anyway.

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:59.270
Bottom line is they can be flushed with lots
of water.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.849
For other chemicals, flushing is not a good
idea.

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:04.599
It probably won't hurt you, but it might hurt
the environment.

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:09.490
Do put the products into an appropriate waste
container, but not just any waste container.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.819
Different solvents and reagents have to be
disposed of differently,

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:14.899
and if you dump some stuff into the wrong
container,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.080
it can totally end up reacting with the other things that have been dumped in there. Not good.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.480
Rule of thumb: always know the right way to dispose of something before you even start to use it.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.599
This is an apron.

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:27.619
It protects you and your clothes just a bit
extra

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:30.830
in case you're working with something hazardous
like concentrated acids.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.080
Aprons are nice because they're easy to get
off if you spill something on them,

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.969
while if you're wearing pants, you might hesitate
a bit too long before you ditch 'em.

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:44.270
Which reminds me: if you spill more than just
a bit of anything super bad on your pants,

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.029
modesty goes out the window; just take them
off.

00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:51.529
Also, while you're taking them off, you might
want to run over to this guy here.

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:55.610
His job is to dump a gigantic amount of water
on you really fast.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.770
Now usually you don't get to see these things
in action unless there is an actual emergency,

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:04.849
but to thank you for sticking with us through this somewhat disjointed lecture on safety in the lab...

00:08:04.849 --> 00:08:15.080
I'm gonna take this off.
That's a lot of water! Aah!

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.380
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:22.909
If you were listening, you learned what to
wear in the lab, how to dispose of chemicals,

00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:25.800
how to avoid the most common accidents in
the laboratory,

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.209
how to pour properly,
what the HazMat diamond is,

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:31.949
what an MSDS is,
and how to use a fume hood.

00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:35.389
