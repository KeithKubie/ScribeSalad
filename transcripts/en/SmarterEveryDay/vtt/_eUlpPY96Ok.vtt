Hey it's me Destin. Welcome to this week in Smarter Every Day. Today we're gonna try to figure

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.040
something out that I've always wondered. What happens when you shoot a pistol

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.570
underwater. I think revolvers are gonna act a little different than semi-automatic pistols.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.110
[music]

00:00:18.130 --> 00:01:07.750
           

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.500
Alright, here we are in the field, this is the setup. So what we have here is a revolver

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.540
in an aquarium that we made out of plate glass and silicone. This should be

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.580
pretty cool, but we're gonna film this with this Phantom v10

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.610
camera made by Vision Research. We're gonna film it at 2200 frames per second.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.630
We've got about a 40 microsecond exposure time. But in order to get enough light we have to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.670
use this, which is a 15 million candle power spotlight.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.700
This should be pretty cool, but the intent here is we're gonna fill this up with water

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.740
over the pistol, and we're gonna see if we can capture that gas bubble as it comes between

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.760
the revolver and the barrel. It should expand, and hopefully not blow up.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.780
But I'm expecting this to blow up. And immediately after we capture all that

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.790
video we're gonna compress it into a pretty small format and then we're gonna

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.800
beam it via this satellite dish straight to the 80s so that my granddad can.. I'm just kidding.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.530
Anyway, let's do the shot.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.840
[music]

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:30.850
     

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.060
Do I look as sad as I feel? [laugh]

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.080
Or maybe nervous? I really don't want this to blow up

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.130
because I don't have money to buy it again if it does, so...

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.210
I'm doing this so you can learn. You don't have to blow your pistol up.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:57.230
 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.280
[music]

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:28.500
     

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.540
Alright, let's see if she lived. I really hope so.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.570
3..2..1.. [bang]

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.610
Yay Ruger. Alright so now let's talk about the results.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.660
To my knowledge this is the first time handguns have been studied like this, and there's

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.670
obviously a lot of stuff to learn here but I'll focus on three things that are pretty simple.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.690
The first thing is, it was pretty clear that as soon as the hammer

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.730
struck the firing pin which hit the primer, there was an outgassing, you could

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.760
actually see a bubble. It's pretty interesting. My assumption is that

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.780
that's the seal around the primer breaking down and causing a little outgassing.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.800
Nothing really new there. The second thing that we learned is it appears that

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.820
the semi-automatic pistol is more efficient at applying the gases generated by the cartridge

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.840
to the back of the bullet creating more velocity than the revolver.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.900
You noticed when the revolver fired there was this large blast wave

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.930
that came out from between the revolver cylinder and the barrel. All that is

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.950
wasted energy that could be applied to increasing the velocity of the round, which wasn't.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.980
So that was also pretty interesting. The next thing that we learned

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.990
is when the weapon is fired, you see this large blast

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.000
wave come out the front of the weapon. Now the assumption is, or at least the assumption

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.030
I made to begin with is that it's a spherical blast wave. It's actually

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.040
not. It's more like a bagel or doughnut.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.050
It's what's called a toroidal vortex. Root word being

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.100
torus. So if you were to take this

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.120
and... let me draw this... alright.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.160
So this is kinda what's happening here. The gases are coming out

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.210
from the barrel, and they're going in a loop around

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.230
the outside of the bullet. Toroidal vortex, that's what's going on there.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.250
Anyway, there's a whole lot to learn here. I hope you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.290
Have a good one.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.370
