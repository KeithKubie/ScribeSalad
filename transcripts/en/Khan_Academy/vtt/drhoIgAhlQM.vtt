00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.992
We're are asked to find the
cube root of negative 343.

00:00:04.992 --> 00:00:07.480
Or another way to think
about it is some number

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.860
that when I multiply it
by itself three times,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.985
I'm going to get negative 343.

00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:14.325
Or another way to view
it-- this is the same thing

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:20.634
as negative 343
to the 1/3 power.

00:00:20.634 --> 00:00:22.300
And the best way to
do this is to really

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.964
just try to factor this out.

00:00:23.964 --> 00:00:25.630
So the first thing
that we could do-- so

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.516
let me just factor negative 343.

00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:28.890
So the first thing
I'd like to do

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.780
is just factor out
the negative 1.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.895
So this is the same thing
as negative 1 times 343.

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:37.310
And let's think about this.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.600
Is this divisible by 2?

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.100
No.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.776
Is it divisible by 3?

00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:44.650
Let's see-- the digits do not
add up to a multiple of 3.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.850
They add up to 10.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.230
So it's not divisible by 3.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.440
Not divisible by
4 since it's odd.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.620
Not divisible by 5 because it
doesn't end with a 5 or a 0.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.750
It's not divisible by 6, because
it's not divisible by 2 or 3.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.160
Is it divisible by 7?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.220
Let's check this out.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:05.165
So 7 goes into 343-- 7
goes into 34 four times.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:09.390
4 times 7 is 28.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.530
34 minus 28 is going to be 6.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.010
Bring down the 3.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.380
7 goes into 63
exactly nine times.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.570
So then we end up-- so 9
times 7 is 63, no remainder.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.050
So this is going
to be 7 times 49.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.340
And we know that 49 is the
same thing as 7 times 7.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.660
So how can we rewrite this?

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.590
This is the same thing
as taking the cube

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.500
root of negative 1
times 7 times 7 times

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.440
7, which is the same
thing as taking the cube

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.980
root of negative 1 times the
cube root of 7 times 7 times 7.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.670
Now, what's the cube
root of negative 1?

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.350
Well, negative 1 times itself
three times is negative 1.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.090
So this right here
is negative 1.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.130
You could verify it.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.710
Negative 1 times negative
1 times negative 1

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.440
is indeed negative 1.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.880
This becomes positive 1.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.340
Multiply by negative 1
again, you get negative 1.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.000
So this is negative 1.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.120
And then this over here,
the cube root of 7 times

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.920
7 times 7-- well, that's
just going to be 7.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.110
7 multiplied by
itself three times

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.650
gives us 7 times
7 times 7 or 343.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.270
So it's going to
be negative 1 times

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.470
7, which is the same
thing as negative 7.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.620
So our answer is negative 7.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.770
And we're done.
