00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.880
Well let's see.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.387
At week zero,
I'm going to plug in zero for x.

00:00:03.387 --> 00:00:09.597
And I get y=200-10(0).

00:00:09.597 --> 00:00:10.688
Which is just zero.

00:00:10.688 --> 00:00:12.720
So he owes $200.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.010
And of course, that was right after
his parents gave him the money.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.270
He still owed it all back to him.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.800
What about at week 20?

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.964
Well now, y= 200 -10(20),

00:00:23.964 --> 00:00:28.498
which is 200 minus 200 which is $0.

00:00:28.498 --> 00:00:30.289
