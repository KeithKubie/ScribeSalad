00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.341
(upbeat intro music)

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:11.677 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I just gotta reply to
my agent here over e-mail.

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:13.012
- Oh, did you get a job offer?

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:15.548
- Yeah, to teach
English in Korea.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.017
Where were we?

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.185 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Uh, we're in the middle
of your fake podcast.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.722 align:start size:84% position:16%
Look, David, I'm happy
to interview you,

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:25.124 align:start size:94% position:6%
but this isn't exactly
the networking opportunity

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:27.192
I had originally hoped for.

00:00:27.192 --> 00:00:28.394
- What are you talking about?

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:29.795
This is as good as
it gets in Hollywood.

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:31.930
A podcast in a storage unit.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.033
You get any bigger than this,

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:35.267
it's gonna be drugs,

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:37.303
boating accident, Buddhism,

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:39.305
you don't want any of that.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.974 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I don't know what my
college advisor's gonna think

00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:43.242
about this internship.

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:44.810
- College advisor? Who cares?

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.612
College is a waste of time.

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:49.949
I mean, I don't even
play colleges anymore.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:50.984
(silence)

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:51.985
(more silence)

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.486
(even more silence)

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.487
You wanna know why?

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:55.321
- Why?

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.155
- Funny story.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:56.989
(click)

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.891
(flashback whoosh)

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.126
(door opens)

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:01.427
- Uhhhh.

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:03.830
- Jesus, you can't
just come in here.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.633 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Dude, I just booked a
$2,000 college gig on Eid,

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:08.901
so I can't do it.

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:10.736
- Oh, you Muslims
need to loosen up.

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.238
Look at the Christians,

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.340
on their holiest day they got
a rabbit handing out candy.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.808
And the Jews...

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:17.476 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I get your point, but I
just fasted for a whole month

00:01:17.476 --> 00:01:18.911
so I have to eat with my family.

00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:20.145
(sighs)

00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:22.081
- Well, let me see if I
can clear my schedule.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.183
(boxes hit the floor)

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:25.618
Yeah, I could squeeze it in.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.186 align:start size:84% position:16%
- But what if there's
somebody better?

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:28.188
- What are you talking about?

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:29.188
I love college.

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:30.023
The late night parties,

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:30.857
the loud music,

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:32.358
the wild sex.

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:34.994 align:start position:0%
I mean, those are things I
report to the cops all the time.

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:37.463
(flashback whoosh)

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:39.799
(footsteps)

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:43.770
- Oh, hey.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.872
Millennial, huh?

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:48.040
Can you tell me where
the Student Union is?

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.475
- Let me ask you a question.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:50.776
Do you agree there's too much

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:52.878
income inequality these days?

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:54.513 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No, I think there
should be more.

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:55.815
I either wanna be filthy rich

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:57.517 align:start size:84% position:16%
or dirt poor scheming
with criminals,

00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:58.884
not driving a Honda.

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:00.152
(smirks)

00:02:00.152 --> 00:02:01.554
- Wow. You really
don't understand

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:02.855
what it's like to be poor.

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:06.058
Maybe try listening to
their story for once.

00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:07.994 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I do, every night
involuntarily.

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:09.195
I need thicker windows.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:10.463
(smirks)

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:13.966
- Okay. Okay. There's no
point in talking to you,

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:16.235 align:start size:84% position:16%
because you're clearly
just a brainwashed,

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:17.670
capitalist shill.

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:22.341 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Uh, okay.
Socialists, I get it.

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:23.575
Let me tell you something,

00:02:23.575 --> 00:02:25.911
MTV tried 25 years to
get seven strangers

00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:27.413
to live in a house together.

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:28.814
It doesn't work.

00:02:28.814 --> 00:02:29.648
- Fuck off.

00:02:29.648 --> 00:02:30.483
- Fuck you.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.517
- Yeah. - [Both] Shill.

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:32.851
- Take a class, learn something.

00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:33.686
- Audit something.

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:35.221
- I'm so tired of this.

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:38.324
- Hi. Do you have a moment
for sensible gun control?

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.825
- I don't know, I
kinda like guns.

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:42.261
I mean, people use them to
protect against tyranny.

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:44.229
- Wait, tyranny? Seriously?

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:46.398
Government's not
gonna come for you.

00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:47.766
- You liberals say that now,

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:49.268
let me tell you,
Trump gets elected,

00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:51.270 align:start size:84% position:16%
you're gonna have
Rachel Maddow on MSNBC

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.439
showing people how
to saw off a shotgun.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.174
- Okay. Fuck you dude.

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:56.676
- Yeah, fuck me.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.177
Everyone wants to fuck
me now, what's the story?

00:02:58.177 --> 00:02:59.445
- Nobody wants to fuck you.

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.046
- Okay. Hey, can you
tell me where the...

00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:01.881
- No.

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.116
- Black Lives Matter!

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:04.750
Black Lives Matter!

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.285
- Okay, relax pal.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:08.687
- We're here protesting the
lack of diversity on campus.

00:03:08.687 --> 00:03:09.755
There's too many white males.

00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:10.589
- Hmm.

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:12.091
- Like you.

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:14.760
- Me? Jesus pal, you make
me look like Nat King Cole.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.795 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I'm an ally of the
people of African descent

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:18.798
and all other minority groups.

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:20.633
It's important to use
our white male status

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:22.468 align:start size:88% position:13%
to help all
African-American groups

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:23.869
and other people of color.

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:25.237
Even undocumented immigrants.

00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:27.606
(protesters moan)

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:28.607
- Alright, well I agree.

00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:30.142
You know, I'm pro-immigrant.

00:03:30.142 --> 00:03:31.577
I mean, that said, I
think you should be

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:32.811
a fourth generation American

00:03:32.811 --> 00:03:34.313
to legally own stereo equipment.

00:03:34.313 --> 00:03:36.149
- Are you fucking
kidding me, man?

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:37.149
Get out of here!

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:38.083
Be gone!

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:38.984
White devil!

00:03:38.984 --> 00:03:39.986
(moans from protesters)

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:41.287
(protester screams)

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:44.489
(tranquil piano music)

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.592
(tranquil piano music continues)

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:48.260
(protesters yelling)

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.728
(whoosh)

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:50.829
- In the end, I had to cancel

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.598
the show 'cause of the boycott.

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:53.432
(burps)

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:54.267
(silence)

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.936
(more silence)
