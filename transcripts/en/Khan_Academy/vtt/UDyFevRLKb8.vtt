00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.820
We are on problem 17.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.290
Alice and Corinne stand
back-to-back.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.620
They each take 10 steps in
opposite directions away from

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.060
each other and stop.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.740
Alison turns around walks
towards Corinne and reaches

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.090
her in 17 steps.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.720
OK, so this is interesting.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.300
So they're back-to-back.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.775
Let's say Alice goes this way.

00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:27.130
And let's say A is
for Alice steps.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.740
So 10 Alice steps, we don't know
how long Alice steps are.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.540
And then Corinne had gone this
way and taken 10 Corinne

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.520
steps, right?

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.930
C is, I don't know how long she
takes per step, two feet?

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:42.970
Who knows?

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.850
But C is the distance of Corinne
steps in my little

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.410
world right here.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.700
OK, so they took ten steps in
opposite directions from each

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.240
other and stopped.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.730
Alison turns around and walks
towards Corinne and reaches

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.990
her in 17 steps.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.030
So this is where Corinne
is now, right?

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:07.380
So this whole distance here
is 17 Alice steps.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.010
The length of one of Alice steps
is how many times the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.920
length of one of Corinne's
steps?

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.580
And they say, all of Alice's
steps are the same length, and

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.990
all of Corinne's steps
are the same length.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.390
Well we know a couple
of things.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.680
We know to get to here
would have been 10

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.920
Alice steps, right?

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.790
This would have been
10 Alice steps.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.370
So essentially, in the same
distance that Corinne took 10

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.090
steps, Alice took what?

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.330
She took 7 steps, right?

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.500
She took 10 to get to the
middle, and then 7 more to get

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.476
to where Corinne is.

00:01:37.476 --> 00:01:39.870
So this is 7 Alice steps.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.470
So 7 times Alice step length is
equal to 10 times Corinne

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.830
step length, right?

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.610
I'm just saying 7a
is equal to 10c.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.740
And what do we want to know?

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.280
We want to know the length of
one of Alice's steps is how

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.840
many times the length of
one of Corinne's steps?

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.770
So we want to solve for a.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.786
So Alice's step is equal to--
divide both sides by 7-- is

00:01:57.786 --> 00:02:01.520
equal to 10/7 times
a Corinne step.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.460
And that's our answer, 10/7.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:13.230
Next problem, problem 18.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.390
Let the function f be defined
by f of x is equal to x

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.950
squared plus 18.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:33.710
If m is a positive number such
that f of 2m is equal to 2 f

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.960
of m, what is the value of m?

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.360
A lot of people get intimidated
by these function

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.780
problems, but in some ways
they're kind of the most

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.490
straightforward problems.
You just have to sit

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.670
and evaluate them.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.250
So what's f of 2m?

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.670
So everywhere we see
an x, we put a 2m.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.730
So it's 2m squared
plus 18, right?

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.115
Wherever I saw an
x, I put a 2m.

00:02:55.115 --> 00:02:58.475
And that equals 2
times f of m.

00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:00.200
So wherever I see an
x, I put an m.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.360
So that's m squared plus 18.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.870
Now I just simplify.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:14.510
2m squared, that's equal to 4m
squared plus 18 is equal to 2m

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.680
squared plus 36.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.760
I just distributed the 2.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.100
So you subtract 2m squared from
both sides, you get 2m

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.870
squared plus 18 is
equal to 36.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.060
I subtracted this
from both sides.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.590
Subtract 18 from both
sides, you get 2m

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.090
squared is equal to 18.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.110
Divide both sides by 2, you get
m squared is equal to 9.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.180
And then you get m is equal
to-- if you just did this

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.850
straight off, you'd get
plus or minus 3.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.920
But they tell us that m is a
positive number, so we know

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.780
that m is equal to 3.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.162
And we are done.

00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:51.280
And that's it.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.440
I'll see you in the
next section.
