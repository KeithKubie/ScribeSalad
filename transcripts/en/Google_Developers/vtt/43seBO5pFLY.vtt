00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:08.980
PAUL: Today I have--

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.547
[CLEARING THROAT]

00:00:10.547 --> 00:00:13.421
Oh.

00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:14.100
Hi, Timothy.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.610
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi, Paul.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.610
PAUL: We're welcoming
in the "Supercharged."

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.710
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's the
holidays here on "The Dev

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.870
Show," so I'm traveling
around the world-- hanging out

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.120
with friends and family
talking about developer stuff.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.400
PAUL: OK.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.710
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What
are your tips for ways

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.330
they could spend their time?

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.740
PAUL: That's a good
question, first of all.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.842
And I did have time
to think this through.

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:31.800
We have a browser rendering
optimization course

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.660
that you can do on Udacity,
which is well worth your time.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.680
The second thing would be to go
and see the Chrome Dev Summit

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.780
playlists on YouTube.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.505
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
a great playlist.

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:40.710
PAUL: And then last
but not least, just

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.001
spend some time with the tools.

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.290
Maybe put your site
through WebPageTest.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.182
We do this a lot on
"Supercharged" anyway,

00:00:47.182 --> 00:00:49.640
so there's videos there you
could watch to see how we do it

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.860
and what we're looking for.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.818
And just give it a try.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.470
Even if you've just
got 20 minutes,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.170
put your site through
it, see how it comes out.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.960
And then you maybe sort of learn
one or two things and be like,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.130
hey, you know what, in January
I'm going to fix that thing.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.660
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.780
Those are great tips for
the developer in need.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.750
PAUL: It's almost like
I had advance warning

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.430
of your arrival.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.430
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks, Paul.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.346
I gotta go catch a bus,
so I'll see you later.

00:01:07.346 --> 00:01:08.612
PAUL: Bye.

00:01:08.612 --> 00:01:12.049
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:16.468 --> 00:01:18.758
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And on the
show today, Rich Hyndman.

00:01:18.758 --> 00:01:19.882
RICH HYNDMAN: Hey, Timothy.

00:01:19.882 --> 00:01:20.560
How you doing?

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.730
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm
doing well, how are you?

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.700
RICH HYNDMAN: It's great
to see you over here.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.720
You're the jet-lagged
one this time.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.990
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.820
Here we are in London.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.370
RICH HYNDMAN: On a bus.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.620
TIMOTHY JORDAN: On a London bus.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.786
RICH HYNDMAN: 55 to Hackney.

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:29.750
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's
a rather smooth ride.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.070
There's things that we like
to do over the holiday breaks.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.820
RICH HYNDMAN: Mhm.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
What is it you're

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.840
going to do with
your holiday break

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.130
to learn something
new about Android?

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.550
RICH HYNDMAN: Right.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.810
So when you're not
working on your work app,

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.625
you can work on
your personal app.

00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:40.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Sure.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.190
RICH HYNDMAN: I sit
near Nick Butcher,

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.220
and he's been working on the
Plaid sample application.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.990
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, yeah?

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.820
RICH HYNDMAN: And
it looks amazing.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.180
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Does it?

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.690
RICH HYNDMAN: Every time
you turn around, there's

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.606
a different animation.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.920
He's been working on the
design for it very, very

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.850
hard over the last six months.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.160
So I'm going to check that
out-- literally check it out--

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.140
and have a look through
his source code--

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.790
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Very cool.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.370
RICH HYNDMAN: --along with Ben
Weiss's Topeka application.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.780
Very similar in terms
of material design,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.970
lots of animations, very fresh.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.460
Figure out how they put
that magic in there,

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.320
and maybe take some
of it for my app.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.770
So I also want to check
out some people's videos

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.760
from throughout the year.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.610
I think I need to have a
little look into Kotlin.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.400
People talk about Kotlin
a lot, and Jack Wharton

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.870
gave a good talk about
it at Droidcon London.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.410
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.960
RICH HYNDMAN: Definitely
Android Dev Summit videos,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.280
if people haven't seen
them yet, as well.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.863
TIMOTHY JORDAN: January, as we
found out on our previous show,

00:02:14.863 --> 00:02:16.150
is the Black Friday for apps.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.080
What are a few top
things developers

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.196
can do to get their app ready
for that big download period?

00:02:21.196 --> 00:02:22.820
RICH HYNDMAN: Lots
of phones being sold

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.920
and lots of apps
being downloaded.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.380
I think the first thing
to check, of course,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.200
is always your
Play Store listing.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.110
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, because
you can optimize that stuff.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.410
There's tools in the console.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.880
RICH HYNDMAN: You can do
not only the A/B testing,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.060
but also it gives
you hints and tips

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.060
on things that you could
do to improve your chances.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.120
Doesn't sound very relaxing,
but it's a good thing

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.810
to do this holiday season.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.590
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Sounds important.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.660
RICH HYNDMAN: Well
at the same time,

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.000
you might as well do
some unit tests then,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.340
keep the stability of
your application up.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.830
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.909
RICH HYNDMAN: Because now
we're having real fun.

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.700
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK,
give us one last thing.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.930
We've got Play Store listing,
unit testing-- analytics?

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.320
RICH HYNDMAN: Analytics
sounds like a good idea.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.960
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.210
RICH HYNDMAN: You could do that.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.670
Because everyone
always wants to analyze

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.900
the performance of
their application,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.010
but they always forget
to put the analytics

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.430
in their personal apps.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.770
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This
is a time when nobody's

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.270
looking that you could
just kind of put some

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.170
of those analytics in and--

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.457
RICH HYNDMAN: Everyone's
gonna have a great holiday.

00:03:00.457 --> 00:03:02.290
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Or just
check out the videos

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.694
that Rich was also checking out.

00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:04.260
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.640
Android Dev Summit videos.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.100
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.641
Thanks, Rich.

00:03:05.641 --> 00:03:07.010
RICH HYNDMAN: Cheers, Timothy.
