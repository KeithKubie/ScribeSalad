00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.470
So Random Restart Hillclimbing is going to give us a way to deal with the fact

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.560
that hillclimbing can get stuck, and the

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.060
place where it gets stuck might not actually

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.870
be the best place to be. And so we can go back to that function

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.230
that we looked at before. So what are some places that this could get stuck?

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.700
&gt;&gt; There, there, and there.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.120
&gt;&gt; And others to boot. So what randomized

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.630
hillclimbing's going to do is once a local optimum

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.650
is reached, we're just going to start the whole

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.120
thing again from some other randomly chosen x.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.590
It's like, you know, sort of what you do

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.102
if you were trying to solve a problem and you

00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:30.710
got stuck. You're like, okay let me just try to

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.260
solve it again. So why is this a good idea?

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.150
&gt;&gt; Hm. Well one it, it, it takes away the luck factor of I

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.480
happened to pick a good starting place. Although I suppose it replaces it with

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.490
the luck factor that I randomly happened to pick a good place. But that's

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.120
okay because I'm going to keep randomly picking

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.080
good places. Or randomly picking starting places

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So you get multiple tries to find

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.370
a good starting place. That there could be various places where

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.370
you start that don't do so well but as long as there's

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.370
places where you do well. Then you might luck into starting one

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.560
of those places and climb up to the tippy top and win.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.240
&gt;&gt; Another advantage is that it's actually not much more expensive. So,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.840
whatever the cost is, of climbing up a hill, all you've done

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.700
is multiply it by, you know, a factor, a constant factor, which

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.510
is how many times you are willing to do a random restart.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good way of thinking about

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.480
it. That it's, it's really just random hill climbing,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.200
repeated how every many times you feel like you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.770
have time to repeat it. And it can actually

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.840
do much, much better. Now, if there really is

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.270
only one local. Sorry, if there is only one

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.140
optimum and there is no local optimum, then what's

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.110
going to happen when we do random restart hill climbing?

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.560
&gt;&gt; We'll just keep getting the same answer.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah, over and over again. So, could be that we, that we might

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.780
keep track of that and notice, okay, you know, what we seem in a space

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.935
where these random restarts aren't getting us any

00:01:43.935 --> 00:01:45.610
new information. So, you might as well stop now.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.150
&gt;&gt; Well, that's one answer but I could think of another answer. What's that?

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.830
&gt;&gt; So, maybe you just keep starting too close

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.220
to the same place you were starting before. I

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.830
mean, it may be random, but you can get

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.080
unlucky in random right? So, maybe you should make certain

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.820
your next random point is far away from where

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.960
you started, so that you cover the space. You

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.000
want to cover the space as best you can.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.250
Yeah the randomness should do that, at least on average.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.780
But you're right, so we could try to be more systematic.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.830
So here might be an example of a kind of function where

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.160
that would be really relevant. So imagine we've got, here's our

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.520
input space and most of the random points that we choose are

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.340
all going to lead us up to the top of this hill.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.460
But a very small percentage are actually going to lead us to the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.660
top of the, the real hill. The top that we really want.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.110
The optimum. So yeah, we, we might not want to give up after

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.510
a relatively small number of tries because it could be that this

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.040
tiny little, I know, I'm going to call it a basin of attraction.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.345
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. I like that.

00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:46.400
&gt;&gt; And if it's small enough, it might take lots of tries to hit it. In

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.670
fact, it could be a needle in a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.290
haystack. In which case, there's only one place that

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.890
you could start that has that optimum. And

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.300
that could take a very, very long time

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.640
to luck into. In fact, the hill climbing

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.350
part isn't doing anything for you at that point.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you know. If you're in a world where there's

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.770
only one point that's maximum. And, but there's only one way to get to it

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.015
by having to land on a single point. Then, you're in a bad world anyway. [LAUGH]

00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:09.870
&gt;&gt; Right, I mean, there's going to be, nothing is going to

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.885
to work out. Nothing is going to help you in that world.

00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:13.223
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:13.223 --> 00:03:14.380
&gt;&gt; Right, and in fact, I would, I would

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.542
claim since everything has some kind of inductive bias.

00:03:16.542 --> 00:03:19.020
Right you're, you're making some assumption about like local

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.480
smoothness or something. that, that makes sense here because if

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.390
you, if you are worried about a world where

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.310
there is always some point of the infinite number

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.100
of points you could be looking at say. That is the right one and there is no way

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.010
of finding it other than having to have stumbled

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.890
on it from the beginning. Then you can't make

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.370
any assumptions about anything. You might as well look

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.480
at every single point and what's the point of that.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.049
&gt;&gt; Fair enough.

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:42.549
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.060
&gt;&gt; So the, the assumption here I guess is that

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.800
there, you can make local improvements and that local improvements

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.490
add up to global improvements.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.250
&gt;&gt; Right. Hey I got a question. I got

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.110
a semantic question for you, a definition question for you.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.120
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.770
&gt;&gt; You decided that you didn't, if

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.610
you only had one optimum, you didn't want to

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.600
call it a local optimum. So, is a

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.700
local optimum, by definition, not a global optimum?

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.470
&gt;&gt; So, if I was being mathematical about it, I

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.290
would define local optimum in a way that would include the

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.940
global optimum but it's just awkward to talk about it

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.080
that way. because it feels like the local optimum is someplace

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.664
you don't want to be and the global optimum

00:04:15.664 --> 00:04:17.980
is someplace you do want to be. But yeah

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.930
that's right the global optimum is a local optimum

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.130
in the sense you can't improve it using local steps.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.950
&gt;&gt; Okay.
