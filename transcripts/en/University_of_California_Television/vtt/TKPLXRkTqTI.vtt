00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.600
- Who has spoken at our conference

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.000
on several previous occasions.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.693
He's, are you chair of
orthopedic surgery at Rady?

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.490
Program director at
Rady Children's Hospital

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.370
in San Diego and professor of
clinical orthopedic surgery

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.650
at UC San Diego.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.730
And the David Sutherland director

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.320
of the cerebral palsy program at Rady.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.343
And program director of the
education program there.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.930
You're one of the original
Botox investigators,

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.040
and overseeing a movement disorder clinic,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.040
as well as a lifespan
disability clinic since 1992.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.830
And your son, who has cerebral
palsy, is now 35 years old.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.100
Wow.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.557
Welcome back.

00:00:58.557 --> 00:00:59.483
- Thank you so much, thanks.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.460
Thanks for having me back.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.283
It's always an honor to come
to this great conference.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.920
Yesterday I flew in from
the American Academy

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.800
of Orthopedic Surgery
meeting in New Orleans.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.230
And we were learning how to put the screws

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.360
in the right place and all that stuff,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.730
and I walked into the transgender talk.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.123
I guess I'm not in Kansas anymore, Toto.

00:01:20.323 --> 00:01:22.063
This is a different group of people.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.530
When I was a visiting professor
in Melbourne, Australia,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.130
I was challenged by my host
to give a more personal talk

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.990
than rather a technical talk.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.010
And so I'm going to talk a
little bit about our family

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.720
and how it affected me and
how it affected the way

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.300
I think about cerebral palsy.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.170
How many people in here
have family members

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.583
or themselves have some sort
of developmental disability?

00:01:51.117 --> 00:01:53.163
And the rest of you when
into it for the big money?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.473
OK, all right, great.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.563
Is this the advance, I'm sorry.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.150
Oh here it is.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.890
All right, so I'm going to
talk about cerebral palsy,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.420
a view from both sides.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.870
And these are my disclosures.

00:02:09.914 --> 00:02:10.900
I'm not going to talk too much about it,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.150
but there are some off-label use.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.870
Botulinum toxin, at least
some of the ones like Botox

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.810
that you've heard of,

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.700
has not been approved for
use in spasticity by the FDA.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.790
Dysport however recently was approved

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.630
for lower-extremity spasticity.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.510
I talk about intrathecal baclofen,

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.400
it's not approved for the use in dystonia,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.020
and it's the best thing
you can do for dystonia.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.650
However, when you think about it,

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.090
50% of all the drugs that we
use as pediatric specialists

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.990
are not approved for use in children.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.860
So we do these things
off-label all the time.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.770
Every day you do that.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.230
What is cerebral palsy?

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.520
And there's a lot of
different definitions.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.140
When I was a resident I was taught

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.090
that it was all due to obstetrical trauma.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.860
And as you all know, if you
go google cerebral palsy now,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.380
you'll find all the best, they're
actually pretty good sites

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.790
but they're all lawyer sites.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.500
And they have good pictures,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.490
and tell you how to sue your doctor,

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.410
sue your obstetrician.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.323
Was the baby too big or too small?

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.260
And one of the things that
as we get together as a group

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.390
and come up with consensus
we feel that it occurs

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.230
before the age of three.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.740
I can't believe I'm talking
in front of Marshalyn,

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.840
and she's going to tell me
everything I'm doing is wrong.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.593
The world's best epidemiologist.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.663
So I'll probably misquote her
several times in this talk.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.777
And then this is a thing that our academy,

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:33.050
American Academy of Cerebral Palsy

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.090
and Developmental Medicine
came up with a definition.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.495
And really, you all know
what cerebral palsy is

00:03:40.495 --> 00:03:42.460
so I don't have to go into much detail,

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.530
but that it's a non-progressive
disturbance of the brain.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.210
And I may argue a little bit against that

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.040
from some of the things that
I've seen in my adult practice,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.330
but it affects everything.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.170
So, I'm not going to read
that whole definition,

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.143
but it affects everything in the body.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.630
So, epidemiology, and
you notice I call this

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.680
the cerebral palsies,
there's no such thing

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.350
as cerebral palsy, there's no one disease

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.740
or one entity.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.430
And some of this work is
from Eve Blair in Australia.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.510
And so the risk is much higher

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.050
if you're born prematurely.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.470
If you're very small.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.380
And one in three children
with very low birth weight

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.590
will have CP.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.760
However, as you saw today
from Yvonne's slides,

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.070
most of the children with
cerebral palsy are not premature.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.650
It's maybe a little bit more than half.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.510
And you can see that number there.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.650
The prevalence, and this
is from Marshalyn's study,

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.851
showed that in three states,

00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:42.440
that prevalence is a little bit higher

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.640
than we have been talking
about, one to three,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.810
and now it's it's probably
three to four patients,

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.620
3.8 was the number.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.820
And so there are about 10,000
new diagnoses each year.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.510
About a million people
in the United States

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.683
have cerebral palsy.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.370
One of the things is
we've been more successful

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.190
in the NICU and also
taking care of children

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.780
as pediatricians, is that we
have a longer survival rate.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.920
And there are now more adults

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.183
than there are children
with cerebral palsy.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.290
There's also some racial differences,

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.470
which we aren't really
quite sure why that is,

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.470
it probably has to do with
availability of services

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.803
in the prenatal period.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.800
But 54% of Americans have
some sort of disability.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.433
In fact everyone in this room,
at some point in your life,

00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:35.210
will be either disabled or dead.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.060
Think about that.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.420
Right?

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.260
You're gonna be in a walker or crutches

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.040
or a walker or something or a wheelchair.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.240
Or you're gonna be dead.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.600
If you look at the entire cost

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.810
of a child with cerebral palsy
across all levels of severity

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:53.940
it's about a million dollars,

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.163
so it's a huge impact
on our medical system.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.300
The etiology of the cerebral palsies.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.230
I'm not going to go through all these.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.160
Mainly it just shows you how
complex cerebral palsy is,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.930
and that there are so
many different types.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.870
The thing that I'm just
going to, once again,

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.870
because I'm bringing a little
bit of my family into it,

00:06:17.067 --> 00:06:21.470
and that is this hemostatic disorders.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.810
So we talked a little bit in the EPO talk

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.363
about how it can cause
increased clotting problems.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.100
My wife was pregnant when I was an intern.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.090
And we found out we were gonna have twins.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.550
About halfway through my internship

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.480
one of our twins died in utero.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.740
And when he was born, I mean
when my other son was born,

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.113
prematurely because my
wife had an abruption,

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.920
we found out that the other
child's umbilical cord

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.470
was completely clotted off.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.620
And that was the cause.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.680
We go that's really terrible, bad luck,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.183
and my son has really
bad, GMFCS level 4 CP now.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.270
And then 20 years later my
wife got several blood clots

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.410
coming back from a from
a trip over to Europe

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.270
where we sat on the
ground for a long time.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.003
And turns out that she
has Factor V Leiden.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.330
The heterozygous type,
not the homozygous type.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.850
But if you think about it,
about up to 5% of American women

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.193
have this as maybe a cause
of seizure disorders.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.940
Not seizure disorders,
but stroke problems.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.023
And so that's where we found
out where my son had this.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.114
There are some other
interesting things in here,

00:07:39.114 --> 00:07:40.930
and Yvonne talked about these

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.890
as far as chromosomal
and brain abnormalities.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.990
Many of our GMFCS level 5 patients,

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.800
the more severely involved patients,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.373
have some sort of chromosomal abnormality.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.590
We just got a $120 million
grant at Rady Children's

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.150
in San Diego and we're
doing more genetic testing

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.770
on all these patients
and we're finding things

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.480
that you've never even heard of.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.530
It's just a series of numbers
and then I'm supposed to

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.230
figure out what to do with that child.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.490
And I think I'm glad I'm
at the end of my career

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.950
rather than the beginning of my career,

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.290
because I don't know how
we're ever going to know

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.340
how to to treat these
because we won't know

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.373
the natural history.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.700
A big study here in Contra Costa County

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.330
several years ago demonstrated

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.360
that there is an increased
incidence of vaginosis

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.870
in the mothers whose
children had cerebral palsy.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.920
And once again, none of these things are,

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.680
these are correlations,
they're not causations.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.220
And we really aren't sure what's going on.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.560
We do know that some things
like epigenetic factors,

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.750
such as maternal depression,
that's misspelled,

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.380
and a couple of other
things that are happening.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.440
So just think about the brain
and remember the homunculus

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.713
from medical school and from college.

00:08:52.613 --> 00:08:56.270
And think about why does this happen.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.530
Well now you're gonna hear
the simple orthopedic surgeon,

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.030
there's no neurology going on here,

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.403
this is orthopedic
surgeons with pictures, OK?

00:09:04.853 --> 00:09:06.723
So it's the only way
I can remember things.

00:09:07.824 --> 00:09:10.910
Here's the brain, that
kind of looks like a brain.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:11.990
And here's the homunculus.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:16.990
And remember this gyrus
here is where the legs are.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.090
And your legs are pretty
stupid, they do the same thing.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.650
You walk, they don't do
anything fancy with that.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.230
With your hands and your face

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.370
you have a lot of
different things going on.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.780
So these are the ventricles,
and then remember

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.379
this watershed area,

00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:34.340
and that was a thing
that Yvonne talked about.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.560
If there's a area of injury right there,

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.030
the legs are more preferentially involved

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.240
than the upper extremities.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.730
And that's what diplegia
means, the lower extremities

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.460
are involved more in
the upper extremities.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.883
And it can be symmetric,
but most of time it's not.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.560
And very rarely are two kids the same.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.480
And it's really hard for
us to do research now

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.080
because we don't know, we
can't get a control group

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.330
because they're not the same,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.350
they have some other problem going on.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.170
And she talked about the strokes.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.543
And then this area, the basal ganglia,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.170
our understanding of what
happens at the basal ganglia

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:11.110
has really changed our evaluation

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.210
of children with cerebral palsy,

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.250
our treatment of children
with cerebral palsy.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:18.203
And I'll explain that as
later as we get to that.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:24.950
This new functional MRI
information is just beautiful,

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.863
it looks great, we don't
know what to do with it yet.

00:10:28.766 --> 00:10:30.870
There's so many, you
know, there's all these,

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.040
all it does is show how
interconnected the brain is.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.784
I mean that's the most important thing.

00:10:36.784 --> 00:10:40.500
If you look at some of
these tractography things.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.900
There's, something come
from the cerebellum happens,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.390
goes to almost everything every tract

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.460
that comes out of your body.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.620
So if you have a problem
in your cerebellum

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.470
it affects your balance,
it affects everything,

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.420
it affects your speech, it
affects the way you walk,

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.253
it affects the way you talk.

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:56.670
The way you use your upper extremities.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.470
And so we're learning
this, but this becomes

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.410
very complex, three-dimensional things.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.920
So, Yvonne talked a little bit

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.580
about some of these preventive strategies,

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.950
and obviously that's going to be our hope

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.100
is to not have a child
with cerebral palsy.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.620
As you can see, we could talk an hour

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.390
about every single one of these things.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.732
And she talked about some of those.

00:11:17.732 --> 00:11:20.130
I think most of us believe

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:23.280
that this is an inflammatory problem,

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.150
particularly in the premature children,

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.920
and and maybe in the HIE patients.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.480
And so what can we do, what
kind of anti-inflammatories

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.040
are we're gonna be able to to give,

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.300
whether that's cooling or
EPO, all kinds of things.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.960
There are some children that
are born with hypothyroidism.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.210
It has to be tested or you
won't be able to treat it.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.020
And that's an effect on the brain.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.900
We talked about EPO and other things

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.100
that are erythropoiesis
stimulating agents.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:55.100
Avoidance, having mothers
avoid toxic substances

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.443
of course is important.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.390
Assistive reproductive
technology has changed.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.880
So probably 10 or 15 years ago

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.280
we would have runs of
quadruplets and quintuplets

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.020
from this reproductive technology,

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.880
and I think the obstetricians
are much better at it now.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.600
So they might be able to implant
at least at the most twins.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.310
And so our incidence went down.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:26.273
At one point we had six
quintuplet sets in our NICUs.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:32.080
Of all of those, two of
them had cerebral palsy.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.680
So I'm still taking care
of those those families.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.330
And of course remember I told you

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.610
cerebral palsy goes up
to the age of three,

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:44.610
so anything you can do to
prevent non-accidental trauma,

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.770
near-drowning and those things
that cause brain injuries,

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.070
it's very similar to cerebral palsy.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.343
So how did I get into this field?

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.520
When I was in medical school

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.920
I was very interested in pediatrics,

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.920
I thought that was what I was going to do.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.060
Then I got very interested in orthopedics.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.290
And then I found out
there's a thing called

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.270
pediatric orthopedics.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.523
So that's what I was gonna do
when I started medical school.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:08.650
When I started my residency.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.780
So this is before my son was born.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.040
But we were going by,
my wife was pregnant,

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.470
and we saw a United
Cerebral Palsy telethon.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.330
And she goes, what's cerebral palsy?

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.370
And I go, oh let's see, I
learned that in that same class

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.881
where I learned about muscular dystrophy,

00:13:23.881 --> 00:13:26.413
and myasthenia gravis, and
so I made up something.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.760
And in my pediatric rotation
I only had one patient

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.100
with cerebral palsy the whole
two months I was on that

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:36.940
as an intern.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.930
And then when my son was
born, when I was an intern,

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.483
and this is him, and he weighed
two pounds and nine ounces.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.830
My residency taught me
everything that is wrong.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.820
And unfortunately I
still see this going on

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.550
across the world and
across the United States.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:55.860
We just lengthen tendons.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.500
Orthopedic surgeons just lengthen tendons

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.170
and see how they do.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.000
Put them in casts for a long time.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.710
And that's what I learned,
and that's what my son had.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.990
He had all these surgeries, my
son's had 29 operations now.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:12.663
And I would say 20 of them were bad.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.013
And I pushed them, so that
makes me feel even worse.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.320
I was very fortunate to do
a fellowship at San Diego

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.320
with Dr. David Sutherland,
who became famous here at UCSF

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:28.593
and at the Shriners Hospital.

00:14:29.664 --> 00:14:32.860
He was one of the inventors
of the field of gait analysis.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.697
And was a very forward thinker

00:14:34.697 --> 00:14:36.460
in the way that we do surgery.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.140
And so it was very lucky.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.140
And the other thing is, for
those of you who are younger

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.650
and are getting into this field,
I think it's very important

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:49.650
to get into one of the organizations.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:50.990
And so I started off

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.450
in the American Academy of Cerebral Palsy.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:57.970
Went to meetings, got to meet
everybody, got on committees,

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.450
eventually was the president
of the organization.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.220
And right now I can call
anybody in the world

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.210
if I have a question.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.883
And those things are really important.

00:15:07.894 --> 00:15:11.860
And unfortunately my inbox
is filled with people

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.340
asking me questions right now.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.670
But it also is great.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.340
It's a good thing.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.860
So what is gait analysis,

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.010
I mentioned that because
of Dr. Sutherland.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.130
This is really an important field.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.430
So as I told you every child is different.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.490
And so there's different
ways to do gait analysis,

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:34.490
you can do, I can just watch
a child walk back and forth,

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.570
write down my observations.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:40.110
I can take a video on
my iPhone and save that.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:41.360
My hospital won't let me do that,

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.100
but my iPhone's filled with them.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.390
And the other thing is to do what's called

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.930
three-dimensional gait analysis,

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:53.930
where you can measure what's
going on in three dimensions

00:15:55.915 --> 00:15:58.603
and then make your
decisions based on that.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.270
Those of you have never seen gait analysis

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:06.300
might have seen some movies
where gait analysis was used.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.233
Like every Pixar movie,

00:16:09.986 --> 00:16:12.220
every Disney movie was
made with gait analysis.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.330
Steven Spielberg sent
his team down to our lab

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.110
for three weeks and we
showed them motion capture,

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.090
and how that works.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.160
And we go, oh man we're
going to get research money,

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.100
this is going to be great.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.730
And we took them out to dinner,
we did all kinds of stuff.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.600
And then they ended up saying thank you,

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.430
and then they went and bought
20 motion capture systems.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.570
And that's when they started
making the Pixar movies.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.183
So we got nothing out of it.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.353
But I do enjoy those movies,
so I guess that's good.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.743
Classification systems.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.007
The diplegia, quadriplegia,
hemiplegia system

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:51.480
has very poor intra- and
inter-observer reliability.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.570
If you look at my own chart,

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.857
some day I'll say the
kid has severe diplegia

00:16:54.857 --> 00:16:57.020
and the next day he has
a mild quadriplegia.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:00.193
And so it's really hard
to, these don't work.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.570
You know one of the people that,

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.940
a famous neurologist who popularized this,

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.850
he didn't come up with it
but he popularized this.

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:07.683
Anybody know?

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.840
Sigmund Freud.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.240
So Sigmund Freud, one of his
big interests in research

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.520
was cerebral palsy.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.820
He wasn't a psychiatrist
he was a neurologist.

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.350
There's a thing in Europe where
they talk about unilateral

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:22.663
versus bilateral.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.750
Talk about simplistic,

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.490
I really don't like this system at all.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:27.750
It doesn't make any sense.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.770
Anybody who's taken care
of a kid with hemiplegia

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.580
knows that they're not unilateral.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.470
And now there's been
many studies that showed

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.840
that that's wrong 25% of the time.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.223
So that's not a very good
system, I don't think.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.230
Using this household
ambulator, therapy ambulator,

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.810
community ambulator,
those are good things.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.590
Kind of gives you a
picture of the patient,

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.140
but it doesn't tell you much about it.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.450
And what's revolutionized
the field of cerebral palsy

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.430
is the Gross Motor Functional
Classification System.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:59.173
And this is derived from
a test called the GMFM.

00:18:00.313 --> 00:18:03.290
Many of you are therapists
and know how to do this.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.190
It takes a while, you have
to ask a lot of questions,

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.225
you do tests, and you
come up with a score.

00:18:08.225 --> 00:18:10.420
A number, and you take that number,

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:15.420
and a group in Canada just
started putting these out

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.460
and plotting these hundreds of patients.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.910
And realized that they came out in five

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:23.533
pretty close groups.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.650
And came up with something
really complicated

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:27.850
of how to figure out what they are,

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.630
and of course orthopedic
surgeons get ahold of it

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.710
and make pictures and make cartoons.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.050
And so this these cartoons are great

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.100
because that's how I remember it.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.150
And hopefully the way
you'll remember it too.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.050
So a level one patient

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.920
is someone who hardly has
anything wrong with them.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.380
They may be a little bit uncoordinated.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.220
Might be the last kid
picked on the baseball team.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.860
There's just something different.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.570
A level two is someone who
has problems on uneven ground,

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.880
and in a first world
country the way you can tell

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.210
is they're wearing an AFO, OK.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:02.970
That doesn't work so much in
Haiti, where I go, or Jamaica.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.580
But if they have an AFO that
tells you they have GMFCS 2.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.860
A level three is someone who
uses crutches or a walker.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.470
Can push themselves in
a regular wheelchair,

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.240
but usually a walker.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.240
Level four is someone
who's in a powered chair,

00:19:22.364 --> 00:19:26.080
or someone who can walk in therapy.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.860
And then a level five is someone
whose needs complete care,

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.483
and is in a wheelchair most of the time.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:37.240
And so this is really
an interesting thing,

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.120
because if you just use
the word spastic diplegia,

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.220
that could be almost this entire group.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.154
It could be anywhere on there.

00:19:44.154 --> 00:19:47.030
I have about 20 papers that
I just need to throw away

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:51.677
that I wrote, because I used, in fact,

00:19:51.677 --> 00:19:56.677
the first of our Botox
patients were all GMFCS 1s.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:02.310
So here's the interesting
thing about this,

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.480
is if you do anything to a child

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.990
before the age of six or seven, anything,

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:11.990
physical therapy, early
intervention, Botox, any surgery,

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.960
they're getting better,
that's the natural history.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.970
They're going to improve
no matter what you do.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:18.850
So all the kids in the first Botox studies

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.830
were under the age of six and GMFCS 1.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.750
And surprisingly they all got better,

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.913
what a miracle, a miracle
drug, I'm such a great doctor.

00:20:32.028 --> 00:20:35.210
But anyways, so when we look at the GMFCS

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.620
and how it revolutionized things,

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.940
everything that we do is
almost directly correlated.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.980
It's not even logarithmically,
it's directly correlated

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.060
to their GMFCS.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.230
And these are the things
that we do in orthopedics.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.620
Including things like
morbidity and mortality.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.030
The GMFCS is not an outcome measure,

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.210
it's just a classification system.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.421
But if you want to do something
to see if you can improve

00:21:01.421 --> 00:21:05.713
what they're doing in the
gross motor functional area,

00:21:05.713 --> 00:21:08.400
it's to do this thing called
the functional mobility scale.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.663
And that's what the child
can do at five meters,

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.520
50 meters, and 500 meters.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.520
And you figure that out and you can say

00:21:21.097 --> 00:21:23.570
that by doing this
intervention they improved

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:28.420
from using a wheelchair at 50 meters,

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.080
and they're now using a walker.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.520
So that's something that you've done

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.470
to improve their outcomes.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:36.303
Now there are other,

00:21:36.303 --> 00:21:38.240
that's just the gross motor
functional classification,

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.130
we also have, I had nothing to do with it,

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:44.570
but people have developed
scales for the upper extremity

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.960
called the Manual Ability
Classification System.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.300
Very similar.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.470
There's now a communication system.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:54.590
So this is really a
great way to communicate,

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.290
and also for us to do research.

00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:01.030
So if you tell me this
person is a GMFCS level 3,

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.700
and then you tell me
what they do at 5 meters,

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.390
50 meters, 500 meters,

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.180
you tell me how they use
their upper extremities

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.300
based on this, and you tell
me how they communicate,

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.950
I have a great picture of
that person in my mind.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:15.150
And also if I'm doing research,

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.860
I go, I want all those
patients to be in that group.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.010
And so it really has changed our field.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:22.800
Very simple thing.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.020
Now we talk about the
dimensions of disability,

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.968
and you saw some of this yesterday.

00:22:27.968 --> 00:22:30.900
And all of you are familiar with these,

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.840
but the the International Classification

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.570
of Functioning, Disability,
and Health, or the ICF,

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.080
looks at body functions and structures,

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.590
activities and participation,

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.230
and environmental factors.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:45.160
And so this is the model

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.680
that we base all of our research on.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.540
And also what our goals are

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.573
as taking care of children
and adults with disabilities.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.280
So I can work a little
bit on body and function

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.280
and structures, my goal is to
get them to participate more,

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.920
and then I have almost nothing to do

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.040
with environmental factors,

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.560
that's usually something
that the government does

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.163
with the curb cuts, and
accommodations at work.

00:23:13.841 --> 00:23:17.870
I started this when I was in San Antonio,

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.090
as a junior faculty member,

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:22.460
and I started the Challenger
baseball league there.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.370
And I also started the
Challenger league in San Diego.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.390
And so this is a baseball
thing where the kids come out

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:32.390
and this is my son Shawn
and his little brother.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.640
And this is him just last week.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.357
He's in a drumming circle.

00:23:39.528 --> 00:23:41.490
You can just see the joy that he has.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:45.080
And so that's our goal,
is to get your patients

00:23:46.232 --> 00:23:48.800
and your son and everybody
out, doing stuff.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.810
I wish he was that happy all the time,

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:54.100
that's a different story,
we'll talk about that later.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:58.580
The other one is, this
is actually my favorite.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:03.150
It was made by the NIH and it's NCMRR.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:06.410
And it puts a person
at the center of this.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.409
It could be anybody,
it doesn't have to be,

00:24:08.409 --> 00:24:10.640
when I give this talk to
the orthopedic residents

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.270
I say this could be
someone with a hip problem

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.850
that you're going to do a total hip on.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:17.440
And looks at the different
dimensions of that problem.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.370
And it looks at the
pathophysiology, what caused it,

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:21.850
we talked a little bit about it.

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:22.980
What's the impairment,

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.820
which means what's
happening at the cell level,

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.640
for example spasticity.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.210
How do we treat that.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.790
We look at the functional limitation,

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:33.830
those are the, what does
spasticity do for you,

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.190
if you're walking, you
have a hard time walking,

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:37.270
you have a hard time speaking,

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.610
you have a hard time using
your upper extremities.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:42.680
Your disability, or what
are your roles in society.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.870
We all have different roles.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:47.808
We're students, teachers, husbands, wives.

00:24:47.808 --> 00:24:50.660
Think of every role that you have.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.250
How does that disability impact those.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:57.000
And then the societal limitations
are what does our society

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
put in as far as way of curb
cuts and attitudinal approach,

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.600
problems of the way we treat
people with disabilities.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.863
As we learned yesterday in the ACLU talk.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.640
This was kind of thrown out mainly

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.030
because almost all the words are negative.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.700
You know, disability, functional
limitation, impairment.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:22.100
And that's where the WHO came out of that

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.890
with positive language.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:25.770
Just because it's negative
doesn't mean it's not good,

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:30.360
so I like it and it helps me
think about different things.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.120
So we come up with different paradigms.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.283
And we all have to set goals.

00:25:35.444 --> 00:25:38.170
And it's really important that these goals

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.220
are collective and realistic.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.404
So when you sit down
with a family to decide

00:25:42.404 --> 00:25:46.245
whether it's therapy or some drug,

00:25:46.245 --> 00:25:50.080
Botox, orthopedic surgery.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.390
I'm not going to cure your
child's cerebral palsy,

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.440
and if that's what you think your goal is

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.530
then no one's going to be happy.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.460
And so we have to set the goals.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.250
We have a team.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:02.053
You all are this team.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.293
My first thing I did in the CP Academy,

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.100
this is like 1991 or something,

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.160
they asked me to put on the Family Forum,

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.740
which is the first one that we had.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.690
And so I brought all the
people who were specialists

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:20.980
to come and speak to the
audience in San Diego.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.563
And I stupidly put 32 people on the stage,

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.780
because that's how many people impact,

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.860
you know if you think
about speech therapists,

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.400
physical therapists, gastroenterologists.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.226
It was a great one, we
never replicated that

00:26:33.226 --> 00:26:34.776
because it was just ridiculous.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.720
And then the management
of movement disorders,

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.567
we'll talk about that.

00:26:39.567 --> 00:26:41.400
And the different therapies.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.610
What's the role of technology.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:45.550
Most important thing of
course, orthopedic surgery.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.860
Not really, it's the
least important thing.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.330
And then we'll talk about that.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:50.420
So we have to set goals.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.990
And this is a study that
was done about 20 years ago.

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:55.980
The question was, this
is asked of young adults,

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.460
what's the most important
thing in your life?

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.330
The first one was independence.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:01.720
And I think that's true of all of us,

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.180
who wants to be living with their parents,

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.163
you want to be independent.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.683
The next one was to have a job.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.210
In of my earlier slides I
showed you that 75% of people

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:15.690
with cerebral palsy are unemployed
even if they have skills.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:17.360
Communication, just what we're doing now,

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.513
just talking, exchanging ideas.

00:27:20.513 --> 00:27:22.820
Activities of daily living,
brushing your teeth,

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.323
going to the bathroom,

00:27:24.323 --> 00:27:26.430
just taking care of yourself.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.810
Mobility, getting from point
A to point B, very important.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:32.580
And the least important of all, drum roll,

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.470
was walking, which is what I do all day,

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:35.920
trying to get people to walk.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.960
And so we're actually
doing a study right now

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:45.350
where we're asking the
parents the similar thing.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:47.420
I haven't looked at the
data yet, but my guess is

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.820
it's going to be completely
opposite of this, right?

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.240
The first one, all they
care about is walking.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.360
I went through that, when
my son couldn't walk.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.790
That's one of the things you give up.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:58.100
I mean it's really a horrible thing

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.050
when you realize your child can't walk.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:05.270
So, you go backwards, and the
last thing anybody cares about

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:06.280
is independence.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.210
As we learned yesterday
in conservatorship.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:11.990
Or guardianship, if you're
not from this state.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.380
So we have an integrated approach

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.610
for children with cerebral palsy.

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.130
I'm obviously not going to
go through all of these,

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:17.980
but it's important it's just a big team,

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:22.143
that we work together, and
come up with the answers.

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:27.945
So a lot of you here,
I know, are therapists.

00:28:27.945 --> 00:28:30.062
So occupational therapists,

00:28:30.062 --> 00:28:32.450
at least in the field of cerebral palsy,

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.390
are the ones that take
care of upper extremity

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.000
and oral motor problems.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.280
Talking, to you, it's a joke,

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.610
but I give this talk
to orthopedic surgeons.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.280
Speech and language is very important.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.890
The management of drooling.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.310
So this is a kind of an interesting,

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.230
you know the kids who
are GMFCS 3, 4s, and 5s

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:51.450
often have drooling.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:53.180
Does anybody know which federal agency

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.653
has spent the most money
on drooling research?

00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:59.030
See, you're not supposed to answer it.

00:29:00.744 --> 00:29:02.930
(laughing)

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:04.873
It's actually, it's NASA.

00:29:07.354 --> 00:29:08.750
You usually get Department of Defense,

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:11.963
or now, the White House.

00:29:15.537 --> 00:29:18.787
(audience applauding)

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:24.900
Actually that's us watching TV at night,

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.883
going seriously?

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.430
But when you go into space, you drool.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:35.370
It just goes all over the place.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:39.140
I've actually been to two
NASA drooling seminars.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.850
And the story they told me,

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.133
because my son had a real
bad drooling problem.

00:29:46.753 --> 00:29:48.210
When Gemini, you know we had Mercury,

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.380
they went up and they came down.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.217
Gemini, for the young people

00:29:53.217 --> 00:29:54.700
who don't know anything about this,

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.930
that's when they sent two people up

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.880
and they stayed up for a long
time, like several weeks.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.580
Not knowing that when they
took their helmets off

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.350
this drool just came
out all over the place.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:06.900
They didn't know, they didn't see it.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.970
Except for as soon as they
came back in the atmosphere

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:12.170
it came all over their masks,
and just two weeks of drool

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:13.520
all over everything.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.613
And so now they have ways to stop that.

00:30:17.801 --> 00:30:19.660
In fact the first thing they have to do

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.250
on the space shuttle is
wake up in the morning

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:22.380
with a little vacuum cleaner

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:26.130
and find the little drool
things and pick them up.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.880
Because it can get in the
instruments and short it out.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:34.000
The other thing that we
don't think about is,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.200
this is a brain injury, so
there's visual problems.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.980
And if you think about, we
have a child with hemiplegia,

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.640
just close one eye and see,

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.130
when you bring your other hand over,

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:45.500
when do you actually see it.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.860
It's pretty far, it's almost
midline before you see it.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.760
So if you have this kid
that you're working on,

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.040
you go, why aren't you using your hand?

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.170
He doesn't even know he has a hand.

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.900
And so that's a real problem,

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.280
besides the fact that there's
a motor disorder there.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.133
They forget that they have the hand.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:05.110
And the other one is you
can have a field cut,

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:07.370
inferior field cut, so if you're walking,

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:08.570
you can't see the floor,

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.523
you're going to have
really hard time walking.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.290
So physical therapy,

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:15.750
there's a lot of different
physical therapies,

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.820
we can talk an hour on each
of the different things.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.890
Everyone in this room of course
knows what hippotherapy is,

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:23.960
none of the orthopedic surgeons do.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.860
Even though the picture's right there.

00:31:28.686 --> 00:31:30.686
And those glasses now are back in style.

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:35.840
Although women wear them I saw
them on the plane yesterday.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.760
So just know that they're back.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.360
And the other thing
that physical therapists

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.490
I think are really great
at is managing equipment.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:49.040
Those of you are therapists know that.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.000
You know the equipment
much better than we do.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.280
And what will be helpful for them.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.513
So that brings up the field of technology.

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:58.020
There's a promise and challenges.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.610
A lot of people say if we
just gave a lot of money

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:01.580
to technology and threw everything to it,

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.250
then things would be great.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.920
However there's a lot of
challenges with technology.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.513
It's very expensive, these
things can't be mass-produced.

00:32:10.609 --> 00:32:11.830
There's not that many
people that need them,

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.970
so it becomes very expensive.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:15.610
Training is really hard.

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:20.270
So my son had the DynaVox,
do you all use the DynaVox,

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:21.660
remember using the DynaVox?

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.950
I could never figure that thing out,

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:26.003
it's like you have to have
like a PhD in communication.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:30.030
Anyways, I'll talk about that in a second,

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:31.950
but there's training
and then there's upkeep,

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.810
you have to upgrade it, things break,

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:34.830
and of course the insurance company

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:37.010
might pay for the first one
but they won't pay to fix it,

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.190
as you all know.

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:42.730
And many times we have to do
specificity for each child,

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:45.330
and then you as therapists know
that, that that's your job,

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.280
to keep that going.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.600
Some say what if we have
robotics, wouldn't that be cool,

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.450
we could do really cool
things with robotics.

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:54.070
And maybe there may be
something in the future.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:56.820
And this is the Lokomat, many
of you have seen these before,

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.940
they cost a million
dollars each, at least.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.120
And so we're using them
for kids who are GMFCS 4.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.040
So the kids who are really non-ambulators,

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.520
and maybe the GMFCS 3 kids.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.160
I'm not putting it down,
because I think it's good

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.760
to get exercise and things,

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.300
but is it really going to
change that person's life?

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.480
Are they really going to go from a GMFCS 4

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.703
to a GMFCS 3, that's very
rare for that to happen.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:24.130
Our goal as clinicians is to keep someone

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:28.010
in their GMFCS level, so
if you see someone dropping

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:29.750
from a three to four,
your goal is to get them

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.670
back to the three, and
that could be from surgery

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:34.840
or physical therapy or something.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:39.840
Your goal is not to make them
go from a three to a two.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:43.450
That just doesn't happen.

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:46.340
Maybe occasionally, but
it doesn't usually happen.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:47.790
However, this one right here,

00:33:49.065 --> 00:33:50.620
using a child that has athetosis,

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.030
and using a computer to modulate

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:54.950
those extra movements so
they can use a computer,

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.480
those are going to be very helpful.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.150
So I think there's a lot of
things that are coming along.

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:03.470
Speech therapy and communication devices.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:05.110
You all know how important this is,

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:08.473
I told you where it was in
people's hierarchy of needs.

00:34:11.042 --> 00:34:13.450
So we went from this DynaVox,
which cost like $8,000,

00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:15.473
I had one, which we never used.

00:34:16.956 --> 00:34:19.700
And then all these very simple ones.

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:22.427
One of my friends, well
our friend Richard Ellison,

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:26.810
in New York, sold his,

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:29.293
he had the Leapfrog or something,

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.310
he sold that to DynaVox, but
he was smart enough to know

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:34.810
that the market was about to crash.

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:38.023
Because no one at DynaVox had
heard of an iPad, apparently.

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:41.480
And so he made millions of dollars,

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.210
and then they went bankrupt
like, a couple months later.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:46.273
So he's very smart.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:50.670
But this is where we
are now, a iPad's $500,

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:53.660
and you can get the,
it's usually about a $400

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.174
application to put on it.

00:34:58.174 --> 00:34:59.167
And so we've had really
good luck with that,

00:34:59.167 --> 00:35:01.810
and the speech is very good.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:04.000
Mobility is getting
from point A to point B,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.070
and this usually just
means different types

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.610
of assistive devices.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.800
And it also shows how bad
public transportation is

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.550
for people with disabilities.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:14.530
At least in San Diego.

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:15.630
I can't speak for everywhere,

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:18.600
but almost everywhere I give
this talk, they all agree,

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.660
it's really hard to get
on public transportation.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.263
This is a controversial area.

00:35:25.729 --> 00:35:27.410
Especially as I'm talking to
room with therapists in it,

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:30.153
so I have to remember
what I'm talking about.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.110
So a lot of people, everybody
wants to get people standing.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:38.950
And their goal is to
improve a lot of things,

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:43.040
bone-density, GI function,
urologic function,

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.683
there's all kinds of
good reasons to stand.

00:35:45.683 --> 00:35:47.720
And I agree with that.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:51.340
However when the studies were
actually done with DEXA scans

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.653
and things at Boston Children's,

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:58.420
you have to stand for at
least an hour half a day

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.513
to get any improvement in your bones.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.115
That's a lot, an hour
and a half a day's a lot.

00:36:04.115 --> 00:36:08.246
And no one knows if it affects,
they don't have a long-term,

00:36:08.246 --> 00:36:10.940
they don't know if it affects
fracture or fragility.

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.910
And if you look at how some of these kids,

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:16.650
particular the GMFCS 4
and 5 kids are standing,

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:18.320
they're standing on their groin,

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.320
there's no weight going
through those legs.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:24.500
So the area in your pelvis
is probably pretty good.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.793
That area never breaks.

00:36:27.319 --> 00:36:28.319
But you just wonder,

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.320
when I tell us someone,
when they want to go onto

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.760
a standing program, I
ask them do they like it.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.840
And if the kid likes it, and
they like to do things upright,

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.280
I think that's really good.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.750
Because I take care of adults,
and I still had some people

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:45.900
that were taking four other
adults to lift this person

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:49.023
into a standing frame every
day, and the person hated it.

00:36:50.457 --> 00:36:51.520
Because they said well,
it's gonna affect his bones,

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.850
he's gonna break his bones if we don't.

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:54.250
And I don't think there's any evidence

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:55.650
that shows that that's true.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:59.520
Wheelchairs, we go from
the simple sling chairs

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.890
to the custom power chairs.

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:04.870
Don't ever use those for
anything but transportation.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:06.360
Any of the sling chairs,
I mean have you sat

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.510
in one of those chairs,

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:09.480
you know the ones they take
you out of the hospital with?

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.810
If you sit on those for
more than like an hour,

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:15.600
your legs numb, and they're
not very comfortable.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.340
But it becomes very expensive,
and we go the way up

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.960
to these very expensive things.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.900
I know you all know this
because you work in the field.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.053
How much do these cost?

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.223
Yeah, my son's cost 35,000, the last one.

00:37:29.246 --> 00:37:31.950
Be he has to tilt in space
because he has GI problems,

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:35.940
and so it just becomes
very very expensive,

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.140
if you think about that.

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:42.960
Transportation, there's
not very many of these,

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.280
this is from Columbus, Ohio.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.140
These are very expensive.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.070
I'm on our fourth one of those,

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:50.220
how much do those cost?

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.880
Yeah, after the van after it's converted,

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.750
it's 50, yeah 45 to 50.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:02.603
If you get an FM radio
in it, it's like 40, 50.

00:38:05.878 --> 00:38:08.060
So they're very expensive
and that's the problem.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:09.910
Most of our families can't afford this.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:11.370
I'm an orthopedic
surgeon, I can afford it,

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:15.043
but it's not readily
available to everyone.

00:38:17.782 --> 00:38:18.615
When you can get them used

00:38:18.615 --> 00:38:21.100
that means they're almost worn out.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.843
The shocks are bad, everything's bad,

00:38:22.843 --> 00:38:25.120
because you had all that extra weight.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.600
So we talk about the medical
management of cerebral palsy,

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.850
and it's not just the motor problems,

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:31.480
all those things we talked about before.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.230
And I just list all of these things here

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:35.113
because my son's had all of those.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:40.155
And unfortunately I had to
diagnose most of them myself,

00:38:40.155 --> 00:38:41.880
because no one picked them up,

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.890
particularly the the gall stones

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:46.583
and the the kidney stones were missed.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:49.890
So we talked about movement disorders,

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:54.890
and the importance of how we treat these.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.013
What is spasticity?

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.600
Know the definition of spasticity&lt;

00:39:02.404 --> 00:39:04.033
You all treat it every day, what is it?

00:39:08.808 --> 00:39:11.279
Do you guys know what you're treating?

00:39:11.279 --> 00:39:14.150
(laughing)

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:17.060
What is the definition of spasticity?

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:21.350
Yeah, that's not it, actually.

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.053
Yes sir?

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:34.160
Yeah, that's not it either.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:34.993
Yes?

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.808
Yes, it's the reaction of a
muscle to a rapid stretch.

00:39:39.808 --> 00:39:41.640
To a rapid movement.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.910
What you're talking about is dystonia,

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:44.603
and I'll talk about that in just a second.

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:47.560
And what's the best way to test it?

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.003
Big hint's on the board.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:53.690
That's how you rapidly stretch a muscle,

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:55.790
you'd hit the tendon and you stretch it.

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:57.620
And that's how that's how it works.

00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:59.363
Choreo-athetosis what is that?

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:06.007
Oh come on, this group,
I can, there you go.

00:40:06.007 --> 00:40:06.840
All right there you got
it, you got it back there.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.740
It's the marionette
movement, and that's great,

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.093
so that's very good, I appreciate that.

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:15.820
How about ataxia, how do you
know if someone is ataxic.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.890
So every time you either walk
with a really broad base,

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:25.580
or every time you walk,
the next step is different

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:26.730
from the one before it.

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:30.370
I know none of you have ever
seen anybody drink alcohol,

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:34.380
but if you have, that's what
ataxia looks like afterwards.

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:38.070
So it's every step, maybe you
might have had alcohol before.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:40.860
I just came from the American
Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.623
in New Orleans, I saw a
lot of ataxia come in.

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:49.130
Fact my son, who's now a
chief resident in orthopedics

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:51.820
at the Cleveland Clinic came
in at 2:00 in the morning

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.927
yesterday, quite ataxic.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.800
And then dystonia is
what you were talking,

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.080
dystonia is the posturing,
you get your muscle

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.190
in a different position and
you posture and turn the head,

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:05.540
you see this in the kids.

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.397
And this is a really critical thing,

00:41:07.397 --> 00:41:10.883
and it changes how we take care of kids.

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:14.100
When I give this talk
to orthopedic surgeons

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.710
I go, why do we care
about any of this stuff,

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:17.250
this is what neurologists do.

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:19.500
But if you have a child that has dystonia,

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.220
the worst thing you could
possibly do for that kid

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:22.930
is to do an orthopedic surgery on them

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:23.980
to lengthen their tendons.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.300
You'll make them much worse.

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.570
My son has dystonia.

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:30.320
And the other thing about
dystonia is it doesn't show up

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.750
until they're about
six or seven years old.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:34.140
They're not born with dystonia,

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.070
and then it gets worse during puberty.

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:37.570
And so you might miss it.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:39.560
And we sometimes do
surgery on little kids,

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.740
and then you screw them up.

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.450
So I would say 10 of my
son's surgeries were wrong

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:46.560
because he has dystonia.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.610
Including the selective dorsal rhizotomy.

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:49.900
So this is just a bigger picture.

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:53.130
And this is really for the
stupid orthopedic surgery,

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:55.290
but hopefully you guys will
pick something up out of it.

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:57.423
So if you all were to cut your head off,

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.053
you would just be a reflex.

00:42:01.991 --> 00:42:06.210
As you walk you would
rapidly stretch your gastroc,

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:07.870
it would go back.

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:09.560
That's your stretch
receptors and your muscle,

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.130
it would go back through your spinal cord

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:13.360
and right away you'd pop
back up on your toes.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.690
And that's what equinus is.

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:18.640
So a kid with equinus is doing that.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.510
What comes from the brain are inhibitors

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:24.590
or modulators of that reflex.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:28.530
And that drug, or that
neurotransmitter, is GABA.

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:30.990
Gamma-aminobutyric acid.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:33.783
So what do we do, what
are things that we give

00:42:33.783 --> 00:42:36.500
that are GABA-agonists.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:40.400
Valium, baclofen, those are
those are GABA-agonists.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.900
What can we do in this
to stop this reflex arc?

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.770
We put botulinum toxin into the muscle,

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:47.560
that stops this thing.

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:50.217
We can do selective dorsal rhizotomies,

00:42:50.217 --> 00:42:52.530
and that's all to break
up this reflex arc.

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:54.750
So this really simple idea

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:58.280
explains how all of our
treatments of spasticity works.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.780
Just based on this.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.430
If you remember that spasticity
is the rapid stretch.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.480
So here's a child with ataxia.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.410
Just to show the movements.

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:12.370
You can see its wide base,
sometimes they're different.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:15.337
Here's a child with choreo-athetosis.

00:43:17.685 --> 00:43:20.280
I think you can see how she
has a hard time walking.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:24.760
Here's a child that has both
dystonia and choreo-athetosis.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.900
So there's the movement
and you'll see his arm

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:28.840
just kind of go into full extension there,

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:33.840
and just keep his arm stiff.

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.363
And that's the dystonia part.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.900
So this really changed our field
of understanding spasticity

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.140
versus dystonia.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:48.140
And so when you tell me a
child has spastic quadriplegia,

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:50.083
that's probably not true.

00:43:50.083 --> 00:43:51.430
There's spasticity there,

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:55.740
but most of them have
dystonic cerebral palsy.

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:56.710
And that's a huge difference.

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:59.600
And this is a picture
of my son when he was,

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.070
this is in his baseball league
and actually that person

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:03.300
is his roommate today.

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:06.330
They're now 35 and 37 years old.

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:11.010
And then this was him he was
so rotated from his dystonia

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.730
he couldn't use his computer anymore.

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:16.370
He couldn't drive his wheelchair
and he asked me at this age

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:18.720
to take him to the
operating room and kill him.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.400
His life was so miserable.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.730
And so this comes down to this area,

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:24.870
it's called the basal ganglia.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:26.370
And of course as an orthopedic surgeon

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:28.600
I will spend an hour
explaining these to you,

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.480
I have no idea what they are,

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.433
but they're somewhere down in the brain.

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:38.010
But there are other problems
that happen with cerebral palsy

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.990
that we forget about is the
loss of selective motor control.

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:43.500
So two children, they
look exactly the same,

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.160
they the same amount of spasticity,

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.860
but if you ask them to reach for something

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:48.030
and grab it they can't.

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:49.820
And the one that's the most common

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.410
is someone that has hemiplegia

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:53.590
that has a drop foot afterwards.

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:55.140
They can't fire their tib-ant,

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.136
even though they have a tib-ant.

00:44:57.136 --> 00:44:58.490
The tibialis anterior muscle.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:01.310
We forget the sensory deficits
that happen with strokes

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:02.813
for kids with hemiplegia,

00:45:02.813 --> 00:45:04.920
they may not feel their upper extremity,

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.740
they may not feel their legs.

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.510
And then last is weakness,

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:11.688
and we really didn't
appreciate how weak children

00:45:11.688 --> 00:45:15.150
with cerebral palsy were weak

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:17.340
until we were able to
manage their spasticity.

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:20.520
You can stand up a kid with
spasticity and dystonia,

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.560
and they just stand there and go,

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.847
look how strong that kid is.

00:45:22.847 --> 00:45:24.900
And then you manage that
and they're just as a weak

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.053
as you possibly can be.

00:45:27.024 --> 00:45:29.916
And so what do we do with physical therapy

00:45:29.916 --> 00:45:32.690
and managing spasticity.

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:35.128
We can do physical
therapy and those of you

00:45:35.128 --> 00:45:36.770
who've had a massage
know exactly how you feel

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:38.370
for about 15 minutes afterwards,

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:39.640
and go why did I spend that much money,

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:42.100
it was great but now I feel tight again.

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.090
And then these are the drugs that we use.

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:47.640
So we use diazepam, we use baclofen,

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.230
and for kids who have
dystonia we can use this drug

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:51.253
called artane.

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.890
I haven't had good success with it,

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:55.410
but there are some people that use it

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:57.860
for all their children with dystonia.

00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.210
The big problem that I've seen with this

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:02.950
is really severe nightmares.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:05.070
So the kids just want to quit taking it

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:06.413
because their nightmares are so bad.

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:11.610
We can put phenol or
alcohol right on the nerve,

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:13.320
and that dissolves the myelin sheath,

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.880
and that breaks up once
again that reflex arc.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.540
And then we can use the botulinum toxins,

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:21.170
once again are off-label,

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:23.913
but I've given over 20,000 injections now.

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:28.163
And now I have six
physiatrists that work with me,

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:30.920
and that's much of what they do.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.510
And this new thing, this cannabis CBD oil,

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:36.570
I think there's really some hope for that.

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:39.250
I have some families who are using that.

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:41.570
And the problem is is we can't study it.

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:44.333
Jeff Sessions said he
would put me in jail.

00:46:45.605 --> 00:46:47.530
And really my hospital won't let me do it

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:49.810
because we're worried we're
gonna lose our federal funding

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:52.470
if we study it so I can't
I can't even study it.

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:53.840
So it's really really kind of sad.

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:55.740
I can prescribe it but I can't use it.

00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:00.010
So in orthopedic surgery
we can lengthen tendons,

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:03.340
that lengthens that reflex arc,

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.620
it changes that reflex arc.

00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:06.750
But it only lasts for about six months.

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:09.320
We can actually cut the
bones to rotate them,

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.940
that lengthens some muscles
and shorten some muscles.

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:14.380
We can cut nerves which
we never like to do

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:17.110
because they often come back
and it doesn't work very well.

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:20.150
And surprisingly if you fuse
the spine in some of these kids

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:22.660
who have really bad
dystonia and athetosis,

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:24.060
it improves them.

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:27.170
We don't know why, there's
some central control of that,

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:28.760
and I think that's why.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.670
The big thing that's changed our care

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:33.830
particularly of dystonia is
the intrathecal baclofen pump.

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:37.920
That's where we place
the pump in the muscles

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:41.855
underneath in the abdomen,
run a tube around the back

00:47:41.855 --> 00:47:43.626
and into the spine.

00:47:43.626 --> 00:47:44.750
And you can run it all the way up.

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:46.100
If you want to get the upper extremities

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.170
you put it up there, if
you want to get both,

00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:50.710
if you want to get upper and
lower, if you just need lower

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:52.180
you do there.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:55.623
My son had the highest one put
in at the time, it's at C2,

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.850
and really changed his
life in several ways.

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:01.865
It got rid of his dystonia completely.

00:48:01.865 --> 00:48:02.793
He has none.

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:07.920
He's floppy now, which is
great to help take care of him.

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.440
But he still has motor control.

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.280
The bad thing is it
affected his swallowing,

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.680
and he got pneumonia
which put him in the ICU

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.870
for six months.

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:18.883
And he had to have a feeding tube placed,

00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:22.660
and so those things are all
things you don't think about,

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:27.040
but in retrospect if we ever lost this,

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.310
his quality of life would be so bad.

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:31.310
You can do a selective dorsal rhizotomy.

00:48:32.252 --> 00:48:33.690
So these are these are kids where you cut

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:38.690
some of the afferent neurons
that go back to the spine.

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.540
That breaks up the reflex arc.

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:46.320
You cut about 30 to 40% from L1 to S1,

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.950
and you improve, or from L2 to S1,

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:50.910
and it decreases their spasticity.

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:55.363
However, these are only for
kids who are pure spasticity,

00:48:55.363 --> 00:48:58.950
premature, have good trunk control,

00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:01.053
and are probably level ones or two.

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:03.040
They don't work for everything else.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.520
Of course my son's of
four, he had a rhizotomy,

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:09.550
and because of that he had
horrible lordosis of the spine.

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:11.030
I'll show you his
picture of what happened,

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:12.580
and actually had spine fractures

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:14.550
from being in this lordosis.

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:17.843
So another unintended
consequence made by your father.

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:20.530
So this is him before the surgery

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:21.980
and then after the surgery.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:26.843
And you can tell how that
baclofen pump helped.

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:29.270
Deep brain stimulation seems like could be

00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:31.140
a really positive thing.

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:34.810
The center of research in
this area is here at UCSF,

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:38.072
and my patients that get
the come up here for that.

00:49:38.072 --> 00:49:41.553
And it hasn't worked so
well in cerebral palsy

00:49:41.553 --> 00:49:44.080
because there's such a diffuse injury.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:48.400
It has worked well in kids who have

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:52.340
what's called DYT1 dystonia,
which looks like cerebral palsy

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:55.170
but it's an inherited problem.

00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:58.280
So in orthopedic surgery
we want to do things called

00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:59.960
single event multi-level surgery

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:04.960
where we do as many operations
as we can on one day.

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.890
So I'll sometimes do 20
operations on one day on one kid.

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:11.190
And then they go through all the rehab,

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:13.890
and all the pain's out of the way.

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:15.440
We use epidural catheters,

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.520
and then they start the rehab period.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.940
And that's a new change
and there are still

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:22.420
places in the world that don't do that.

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:24.530
You want to delay the
surgery as long as possible,

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:26.350
so greater than six years.

00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:28.350
And we want to manage their spasticity

00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:31.370
as well as doing their surgery.

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:33.723
So this is a paper that we wrote,

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:37.260
Ros Boyd is the lead author.

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:38.620
And I can guarantee it's true

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:40.750
because we made it up in a bar one night.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:43.700
And it's published, it's
published, so it's got to be true.

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:47.850
But it really is just a philosophy.

00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:51.050
So when they're really
young you use Botox,

00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:54.510
botulinum toxin, and
physical therapy and braces.

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:57.690
As they get older you add casting to that.

00:50:57.690 --> 00:50:58.930
There's more casting.

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:00.650
And the only time we
do something different

00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:03.430
is if their hips are coming out at any age

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:05.010
we put their hips back in.

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:06.850
And that's our philosophy.

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:08.410
A lot of people don't do that.

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:11.900
And the people who don't
do that don't see adults.

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:14.900
And I've had an adult
clinic for a long time now,

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:16.339
almost 30 years.

00:51:16.339 --> 00:51:19.480
And I see what happens when
your hips are dislocated.

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.640
And there's no good way to
fix them once they're out,

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.140
so we put them in at any age.

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:24.470
And I know there'll be people in here,

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:25.940
I saw some people shaking
their heads already,

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:28.817
but we do that all the time.

00:51:28.817 --> 00:51:30.400
And then we do this casting,

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.510
and then we do this single
event, multi-level surgery,

00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:34.910
eight to 10 years old.

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:37.810
And the other thing that you
notice is when you get older

00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:40.290
the surgery doesn't work
as well as you get older.

00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:42.830
So there's this sweet spot, right here,

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:45.600
where we can intervene
and change their life.

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.720
After that it's really
salvage-type things.

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:53.220
So we'll go through, level 1,
these are the high-level kids.

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:57.656
Many of them have seizures,
they may be ASD on the spectrum,

00:51:57.656 --> 00:51:59.190
as well as having this,

00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:01.663
this is from my friend
Kurt Graham in Melbourne.

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:06.620
Very little things, these
kids may need botulinum toxin,

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:10.360
don't need anything else
like intrathecal baclofen,

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.230
and it's mostly a therapy kind of thing

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:14.063
to take care of.

00:52:14.063 --> 00:52:18.540
And level 2, this is spastic
diplegia of prematurity.

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:21.370
These kids have a lot of gait problems,

00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:22.920
and can get significant deformities,

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:24.460
but they don't get scoliosis,

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:27.040
and they rarely get hip problems.

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.015
So these are the kids,

00:52:29.015 --> 00:52:31.727
very few of them will benefit from SDR,

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:34.880
but the botulinum toxin's important.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.930
And this is where we do a lot
of our orthopedic surgery.

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:40.951
And this is a single
event, multi-level surgery.

00:52:40.951 --> 00:52:43.090
These are the kids that are using braces.

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:45.670
And like I said, we can
have an hour-long talk

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:48.260
on almost every one of these slides.

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:51.170
Level three are the kids that
are starting to get dystonia,

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:53.030
so dystonia is coming into the picture.

00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:55.940
It affects how we do the
surgery, affects on what we use.

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:57.320
These are the kids we might use

00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:58.700
an intrathecal baclofen pump,

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:01.700
but usually it's orthopedic surgery.

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.577
We look for their hips
coming out of joint,

00:53:03.577 --> 00:53:05.780
this is when this really starts happening.

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:08.880
And we start looking at their
spine at this point as well.

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.480
And so this is where we do the operations

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:13.340
where we cut the bones,
rotate them, put these plates,

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:16.060
and do these pins here.

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:18.320
And then level four, we're starting to see

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.250
the non-ambulatory patients.

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:22.600
And once again, much more dystonia,

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.250
this is the time we start
using intrathecal baclofen.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.760
Scoliosis and hip problems
are much more prevalent

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:33.250
during this group, and
our surgery changes.

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:36.890
Before we were doing surgery
to improve their ambulation,

00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:38.040
and now we're doing surgery

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.200
to improve their comfort and sitting.

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.590
So now we do different operations.

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:45.790
Before the GMFCS I guarantee
you, I've got papers,

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:48.070
you can look them up,
where I did operations

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:51.560
to get kids walking who
were GMFCS 4s at age 10.

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.946
I mean it's just stupid, you
just shouldn't even do that.

00:53:54.946 --> 00:53:56.973
But I've got papers on it.

00:53:58.444 --> 00:53:59.960
And some of them got better,

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:03.307
but almost all of them
are just sitting now.

00:54:03.307 --> 00:54:05.630
And so once again, this
direct relationship

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:09.170
between hip displacement
and their GMFCS level.

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:12.890
90% of people GMFCS 5
will have hip problems

00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:14.500
and need to be addressed.

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.440
And that tells you about
how you should screen them

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:17.510
and when you should take X-rays.

00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:20.320
And so here, here's the
sockets not forming right,

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.220
the hips coming out of the joint.

00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:24.640
And then we've done CT scan showing that

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:27.420
if you're a sitter your
hip comes out the back.

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.510
So that makes sense if you're sitting,

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:32.580
your muscles are pulling
your hip posteriorally.

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:36.420
And so we do surgery to
fix the valgus of the hip,

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:38.880
meaning the hips going upward.

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:43.140
And also for rotation, which
is femoral anteversion.

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.210
These are the operations that we do,

00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:46.390
here's a kid with hips both out.

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:48.310
Here they are with the hips back in.

00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:52.390
Another kid, same thing,
hips, here with their hips in.

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:55.180
Long-term follow up on that one.

00:54:55.180 --> 00:55:00.180
So GMFCS 5s, these kids have
multiple medical comorbidities.

00:55:01.255 --> 00:55:04.190
Almost all these kids have dystonia.

00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:05.630
So we treat these,

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:08.630
90% of them will get hip
problems and scoliosis.

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:10.563
And our goal is comfortable sitting.

00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:13.910
Also managing these comorbidities,

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:15.540
a lot of these kids get all kinds,

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.160
they're seeing all the other doctors,

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:20.550
the gastroenterologist, the
neurologist, pulmonologist.

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:22.800
And our goal is to do preventive surgery

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:25.200
so we don't have to do salvage procedures.

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.000
We also start thinking a lot more

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.810
of the caregiver quality of life.

00:55:28.810 --> 00:55:30.290
We think about it all the time,

00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:33.380
but this is really a
tough time for families

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:35.800
with a child with GMFCS 5.

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:37.840
And so we had do these
things to address the hip,

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.190
and these are all salvage procedures

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:41.200
that we don't want to do.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.050
These are kids whose hips are dislocated

00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:44.140
and no one picked them up,

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:45.650
and these are the things that we can do.

00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:47.460
None of these are good.

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.909
This is a 13-year-old kid
whose hip was coming out,

00:55:49.909 --> 00:55:52.570
there is no cartilage
on this hip left, OK.

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:54.910
Can you imagine how painful that would be.

00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:56.890
So isn't this a very cool operation

00:55:56.890 --> 00:55:58.540
where we just cut the hips out?

00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:01.190
It's terrible, it's a terrible operation.

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:03.490
Total hips, you go oh, we
just put a total hip in.

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:05.400
Very high complication rate.

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.750
And very difficult to do,

00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:09.760
there's a lot of complexity in doing that.

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.620
One of my friends in DuPont in Wilmington

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:14.800
is putting in shoulder arthroplasties in.

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:18.323
Because these kids are so
small that a shoulder will,

00:56:19.159 --> 00:56:21.500
you could put a shoulder
there and that would work.

00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:23.480
I'm getting ready to publish this study,

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:25.680
this is where we inject botulinum toxin

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.180
in the muscles around the hip.

00:56:28.199 --> 00:56:29.653
And have had great results,

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:33.590
with pain relief for
up to up to six months.

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:36.350
So, it's an expensive way to treat it,

00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:38.210
but not more expensive than
going in the operating room.

00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:40.950
Just walking in an operating
room costs $15,000.

00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:44.640
And so if I use 400
units of botulinum toxin,

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:49.640
that's $2,000 or something
like that, $3,000.

00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:52.363
So it's much cheaper than doing surgery.

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:55.530
This is my son's foot

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:58.480
after my partners did all these
terrible operations on him.

00:56:59.657 --> 00:57:01.120
And he had this ulcer.

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.380
And so I came in the operating room

00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:03.800
and told them how to
do the right operation,

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.000
and that's his foot now.

00:57:06.050 --> 00:57:08.590
So we fused the MTP joint
and we lengthened the tendon.

00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:10.443
I'm joking about that, but no.

00:57:11.318 --> 00:57:12.810
But his foot does look better now.

00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:15.033
And so we fuse joints for stability.

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:18.780
In the spine we have all
these different deformities,

00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:20.370
particularly things like scoliosis.

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:22.190
And this is my son's surgery,

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:23.700
here you can see is baclofen pump.

00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:27.640
And you can see these
rods and things in there.

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.973
So this is very common
in the kids who GMFCS 5.

00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.920
Now once again, I could talk in an hour

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.010
about each one of these things.

00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:37.855
There's all these things

00:57:37.855 --> 00:57:38.688
that are called alternative treatments

00:57:38.688 --> 00:57:39.880
or unconventional treatments.

00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:42.643
And I'm not going to
spend much time on them.

00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:45.670
But a lot of these are
entrepreneurial-based,

00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:49.900
and just because it means that
we didn't come up with them

00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:52.280
as doctors so that means
they must be wrong.

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:55.203
But there might be
something to some of these,

00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:57.810
but most of them have not been shown

00:57:57.810 --> 00:58:00.250
to have any good long-term outcome.

00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:03.384
Caregiver stress is an
important area to think about,

00:58:03.384 --> 00:58:04.620
because you're not
treating just the child,

00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:07.490
you're treating the family,
you're treating the parents.

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:09.720
There's a much higher
instance of back pain.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:11.010
I've had three spine surgeries,

00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:12.420
but I probably blame that on football

00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:13.570
and being an orthopedic surgeon,

00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:15.213
but I did lift my son a lot.

00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:17.900
So there's a higher incidence of back pain

00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:20.930
in parents who have kids
with cerebral palsy.

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:22.483
Increased mental strain.

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:25.290
You know there's a paper that was written

00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:30.290
that said 85% of parents with
cerebral palsy are divorced.

00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:32.750
And I go gosh, I just don't see that.

00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:37.270
And then when I wrote a paper
on this caregiver stress

00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:39.100
I found out that person just made that up

00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:40.410
and put it in a book.

00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:44.810
And the statistics are no
worse than regular marriage,

00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:46.483
which is 50%, still pretty bad.

00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:49.400
However, mothers usually
give up to their jobs

00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:50.423
or their careers.

00:58:51.738 --> 00:58:53.350
There're sleep disorders with the child,

00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:56.020
there're sleep disorders with
the parents particularly.

00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:58.100
My wife has probably not
had a good night's sleep

00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:59.683
in 35 years.

00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:02.250
There's sibling stress.

00:59:02.250 --> 00:59:03.850
It's interesting if you
look at a lot of literature

00:59:03.850 --> 00:59:07.947
on siblings, they go
into caregiving fields,

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:09.860
which is really interesting.

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:12.780
I said my son's going to be a
pediatric orthopedic surgeon,

00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:15.280
so it's kind of interesting.

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:18.080
The other stress is something
that Yvonne brought up today,

00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.490
is that we have all these new treatments

00:59:21.490 --> 00:59:24.070
that are very expensive,
and we have no evidence.

00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:25.650
And what are you supposed to do.

00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:27.450
And I was guilty of that,

00:59:27.450 --> 00:59:31.590
we used the selective dorsal rhizotomy.

00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:34.630
But the stem-cell treatment
is what everybody wants now.

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:37.790
And people go to Mexico and
Germany and China to get these,

00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:38.623
as you all know.

00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:41.360
I have a whole talk on transition,

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.360
so I won't go through this.

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:45.350
And I won't talk about
some of the adult issues,

00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:47.100
but I have a huge adult clinic.

00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.876
And one thing I want to bring up

00:59:48.876 --> 00:59:49.920
because I'm going to bring it up again

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.960
is that the huge mental problems

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:55.540
that people with cerebral palsy have.

00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:58.520
45% of my patients have bipolar disorder.

00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.470
And it's not because
they're just depressed

01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:04.100
because they have a disability.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.650
They actually become manic,

01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:08.340
or they don't sleep for seven
days and are hitting out

01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.710
and reaching out to people.

01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:11.360
This is a different problem
and this is something

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.860
that we haven't haven't noticed that much.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.343
I end with two things.

01:00:16.838 --> 01:00:19.080
And I've been through these,

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.820
and just like when you
someone in your family dies

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.330
you go through these stages of grief,

01:00:23.330 --> 01:00:25.930
of shock and denial.

01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:29.140
Anger, bargaining, depression.

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:31.710
Testing, seeing if there's
any real realistic solution,

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:33.270
and finally acceptance.

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:35.530
And every one of our
families goes through these

01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:36.800
at different times.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.193
Some of them never get past anger.

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:41.610
And some of them get to acceptance

01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:43.199
when the kid's two or three years old.

01:00:43.199 --> 01:00:44.032
They go OK, this is what it is,

01:00:44.032 --> 01:00:45.887
and this how I have to live.

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:49.627
So what have I learned in my 35 years?

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.083
People are seeking for
a cure for their child.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:57.210
Simple insights led to
great changes in care.

01:00:57.210 --> 01:00:59.940
Dystonia, the GMFCS.

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:01.950
There's almost no money
available for research,

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:03.300
as Marshalyn will tell you.

01:01:04.262 --> 01:01:08.150
We went to Congress, lobbied,

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:09.850
you didn't get to go
because you work for them.

01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:11.500
But we got to go, we went to Congress.

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.400
Huh?

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.363
I did, yeah, and we got $60 million.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.250
And then it got sequestered.

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:19.290
And nobody knows where it is.

01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:21.860
And Tom Harkin retired,

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.510
and so we don't have
anything, there's no money.

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:26.350
There's a huge disparity
between health care

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:29.170
for children and adults with disabilities.

01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:31.160
Treatment's important but
as Yvonne was saying today,

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.780
prevention is the real hope.

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:36.560
And all of you are my heroes.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.890
Especially those who
have no vested interest

01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:42.650
