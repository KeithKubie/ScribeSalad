00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.980
In the last lesson, you learned how to
plan and execute a design sprint so

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.860
you can test prototypes with real users.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.050
&gt;&gt; In this lesson you'll
learn about metrics and

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.830
how can you tie them to
improve your products?

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.680
You'll use these metrics to
drive business decisions and

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.670
prioritize what you want to work on,
on the next design sprint.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.550
&gt;&gt; To get started, let's look at a
couple different metrics that you might

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.420
be interested in measuring.
