00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.140
It has filled countless diapers, caused discomfort
for any number of airline passengers, and

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.570
it totally ruined the Dude’s rug, which
really tied the room together, man.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.900
Anatomists call it micturition and I don’t
know why because the rest of us know it as

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.889
urination, which seems like a fine word.

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.849
All mammals, and most animals urinate
to remove toxins and to help maintain

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.560
water-volume homeostasis, or blood pressure.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.130
And while some of us spray it around to attract
mates or mark territory, or deter predators,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.740
as far as I know, only humans actually study
pee.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.500
In fact, we’ve been doing it for thousands
of years.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.480
Even before Hippocrates extolled the diagnostic
virtues of pee-sniffing, early Sumerian and

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.210
Babylonian physicians were making urine-related
observations.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.579
Medieval doctors, as well, diagnosed diseases
based on on smelling, inspecting, or even

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.190
tasting urine samples. And although they were
often totally off-base -- which makes me feel

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.040
bad for those guys who sipped urine for no
reason -- they were kind of on to something.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.380
Today, urological tests can help detect a
lot of ailments based on the color, smell,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.469
clarity, and chemical composition of a sample.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.790
Freshly peed urine is usually about 95 percent
water, slightly acidic -- with a pH of around

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.320
6 -- a little aromatic, and usually somewhere
between clear and dark yellow in color, depending

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.830
on your level of hydration.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.640
Urine also contains over 3000 different chemical
compounds, and their varying levels of concentration

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.060
can tell us a lot about what’s going on
in the body.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.270
For example, if you give me a urine sample
-- I will have no idea what to do with it,

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.190
but if you give it to a doctor and they can
see that it’s cloudy with white blood cells,

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.479
that’s a good sign you’ve got a urinary
tract infection.

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.510
If it smells sweet and contains a lot of glucose,
you may have diabetes.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.760
If it looks pink, then -- unless you’ve
erecently aten beets -- you probably have

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.939
internal bleeding somewhere.

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.580
And if it is chocked full of proteins, you
could be pregnant, or working out too hard,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.790
or have high blood pressure, or be headed
to heart failure…

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.140
So as you can see, even if the most thought
you’ve given the subject is to wonder if

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.850
you should pee now or wait until the end of
the movie, the whole process of producing,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.549
storing, and eliminating pee is no where near
as simple as it may seem.

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.700
From osmotic pressure to stretch receptors to
hormones, our circulatory, nervous, and endocrine

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.240
systems regulate how much urine we produce,
what goes into it, and when to get rid of it.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.400
So join me as we journey into the world of
pee.

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.909
Wait. No. Can we rephrase that?

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.080
All right, how about: “let’s look at where
your pee comes from.” No, actually, that

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.230
doesn’t sound good either. Let’s begin
by looking at what regulates the production

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.050
of urine. That works.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.959
Last time, we discussed how your kidneys filter
your blood, but the actual production of urine

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.840
can be affected by a whole host of factors.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.790
One thing that might have crossed your mind
last time is that the production of urine

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.590
must -- by its very nature -- be influenced by
blood -- specifically, its volume and its pressure.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.440
Because, step one in pee-making is the process
of glomerular filtration -- where blood is

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.620
filtered in the little blood-filled balls
of yarn that are the glomeruli.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.930
So, just like water in a hose, higher pressure
in the blood must push more plasma out of

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.050
the capillaries and into the glomeruli.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.569
But here’s a problem: Your kidneys can only
handle so much filtrate at a time, so they

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.440
have to maintain a constant rate of flow inside
of them.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.560
This is known as the glomerular filtration
rate -- or how much blood passes through the

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.129
glomeruli every minute.

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.000
And your kidneys have ways of regulating this
rate, despite changes in blood pressure.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.349
If your blood pressure happens to increase,
for example, the higher pressure causes the

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.610
arterioles leading to your glomeruli to stretch.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.610
And then the smooth muscle in the walls of
the glomeruli respond to this stretching stimulus

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.909
by constricting -- automatically reducing
the amount of blood flow into the glomeruli

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.590
and leaving the flow rate relatively unchanged.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.060
This kind of intrinsic control, or autoregulation,
is helpful in controlling the filtration rate

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.730
through normal ranges of blood pressures,
but the kidneys mostly regulate urine concentration

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.849
at the other end of the nephron tubules.

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.920
This kind of regulation I’m sure you’re familiar
with. If you’ve ever had too much coffee

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.800
or gone on a bit of a bender, you may have experienced
the pleasure of having to pee every five minutes.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.300
That’s because your endocrine system has
a lot to say about your bathroom breaks, so

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.209
you have some strong hormonal mechanisms that
affect when and how often you go.

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.409
And as it happens, both caffeine and alcohol
inhibit the release of one of these hormones

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.250
-- called antidiuretic hormone, or ADH -- which
is secreted by the posterior pituitary gland

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.720
to help the body retain water and stay hydrated.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.019
How ADH works is kind of complex, but first,
let’s remember that cell membranes are generally

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.590
not that permeable to water.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.950
But in the parts of the nephron that reabsorb
water, like the descending limb of the loop

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.499
of Henle, water has to move easily through
cells, from the filtrate to the blood.

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:25.139
This is possible because of special protein
channels in their membranes called aquaporins

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.799
that are on both the apical, or filtrate-facing side,
and the basal, or capillary-facing side of the cells.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.180
By contrast, the cells lining the collecting
duct only have aquaporins on the basal side,

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:37.779
so not a lot of reabsorption takes place there
usually.

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:42.860
But ADH triggers those cells to move aquaporins
they have in storage, over to the apical side,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.860
which allows more water to leave the urine.
And since caffeine and alcohol inhibit ADH,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.159
that means no moving aquaporins, which means
very little water reabsorption, and ultimately

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:54.279
tons of peeing, and dehydration.

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.289
So, leah, lots of factors affect the production
of urine.

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.919
But once it’s produced, it doesn’t just
leave the building. It has to be moved, and

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.339
stored, until the time is right.

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:06.029
Once the urine leaves the kidneys, it enters
the ureters, a pair of slender tubes that

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:08.939
drop down to the posterior urinary bladder.

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:12.699
Contrary to what you might think, your ureters
aren’t just passive tubes, and your pee

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.270
doesn’t wind up in your bladder because
of gravity alone.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.730
Rather, like the small intestines, each ureter
features a layer of smooth muscle that contracts

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.320
to move urine using peristalsis.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.300
The frequency and strength of these peristaltic
waves varies, depending on how fast urine

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.629
is being produced, and a series of valves
prevent pee from backing up, making sure that

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:30.990
instead it reaches the bladder.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.889
The bladder is a hollow, collapsible sac that
temporarily stores urine. Like the kidneys,

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.990
it’s retroperitoneal, located posterior
to the pubic bone and anterior to the rectum.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.719
The bladder wall consists of three layers
-- an inner mucosa, surrounded by a thick

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:48.039
muscular layer called the detrusor wrapped
in a fibrous, protective outer membrane.

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.469
The inner mucosal layer consists of transitional
epithelium, which allows the bladder to expand

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:56.860
so it can hold more urine, a handy feature
for social mammals like us who prefer dry

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.529
underwear and peeing in private.

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:03.179
When it’s empty, it collapses into a triangular
shape, folding up on itself like a deflated

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:08.369
balloon. Then as urine accumulates, the bladder
thins and expands into a pear-shape, and all

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:09.419
those folds disappear.

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:14.059
A full bladder can comfortably hold around
500 ml of pee, though it can usually expand

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:17.729
to hold a maximum of around one liter. At
that point, though, you’re pushing your

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:22.490
luck, because prolonged overdistention could
-- in theory -- lead to a burst bladder, although

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.069
you’d probably just pee your pants first.

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.159
But let’s assume for the sake of polite
conversation that you have found an appropriate

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:32.179
location to relieve yourself: Your urine enters
the thin but muscular urethra by passing through

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:33.979
the internal urethral sphincter.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.580
Now we don’t actually have voluntary control
over this particular sphincter, but the autonomic

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.599
nervous system keeps it cinched up whenever
you’re not peeing to prevent leakage.

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.869
Once the urine is through the sphincter, it
heads down through the urogenital diaphragm

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:49.080
which includes the last stop, the external
urethral sphincter, which is probably the

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.440
one you’re familiar with, because it’s made of skeletal
muscles and is the one that you control voluntarily.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:01.060
ONLY NOW are we finally ready to explore the act of
micturition itself, the actual excretion of urine, urination.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.999
As the pee from your morning coffee builds
up, it causes the bladder to push out, activating

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:06.860
the stretch receptors in its walls.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.770
The resulting nerve impulses zip along afferent
fibers to the sacral region of the spinal

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.119
cord, along interneurons, and toward the brain,
eventually exciting the parasympathetic neurons

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:16.990
and inhibiting the sympathetic system.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.529
This tells the detrusor to contract while
the internal urethral sphincter simultaneously

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:26.539
opens, and the external sphincter relaxes
so that the pee can flow out.

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:30.110
This, you may or not recall, is kind of an
acquired skill.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.469
When you’re a baby, those stretch-receptor
impulses trigger a simple spinal reflex that

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:38.839
coordinates this whole process, and you have
no real control over when you pee.

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:42.029
But within a couple of years of birth, your
brain’s circuits have developed the ability

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:46.249
to override simple reflexive urination and
to choose a different neural pathway.

00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:47.379
So how’s that possible?

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:51.589
Well, an area of your brainstem, called the
pons, contains two different centers that

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:56.559
lock down your urination control, or lack
of it: there’s the pontine storage area,

00:07:56.559 --> 00:08:01.199
which inhibits urination, and the pontine
micturition center, which gives it the green light.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.580
As your bladder fills up, impulses triggered
by stretch receptors head to the pons and

00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:07.599
other higher brain centers that give you that
conscious feeling that you have to pee.

00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:11.399
If your bladder isn’t full, and you’re
too busy to find a bathroom, it mostly activates

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:15.110
the pontine storage area that keeps you from
peeing, by inhibiting your parasympathetic

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.369
activity and increasing sympathetic output.

00:08:17.369 --> 00:08:20.610
Of course, the longer you hold it, the more
your bladder fills up, and eventually the

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.969
need to pee becomes too strong to ignore,
at which point the pontine micturition center

00:08:24.969 --> 00:08:30.559
jumps into action, overriding the previous orders,
and opening the sphincters so you can finally tinkle.

00:08:30.559 --> 00:08:33.339
And that’s how your own personal waterworks
… works.

00:08:33.339 --> 00:08:37.509
Whether you’re a baby in diapers, or a grown-up
science student … or a guy who was sent

00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:40.219
to “leave a message” on Jeffrey Lebowski’s
rug.

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:43.509
Today you learned how the urinary system regulates
the production of urine, by maintaining a

00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:48.050
study glomerular flow rate. We also talked
about the anatomy of storing and excreting

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:52.360
urine -- from the ureters to the urethra -- and
we went over the nervous system’s role in

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.519
controlling the act of urination.
