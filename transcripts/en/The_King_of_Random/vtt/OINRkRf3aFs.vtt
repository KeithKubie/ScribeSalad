00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
In yesterdays video we made a simple homemade contraption

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.180
That will convert plastic 2 liter bottles into hundreds of feet of plastic string.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.200
making over 1,200 feet of this plastic

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.550
string so for this video I thought it'd

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.750
be fun to bring back our rope making

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.130
machine and wind these strands together

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.020
to see if we could make ourselves a

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.750
genuine plastic grip now the two main

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.340
questions I saw in my rope making video

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.170
were how do you make a longer rope and

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.340
what would happen if you were to take

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.260
three fully made ropes and wind them

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.939
together on the road making machine well

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:27.960
you're in luck because today we're going

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.400
to answer both of those questions at the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.349
same time we experiment with our plastic

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.320
string now in my original rope making

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.300
tutorial I took these two devices and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.820
clamp them to either end of my workbench

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.020
and strung a line between them so if you

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.300
want to make your rope longer all you

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.870
have to do is increase the distance

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.300
between them so for today's wrote making

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.620
experiment why don't we take our spinner

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.450
hook unit and clamp it right here to the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.890
head of my workbench it will take the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.300
back end unit and clamp it across the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.539
room to counter 20 feet away now since

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.980
we've increased the distance of a rope

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.000
machine we're also going to need to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.680
increase the distance of our guidelines

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.539
as well so I went down to the home depot

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.370
and picked up a couple packs of 50 foot

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.170
paracord this just gives us the option

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.240
to run our machine out 50 feet long if

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.770
we ever feel like doing that let's go

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.210
ahead and bust out some chords and line

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.740
our machine

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:32.660
(Music plays)

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.280
beautiful thing when a plan comes

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.680
together

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.960
Here we go

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.480
okay the good news guys in a couple of

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.590
minutes we've got our rope machine all

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.300
set up the guide wires are nice and

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.710
tight and the slider moves easily

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.440
between both ends so just for fun i went

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.550
ahead and measured out the distance

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.080
between these two contraptions and it

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.180
runs about 22 feet and since the two

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.100
liter bottle makes about 95 feet of rope

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.060
we're going to need about one and a half

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.890
bottles to make this length of rope here

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.240
and you know how it works from here

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.470
we're going to take our strings thread

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.820
it between all the hooks then take a

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.500
power drill and wind them all together

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.899
most took these suckers up to get

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.600
spinning I think I'm going to start out

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.100
with green just because that's kind of

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.360
unique

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.080
all right there's one and a half hooks

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.560
done and I don't think we're going to

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.080
make it back with this and we shouldn't

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.000
need nearly as much just half

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.800
cool we got all of our lines strung and

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.319
as anticipated it took one and a half

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.689
soda bottles to string this line really

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:58.129
curious to see how this works out now

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.540
it's looking really good so it's time to

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.189
hook up our drill get spinning and see

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.940
exactly what happened

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:27.720
(Music plays)

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.000
oh wow it's going started making the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.520
rope that's good news we might actually

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.440
have some success

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:57.240
(Music plays)

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.700
sweet look at that we actually did it we

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.770
made a genuine piece of soda bottle rope

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.690
now because it's so long I did have to

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.400
guide the spacer forward with my hand at

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.360
times to release some of the tension

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.220
because I felt like the rope was going

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.780
to break but once it got within about

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.340
four feet is just one on that so no

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.519
problem there you have a guy's there is

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.769
our length of soda bottle cordage now we

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.269
start off with about twenty two and a

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.730
half feet of cord and after it while I'm

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.350
attention into it this rope turned out

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.540
being 18 and a half feet so looks like

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.270
it shrunk in size by about 4 feet if you

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.770
look really closely you can see it does

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.930
actually resemble a three stranded rope

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.669
now because the fibers were a little bit

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.680
wider than feistel or any other kind of

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.750
fiber it gives it a little bit more of a

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.690
rough appearance a rough texture it

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.169
looks pretty cool nice shiny and green

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.990
kind of pretty this actually worked out

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.460
pretty well I'm very encouraged let's

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.000
rig up our machine and make two more

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:16.160
(Music plays)

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.020
beautiful there it is boys two down one to go

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.280
Ok im releaseing tention

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:36.200
(Music plays)

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.060
update guys we have finished three

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.860
different strands of three stranded rope

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.390
and they're looking pretty good so what

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.620
would happen if you rigged these three

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.210
lines up to our machine wound them again

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.460
is it possible to wind a three strand

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.530
rope out of three strand rope this is rope

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.700
reception

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.400
(Music plays)

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.530
guys I'm excited this is the moment of

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.210
truth we have our three strands hooked

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.680
up to our rope making machine to make

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.090
another rope and it's time to pull the

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.530
trigger but there is an important thing

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.599
we need to keep in mind whenever we're

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:06.979
making a rope out of three strand of

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.509
rope we need to spin the hook the

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.639
opposite direction if we spin the ropes

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:11.750
the same way we did when we originally

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.430
created them they'll actually undo

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.229
themselves this time we need to flip our

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.090
drill into reverse and spin hooks the

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.189
opposite way you can see it when we spin

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:20.629
the hooks this direction it actually

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:22.189
tightens the rope it makes it harder

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:23.599
which is exactly what we want we don't

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.490
want it to undo itself we want it to get

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.860
better will it work we're about to find

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.360
out here we go

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:52.520
(Music plays)

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.160
cool it's not perfect but that is

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.430
looking more like a rope so check that

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.229
out guys we took three of our robes put

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:02.850
them together and made them into another

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.139
rope and this stuff is looking pretty

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:07.710
legit it's a little rough but it looks a

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.240
lot more like a rope panels like a rope

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.759
and looks incredibly strong now just to

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:12.990
go one step further why don't we take

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.759
this stuff cut it into thirds and run

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.200
one more cable three times a stick

00:07:25.960 --> 00:08:06.060
(Music plays)

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.840
that's kind of cool huh all right let's

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.960
tape it off and call it good

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:19.420
(Music plays)

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.480
success we have done it guys we've

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.400
made a beautiful three stranded rope out

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.759
of three strands rope out of three

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:30.770
stranded rope the total thickness of our

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.330
rope now is nearly half an inch is

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.190
extremely strong extremely durable and

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.169
surprisingly it actually looks like a

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:38.630
rope I'm not sure how practical it is to

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.099
make robot of plastic bottles we can

00:08:40.099 --> 00:08:42.289
definitely see it's possible so let's

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:43.849
recap what we've done here today we

00:08:43.849 --> 00:08:45.740
start off with small strands of plastic

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.540
soda bottle strings so we made some a

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.100
homemade contraption using nothing but a

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.410
piece of wood and undoing we hope those

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.900
strings up to a home made of rope making

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.200
machine and weld them together to make

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.940
three different three stranded rope

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.920
which are very cool by themselves but if

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.390
that wasn't enough we took that rope and

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.040
cut it into thirds and made one final

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.320
rope a rope was in a rope within a rope

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.959
rope ception so very very cool to see

00:09:05.959 --> 00:09:07.220
that this idea works guide we took

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.480
plastic bottles turn them into the

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.790
string and use the string to make PE tu

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.860
rope this is very very sick very very

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.480
durable and can most likely lift

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.730
hundreds and hundreds of pounds thanks

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:17.900
for joining for this project today I'll

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.339
be looking for you the next one talk to

00:09:19.339 --> 00:09:21.920
you then and you can take this and braid

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.890
it again and make another rope olb super

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.130
strong it's a Christmas wreath hit hit a

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:33.140
plastic bottle kind of hurts the hands a

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.200
little bit hey guys thanks for watching

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.000
