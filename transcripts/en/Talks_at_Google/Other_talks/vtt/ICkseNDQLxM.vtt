ALAN EUSTACE: Today, we're
honored to have two extreme

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.200
pilots from very different
extremes.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.470
We have Andre Borschberg, who
flies jets, so Hawker Hunters,

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.140
F-5's at one end of
the envelope.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.270
And we have Bertrand Piccard,
world-record-setting

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.160
balloonist, first to
circumnavigate

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.420
the globe in a balloon.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.300
And together, they have
collaborated on a remarkable

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.190
project that lives in yet
another corner of the

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.690
aeronautical envelope.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.000
And we're honored to have them
here in conversation to tell

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.670
us a bit about it.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.196
But first I think we're going to
roll an introductory film.

00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:37.610
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.885
-The first airplane to fly.

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:46.610
The first to cross
the Atlantic.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.955
The first to break the
sound barrier.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.500
The first to fly day and
night without fuel.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.582
-Three, two, one, go!

00:00:59.582 --> 00:01:00.564
We made it!

00:01:00.564 --> 00:01:04.001
We made it, guys!

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:04.983
We made it.

00:01:04.983 --> 00:01:07.438
Absolutely I believed it.

00:01:07.438 --> 00:01:20.204
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:20.204 --> 00:01:24.050
-When I was a child, I saw my
father diving into the deepest

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.230
point of the ocean
with the US Navy.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.270
That was actually my
first inspiration.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.660
Today, in scientific
exploration, I want to inspire

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.110
others to also achieve the
impossible thanks to

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.264
pioneering spirit.

00:01:40.264 --> 00:01:46.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.350
-I've been educated at MIT, and
this time spent in Boston

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.580
let me [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.220
startup companies.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.900
I know that dreams
fuel innovation.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.870
And I also know that human
commitment and new

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.060
technologies can really
change the world.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.290
-In the spirit of exploration,
Solar Impulse intends to

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.270
achieve the first ever round
the world flight powered by

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.640
solar energy.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.460
-It's amazing, just amazing.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.840
-Inspiring new generations.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.545
Bringing innovative solutions to
the challenges of humanity.

00:02:27.545 --> 00:02:29.455
Inventing a brighter future.

00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:51.974
-And you-- would you like
to be a part of it?

00:03:01.187 --> 00:03:02.660
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.980
ALAN EUSTACE: So to be clear,
this project of yours, this

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.665
collaboration, has
some implicit and

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:08.740
some explicit goals.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.100
Can we start out by telling us
what the explicit goals are?

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.370
What exactly, in FAI terms, is
it that you're attempting to

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.020
do first this year,
and then in 2015?

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.040
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.100
BERTRAND PICCARD:
Exactly, yes.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.000
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: Our goal, as
you have seen, is to fly

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.140
around the world with a
solar-powered airplane.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.700
To do with it, we need
to fly day and night.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.480
Up to now, I think the
solar-powered airplane has

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.340
been flying since
about 30 years.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.550
But they fly well when the sun
is high in the sky, so between

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.220
10 o'clock and 3 o'clock
in the afternoon.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.300
But no one can fly
through the day.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.300
And of course, no one can fly
through the night as well.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.060
To cross ocean, of course we
need to get to this notion of

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.600
perpetual flight.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.000
And we wanted to have
a clean solution.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.970
The solution's where you collect
the energy directly on

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.300
the airplane.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.300
And you'll understand
why afterwards.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.670
So what we did now was able
to demonstrate we

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.149
can fly day and night.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:18.490
We limit ourselves to
fly for 24 hours.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.380
The next goal is 2015.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.600
That's our flight around
the world.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.750
BERTRAND PICCARD: And meanwhile,
if we're here, it's

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.770
to cross the United States.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.090
Because it was until
now a European

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.060
project, Swiss project.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.250
Of course, the next level is to
bring this airplane where

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.200
everything began.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.540
The history of aviation started
here in the US.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.670
So for us, it's great to bring
the project to the high level,

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.160
which is coast to
coast America.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.860
But of course, the goal, as you
can see, is to fly day and

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.300
night with a solar-powered
airplane.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.980
That means without fuel.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.430
But beyond this, what you like
to do, is to inspire people to

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.790
also try to achieve
the impossible.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.090
Because maybe for you, it's
very strange what

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.280
I'm going to say.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.240
But for the rest of the world,
which is not Google, a lot of

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.460
people are limited
by their fears.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.900
They're limited by
their certitudes.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.960
They're limited by their
convictions that they cannot

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.170
do better than what
they already do.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.710
And that's why humankind is
stuck and doesn't move as fast

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.320
as it should.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.870
So we want to bring positive
emotions around innovation,

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.870
around exploration, around clean
technologies, and show

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.050
that the challenges we're
facing now in terms of

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.570
ecology, environments, clean
technologies, energy, and so

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.280
on is really something sexy that
people should look with

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.040
bright eyes, and not
with reluctance.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.490
ALAN EUSTACE: Whoa.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.700
So all of that in
one airplane.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.174
Well, two airplanes, I guess.

00:05:55.174 --> 00:05:55.566
BERTRAND PICCARD: Yeah.

00:05:55.566 --> 00:05:58.676
But if we woke up in the
morning, and we'd go over

00:05:58.676 --> 00:06:00.990
there and say, oh, we should
speak about innovation, we

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.160
should speak about pioneering
spirit, nobody

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.640
would come to listen.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.090
But because we have an airplane

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.710
that is really fantastic.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.710
And the one of you who are
pilots can imagine how it is

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:14.790
to fly any airplane like that.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.140
And the signature in the sky
is such a crazy shape.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.700
Of course people are
attracted by it.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.180
The media talk about it and
gives an opportunity to really

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.280
explain what we deeply think.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.250
So it's an airplane.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.650
We love to fly with
it, of course.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.545
But it's also a vehicle to
spread what we really believe.

00:06:32.545 --> 00:06:34.480
ALAN EUSTACE: That actually
almost sounds like a

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.280
counterpoint to--

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.595
somebody with a keyboard in
front of them can look up the

00:06:40.595 --> 00:06:42.990
Saint-Exupery quotation about
if you want men to build

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.010
ships, don't tell them about the
engineering, but to take

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.106
them down to the shore
and talk of the sea.

00:06:48.106 --> 00:06:49.620
This is sort of the opposite.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.150
You're building a ship so as to,
instead of the sea, teach

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.860
people the wonders of flight,
limit the technology, what you

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.120
can do with unlocking.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.420
I'd love it if somebody could
look up the exact quotation

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.080
now that I've butchered it.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.730
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: The thrill
of flying is a dream, also.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.150
You don't talk only
about technology,

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.950
you talk to the emotions.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.700
I think everyone sees an
airplane can imagine himself

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.960
being there, maybe
flying himself.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.240
So it's really linked to this
part of the brain as well.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.940
BERTRAND PICCARD: You know, in
my entire life, I was reading

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.560
history books about
exploration.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.600
And I saw the power of
exploration in the mindset of

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.510
the people.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.300
And today, with this solar
airplane, we can write a page

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.370
of history instead of only
reading what others have done.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.040
And this is what
is fascinating.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.860
And this is also why we want to
associate as many people as

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.820
possible to this adventure.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.440
So the maximum number of people
can really feel they're

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.340
part of this history of aviation
and energy and

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.640
innovation.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.630
That's why it's nice to make a
talk here, and then to invite

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.090
you to see the land, and have
you really understand what we

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.710
do and spread the words
for further on.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.190
So it's also a communication
project, not only an

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.280
aeronautical project.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.530
Sorry for the pilots!

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.700
ALAN EUSTACE: I was going
to ask this later in the

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.480
discussion, but since you talked
about you want as many

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.340
people as possible involved,
what are the different ways

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.710
you're getting people
involved.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.830
So there are clearly the passive
ways of coming and

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.160
watching, reading,
following online.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.150
Are there more active
ways you're

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.530
getting people involved?

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.930
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: Flying
certainly is the best way.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.659
It's the way we get
most of the people

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.480
following up on the project.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.720
And we have quite a lot
of interactions.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.169
The pilot is connected from
the takeoff to the landing

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:41.740
with the ground.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.790
Not only with the ATC, but with
the control center, and

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.370
through the control center
with media, partners,

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.570
universities, schools.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.100
We had a lot of discussions
in, of course, the public.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.330
But we have a lot of discussions
with the schools

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:59.470
and kids of the age of 10,
12, 14, asking questions.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:03.640
And when you can answer these
questions at 30,000 feet--

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.810
almost at 30,000 feet--

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.370
in a solar-powered airplane,
and you can talk about this

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.572
technology, this is an impact.

00:09:10.572 --> 00:09:15.080
And we've noticed also how
many people dream about

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.810
innovation, dream about being
pioneers in their own life,

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.390
dream about being more open
to the world, but they

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.270
don't dare to do it.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.020
They're alone.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.630
They're isolated.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.770
And we also like to bring these
people around Solar

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.650
Impulse to create more
connections between them.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.890
In other words, to give a little
bit more voice and

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.260
power to the people who have
something to say and to do and

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.040
who don't dare to do it.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.560
So we're starting now.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.680
It's the early beginning.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.440
But you know how an early
beginning can grow.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.530
We're starting to build a
community of people who like

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:54.260
to share this mindset and who
like to interact together.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.990
So it must be a two-way

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:57.550
communication with this community.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.130
So we're starting it now.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.800
And it should be completely
ready for the

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.080
fight around the world.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.070
You can already start to sign
up on our page for that.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.400
ALAN EUSTACE: On the surface, as
I alluded at the beginning,

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.990
balloon pioneer, jet pilot,
you're flying a very different

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.660
kind of airplane
here together.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.650
Can you tell us a bit about how
the collaboration started?

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.250
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: I think it's
Interesting to talk about our

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.030
collaboration.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.790
Because it's, I think, also
linked afterwards to this

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.860
question of flying
the airplane.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.870
We are very different.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.500
I think we share the goal.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.520
We have the same goal.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.600
We share the same values.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.600
But we're extremely different.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.370
Bertrand is a psychiatrist,
American doctor.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.000
Maybe he has more the dimension
of the humanist.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.210
And I'm an engineer, and maybe
more the technology

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:48.910
[INAUDIBLE]

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.850
as we see, we influence each
other so much that he's

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.970
becoming an engineer,
and I'm becoming a

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.130
psychiatrist as well.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.810
But the combination effect
of this totally different

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.930
approach helps us to maybe
find other solutions or

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.250
different solutions.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:07.940
So when we are in disagreement,
for example,

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.400
these are situations we like.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.360
Because we know from this
disagreement will come

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.400
something which is better
than my idea and maybe

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.030
better than his idea.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.560
And I think in terms of flying,
that's the same.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:23.450
Bertrand comes from the
low-speed airplane, but the

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:30.190
airplane also where you have
to discover the flying

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.300
qualities, the envelope.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.600
I'm coming, maybe, from
the fast airplane.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.780
But where I think we have more
knowledge about the behavior

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.590
of this airplane, and we are
somewhere in the middle with

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:42.710
the Solar Impulse.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.140
So everyone is bringing
something different, but which

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.870
helps at the end to achieve,
I hope, our goal.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.465
ALAN EUSTACE: It sounds like a
Lennon and McCartney or a Brin

00:11:51.465 --> 00:11:53.550
and Page type collaboration.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.520
BERTRAND PICCARD: Yeah,
you know how it is.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.450
It's one and one equals three.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.800
That's the best equation.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.930
It's always been both of us.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:03.190
The only one who is really able
to run that project is

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.060
both of us.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.730
ALAN EUSTACE: Let's talk
about the airplane.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.680
So it's insanely large.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.100
It's insanely light.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.370
It's powered by photons
coming from--

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.360
how many million miles away?

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.620
I'm embarrassed I don't remember
how far the sun is.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.620
Tell us a bit about
the structure.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:26.130
I understand that actually
putting this thing together,

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.440
you had to push a bit beyond
the envelope in various

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.170
materials, technology, power,
engineering, aerodynamics.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.330
Tell us about the plane.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.120
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: Maybe to
understand the technical

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.460
questions it's interesting to
see where we are coming from.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.690
When we started the feasibility
study, the first

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.430
questions we looked at were
the question of energy.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.280
That's I think the case for any
airplane, but it's really

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.760
the case for this one.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.500
And how much we could collect,
and of course, how much we

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.980
need, and try to balance both.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.410
It was very clear from
the beginning that

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.290
we had to save energy.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:06.290
In fact, the project is really
about energy savings.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.760
And that's what's attracted
our partners.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.090
If you see the partners we
have, we have about 80

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.430
companies large, small ones.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.850
There's one coming from
the aviation field.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.600
And the 79 others do
not come from the

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.960
aeronautical industry--

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.780
chemical, electronics,
whatever.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.850
And the interest of these
people was to develop

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:29.070
technologies that can be used
not only in aviation, but

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.250
everywhere.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:33.840
So energy savings is
the key questions.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.550
So the consequence was quite
straightforward.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:41.300
First, the airplane has to be
big and large and big wingspan

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:46.750
to get more lift and reduce as
much as we could the drag.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:50.490
When you know the size, you can
see and calculate how much

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.230
energy you can collect.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.310
It's given by the sun.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.440
You can't change it.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.220
The solar science technologies
you can improve a little bit.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.030
But developing new technologies,
as you certainly

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.810
know, takes 10 years or more and
a lot of hundred millions.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.200
And when you have this, you
can calculate how much the

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.520
airplane should weigh.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.890
And in our situation,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.070
should be the wingspan
of a 747.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:18.440
The power we have available over
24 hours is, in average,

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.150
the power of a scooter.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.120
And the weight would not exceed
the weight off of car.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.900
So that's the starting point,
and the rest follows.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.910
BERTRAND PICCARD: So
the goal was clear.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.950
And we were thinking in the
beginning that airplane

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:36.180
manufacturers would fight
against each other to be able

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.670
to subcontract our airplane, to
design it and to build it.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.490
And they all said it
was impossible.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:45.700
So we had to find people
who did not know it was

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.660
impossible, put them together.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.280
That was Andre's job.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.070
He brought the technical
team together.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:57.020
And then the subcontract of
building the carbon fiber

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.430
pieces was made in a shipyard.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:04.600
So it's a shipyard who has built
the most crazy airplane

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.620
existing today.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.146
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: But
not any shipyard.

00:15:08.146 --> 00:15:10.600
BERTRAND PICCARD: No, it's the
one who builds the hulls of

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.730
the Alinghi boats for
the America's Cup.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.800
So of course, today everybody
speaks of Oracle.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.240
But Alinghi same shipyard won
the America's Cup twice.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:19.780
Twice, yeah.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:25.240
Do the quality of the
construction.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.180
ALAN EUSTACE: Can you tell us
a bit about some of the

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:30.100
individual pieces of the
technology, what sort of

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.620
innovations you needed?

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.850
Was it just straight
carbon fiber layup?

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.090
Ribs?

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.200
BERTRAND PICCARD: Well, first,
maybe before Andre goes into

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.070
the details--

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.430
there was no benchmark.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:45.930
Absolutely no benchmark.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:46.980
So that was interesting.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.040
Because we could really
create something.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.620
We were not limited
by any knowledge.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.150
Very often we're limited by some
knowledge, and we try to

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.820
extrapolate, to optimize.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.040
Here, everything had to be
created from scratch.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.300
And that was also great
for our engineers.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.700
Because they had the impression
really to invent

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.630
and to create.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.480
It was limitless in
the beginning.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.830
Of course, then it narrowed a
little bit because we had to

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.080
make a design freeze.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.060
ANDRE BORSCHBERG:
So we started by

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.800
building up a simulator.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:22.490
Not a flying simulator, but a
tool which simulates 24 hours

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.440
flight of such an airplane.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.990
So how much you collect,
how much you use, the

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.450
aerodynamics of heat--

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.550
all the flying characteristics.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.120
Then to be able to compare
different solutions in terms

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.700
of size, in terms of layout, in
terms of shape, in terms of

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:39.850
dimensions.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.290
If you look at this airplane,
finally we ended up with

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.460
something which is quite
conventional.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.110
I get very often--

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.380
BERTRAND PICCARD: In
terms of shape.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.800
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: In
terms of shape.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.130
Very often the question, why
didn't you do something

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:58.240
completely crazy with circular
wings or whatever?

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.950
And I think the number of
unknown was so big that we

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:05.420
said, OK, the best way to
achieve our goal is still to

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.640
use what we know.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.730
And the conventional aircraft
is something we know very

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:14.220
well-- to be able to integrate
a completely new structure,

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.500
completely lower wing loading,
and of course, a completely

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.470
new propulsion.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.970
So that was the way we
approached that.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.760
And then we had the weight
which we had to divide--

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.160
the weight budget, which we
had to divide in different

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.250
components.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.650
Some of them are given.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:32.990
Of course we worked
on batteries.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.705
We improved the batteries
with the manufacturers.

00:17:36.705 --> 00:17:38.500
We tried to improve
the solar cells.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.300
But it's a given.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.940
You can't change much over a
period of two, three, four,

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.340
five years.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.940
So the materials, that's where
maybe you have the most

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.580
flexibility, and that's where
we put a lot of efforts.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.550
ALAN EUSTACE: Did you find
yourself, at any point when

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:57.150
doing these simulations, doing
these equations, coming to

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.000
basically a roadblock where you
said, OK, and with this,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.240
the propellers have to weigh
negative 5 pounds a piece.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.380
Did you find yourself at any
of these places where the

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.730
numbers didn't work, and you
had to back up and change?

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.540
BERTRAND PICCARD: Yes, that
brings us back five years ago

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.745
when I saw Andre starting
to make a diet.

00:18:16.745 --> 00:18:18.050
[LAUGHING]

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:19.500
BERTRAND PICCARD:
Stopping to eat.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.840
For two years, in the beginning,
when he was really

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.440
involved in the calculation
of the weight, he

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.680
wasn't eating anything.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.075
And he was getting skinnier
and skinnier.

00:18:28.075 --> 00:18:29.977
ALAN EUSTACE: Yes, the ideal
pilot is sitting up here in

00:18:29.977 --> 00:18:30.345
the front row.

00:18:30.345 --> 00:18:31.800
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: I get my
minimum weight there.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.970
BERTRAND PICCARD: [LAUGHS]

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:35.180
ALAN EUSTACE: Right.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.870
Yeah, I have to say, I was a
little surprised in terms of

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.000
you're trying to minimize
weight, maximize aerodynamic

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.280
efficiency, that you did end
up with what looks like a

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.460
fairly conventional plane form,
as opposed to some of

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:52.750
the early human-powered flights,
which was a canard.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.810
With a conventional aircraft,
your tailplane is actually

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:58.800
creating a down force,
decreasing your efficiency.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.510
BERTRAND PICCARD: But you know,
for us, the main word to

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.110
fight was "drag."

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.640
ALAN EUSTACE: Sure.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.240
BERTRAND PICCARD: And this
airplane has the lowest drag

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.180
that was possible to obtain.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:13.000
So of course, if you put a
doubledecker, you create twice

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.030
as much drag.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:17.270
Of course, you also create
shadow for the solar cells on

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:20.370
the bottom on the lower
wing, so it's useless.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.770
But all of these type of
things-- also inflating a

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:28.250
helium balloon on top of it
to increase the lift.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.830
OK, you have more lift, but you
have so much drag that in

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.620
the end, you get all your
batteries empty before the end

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.560
of the night just to try to
move 8 knots forward.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.260
So it's useless.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.090
So at the end, what the
engineers come out with was

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:46.420
this shape that gives
the best sink rate

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.070
ever of a flying machine.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:52.580
It's less than a foot per
second sink rate.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.800
The best competition gliders
have a little more than 1 and

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.660
1/2 foot per second.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.810
So this is energy saving.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.650
This airplane needs so little
energy to stay airborne.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:06.220
And that's how we can make
it through the night.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.710
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: But just to
answer your point before, what

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.780
we tried to get is almost
zero lift on the tail.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.340
Because of course, if you have
lift, you have drag.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.910
So that's the reasons why I did
for canard solutions or

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:23.050
double deck or whatever, that
you try to have one low wing

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.250
and only one [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:30.000
And that was also the design
criteria there.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.774
ALAN EUSTACE: So what's
it like to fly?

00:20:31.774 --> 00:20:33.040
BERTRAND PICCARD: [LAUGHS]

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.460
You wanted to ask that
question since

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.510
the beginning, huh?

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.960
ALAN EUSTACE: Oh yeah.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.730
BERTRAND PICCARD: But Andre
flew the airplane before I

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:43.500
tried it, so you have
to answer that.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.710
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: I would look
at it in two different ways.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.510
The first one is the
question of energy.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.850
If you can fly, you can take
off almost empty battery in

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:51.590
the morning.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:56.010
You could climb to 20,000 feet,
and you can fill up the

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:57.190
battery slowly.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:02.530
And if you land at sunset, this
is energy you can provide

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.300
to the grid.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.590
So you have the benefit of
flying 12 hours and producing

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:08.450
energy at the same time.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:09.640
So that's a strange feeling.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.090
That's really unusual for me.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:16.540
But in terms of flying, this is
an airplane which has two

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.500
personalities When the air is
extremely calm that you can

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.500
fly with two fingers.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.145
It's extremely smooth.

00:21:25.145 --> 00:21:28.260
It's extremely easy
to handle if you

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.310
understand how it reacts.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:34.570
That's a question maybe
after Bertrand

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.220
certainly talk about that.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:42.160
But when it start to be
turbulence, you need to a lot

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.250
of effect of the flight
controls.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:48.050
And of course, as they are
not assisted, you also

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:49.470
need a lot of effort.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.740
So when it's turbulent,
it's a big fight.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.560
It's a heavy workload airplane
in this situation.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.036
So we really have these
two personalities.

00:21:57.036 --> 00:21:59.590
BERTRAND PICCARD: And to really
explain how you feel as

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.590
a pilot inside, I think the
best example is the

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.110
helicopter.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:09.460
Knowing a helicopter you are
just suspended by one point,

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.750
and it's completely
unstable in three

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.830
axis around that point.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.450
In an airplane, it's
not like this.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.630
In a normal airplane,
you have axis.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.870
And you can be stable around
the bend, stable around the

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.060
pitch, stable around
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.160
And you can combine one
after the other.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.100
In this airplane, you have to
combine all three together,

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.240
even much more than
in a glider.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.860
And sometimes you have the full
deflection of the stick

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.050
on one side and the full
deflection of the rudder on

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.730
the other side in order to keep
the right thread in the

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:42.200
middle and get out
of a turbulence.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.960
So it needs a lot of
dissociation of the pilot.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.020
In that sense, it's
quite strange.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.380
And you better be careful,
because there's a permanent

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.910
telemetry to the
control center.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.150
And each time you don't react
exactly the right way, you

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.990
have the engineer screaming
in your helmet,

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.860
hey, what are of doing?

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:01.660
Hey, watch your speed!

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.970
Watch your bank!

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:04.380
They have everything.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.690
And you say, yes, I reacted
full deflection.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:07.750
And they say, no, no, no!

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:08.380
We saw the computer.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.130
It was only 3/4 of
full deflection.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:14.150
So next time you have to be
more effective, and so on.

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:15.410
And so you can hide nothing.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.270
You can hide no mistake.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:21.160
And sometimes, when I was
starting in the beginning with

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.690
flying this airplane, I tell
you, it was not so fun.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.190
ALAN EUSTACE: Do you get to
monitor the engineer's heart

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.668
rate as well when you say,
hey, watch this?

00:23:28.668 --> 00:23:30.620
[LAUGHING]

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.630
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: That's
a very good idea.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:35.420
I think we should suggest that
for the cockpit instrument

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.080
down to the MCC.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.580
But talking about the beginning,
we started with the

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.720
flight simulator.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:47.590
And of course, we wanted to
compare design solutions, and

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:50.460
of course, we wanted to see
how this airplane flies.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:54.600
And interestingly, flying is
usually not so much a problem.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.275
The difficulty was landing.

00:23:56.275 --> 00:23:59.040
And no one could land
this airplane.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.850
The airplane was either on the
left side in the grass or on

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:04.580
the right side in the grass, but
not over the center line

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.620
or not close to the
center line.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.592
BERTRAND PICCARD: A lot of
sideways or upside down.

00:24:09.592 --> 00:24:11.310
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: And we had
a lot of people also.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:12.790
We had a test pilot.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:16.310
We also had as advisor a former
chief test pilot of

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:19.540
NASA who had the same
problem as well.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.450
He couldn't sleep
anymore, even.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:27.110
But I think we understood that
the airplane had very slow

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:31.820
reaction, and that you had to
anticipate what it was going

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:36.570
to do as soon as you make a
change in the flight controls.

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:38.700
And at the beginning, of
course, we were always

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.430
over-correcting and getting
this airplane oscillation.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.370
It's quite known for
certain aircraft.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.760
And we call it pilot-induced
oscillation.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.440
But it was extreme
in this one.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.570
But slowly we got used to it,
and then the quality of the

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:52.330
landing improved.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.370
And we were ready for
the first flight.

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.480
BERTRAND PICCARD: Now, when we
explain all this, I don't want

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.580
you to have the impression
that we made the most

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.600
difficult airplane to fly, the
most difficult airplane to

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.850
build, the most difficult
airplane to operate.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.550
That was not our goal.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.990
But it's the price we had to
pay in order to have an

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:13.890
airplane that could fly
day and night with

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.050
absolutely no fuel.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:19.390
Maybe in the future we can have
smaller wingspans, we can

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.930
have a heavier wing load,
and things like that.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.710
Then it's going to be easier
to handle, I hope.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.380
But for now, it's the price
we have to pay.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.830
If we want to have a stable
airplane, we have to put the

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.840
gasoline, have a short wingspan,
a heavy wing

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.510
loading, and limited
to two hours.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:41.050
ALAN EUSTACE: Actually, speaking
of endurance, if I

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:45.160
read correctly, some of your
mission profile talks about,

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.960
in an around the world flight,
flying to the pilot's

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.790
physiological endurance limit.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:52.670
I think that was the term.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:57.800
So it's not entirely stable,
requires constant attention,

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.050
no auto pilot--

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:03.660
what are the limits there?

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:04.640
It is staying awake?

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.160
It is bathroom breaks?

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.350
BERTRAND PICCARD: Well, if
you're passionate enough, and

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.910
if like us you wait 10 years
to be able to sit in the

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:15.850
cockpit to spend complete cycle
there, or night, or

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:20.290
maybe three, four days in a row
for the Pacific crossing,

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:21.350
then you cope with it.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:24.960
Because you're so excited to
be finally in the situation

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.510
you're looking for
such a long time.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:30.580
But of course, if you want to
spend three, four days, you

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.640
need an auto pilot.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.510
So the second airplane we're
building for the flight around

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.850
the world has an auto pilot
and has toilets.

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.680
This one has no toilets
and no auto pilot.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.840
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: But it's
an interesting question.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.630
Because it's an airplane
which is

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:43.880
sustainable in terms of energy.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.950
And we have to make now the
pilots sustainable.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.980
So we know how to harness the
energy of this airplane, with

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.920
the batteries, with how much
we collect we use.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.980
And we have to do it the same
of the human dimension.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.370
And that's true in
life as well.

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:02.280
I'm sure you guys, you're
involved in the long-term

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.160
project, difficult project,
you can get exhausted.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.920
So we have to know how much
efforts you can put, how you

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.010
will rest, how you keep all your
functions working well.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:16.040
And that's extremely acute when
you do it five days, five

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.290
nights in an airplane, alone.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:22.060
So it's an extraordinary
learning on the

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.350
human point of view.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:26.550
BERTRAND PICCARD: And Andre's
spent already 72 hours in the

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:30.530
flight simulator last year in
order to train all these, the

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:32.790
sleep cycles, he was monitored
completely with

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:39.160
electroencephalogram, and he
had electrodes everywhere.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.970
I should do it soon,
in December.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:43.870
[LAUGHING]

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.690
BERTRAND PICCARD: And that was
interesting, to see how in the

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:49.550
beginning it can seem hard.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:55.300
And after one or two days, you
get into this new pace of

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.950
flying the plane, of taking
little power naps every couple

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.376
of hours, few minutes.

00:28:01.376 --> 00:28:04.420
And I think you were sustainable
at the end.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.685
You could have carried on
a couple days like this.

00:28:06.685 --> 00:28:09.055
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: Well, we
measured the reaction times,

00:28:09.055 --> 00:28:13.790
we measured through different
gains, to see, in fact, if you

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:15.990
keep the same concentration.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:21.570
And there it was very stable
over the 72 hours.

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.810
I think I could have
continued.

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:25.950
But it's hard to find
your own way.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.530
Because I think we are all
different with sleep.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.470
So my strategy works
maybe well for me.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:33.270
Bertrand will certainly
find another strategy.

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:34.970
You may have to find
another one.

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:37.450
So it's a personal discovery.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:38.890
ALAN EUSTACE: Yeah, you don't
have business class in your

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:39.410
plane, do you?

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:40.400
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: But that's
the difference between the

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.560
first and the second airplane.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.280
As you mentioned, the
first airplane is a

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.700
very bad economy class.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.660
And for the second airplane,
which is under construction

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.590
now, we'd like to have at least
a good business class,

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.360
it not the first class.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.430
ALAN EUSTACE: OK, excellent.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:56.710
So things like pressurization,
for example,

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:57.926
in the second airplane.

00:28:57.926 --> 00:29:00.270
Let's shift over to the
differences between--

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.910
the first airplane
taught you a lot.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:06.220
Second airplane, you're now
working with some proven

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.080
structures, some proven
flight dynamics.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.160
But you have some
new challenges.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.670
Like, for example,
pressurization--

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:14.940
that takes power.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.130
BERTRAND PICCARD: We
don't pressurized.

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:17.115
ALAN EUSTACE: You don't
pressurize?

00:29:17.115 --> 00:29:18.250
Not numbered.

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:20.640
BERTRAND PICCARD: No, we have
the flight profile where the

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:25.000
airplane climbs during the
entire day, and then reaches

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.570
the maximum altitude just
before the sun is not

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:31.150
efficient anymore.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.210
And then we start to descend.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.730
With all this altitude that
is potential energy

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:38.540
that has been stored.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.090
So the first four to five hours
of the night are for

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.890
free in terms of energy.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:46.690
And then we continue with the
batteries with until next

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.320
sunrise rise, and then
we start again.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.280
Which means that the
pressurization would just be

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.450
useful for, probably, four
hours, which we can cope very

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:57.040
well without pressurized
cockpit.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:05.120
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: The real
reason is also technical.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.750
We could pressurize.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:11.255
But if you pressurize, as you
want to exit the airplane in

00:30:11.255 --> 00:30:13.640
flight, which is always a
possibility in an experimental

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.840
airplane, it's very difficult
to achieve.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.842
We have an exit door that
you can open quickly.

00:30:21.842 --> 00:30:24.630
And that allows you to go out
with a parachute and with all

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.710
your equipment you need--
a life raft and so on.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:33.420
So this was too big
a requirement.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.810
If we would have built a normal
airplane, I think we

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:39.390
had have had the weight budget
for pressurized cabin, but

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:44.602
with very, very small entry
doors or doors to get out in.

00:30:44.602 --> 00:30:44.980
ALAN EUSTACE: OK.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.520
So what altitudes are we
talking about here?

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.050
Tell us about a typical mission
profile, let's say,

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:55.420
for the United States flight,
and then for the world flight.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.790
Take off at some time, climb to
which altitudes, et cetera.

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:03.840
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: Every day we
climb to close to 30,000 feet.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.150
ALAN EUSTACE: And you're doing
that just on oxygen?

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:07.720
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: Which is
with oxygen, exactly.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.370
It's also the altitude at which
you can cope with oxygen

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:12.960
quite well if you're
not pressurized.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.620
If you're above this altitude,
at a certain stage you need

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.940
pressurized oxygen, which is
slightly more difficult.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.440
Of course, if you have a small
difficulty with the oxygen

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:28.000
system, the time that you have
available to use a safety

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.340
system or another system or
backup solutions is more and

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.500
more smaller.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.620
I think it's 30,000 feet,
you talk about

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.560
something like half a minute.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.670
Which is already short to
understand that you have a

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:44.190
difficulty and that you have to
switch to something else.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:48.090
So that's some kind of a safety
that we have defined

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.020
for ourselves.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.000
And every night we will go
down to a lower level.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.115
This depends on meteorology.

00:31:53.115 --> 00:31:55.390
It depends on the time
of the year.

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:57.890
Are the batteries full?

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:01.500
The goal is to be around
10,000 feet at night.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.100
It can be lower, depending
on the situation.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.190
ALAN EUSTACE: So you have
20,000 feet of potential

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:11.320
energy, coast down to 10,000--

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.170
air is nice and thick there--

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:18.430
hit the go buttons, accelerate
to a blinding--

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:19.480
30 knots, was it?

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.630
AUDIENCE: 35

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.510
ALAN EUSTACE: A blinding 35
knots, blown back in the seats

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:27.380
by the g-forces, power along
there at that altitude until

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:31.150
the sun is up a few degrees,
high enough to start fueling

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:32.290
the batteries and climbing.

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:33.190
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: Exactly,
and you start to gain.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.000
But you keep the same speed,
which you developed your own

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.920
speed, which is 25 knots.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.735
You keep this speed because you
want to make sure that you

00:32:39.735 --> 00:32:41.740
have the maximum energy
available.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.820
ALAN EUSTACE: Sure.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.840
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: I think every
morning you have some

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.520
kind of degree of suspense.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.450
ALAN EUSTACE: [LAUGHS]

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:56.070
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: Is the battery
going to have enough

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:58.020
energy to bring you
to the sunrise?

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.560
And the sunrise is not
when you see the sun.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.210
The sunrise is about 1 and 1/2
hours later, when it's high

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:07.980
enough to produce and to provide
enough energy to the

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.610
solar cells.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:11.650
ALAN EUSTACE: You can't
just like roll 90

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:12.900
degrees to the side.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.630
BERTRAND PICCARD: One technology
you would be

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:20.990
interested in is the way to
make our oxygen system

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.360
sustainable.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:29.510
We're working now on a little
turbine turning 500,000 RPM.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:33.190
And we developed 100
to 120 watts.

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:35.600
So very small energy needs.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.670
And this pressurization against
the membrane allows to

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:42.560
extract the oxygen
out of the air.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.150
So we don't need to take off
with lots of oxygen in tanks,

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:47.530
which are very heavy.

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:49.910
We just produce our
own oxygen--

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:51.470
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: With
the solar cells.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:52.980
BERTRAND PICCARD: --during
the fight.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:53.940
ALAN EUSTACE: This is something
that you've

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:54.920
developed for the--

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.390
BERTRAND PICCARD: For
the second airplane.

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:58.400
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: Yeah,
with partners.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.590
Something which was required.

00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.880
ALAN EUSTACE: Excellent.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.150
I want one.

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:03.910
BERTRAND PICCARD: So we can
produce our oxygen.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:06.650
We can recycle water.

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:10.639
There will just be the foot that
will not be completely

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.190
sustainable.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:13.389
So we have learn--

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:14.670
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: How to
grow our own salads.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:15.067
ALAN EUSTACE: Yes.

00:34:15.067 --> 00:34:16.260
[LAUGHS]

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.790
I know someone you can
talk to about that.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:21.005
But we'll take that offline.

00:34:21.005 --> 00:34:25.010
So on the mission, again-- the
US mission is sort of scaling

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:26.449
up towards the world mission.

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:29.770
You've got a fairly massive
ground control, mission

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:32.739
control, looking at weather,
telemetry, all things.

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:35.739
Can you tell us a bit what
you're looking at?

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:38.770
What your contingencies are?

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:42.900
Your jet stream shifts, some new
country decides that it's

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.150
not friendly with
you anymore--

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.230
what sort of factors are
you working with?

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:54.760
BERTRAND PICCARD: For flight
permissions, it's quite easy

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.780
to be Swiss and to have a
Swiss-registered airplane.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:58.170
ALAN EUSTACE: [LAUGHS]

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:01.690
BERTRAND PICCARD: This I tell
you, neutral country, normally

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:04.020
we have permissions
from everyone.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.410
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: Meteorology,
of course, is a very important

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:07.180
part of it.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:11.640
And we are training since six
years now, every year.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:18.920
So we fly around the world every
spring or summer, using

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.590
the meteorology of the year,
using simulation tools.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:25.240
In fact, for the mission control
center, they have a

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.290
blip on the screen.

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:29.560
If the blip comes from the
airplane over the Pacific or

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.700
it comes from a computer,
doesn't make a difference.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.950
So we have a simulating tool
which is precise enough to

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:40.010
make sure that we can integrate
the current

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:43.020
meteorology and have this
airplane fly, for example,

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:43.670
over the Pacific.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:45.180
That's what we are doing now.

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.930
It's the right time to
cross from China

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:48.220
to the United States.

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.780
So we are using the real
meteorology to see

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.390
if we can make it.

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.710
If we can predict the
methodology well, then you can

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:56.650
compare it with satellite
pictures and all the

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:58.730
information which
are available.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:02.290
So these people make the routine
of the airplane.

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:07.540
These people will choose the
time of departure and the way

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.340
to proceed, and eventually an
alternate if the alternate is

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.890
possible and it is existing,
which, of course, not the case

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:15.125
over the oceans.

00:36:15.125 --> 00:36:17.410
ALAN EUSTACE: We talked
about this before.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:19.940
You've often described Solar
Impulse as a flying

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:20.230
laboratory.

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:24.070
You're pushing the limits
on all of these things--

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:26.440
so on materials, on meteorology,
on flight,

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.690
planning on aerodynamics.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.950
Are you actively talking to
people about spinoffs,

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:34.350
commercial applications?

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:36.420
Your little oxygen thing
sounds like it might be

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.030
popular among us unpressurized
aircraft people.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:42.390
BERTRAND PICCARD: There
are a lot of spinoffs.

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:45.350
But what we have to understand
is that on one side, it's

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:48.370
clear that every partner working
with us in his field

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:50.020
is making spinoffs.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:53.870
We have the best electrical
engine of today, the thinner

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:57.020
solar cells of today, the best
batteries of today, the best

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.050
insulation of today.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:01.520
Of course, all these partners
providing this, testing it

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.060
with us are putting
it on the market.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:09.200
For example, the polyurethane,
a very high density and light

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:12.530
weight that we have to put in
the batteries is now going to

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:17.510
be on the market, probably, for
75% of the refrigerator

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:22.560
constructors in order to save
energy in refrigerators.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.640
So this brings really to one of
the goals of the project.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.540
We were saying in the beginning
how important it was

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:34.560
to motivate people, to think of
the box, to be pioneers, to

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.210
be innovators, but it's
also very practical.

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:39.250
It's not only philosophical.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:42.470
With the technologies we have
on board with Solar Impulse,

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:45.390
we can clearly say that if
they were used massively

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.960
everywhere in the world, we
could, today already, without

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.540
additional innovation, divide by
two the fuel consumption of

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.290
the world, and provide
half of the rest

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:57.030
with renewable sources.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:02.860
So we could shift from 100%, or
almost 100%, oil world to a

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:05.320
25% oil world.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.630
And the technologies exist.

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:07.640
We use them.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.050
And what we hope is that maximum
number of people are

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:13.820
really going to implement this
on the market, and that it

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.860
doesn't stay just in startups,
in laboratories of

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:21.030
universities, or corporations
who develop it, but they don't

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.475
find a market for it.

00:38:22.475 --> 00:38:22.890
ALAN EUSTACE: Excellent.

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:25.994
So dot org energy team,
you're taking notes?

00:38:25.994 --> 00:38:26.800
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.050
ALAN EUSTACE: Thank
you, Yulia.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.980
BERTRAND PICCARD: Just one
more word for you.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.810
You know what is lacking in this
world now is really the

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:45.290
political will to go into
that direction.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:48.970
It is still fashionable to have
cars that have too much

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:54.720
gasoline per mile, houses
that are not insulated.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.270
All this is common.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:59.500
And here is the way that we
really have to push the

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:04.010
politicians into in terms of the
encouragement, incentives,

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:05.380
or maybe regulation.

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.160
Because the solutions exist.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:11.090
And we just need to push maybe
a little bit people to make

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:12.540
the first step and use that.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.440
So we work also a lot
with the political

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.350
world with Solar Impulse.

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:20.010
It gives us the possibility to
meet a lot of politicians,

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:22.430
heads of states,
parliamentarians.

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:26.100
And they seem to be quite
motivated after

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:26.895
they see the plane.

00:39:26.895 --> 00:39:29.880
It gives them arguments
to then speak to other

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.870
politicians who makes
the regulation.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:36.170
ALAN EUSTACE: Mark has some
questions from the Dory.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:37.970
AUDIENCE: First of
all, [FRENCH].

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:40.900
Thank you for having spent
the time with us here.

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.360
So actually, I'll start with
my own question first.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.250
[LAUGHS]

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:46.850
Since you're going to have to be
flying a long time, do you

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:51.210
have a special allowance to use
drugs to keep you awake

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:52.620
that you're not supposed
to take as a pilot?

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:55.940
Or how are you planning to stay
awake besides just sheer

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.510
excitement?

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.490
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: So we tried,
as I tried to explain at the

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:01.780
beginning, to make these
pilots sustainable.

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:05.920
And sustainability is really
a lot of perspective.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.410
So there's different methods.

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:11.890
I do a lot of yoga and
meditation, so I use that in

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:12.690
the airplane.

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:16.530
That's what I also used
when I did my 72-hour

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:18.390
flight in the simulator.

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:22.000
Bertrand is using other
techniques for that that he'll

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.700
certainly use when he does
his training in the

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.070
simulator this fall.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:30.720
So that's how we think we try
to cope with these questions

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.720
and not using substance.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.320
AUDIENCE: Someone's asking, "The
weather is a major factor

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.430
in planning in around
the world flights.

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:40.200
Please talk about how you're
planning on doing it." And I

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.740
guess a follow up question that
goes together for me is,

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.730
if your plane does 25 knots,
with a good wet headwind,

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:47.560
you'll actually be going
backwards, unless you're

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.440
flying with a jet stream going
eastbound and taking it.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.460
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: We have the
man who has the record flying

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:55.880
backwards next to me--

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.360
the world record!

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.200
BERTRAND PICCARD: Well, it's
true, when I came back from

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:05.240
Morocco to Spain, I was not
allowed to arrive in Madrid

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.630
before midnight because of

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:10.250
international commercial airline.

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:13.240
So if I was going with the
winds, I would have

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.840
come far too early.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:15.980
And then waiting there, I would

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.350
have drifted to Barcelona.

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:22.580
So the team sent me on another
path to Portugal, on low

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.540
level, and asked me to climb.

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:28.670
And then I was headwind with a
wind that was faster than me.

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:31.040
And I drifted back to Madrid.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.160
I was facing a beautiful sunset
to the west, and I was

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.260
drifting through the east.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.970
So it was a perfect way to do.

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:39.060
But it's quite strange.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.970
In the beginning, you just have
to understand that to

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:45.660
follow your line on the GPS,
you have to turn left to go

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:47.960
right and to turn right
to go left.

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.350
And once you understand
that, it's fine then.

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:51.355
[LAUGHING]

00:41:51.355 --> 00:41:53.720
BERTRAND PICCARD: But you just
have also to cope with the

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:57.610
anxiety of the guys in
the control center.

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:59.720
AUDIENCE: Is it fair to say that
basically, even though

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.610
you're not flying a balloon, you
have 25 knots of airspeed,

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:05.000
or really, when you're
at 25,000 feet, it's

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.020
not airspeed at all.

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.850
So are you just following the
jet stream and any kind of

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:10.520
weather pattern that will
push you to where

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.050
you're trying to get.

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:14.320
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: We
try to avoid them

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.650
because they may be turbulent.

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:19.070
And we try to get the good
meteorology, which is a

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:20.230
certain meteorology.

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:22.570
So that's not necessarily where
the jet streams are.

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:25.050
So maybe we have them,
maybe not, but it's

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:26.840
not the goal by itself.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.430
And if you look at the
Pacific, normally the

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:33.710
situation is such that the wind
at the upper level of

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:35.370
west to east--

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:36.300
favorable.

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:40.270
But you have the trade winds,
which are at low altitudes, at

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:43.200
about flight level 100, which
are on the other side.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:48.580
So what we may do and may
experience is to fly forward

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:50.710
during the day when we climb
and backwards and

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:51.930
be during the night.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:55.980
And hopefully, the daily flight
is going to be a bit

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:57.260
longer than the night flight.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:57.660
[LAUGHING]

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.690
BERTRAND PICCARD: And the result
is that maybe when I

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:04.350
flew around the world in my
balloon, it took less time

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:06.830
than what we're going to
do with our plane.

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:08.740
Because with a balloon, you
put yourself in the jet

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.660
stream, the c the jet stream.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.540
You stay up day and night.

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:17.440
And the average speed
around the world was

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.710
60 miles per hour.

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.910
AUDIENCE: [WHISTLES]

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:22.400
OK.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.370
BERTRAND PICCARD: The fastest
parts over the Atlantic was

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.780
234 kilometers per hour.

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:29.200
AUDIENCE: [WHISTLES]

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.990
BERTRAND PICCARD: That's
131 knots.

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:34.250
It's 160 miles per hour--

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.270
165 miles per hour.

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:37.910
Fortunately no speed limit.

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:39.550
[LAUGHING]

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:42.273
AUDIENCE: So the next question
that's also related is, "How

00:43:42.273 --> 00:43:44.570
long do you expect the flight
around the world to take?"

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:46.740
Which is also related to,
do you have a route?

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.740
Do you know what you're
expecting to be doing?

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:53.630
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: So close to
the balloon flight in the end.

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:55.830
So about 20 flying days.

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:58.730
It can be more, it can be less--
it depends on the wind.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:02.450
But this will be spread over
a certain period of time.

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:06.520
Because we'll be landing in
the larger countries.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.800
And everywhere where we land
there is a strong interest.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.360
Right now, when we do our
stops through the United

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:15.450
States, there is an interest for
us to stay, to present, to

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:18.930
talk, to meet, to have
educational events.

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:24.680
So the total flight may take
about two to three months.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:29.820
AUDIENCE: How much energy does
the plane use in flight?

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.290
What would be the equivalent
chemical energy

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:34.160
in gallons per hour?

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:37.700
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: We are not
so used with using fuel, so

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.140
it's in translation, which
is difficult to make.

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:44.360
But if you talk about kilowatts
or horsepower, but I

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:50.870
mean what our kilowatts are, the
power we use for the night

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:54.140
flight, it's about
8 kilowatts.

00:44:54.140 --> 00:45:00.230
so if you multiply this by 24,
you get, more or less, the

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:04.770
energy, plus, I guess, what you
lose in climbing and in

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:06.670
going down.

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:11.700
You get something like 240
kilowatt hours, which is the

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:15.510
total energy we collect and we
use over 24 hours with the

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:16.966
first airplane.

00:45:16.966 --> 00:45:19.470
BERTRAND PICCARD: When the
batteries are full, we have 85

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:21.210
kilowatt hours at
our disposal.

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:27.530
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: So this 240,
that's about a third for

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:31.400
battery, a third for flying,
and a third for climbing.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.950
BERTRAND PICCARD: But it's clear
that the challenge to

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:34.890
have batteries rather
than kerosene.

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:36.390
Is very high.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:40.240
Because one pound of kerosene
gives you the same energy than

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:43.770
35 pounds of batteries.

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:48.760
So it's absolutely clear that
kerosene is the most efficient

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.560
way to fly--

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.360
on the short term.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:53.950
ANDRE BORSCHBERG:
It's efficient.

00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:58.230
But the transformation of this
type of energy into propulsion

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:01.100
energy, of course,
is much worse.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:04.503
So this ratio of 1 to 35
translates to something like 1

00:46:04.503 --> 00:46:08.310
to 10 if you see how efficient
electric motors are and how

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:12.270
inefficient thermal engine is.

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.660
ALAN EUSTACE: Before we break
for the buses, any last words

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.300
you'd like to share?

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:19.660
Messages of inspiration?

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:21.820
BERTRAND PICCARD: Well, we've
talked a lot about Solar

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:25.460
Impulse, because maybe Solar
Impulse is new for you.

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:27.580
But for us, coming
from Switzerland,

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:29.610
it's great to be here.

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:31.420
It's great to visit you.

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:35.400
It was great to have the visit
of Larry Page last Saturday

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.830
and to be in the
Silicon Valley.

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:41.020
Because when we speak
of innovation,

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:42.650
for you it's obvious.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:45.260
We even see the trees
climb higher here

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.240
than anywhere else.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.820
So of course everything
grows here.

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:48.950
All the ideas grow.

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:51.870
And it's absolutely
fascinating.

00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:55.760
And we're really happy to be
here and to share our passion

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.880
of this airplane and this
philosophy of flight and

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.280
energy with as many people
as possible.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.120
So it was great to
meet you all.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.325
And it's going to be really fun
for us to present you the

00:47:06.325 --> 00:47:08.250
plane in the next 30 minutes.

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.160
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: And we hope we
can learn also a lot about

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.030
what you guys are doing.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:12.630
Because I think it's
fascinating.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:16.130
It's, for us, also extremely
useful for own goals.

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:21.570
So if we could know more about
what you do and how we can use

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:23.470
that, that would be
great as well.

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:24.010
Thank you for very much.

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:26.500
BERTRAND PICCARD: Yes, because
we had some discussions with

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:31.000
several of your different
departments on how to maximize

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.030
communication between Google,
between Solar Impulse.

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:35.620
I don't know if you heard
a little bit about it.

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:39.160
But there different ideas
going around through the

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:43.210
Google hang around, the
Google [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:45.370
on your website.

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:47.920
We'll see what comes out of it,
but I'm sure something is

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.820
growing fast.

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:52.040
And I hope it's going to be
ready already for the

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:52.840
[INAUDIBLE].

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.540
ALAN EUSTACE: Andre,
Bertrand, [FRENCH].

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:55.520
Thank you so much for
being with us.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.080
BERTRAND PICCARD: It
was a pleasure.

00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:00.040
ALAN EUSTACE: And we'll work
gather over at the roundabout

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:00.990
for the bus tour.

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:01.590
Thanks again.

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:08.492
