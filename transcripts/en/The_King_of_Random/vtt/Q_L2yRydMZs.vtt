00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.190
In a previous project we used sugar, stump
remover, and a little bit of kitty litter,

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.690
to make “E45 equivalent” rocket motors.
In this project we’re adding time delays,

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.190
ejection charges, and sending a duct tape
rocket, over 1,000 feet high.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.300
I just made 10 rocket motors for under $5.00,
and they only took about 10 minutes each.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.650
Now to see if they’ll even work at all,
let’s strap one to a couple of bricks for

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.800
static testing, and light it up. When the
propellent catches, you can see it’s actually

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.409
got an impressive amount of thrust.  Now of course this

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:38.629
begs the obvious question. What would happen
if we put one, in the paper rocket from a

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.079
previous project. So I just made a glorified
version of the same thing, using cardboard

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.609
and duct tape. You can see the cardboard fins
are just hot glued to the body, and I reinforced

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.179
the upper part of the tube with 3/4” PVC
pipe to keep it rigid. The hole at the back

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.019
has just enough room to accept a single sugar
motor, and you can see a little metal wire

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.370
holds it down in place. Ok, our rocket is
loaded and ready to fly, but we still need

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.690
a way to launch it. I used the lid of a cooking
pot, and a sawed-off marshmallow roasting

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.940
stick to make a simple blast pad. And the
rocket’s just held on with pieces cut, from

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.410
the body tube of a pen. Alright, let’s light
it off and see how it does. Now that’s not

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.900
too shabby for a rocket made from sugar and
cardboard. From the time of apogee, it took

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.560
a little over 8 seconds to hit the ground,
which means this thing shot up over 1,000

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.530
feet high. How cool is that? The problem,
of course, is that there’s no parachute

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.700
on this thing, which means it’s going to
“lawn dart”, straight into the ground,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.080
every time. That’s exactly why I’m out
in the boonies, miles away from any people,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.660
or property. Now it’s important to mention
here that potassium nitrate is hygroscopic,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.320
meaning when the propellent is exposed to
air, it’ll slowly absorb moisture until

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.790
the fuel loses potency. This mix is about
a month old, and won’t even light off anymore,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.300
and you can see this rocket, doesn’t produce
any thrust whatsoever. To reverse the hydration,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.770
you could put it in the oven at 300F for 30
minutes. If you’re willing to risk the possibility,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.310
of an insurance claim. Ok, to make a parachute
ejection charge, we’re going to need to

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.450
add a time delay function, and a little black
powder. I just made this one out of acrylic

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.340
so you can see exactly what’ll be happening
inside the motor during the launch. You can

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.750
see that when the white mix ignites, it burns
incredibly fast, then stops suddenly at the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.940
black mark, where the delay mix begins. This
amount of powder should give about a 5 second

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.490
delay, then ignite the ejection charge. .. Which
you’ll see how to make in just a minute.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.370
Now the recipe for delay mix is so incredibly
simple. All we need to do is separate 20 grams

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.660
of the white mix, made in our “Sugar Rocket”
project, and add 15% baking soda by weight.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.330
Which in this case brings the mix up to 23
grams total. Put the modified mix in a container

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.270
and shake it around for about a minute, to
blend it together as much as possible. And

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.600
that’s it. Just by adding a little baking
soda, we’ve modified the rocket propellent,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.819
into a fairly reliable time delay mix that’ll
burn 1 second for every 1/16th of an inch.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.150
I typically use a 5 second delay on my motors,
and ended up making a new ram rod to fit that

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.700
profile. It should be obvious that the delay
mix goes in after the white mix, but before

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.290
the kitty litter end cap. The last step is the
ejection charge, and for that we need a little

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.410
black powder, and a small drill bit. The bit
I’m using is a 3/32” bit, and using the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.340
modified template we can gauge how deep, we’ll
need to drill through the clay plug, to expose

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.260
the delay mix underneath. This will need to
be drilled out by hand the same way we did

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.770
the nozzle in the “Sugar Rocket” video,
and it’s important to watch carefully for

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.540
a trace of white powder, on the tip of the
bit. This is our confirmation that we’re

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.000
all the way through the clay, so to finish
up, let’s drop a bit of black powder down

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.890
the hole, cover the clay plug a few grains
deep, then compact it with a few taps from

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.599
the wooden rod. This compacted ejection charge
should hold firmly in place, and the modified

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.770
rocket motor is finished. Now, using another
acrylic motor, you can see that the instant

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.360
the burn hits the delay mix, it stops suddenly,
and burns dramatically slower for about 5

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.290
seconds. When it reaches the black powder,
though, the charge ignites, with enough power

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.550
to push out a parachute. The delay can be
adjusted for any length of time we need, and

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.730
the rule of thumb, is a 1/16th of an inch,
per second. Well now you know how to modify

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.170
your sugar motors to have time delays and
parachute ejection charges, rather than taking

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.670
the riskier approach of launching duct tape
rockets, and just hoping they don’t hit

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.670
anything important. Well that’s it for now. If
you liked this project, perhaps you’ll like

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.950
some of my others. Check them out at www.thekingofrandom.com

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.860
Hey, if you’re across the pond, or in another
country, I realize you may not have access

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.299
to some of these materials, so I’ve got
another rocket building project coming up

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.460
that I guarantee you’ll be able to do. So
keep at eye out for that video coming very

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.480
soon, and in the mean-time if you still want
to build rocket motors like these, I strongly

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.210
recommend you join a rocket club first, so
you don’t get yourself into trouble. There

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.530
are a lot of regulations and safety precautions
that you need to be aware of. One thing I

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.430
didn’t tell you is that these motors can
be modified to work with Estes model rockets

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.960
as well, but I’m thinking about doing a
video on building a rocket with a parachute

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.810
from scratch, so if you’re interested in
seeing that, let me know in the comments and

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.260
I may put together something for next spring.
And one final thought. If you have to ask

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.699
where to get black powder, this definitely
isn’t a project you should be playing with

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:01.040
yet, but let me just say this. It’s actually
easier to find than potassium nitrate. Thanks

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.680
for watching to the end. I hope you enjoyed
what you saw, and I hope to see you around

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.770
for the next project video. Bye.
