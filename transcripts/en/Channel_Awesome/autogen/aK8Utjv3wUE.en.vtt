00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.700
 Now that I am getting closer to the end of watching these Disney follow-up films, I can honestly say that 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.980
 the most amusing of all is "Cinderella 3". 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.900
 Yes. You are kidding me? The third "Cinderella" movie? That is ridiculous! 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.000
 Look at this opening! It doesn't even look like it's going to be something! 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.540
 It looks like a sequel that is even worse than the previous one! 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.820
 But, when I told others that I was going to watch all these Disney follow-up films, I heard again and again 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.260
 that "Cinderella 3" is good. "Wait until you get to" Cinderella 3 ". That's a good one." 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.640
 And, for the most part, they are pretty much right. 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.460
 Are there any problems? Yes, I think that can be expected from every Disney follow-up film. 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.520
 Is it my favorite? No, but, again, it's - How should I say it? - simply the most enjoyable. 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.720
 Like I said before, it starts a bit floury and cheap with a silly song. Not very impressive. 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.440
 But, suddenly, the bad guys return: the stepmother and the stepisters. 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.240
 They find the magic wand of the magic fairy, turn it into stone, 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.980
 and travel back in time to ensure that the step sister is the one with whom the shoe fits. 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.580
 Thus, everything has changed: Cinderella is left behind and she has lost her 'end well, all right'. 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.380
 The bad guys are taken to the palace, 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.340
 they hypnotize the prince making him think that the sister is the one he has fallen in love with, 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.020
 and now Cinderella must penetrate the palace and convince him of what is really going on 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.760
 without being caught by the guards or the bad stepmother. 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.300
 On the one hand, this sounds incredibly forced and foolish, and ... yes, I think that's a bit too, 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.480
 but, for such a forced and foolish idea, they do everything they can do with it. 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.540
 They have realized that the bad guys are the most interesting characters, and a lot of time is spent on them. 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.240
 Look at the drawings of them. Look at these close-ups. 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.540
 They are just so slinky, and they love being on the screen every second, and we do! 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.380
 I remember that there is a scene where Cinderella sneaks in like a servant, and covers her face, 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.700
 and the stepmother looks at the reflection in the water in a certain way, and she can see her face, 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.860
 and I really had something like, "Oh, no" Which is amazing! 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.500
 I sincerely said "oh, no" during an "Cinderella" movie, let alone during a follow-up movie. That's insane! 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.960
 But, moreover, they actually have a lot of characters who had little development 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.600
 given much more development in previous films. 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.940
 The king, for example, is much more than just a man bouncing up and down 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.640
 while shouting "Ah! give me grandchildren!" 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.640
 They made him a very sensitive man who lost his wife years ago, 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.000
 and therefore gives a jewel to his future daughter-in-law, and it is actually very sweet. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.180
 One of the step sisters is also much more developed. And what makes this so incredibly smart 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.640
 is the fact that this connects to the second film, "Cinderella 2". 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.040
 Yes!! That stupid sequel that nobody cares about. They really have a few things that tie in with that. 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.100
 Not only have they given her character more depth and a storyline, but there are even characters 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.120
 from the second film that are also introduced in this film. 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.020
 Do you remember the woman who was at the head of the servants? 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.680
 Of course you don't know that anymore! Because nobody remembers the second film! 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.000
 But she's in here. What an incredible attention to details! 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.020
 Even the prince, who perhaps had one line of text in the first film and, I don't know, 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.500
 maybe two in the second - he was clearly nothing more than a feast for the eyes - 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.900
 has much more personality in this film. 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.460
 Well. Not very much anymore, but there is, no doubt, a personality. 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.420
 He is gentle, sympathetic and charming, but you get to know him a little better. 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.320
 Enough to make sure you want to see him with the right person. 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.540
 The animation is fantastic 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.260
 and what's great about it is that it doesn't necessarily try to recreate the same animation as in the first movie. 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.920
 "Bambi 2" fell a bit into that trap, and while it wasn't bad at all or something like that, 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.020
 you are constantly reminded that it is not entirely unique. 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.800
 This, although it is a follow-up film, feels like something unique. 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.240
 The world of imagination becomes a lot more threatening and creative. 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.480
 There is a scene where stepmother Cinderella imprisons in a giant pumpkin, and it's all dirty and nasty inside, 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.420
 and these strands seize the horse and wrap itself around him 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.140
 and then she turns the cat into an evil coachman who laughs madly as he starts to swing the pumpkin off a cliff, 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.220
 and it's just crazy! It is something you want to see in a sequel to a fairy tale. 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.140
 It gets a bit darker, it gets a little bit disturbed and it gets a lot more fun. 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.980
 It is as if it is half Cinderella and half Tim Burton. It's just wonderful to watch. 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.520
 So. Okay, this movie sounds great. Is it that too? 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.640
 Well ... There are a few minor issues that prevent it from becoming a complete whole, 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.900
 and I don't think it's just mosquito sifting. 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.320
 The largest is Cinderella itself. 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.760
 Which does not mean that the character is poorly executed, I mean that they have animated her very well, 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.960
 and the pace is right, and there is even a scene when she finds out that everything has changed, 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.800
 in which you don't even see her reaction. 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.980
 You only see that she puts her hand on the door, and that's basically all you need. 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.560
 Small moments like this are really, really good. 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.740
 But the problem is in the story. It's a bit like in "The Little Mermaid": She doesn't learn anything. 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.080
 It is not undergoing development. She just wants to achieve something, and she achieves it. 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.360
 I think it's just a distracting contrast 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.540
 when you see what all the other characters are experiencing and all the changes they are facing. 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.120
 In addition, the moral is sometimes a bit weird, such as the continuous idea 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.120
 that when you touch someone's hand you immediately know if you are in love, and ... yes, I know 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.900
 Dinsey. Fairytales. They teach you even stranger lessons than this when you really think about it, but ... 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.020
 I do not know. This seems particularly strange. 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.020
 For a film that tries very hard to solve the dated problems of the first film, 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.180
 it seems that this is something that is clearly very distracting where they might be 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.900
 should have thought again. 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.580
 In addition, this film has three climaxes. 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.580
 Yes, there is one in which the prince rescues her, then there is one in which she rescues herself, 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.800
 and then there is one in which she saves him, and it just goes everywhere. 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.300
 But they are all very nice. 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.020
 There are all green things flying in all directions, and a choir goes from 'ohohoh'. 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.400
 It is something that you can clearly see that the animators, and the writers, and the directors have enjoyed working, 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.940
 and we can feel their pleasure. 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.260
 The hard work and effort is clearly present in a project that there should not have been anything. 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.420
 They have given 110% to something that was simply meant to be put on the market quickly, 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.760
 but they really did their best, and you can see they really did their best. 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.700
 But, yes, those problems that I mentioned earlier are still valid problems. 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.180
 They focus a bit too much on the secondary characters, and yes, I know, from the first film 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.480
 you could say that too, but the center was still her need, her wish, 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.940
 that she had to endure everything in order to get what she needed, worked hard and eventually received her reward. 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.860
 Here I think it's a bit of the same thing, work hard and get a reward, 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.300
 but we have already seen that, so why is that still interesting? 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.520
 But, in my opinion, the rest is so amusing and so insane, and so enjoyable 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.940
 that I see it a bit, and I think a lot of other people do that too. 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.560
 The only thing I can say about it is that what everyone says about it is strange enough. 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.900
 It is very entertaining, and I heartily recommend it. 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:09.520
 I can't say it's perfect. I can't say it's a Disney classic or something like that, but it's just a huge amount of surreal joy. 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.960
 I love how they took something that was pretty useless and even a bit of a stupid idea 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.320
 and have turned it into something that was just cool, 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.240
 and focused on the elements that were most enjoyable from the first film. 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.960
 If you want a Disney follow-up movie that shouldn't have existed, but is still very, very well cared for, 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.500
 then "Cinderella 3" is, bizarre enough, the film to watch.
