Guys, we know the fidget spinner fad has somewhat faded but, we still have some and so there's some things

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.380
we want to try with them. Mainly, we want to take fidget spinners and put them up against a block of ice.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.200
I don't mean leaning up against the block of ice, I don't even mean throwing them like ninja stars at a block of ice, although it does sound kind of fun

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.620
What we're gonna do is take a bunch of fidget spinners, melt them down,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.000
and then pour the molten metal down into the block of ice.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.660
I'm hoping that by using nothing but melted fidget spinners,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.320
we can replicate our aluminum explosion and destroy this block of clear ice.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.960
Goodbye fidget spinners!

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.800
Well, That looks like a good amount of those

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.120
While our fidget spinners are melting in our foundry, let's prepare our ice to receive the molten metal.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.600
There we go, that's nice and clear

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.460
Just give our holding container a couple of minutes over the fire so it's not cooling off our crucible too quickly.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.620
Okay,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.260
Three, Two, One

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.720
HAHAHA, hahahahaha,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.560
YEAH!

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.460
There's just a blob of super heated aluminum

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.199
inside our block of destroyed ice!

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.260
That looks amazing!

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.200
Let's look at what's left at the bottom of this cup, fidget spinners are mostly made of aluminum

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.139
But the bearings inside them are not and I removed the bearings from some, I didn't

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.509
want to come out of all of them so I think what

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.270
We have down here is a bunch of slag made of a little bit of molten aluminum, and a lot of hot steel bearings.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.550
Each one of these little circles here is a bearing from a fidget spinner, at least seven maybe

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.809
A few more, still just stuck down in the remaining aluminum I don't think they're gonna spin very well anymore let's go look at

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.060
That ice more that was amazing, okay?

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.170
so right here there's still this is the mark from the drill bit when i drilled the hole down into the block of ice

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.190
So when the aluminum went in there and exploded it like exploded

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.450
Sideways and sheared everything off but you can, still

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.559
See the little point, where the drill bit made its mark so it didn't explode down

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.149
Like at all it just exploded sideways and all of our aluminum

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.049
melted its way down, through the block of ice well not the block of ice anymore the remaining shards of ice

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.890
melted through our cord

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:03.809
here is the remains of the fidget spinners that so valiantly gave their lives to destroy this block of ice

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.220
i'm not sure which one is worse off the block of ice or the fidgets spinners they're, both pretty much gone

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.540
and Unrecognizable.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.540
Guys we've got a bunch of these king of random branded fidgets spinners in six different varieties rather than melting them all down

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.880
We are giving, them, away all you have to do is pay for shipping

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.809
Guys, the fun's not over there's still more for you to see that little

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.459
Box up at the top will transport you directly to our last video and the box at the bottom will take you to what youtube

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.299
Thinks you should be watching next this bomb here in the center will subscribe you to our channel so you

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.710
Never, miss out on another video again, don't forget to ring that bell and we'll see you the next one talk to you then
