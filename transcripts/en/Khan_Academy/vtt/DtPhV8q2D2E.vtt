00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.760
We're asked to convert
the following equation

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.957
from point-slope to
slope-intercept form.

00:00:05.957 --> 00:00:07.790
And so this is the
equation right over here.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.460
Let me get my little
scratch pad out here.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.876
Let me see if I
can remember this.

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:15.930
It's y plus 13 is equal
to 4 times x plus 2.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.060
So let's write that down.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:24.680
We have y plus 13 is
equal to 4 times x plus 2.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.640
So this is in point-slope form.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.990
And just inspecting
this, I can tell you

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.480
that the slope of the line
described by this equation

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.640
is 4.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.915
I could tell you that the
point x equals negative 2,

00:00:38.915 --> 00:00:42.960
y equals negative
13 is on this line.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.510
So we know the point
x equals negative 2, y

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.895
equals negative 13
is on this line.

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:50.020
Because when you put
something in point-slope form,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.728
it's of the form where
this is the slope,

00:00:51.728 --> 00:00:54.040
and this would be x
minus one of the points.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.070
So x minus negative
2 is positive 2,

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.440
and y minus the
y-coordinate of that point,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.610
so y minus negative
13 is positive 13.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.890
But let's actually convert
this into slope-intercept form.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.730
And that of course,
is a form y is

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.830
equal to mx plus b,
where m is the slope

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.921
and b is the y-intercept.

00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:17.420
And we're going to
do this just with

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.586
some algebraic manipulation.

00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:20.240
And you can imagine,
once we do this,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.010
the m should still be this 4.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.190
So let's do that.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.950
So the first thing
I'm going to do

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.970
is distribute this
4 over the x plus 2.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.706
So this is going to be equal
to 4x plus 4 times 2 is 8.

00:01:34.706 --> 00:01:38.050
4 times x plus 4 times
2, so it's 4x plus 8.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.730
And we still, of course,
have our y plus 13 here.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.420
And now we're pretty
close to getting it

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.940
into slope-intercept form.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.027
We just have to subtract
13 from both sides.

00:01:48.027 --> 00:01:49.610
And I'm going to
have it of the form y

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.370
is equal to something
times x plus something.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.200
So let's do that.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.730
Let's subtract 13
from both sides.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.070
And we will get on the
left-hand side just y.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.660
And on the right-hand side,
we are going to have 4x.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.130
And then 8 minus
13 is negative 5.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.930
So we get y equals 4x minus 5.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.090
And let's just type that in and
see if we got the right result.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.140
So y is equal to 4x minus 5.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.000
So y is equal to 4 times x, and
they just have a positive here.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.550
So I would write
plus negative 5,

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.790
the same thing as 4x minus 5.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.820
So let's check our answer,
and we got it right.
