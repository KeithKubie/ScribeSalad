&gt;&gt; Well hello everybody on YouTube. This is
Philip Rosedale and I'm the founder of Linden

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:13.150
Lab. We're the company that makes Second Life
and to answer the Davos Question here what

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:21.260
do I think we can do I guess as both people,
I'll answer for both, as individuals and companies

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:28.019
and countries in 2008 to make the world better.
One of the things we've seen happening in

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.739
Second Life that is very moving and powerful,
and is something we try to do and live by

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.760
as a company, I think in part because we've
seen it happen in the virtual world with Second

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:48.570
Life is a willingness to be transparent. That
is, the world in which we can know more about

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.820
what's happening is a better world regardless
of what's happening. I think that if we, and

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.660
I think virtual worlds are a first example
of this, if we can be in a place where it's

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.740
simply true that it's easier to see what's
going on, it's easier to know what everybody's

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:13.000
doing and you know what their actions are
moment by moment. Not what they want you to

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.020
know but in fact what is actually happening.
That is something that I think has the power

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.880
to make the world a better place no matter
what. And it always works, and it's very simple,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.840
and it doesn't take governance, and it doesn't
take policy. So I think that's something that

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.240
definitely governments, but also companies
and people can and should think about. Just

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.730
being open, being transparent, being willing
to share what you're doing with the rest of

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:46.350
the world. Which I guess is appropriate given
using YouTube to answer a question like this

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.799
and leave a video. Thank you.
