[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.341 --> 00:00:04.730
MALE SPEAKER 1: Shanghai GDG
is a very interesting

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.325
developer community.

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:06.450
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.280
has asked this question.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.986
MALE SPEAKER 2: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:08.986 --> 00:00:10.170
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.760
answer show, so if any of you
out there would like to ask

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.010
questions--

00:00:18.926 --> 00:00:22.270
PENG YING: Hey, and welcome to
another episode of Google

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.520
Payments Live.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.830
My name is Peng Ying.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.860
Unfortunately, Mihai can't
be with us today.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.120
He's in Hawaii.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.430
Tough life, right?

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.010
And joining me today
is Mark Thomas.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.226
Mark, tell us a little
bit about yourself.

00:00:35.226 --> 00:00:36.390
MARK THOMAS: Hi, Peng.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.400
Hi, everyone out there.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.290
So my name is Mark, and I've
been a PM at Google for about

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.502
two years, and I'm a Product
Manager on Google Wallet.

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:45.240
PENG YING: Cool.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.050
So tell us a little
bit more about the

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.190
product that you manage.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.920
MARK THOMAS: Sure.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.930
So right now, I'm working
on a project

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.360
called Commerce Analytics.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.330
So what we're trying to do is
build a suite of tools that

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.730
help people that use Google to
sell, like app developers, web

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.860
and app developers, to better
understand their business.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.650
So by focusing on analyzing
purchase data, basically your

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.850
sales data, we want to help make
it more obvious how to

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.210
make more money, how to improve
your products, and how

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.431
to get more customers.

00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:25.090
PENG YING: So, I mean,
I've used Google

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.780
Analytics a little bit.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.255
Can you tell me how Commerce
Analytics is going to be

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:29.970
different from Google
Analytics?

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.510
MARK THOMAS: Sure,
good question.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.890
So Commerce Analytics is really
focusing on your sales

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.710
data and analyzing
your sales data.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.590
Google Analytics provides
metrics around bounce rates

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.900
and page views.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.570
We are really, again, focusing
just on the purchase events,

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.380
so Commerce Analytics is a good
complement for Google

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.270
Analytics in that regard.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.230
Some other interesting things,
Commerce Analytics requires no

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.720
instrumentation to get
up and running.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.800
So as soon as you start selling,
you will start

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.420
getting Commerce Analytics, and
I think that's a really

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.430
exciting thing.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.090
We also provide demographic
charts and demographic

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.080
analyses of your customers,
which is something that is not

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.500
yet available in Google
Analytics.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.510
PENG YING: So are there
any other synergies?

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.490
Like what else can I get
if I leverage both?

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.420
Is there any additional
insight?

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.400
MARK THOMAS: Yes, you should
definitely leverage both.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.270
I think Google Analytics, again,
provides a lot of great

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.320
tools for tracking many events
and engagement metrics.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.920
So again, page views, bounce
rates, conversion rates,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.380
things like that, and they can
also help you track your apps

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.600
and your products across
the platforms.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.850
So if you develop for multiple
platforms, Google Analytics is

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.450
a great tool for that.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.170
Commerce Analytics is a great
"out the box," "get up and

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.050
running quick with no
effort" tool to

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.250
use for a quick analysis.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.900
And we may also be providing
some deeper dives into how to

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.500
better analyze and better think
about your sales data in

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.366
particular.

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:11.650
PENG YING: So you kind of went
over this a little bit in the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.180
description, but what are
we hoping to provide to

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.220
developers/ and then how should
they use it, a little

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.460
bit, for Commerce Analytics?

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.390
MARK THOMAS: I take that to mean
so what is the ultimate

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.475
vision for Commerce Analytics?

00:03:27.475 --> 00:03:28.420
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.570
MARK THOMAS: Yeah, and I think
that's a great question.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.040
So in our UX studies, we
heard a really great

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.180
quote from a developer.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.150
He was saying the hardest part
about analytics in general is

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.920
actually defining the right
questions to ask.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.790
And that's the ultimate problem
we want to solve.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.510
The truth of matter is not
everyone can afford hiring an

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.346
analyst to look and crunch
numbers as a full-time job.

00:03:56.346 --> 00:03:59.650
And even if you can, sometimes
there are things you miss.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.900
Well, Google is really good at
diving into the data, digging

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.650
through it and finding
useful information.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.890
So let us do that, and let
us tell you when we find

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.450
something that's interesting.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.395
So I think it's an ambitious
vision, but I think it's where

00:04:14.395 --> 00:04:14.980
we're headed.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.660
PENG YING: Cool.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.810
I mean, you must have dug into
a lot of data while you're

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:20.544
developing this product.

00:04:20.544 --> 00:04:22.470
Do you have any interesting
stories or

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.660
anything that you found?

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.880
MARK THOMAS: Yeah.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.270
As we were looking into this,
one thing that really leaped

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.320
out at me was just how useful
just looking and analyzing

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.610
sales data can really be.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.630
So another great quote from a
developer that we got in our

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.080
studies, with something like
this, they said, you can look

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.960
at daily active users.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.270
You can look at these metrics.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.580
But ultimately at the end of the
day, it's really about are

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.290
people buying things and are
people spending money?

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.430
I mean, if you're a business
that cares about being

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.700
profitable, the ground truth
for you is did somebody buy

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.055
something from me?

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:06.940
Who are my best customers?

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.380
How can I get more of them?

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.020
And that's where Commerce
Analytics, I think,

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.200
can really help out.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.660
And looking at page views and
daily actives, again, pretty

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.920
standard, but it's harder to
quantify what the value is of

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.040
those things, especially
if you're

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.905
selling goods and services.

00:05:24.905 --> 00:05:26.885
PENG YING: So why don't we just
dive into the product

00:05:26.885 --> 00:05:29.850
right now and check out what
you've got to offer?

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.750
MARK THOMAS: Yeah,
I would love to.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.120
All right.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.070
So this is the beta version
of Commerce Analytics.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.960
It is available today for a
select subset of test users

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.660
right now, and you can find
it in your Google Checkout

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.180
Merchant Center.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.840
When it becomes available,
you'll see it under this

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.320
Business Insights tab.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.250
So, we provide a few
standard charts.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.200
The first, you'll notice we've
got a revenue chart which is

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.010
just showing you amount
of revenue over time.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.090
So that's a landing page, and
this is useful for trying to

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.490
see some things like are
my sales seasonal?

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.540
Was there a particular
spike or a drop?

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.360
Was that expected?

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.460
And if so, you can dive
into that analysis.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.960
PENG YING: This guy's
sales were spiky.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.550
MARK THOMAS: Yes.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.400
This is for our test merchant,
so you can see here that it

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:37.410
looks like August 31 was the
biggest day thus far for our

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.360
little test merchant.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.110
So we also provide a Map View
so you can see a geographic

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.990
heat map of where your
purchasers are coming from.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.070
So here, a lot of them coming
from the United States, but we

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.330
can see that there are also,
on a revenue basis, some

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.410
activity, a decent amount of
activity, in Europe, Southeast

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.560
Asia, and even Latin America.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.280
PENG YING: We have testers
everywhere.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.370
MARK THOMAS: Indeed.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.280
Indeed we do.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.500
So we also provide an orders
charts, and orders is a good

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.690
measure of popularity.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.510
How popular are your products?

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.470
How popular are certain
products?

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.470
And generally, this should
correlate closely to revenue,

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.990
but if you're running a
promotion, like a $0.10 app

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.050
promotion or something, you
may see a large spike in

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:29.010
orders, and you wouldn't see as
big of a spike in revenue.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.700
And so I think this is a good
time to point out that we have

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.680
a couple of filters over
here on the side.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.580
You can filter by country.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.120
You can filter by product.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.020
So you can really start diving
into the data here and try to

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:47.200
get a more specific view into
how particular products are

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.450
doing over time.

00:07:50.692 --> 00:07:52.110
PENG YING: Refunds.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.980
That's a section that
nobody wants to see.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:54.460
MARK THOMAS: Indeed, indeed.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.225
PENG YING: Or maybe that
everybody wants to see.

00:07:56.225 --> 00:07:57.255
It's like probably the
most important.

00:07:57.255 --> 00:08:01.300
MARK THOMAS: Yeah, refunds, the
goal here was to try to

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:09.270
provide some insight into is
something going wrong or where

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.980
am I making sales initially
that end up not being

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.230
successful?

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:17.830
So we show refunds over time and
also by geography, but you

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:23.030
could use this to really try
to get a sense for are we

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.720
getting more refunds from
certain parts of the real

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.750
world than others?

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.090
Are certain products being
refunded more than others?

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:34.010
And if so, you can start to dive
into why that might be.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.080
And for example, you may not
want to spend as much ad

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:44.740
revenue if you find that there
are countries with large

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.330
number of refunds for
particular products.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.320
OK, so now I'll switch over
to the customer's view.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.070
So this is where we're
starting provide some

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:59.290
demographic data, and the goal
here is to really provide some

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.560
tools to help you segment
your customers.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.740
We want to help you answer
the question

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.950
who are my best customers?

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.300
So this is an early stab
at doing that.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.110
But what we provide today is
a breakdown of revenue and

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.080
orders by age range
and gender.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:21.130
And this is being pulled from
a combination of explicitly

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:26.630
provided and inferred
demographic data, and it's

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:31.550
aggregated up here so as to
preserve the privacy of your

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.740
customers, of course.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:38.110
So you can see here that the
products here, the age range

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:42.990
tends to be between 18 and 24
when broken down by revenue.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.520
Also by revenue, we can see
that the males hold the

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:51.020
majority of buying power for
this particular test merchant.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.360
And again, we also break it
down by order volume.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.760
So again, revenue and order
should be generally

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.610
well-correlated, but you may
have promotions, you may have

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.410
certain products where they
are very popular with a

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.960
certain demographic category.

00:10:11.162 --> 00:10:14.915
PENG YING: A large percentage of
males guzzling electronics

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:15.780
right here.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.880
MARK THOMAS: Electronics yes.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.790
Mostly games, here.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.350
So one other chart I want to
point out is the unique

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.150
buyer's chart.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:30.160
And so, this is just trying to
give you an idea for how many

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.760
unique people made a purchase
on a given day, so each day

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.540
has the total number
of unique buyers.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.980
And this should give you an
idea for how many people

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.790
you're actually reaching.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.610
It also starts to give you a
sense for am I reaching a

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.530
small number of very
loyal customers?

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:52.610
That is, do I have one
unique buyer, but

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.860
1,000 orders in a day?

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.860
So do I have one person that's
buying 1,000 things, or do I

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.330
have 1,000 people buying
one thing?

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.430
And so, that can help you inform
how you want to target

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.210
your products.

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:10.870
Do you want to really go after
your rock star users, or is

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.010
this more of a product that
has a broader appeal?

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.540
PENG YING: So now that you've
gone through some the

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.210
functionality of it, as a
developer, I'm selling a bunch

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.050
of apps, right?

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.910
Or I'm selling one
app or whatever.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:26.710
How should I then come into
the business insights and

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:27.980
leverage it?

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.225
Can you go through some of the
flows that you typically see?

00:11:30.225 --> 00:11:31.730
MARK THOMAS: Sure.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.470
So the first thing you need to
do, I think, as any sort of

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:40.870
business analyst, you need to
come into the product having

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.710
done a little bit of homework.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:46.310
And what that means is you
should know what to expect.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:49.240
If you've launched a product,
you should know what day that

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.910
product launched, where that
launched, in which countries,

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:56.560
and whether or not you've done
any sort of promotion.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.160
And you should also know what
sort of impact you expect to

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.720
have on sales, on orders,
on unique

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.290
buyers, things like that.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.310
So know what to expect.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.220
That's the first step.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.170
And then once you get into the
insights, the business

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.910
insights tab and start looking
at your commerce analytics,

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.480
just start diving
into the data.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.890
I would suggest aggressively
filtering.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.090
Look at all the charts.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.490
Test your expectations against
everything that we have.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:30.540
So start looking at a
per-product revenue chart,

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.060
per-product orders chart, per
product, per country.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.880
You'll never know where you'll
find that little nugget of

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.760
insight that can help you
boost your sales.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.480
So know what to expect,
and then get down and

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.660
dirty with the data.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.530
PENG YING: I'm not sure if you
know the answer to this

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:55.150
question, but now that I have
the business insights, now

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.010
that I have targeted a few
audiences, what can I do to

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:02.070
improve sales in those target
audiences, in the target

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:02.790
demographic?

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:03.640
MARK THOMAS: I see.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:08.030
So this is where you can
start to look at--

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.680
hopefully, the insights that we
provide here might provide

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.710
you some suggestions.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.160
So, for example, if I notice
that I have a large customer

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.260
base in a particular country,
but I haven't localized any of

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.110
the text, I've haven't
translated any of the text

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.870
into the local language, that
might be one way to increase

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:25.970
engagement rates.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.490
So that's something
you could do.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:32.720
Also, if you haven't been
running any app promotions,

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.820
you can start looking at, for
example, the customer

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.710
demographics data to try to
pull out some demographic

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:39.910
targeting information.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.340
If you tend to reach 18 to
25-year-old males, then you

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:47.370
can start to input that into
some advertising tools to help

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:55.175
better target your app launches
and your apps.

00:13:55.175 --> 00:13:57.250
PENG YING: I wasn't quite sure
about this, but can you filter

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.280
by specific items you're selling
to see demographic

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.160
data specific to the item?

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.420
MARK THOMAS: So for demographics
data, today we

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.120
are not actually providing that
filtering functionality.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.300
We're working on it.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.860
As you can imagine, there are a
lot of privacy concerns that

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.930
we take very, very seriously
here, so we want to make sure

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.650
that when we do provide
that sort of filtering

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.680
functionality here, that we can
do so in a way that's safe

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.520
for customers.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.350
However, on the sales and
revenue and orders charts, we

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.350
do provide the ability to filter
down by country, and

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:33.600
again, by product.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:36.440
And of course, time.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.500
PENG YING: Super useful.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.060
So this seems like something
that's very useful that comes

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:46.960
pretty much out of the box for
merchants and developers.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.490
How would they access
it through their

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.380
own merchant accounts?

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.620
Is there any way to access it
or join the beta early?

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.190
MARK THOMAS: Yeah.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:57.960
So let me present
the link here.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:03.470
If you're interested, we have
a Google form which you can

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:07.530
reach at this shortened URL.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.600
I encourage you to fill
out the form.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.030
We can't guarantee that we'll be
able to bring you on to the

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.240
beta immediately, but the good
news is we're looking at

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.860
rolling this out much more
broadly in the coming months.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.370
So very shortly, we expect
everyone who uses Google to

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:30.260
sell to have Commerce
Analytics.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.980
Again, go to the form, fill it
out if you're interested.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.000
We'd love to hear from you.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.870
We also have a section on there
for additional comments.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.520
So if you have any suggestions
for things you would like to

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.290
see, things that you would
find very useful, please,

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:45.860
please do let us know.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:51.280
So yeah, looking forward to
having some more users and

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.480
some more feedback on this.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.460
PENG YING: Cool.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.790
I think it's really awesome.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.540
I think it provides super easy
insight into what you're

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.820
selling and how you can
improve your sales.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.090
And that's all the questions
I have for you.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.680
Let's see if there are
any live questions.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.550
MARK THOMAS: Sure.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.860
PENG YING: I'm looking at
the Moderator right now.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.430
So it doesn't look like these
questions are actually related

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.080
to Commerce Analytics.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.980
"I am a Brazilian developer,
and nowadays payments in

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.540
Brazil are very complex.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.290
Paypal is a more straightforward
way to pay.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:31.082
How can Google fix
this problem?"

00:16:31.082 --> 00:16:33.192
MARK THOMAS: It's
a big question.

00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:34.770
PENG YING: Internationalization
has

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.530
always been a huge question with
Google Wallet, and we're

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.890
always trying to improve
the number of

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.160
countries that we support.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.720
But in order for us to expand
into new countries, we always

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.860
have to go through the regular
rules and regulations and

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:50.010
follow proper paperwork, and
that's probably why it takes

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.040
some time to expand
internationally.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.130
But we are trying to do it.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.630
Let's see about the YouTube.

00:17:02.475 --> 00:17:05.200
Just one second--

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.000
well, I have a few questions
for you.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.470
A few more questions for
you if you don't mind.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:11.650
MARK THOMAS: Lay it on me.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:15.780
PENG YING: So are we doing
anything with Google Offers?

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.030
I know that as a merchant,
I can sell offers.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.579
Will my offers be tracked within
Commerce Analytics?

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:25.480
Like really quickly figure out
who's buying from where, and

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.990
then maybe target those areas
with better offers, or like

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.730
more coupons, or ads,
or whatever?

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.010
MARK THOMAS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:37.130
I think the short answer is
we're looking into it, and the

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:41.240
general sentiment, though, is
that anyone that uses Google

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.850
to sell should be able to
have Commerce Analytics.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:52.210
And in general, anyone who sells
something could benefit

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:53.330
from a tool like this.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.350
That's sort of the way that
we feel on the team.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:59.910
So I'll sort of leave
it there, but

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.260
very interesting stuff.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.650
PENG YING: We have one
more question.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:09.270
So I hear this is what Amazon
does, because they have a

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.720
sense of the entire
marketplace.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.080
And I'm not actually sure.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.725
I haven't been in Amazon
market, but this is

00:18:14.725 --> 00:18:17.370
just word of mouth.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.120
But I hear what they do is,
because they have an entire

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.690
sense of who's selling what
and how often and the

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:27.350
frequency of it, they can
actually say that these items

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:28.390
will be your top sellers.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:30.250
Nobody else is selling this
item, so you should increase

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.580
the price, and other
stuff like that.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:36.030
Is that an area that we
want to get into?

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:37.830
Or can you not talk about--

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.140
MARK THOMAS: I will say that
there's a lot of very

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.520
interesting things
that we can do.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.380
There's a lot of very
interesting things that we can

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.130
do, so stay tuned.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:49.940
PENG YING: Stay tuned.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.850
Join the beta, or sign
up for the beta.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:56.110
And eventually, can you get into
when we expect to have

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.330
open access for this, or this
is still a work in progress?

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.980
MARK THOMAS: So the exact
date is to be

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:04.060
determined, but we will--

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.000
well, I shouldn't say that.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.930
It's coming in the next, I
would say, two months.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:08.510
PENG YING: Nice.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.520
Very soon.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.030
Cool.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.140
Looking forward to it.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.585
And with that, I think that's
all the questions we

00:19:14.585 --> 00:19:15.850
have for you today.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.720
No more of this interrogation.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.520
MARK THOMAS: Thanks.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.100
Thanks for having me.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.500
PENG YING: Well, thanks
for joining.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:26.280
And we'll have another Google
Payments Live in two weeks.
