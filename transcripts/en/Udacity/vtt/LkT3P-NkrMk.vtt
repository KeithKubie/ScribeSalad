00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.750
Now I will turn things over to 3.8 to lead the attack against these bugs.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.850
&gt;&gt; Is everyone ready, Crazy Bob?

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:08.880
&gt;&gt; I am ready, sir.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.388
&gt;&gt; Bite Me? &gt;&gt; Ready to go.

00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:12.700
&gt;&gt; Ready to roll.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.980
&gt;&gt; Doctor Bug? &gt;&gt; I was born ready.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.660
&gt;&gt; Oh, excellent.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.090
We are all ready here.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.620
So, let us start.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.564
&gt;&gt; If I could interject something before we begin [LAUGH] I just would like to

00:00:21.564 --> 00:00:26.359
say, before we started this project, I I advised management that we wouldn't be

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.460
having a lot of these core problems that we've got now if we just use data.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.140
We're on job aid it would really, you know,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.610
it would solve a lot of our integration problems and all.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.286
And I just wanted to make that clear, that I told them before we

00:00:38.286 --> 00:00:41.430
began this project that we should do it, and here we are looking at jobs.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.380
So, I just wanted to make that clear before we got started.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.220
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, with that,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.390
just trying to read this Baloney Code that this guy wrote is unbearable.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.280
&gt;&gt; Well I think we should just, &gt;&gt; I am just sick to my stomach.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.090
&gt;&gt; We should just proceed with the review probably.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.640
&gt;&gt; Oh, well, okay.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.155
&gt;&gt; Gentlemen, let me remind you that I'm the controller here.

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:00.000
[LAUGH] Thank you very much for your advice.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.250
Dear reader, Doctor Bug, please talk.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.769
&gt;&gt; We start with two imports in the code.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.792
The first one is an import to the java.io package, all the classes in

00:01:09.792 --> 00:01:14.335
the package, and there's the right semicolon right after that.

00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:19.272
And there's another importer, which is to java.lang.System,

00:01:19.272 --> 00:01:24.739
which is used for the io, and another semicolon, so this looks fine.

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:27.382
&gt;&gt; So line one, line one is actually not good coding style,

00:01:27.382 --> 00:01:30.540
because you should never import you're polluting the namespace.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.010
So we should never import asterisk,

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.100
we should only import the classes that we're actually using.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.690
&gt;&gt; Well, I think it's okay, all right, if we need to use multiple ones.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.700
Do you want to spell them all out.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.470
&gt;&gt; But then you're polluting,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.840
you're bringing in all these names that we really don't need.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.340
So, I think it should be, what?

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.591
Java. I think the only IO class, let's see InputStream.read, so

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:51.023
we should have java.io.InputStream.reader.

00:01:51.023 --> 00:01:56.434
&gt;&gt; I think you're, you're wasting space by doing this,

00:01:56.434 --> 00:01:59.550
I mean this is, why is it there?

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.690
&gt;&gt; And thanks for telling us about the semicolons, that's a, a big help.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah I figured.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.610
&gt;&gt; Can I continue?

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.410
&gt;&gt; Yes, please continue.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.800
&gt;&gt; So should I record that as defect or, or we don't believe that's a defect?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.010
&gt;&gt; I think you should I, personally, I gotta,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.310
I gotta echo Crazy Bob here because if we move to the next line here,

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.710
purpose, we have the slash star here for comment style and then further on

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.200
down we're going to use the slash slash, some consistency would be nice.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.212
&gt;&gt; So, I think we should record that as an error.

00:02:28.212 --> 00:02:29.367
&gt;&gt; But let's move on.

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:30.220
&gt;&gt; That's bad style.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.030
&gt;&gt; Sure, sure.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.315
Okay, Crazy Bob will record it.

00:02:33.315 --> 00:02:34.079
Dr. Bug?

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.338
&gt;&gt; Okay, fine.

00:02:35.338 --> 00:02:37.400
okay, then the main class starts, which is &gt;&gt; Before we do that,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.510
let me complain about line 2.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.132
I don't believe you have to import anything from java.lang, right?

00:02:44.132 --> 00:02:46.027
I believe java.lang comes in automatically.

00:02:46.027 --> 00:02:47.056
&gt;&gt; I believe that's correct.

00:02:47.056 --> 00:02:49.418
&gt;&gt; So that's a useless, that's a useless import.

00:02:49.418 --> 00:02:53.380
&gt;&gt; Okay, fine, that's what my mentor told me that I was supposed to do but

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.260
that's okay.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.840
&gt;&gt; Okay, so then we start with the main classes.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.140
&gt;&gt; Maybe we should reconcile this common issue, before we move on.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.890
As brought up by me.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.560
&gt;&gt; I think so.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.060
&gt;&gt; I mean.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.860
That, that's just.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.720
Don't you have coding standards and

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.500
which would include how to write comments in your, in your.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.040
&gt;&gt; I do and it's usually, just stick with one and

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.400
then that's the way it goes for the rest of the, the comments.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.960
&gt;&gt; The slash-star has so much history with it.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.540
You know, we want,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.440
we want to reflect the fact that this is a historical artifact.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.170
&gt;&gt; I don't know if I agree I,

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.190
I think not only that, I'm not sure what constitutes getting its own white space

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.030
like an extra line here.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.040
We move down further maybe we come back to this but

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.690
I have a couple places that I marked that I just don't quite understand.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.367
&gt;&gt; Maybe Bite me is saying, let's go one down and come back to this.

00:03:39.367 --> 00:03:40.701
Doctor, Bug please continue.

00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:41.329
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
