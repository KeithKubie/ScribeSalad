00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.122
How do you know what's happening in your world?

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:13.621
The amount of information just a click away

00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:15.281
may be limitless,

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.098
but the time and energy we have

00:00:17.098 --> 00:00:20.233
to absorb and evaluate it is not.

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:23.148
All the information in the world won't be very useful

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.988
unless you know how to read the news.

00:00:25.988 --> 00:00:27.538
To your grandparents, parents,

00:00:27.538 --> 00:00:29.319
or even older siblings,

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:31.601
this idea would have sounded strange.

00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:34.867
Only a few decades ago, news was broad-based.

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:36.203
Your choices were limited

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:38.390
to a couple of general interest magazines

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.968
and newspaper of record,

00:00:39.968 --> 00:00:42.825
and three or four TV networks

00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:45.697
where trusted newscasters delivered the day's news

00:00:45.697 --> 00:00:48.901
at the same reliable time every evening.

00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:51.148
But the problems with this system soon became apparent

00:00:51.148 --> 00:00:53.213
as mass media spread.

00:00:53.213 --> 00:00:54.991
While it was known that authoritarian countries

00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:57.256
controlled and censored information,

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:59.665
a series of scandals showed that

00:00:59.665 --> 00:01:03.211
democratic governments were also misleading the public,

00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:06.058
often with media cooperation.

00:01:06.058 --> 00:01:09.267
Revelations of covert wars, secret assassinations,

00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:11.068
and political corruption

00:01:11.068 --> 00:01:13.864
undermined public faith in official narratives

00:01:13.864 --> 00:01:16.793
presented by mainstream sources.

00:01:16.793 --> 00:01:19.421
This breakdown of trust in media gatekeepers

00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:23.744
lead to alternative newspapers, radio shows, and cable news

00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:26.666
competing with the major outlets and covering events

00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.541
from various perspectives.

00:01:28.541 --> 00:01:31.066
More recently, the Internet has multiplied the amount

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.953
of information and viewpoints,

00:01:32.953 --> 00:01:35.957
with social media, blogs, and online video

00:01:35.957 --> 00:01:39.471
turning every citizen into a potential reporter.

00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:41.913
But if everyone is a reporter, nobody is,

00:01:41.913 --> 00:01:43.720
and different sources may disagree,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.813
not only opinions, but on the facts themselves.

00:01:46.813 --> 00:01:50.204
So how do you get the truth, or something close?

00:01:50.204 --> 00:01:52.929
One of the best ways is to get the original news

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.140
unfiltered by middlemen.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.012
Instead of articles interpreting a scientific study

00:01:58.012 --> 00:01:59.597
or a politician's speech,

00:01:59.597 --> 00:02:03.423
you can often find the actual material and judge for yourself.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:06.983
For current events, follow reporters on social media.

00:02:06.983 --> 00:02:09.019
During major events, such as the Arab Spring

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.671
or the Ukrainian protests,

00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:14.271
newscasters and bloggers have posted updates and recordings

00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:16.434
from the midst of the chaos.

00:02:16.434 --> 00:02:19.416
Though many of these later appear in articles or broadcasts,

00:02:19.416 --> 00:02:21.890
keep in mind that these polished versions

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.634
often combine the voice of the person who was there

00:02:24.634 --> 00:02:27.311
with the input of editors who weren't.

00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:29.392
At the same time, the more chaotic the story,

00:02:29.392 --> 00:02:32.369
the less you should try to follow it in real time.

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:35.721
In events like terrorist attacks and natural disasters,

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:37.977
today's media attempts continuous coverage

00:02:37.977 --> 00:02:41.578
even when no reliable new information is available,

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:44.141
sometimes leading to incorrect information

00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:47.150
or false accusations of innocent people.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.842
It's easy to be anxious in such events,

00:02:49.842 --> 00:02:52.152
but try checking for the latest information

00:02:52.152 --> 00:02:53.991
at several points in the day,

00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:55.898
rather than every few minutes,

00:02:55.898 --> 00:02:58.704
allowing time for complete details to emerge

00:02:58.704 --> 00:03:01.721
and false reports to be refuted.

00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:03.838
While good journalism aims for objectivity,

00:03:03.838 --> 00:03:06.799
media bias is often unavoidable.

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.260
When you can't get the direct story,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.844
read coverage in multiple outlets

00:03:10.844 --> 00:03:14.386
which employ different reporters and interview different experts.

00:03:14.392 --> 00:03:17.399
Tuning in to various sources and noting the differences

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:19.445
lets you put the pieces together

00:03:19.445 --> 00:03:21.464
for a more complete picture.

00:03:21.464 --> 00:03:24.216
It's also crucial to separate fact from opinion.

00:03:24.216 --> 00:03:27.564
Words like think, likely, or probably

00:03:27.564 --> 00:03:29.591
mean that the outlet is being careful

00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:31.915
or, worse, taking a guess.

00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:35.653
And watch out for reports that rely on anonymous sources.

00:03:35.653 --> 00:03:38.677
These could be people who have little connection to the story,

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:41.409
or have an interest in influencing coverage,

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.564
their anonymity making them unaccountable

00:03:43.564 --> 00:03:45.745
for the information they provide.

00:03:45.745 --> 00:03:47.545
Finally, and most importantly,

00:03:47.545 --> 00:03:50.652
try to verify news before spreading it.

00:03:50.652 --> 00:03:52.473
While social media has enabled the truth

00:03:52.473 --> 00:03:53.756
to reach us faster,

00:03:53.756 --> 00:03:55.805
it's also allowed rumors to spread

00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:57.588
before they can be verified

00:03:57.588 --> 00:03:59.038
and falsehoods to survive

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.185
long after they've been refuted.

00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:03.470
So, before you share that unbelievable

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.431
or outrageous news item,

00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:07.828
do a web search to find any additional

00:04:07.828 --> 00:04:10.986
information or context you might have missed

00:04:10.986 --> 00:04:13.540
and what others are saying about it.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.567
Today, we are more free than ever

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:17.226
from the old media gatekeepers

00:04:17.226 --> 00:04:20.052
who used to control the flow of information.

00:04:20.052 --> 00:04:22.478
But with freedom comes responsibility:

00:04:22.478 --> 00:04:25.441
the responsibility to curate our own experience

00:04:25.441 --> 00:04:28.492
and ensure that this flow does not become a flood,

00:04:28.492 --> 00:04:31.847
leaving us less informed than before we took the plunge.
