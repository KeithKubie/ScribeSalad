00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.520
People get super passionate and downright
angry about politics - to the point that researchers

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.729
believe it might be making us less racist.

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:08.719
How does that work?

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:15.049
Hi guys, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.130
I love debating, but realizing that it can
lead to fierce arguments, my wiser than I

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.650
best friend always advised me to keep my mouth
shut at family dinners when it came to politics.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.730
But what is it about political disagreements
that gets us so riled up?

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.440
Well, it has a lot to do with what anger IS
at its core.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.110
Biologically, your heart rate, blood pressure,
and testosterone increase.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.370
Your body also releases norepinephrine which
numbs our physical and emotional pain, and

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.380
epinephrine - also known as adrenaline - which
acts like an amphetamine making you feel in

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.380
control.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.120
Your cortisol levels or stress hormones decrease;
What’s more, you become irrational.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.620
Because while anger can activate the left
prefrontal cortex which increases logical

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.940
thinking and reasoning, it only does so if
there seems to be a solution to the situation.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.140
This perhaps explains why people keep at it
for hours - arguing and debating with no end

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.140
in sight.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.720
So if rationality goes out of the window,
what’s the evolutionary advantage of getting

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.720
angry?

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.080
Well, Darwin once observed that expressing
anger affects “animals of all kinds, and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.160
their progenitors before them, when attacked
or threatened by an enemy, to fight and protect

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.160
themselves.”

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.340
Anger’s evolutionary advantage then, seems
to be connected to a protection mechanism

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.950
that shields us and our clan from the threats
of outsiders.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.770
And as part of this protection system and
its development, it would have been incredibly

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.170
evolutionary advantageous to accurately determine
who is and who isn’t part of our group.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.479
Obviously, grouping ourselves in terms of
who has smaller or longer pinky toes isn’t

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.730
very useful…what is important when picking
someone to be a part of our group is whether

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.370
that person might cooperate or compete with
us.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.900
Researchers at The University of California
Santa Barbara, the London School of Economics

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.640
and Aarhus University teamed up to discover
if political ideology is one of the categories

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.580
we use to determine if someone is “one of
us.”

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.230
They were particularly interested if the alliance
detection system, as they call it, would be

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.260
activated in participants minds when the political
views of others were presented.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.190
Each study volunteer was shown a video of
a conversation between eight people, what

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.970
they didn’t know was that four of them were
republicans and four were democrats - also

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.980
half of the republicans were white and half
were black - same for democrats.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.760
Once the video was complete, the participants
were then given snippets of the transcript

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.190
from the discussion and asked to categorize
the individuals.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.830
What the researchers found, was that the study
volunteers predominantly categorized individuals

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.540
in the video by political beliefs and not
by race.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.110
Through other variations of this experiment
they discovered that while that while things

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.180
like age and sex are social categories that
help us organize the world, political leanings

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.930
and race are part of our alliance categories
that help us figure where we belong.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.920
And the fact that politics overrides race
when it comes to choosing our alliances, means

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.709
there is something special about our political
views that can bond us together or break us

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.709
apart.

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.940
This is probably why we get so angry when
talking politics.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.340
It’s not really about economic policy, abortion,
or health care - it’s actually about group

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.480
affiliation - about identifying members with
whom to cooperate or compete.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.770
And, it might be especially infuriating when
it’s a family member or friend who disagrees

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.099
with because you may have considered them
a part of your group in other situations.

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.370
When it comes to politics, it’s not debate,
it’s war.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.010
Which is why when you’re talking politics
around the family dinner table, you can end

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.930
up feeling betrayed.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.150
Sometimes to the point of fist fighting and
full-on brawls.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.629
Which makes you wonder if humans are naturally
violent.

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.050
Lucky for us, Trace did an episode on just
that.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:04:00.280
Check 
it out.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.450
Do you enjoy watching or participating in
political debates?

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.340
I hate to admit it, but the primary debates
have been one of my favorite things to watch

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.340
this year.
