LAURENCE MORONEY: Hi, everybody.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.830
Did you know there's a great
new YouTube channel for machine

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.140
learning and AI developers?

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.000
It's all about TensorFlow,
and on it, we've

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.140
got lots of great
new shows for you.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.980
For example, one of the shows
is called "TensorFlow Meets."

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.720
And on this show, I
will go out and meet

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.340
with members of the
community to talk

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.800
about what it is that you
do with TensorFlow, so we

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.430
can learn from each other.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.130
We'll also have
"Coding TensorFlow."

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.881
And on "Coding TensorFlow,"
we'll go on a journey together,

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:26.380
writing the code that you will
use to build machine learning

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.370
models.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.366
You can get it on
GitHub at this link.

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.500
There's "Ask TensorFlow,"
and on "Ask TensorFlow,"

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.170
if you ask your questions in
social media with the hashtag

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.990
#AskTensorFlow, we'll
have some of our experts

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.540
answer them in a video with you.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.890
We'll also be covering
things such as the TensorFlow

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.220
Developer Summit, as well as
lots of more content and maybe

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.907
just a few surprises as well.

00:00:46.907 --> 00:00:49.240
So go hit that subscribe
button, and I'll see you there.
