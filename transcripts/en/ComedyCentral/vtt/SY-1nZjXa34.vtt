00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.836
Opposers, if you're like me,

00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:06.773
you woke up
an hour-and-a-half ago...

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.307
to a victory.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.643 line:0%
TV REPORTER: Republicans
 are waking up to a victory,

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:13.479 line:0%
 a win in that state's eighth
 congressional district.

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:16.249 line:0%
 Debbie Lesko, the projected
 winner in a special election.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:17.984 line:0%
 But here's the thing,
 in a race that on paper

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.886 line:0%
 really should have been
 a blowout,

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.921 line:0%
 it ended up in
 a single-digit margin.

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:23.756
Oh, yeah, baby,
a single digit.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.825
The number one. Ha-ha.

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:29.595
As in "the Republican won.”

00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:32.298
Granted,
Lesko won by five points

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:34.600
in a district Trump won
by over 20,

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:38.438
so this race was a little closer
than it should have been,

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:41.474
but so was Emmanuel Macron
all day yesterday,

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:44.944
and, I got to tell you,
that went well.

00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:46.646
See, the left
keeps talking about

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.948
a supposed blue wave
in the upcoming midterms.

00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:52.685
(laughs) Republicans have all
the tools to crush it this fall.

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:54.353
Just look at their fundraising.

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:56.656 line:0%
TV REPORTER: Republicans are
 worried about a blue wave,

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.459 line:0%
 they also have reason to fear
 a green one, as well.

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:02.261 line:0%
Democrats are out-fundraising
Republican incumbents,

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:05.631 line:0%
so far, Politico reports that
at least 43 House Republicans

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:08.968 line:0%
 have raised less money than
 their Democratic challengers.

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.937
Shut it.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.873
Of course Democrats
raised more money.

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:16.008
They need it to buy that super
expensive milk that comes

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:18.377
from cows who are organic,
grass-fed,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.513
and have Audible accounts.

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:22.348
Not me.
I get my milk

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:24.350
from the most (bleep)-up cow
in the barn.

00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:26.319
(laughter)

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:31.157
Republicans don't need money.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.626
Just look at Morris County,
New Jersey,

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.795
where the local GOP
held a fundraiser

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:37.964
featuring Fox personality
Greg Gutfeld

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.532
as the keynote speaker.

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:41.901
Now, they paid Greg $30,000,

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:44.937
and all in,
the event cost $64,000,

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.073
but it was worth it,
because they brought in

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:51.010
a whopping-- less than that.

00:01:51.043 --> 00:01:54.313
So now, their entire war chest

00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:57.884
is down to a little less
than 14 grand.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:00.620
But 14 grand,
that's more than enough.

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:03.322
I went online to see who they
could afford to hire

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:06.125
for their next fundraiser,
and let's just say we might

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:09.128
be seeing appearances from
the likes of Rockapella,

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:13.032
Liza Minnelli look-a-like
Suzanne Goulet,

00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:16.769
or my favorite:
Right Said Fred.

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:19.605
This, this is why I'm not
worried about the midterms.

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:22.175
We have all the money
and energy we need.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:25.044
And as far as a blue wave
is concerned, I can assure you,

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:28.214
the water is very calm
and very red.

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:30.383
Like, super red.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:33.186
Someone might have had
an accident in the water.
