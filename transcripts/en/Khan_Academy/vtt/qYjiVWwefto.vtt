00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.091
What I want to introduce you to
in this video is the notion of

00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:05.493
a proportional relationship.

00:00:05.493 --> 00:00:09.755
And a proportional relationship
between two variables

00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:12.252
is just a relationship
where the ratio

00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:13.572
between the two variables

00:00:13.572 --> 00:00:16.683
is always going to be the same thing.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.467
So let's look at an example of that.

00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:21.981
So let's just say that we want
to think about the relationship

00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:26.737
between x and y. And let's say that when

00:00:26.737 --> 00:00:35.234
x is one, y is three, and then
when x is two, y is six.

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:40.055
And when x is nine, y is 27.

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:44.339
Now this is a proportional relationship.
Why is that?

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.194
Because the ratio between y and x
is always the same thing.

00:00:48.194 --> 00:00:51.297
And actually the ratio between y and x
or, you could say the ratio

00:00:51.297 --> 00:00:53.666
between x and y, is always the same thing.

00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.704
So, for example--
if we say the ratio y over x--

00:00:56.704 --> 00:01:00.544
this is always equal to--
it could be three over one,

00:01:00.544 --> 00:01:04.676
which is just three.
It could be six over two,

00:01:04.676 --> 00:01:06.846
which is also just three.

00:01:06.846 --> 00:01:11.545
It could be 27 over nine,
which is also just three.

00:01:11.545 --> 00:01:17.896
So you see that y over x is
always going to be equal to three,

00:01:17.896 --> 00:01:19.933
or at least in this table right over here.

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.896
And so, or at least based on
the data points we have just seen.

00:01:22.896 --> 00:01:26.270
So based on this, it looks like that
we have a proportional relationship

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.640
between y and x. So this one
right over here is proportional.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.555
So given that, what's an example of
relationships that are not proportional.

00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:37.367
Well those are fairly easy to construct.

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:41.947
So let's say we had-- I'll do it with
two different variables.

00:01:41.947 --> 00:01:47.419
So let's say we have a and b.

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:52.020
And let's say when a is one, b is three.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.118
And when a is two, b is six.

00:01:56.118 --> 00:02:02.289
And when a is 10, b is 35.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.492
So here-- you might say look, look

00:02:04.492 --> 00:02:06.305
when a is one, b is three so

00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:11.459
the ratio b to a-- you could say b to a--

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.072
you could say well when
b is three, a is one.

00:02:14.072 --> 00:02:15.605
Or when a is one, b is three.

00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:18.227
So three to one. And that's also the case

00:02:18.227 --> 00:02:22.132
when b is six, a is two.
Or when a is two, b is six.

00:02:22.132 --> 00:02:25.048
So it's six to two. So these ratios
seem to be the same.

00:02:25.048 --> 00:02:27.161
They're both three.
But then all of sudden

00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:29.204
the ratio is different right over here.

00:02:29.204 --> 00:02:36.000
This is not equal to 35 over 10.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.612
So this is not a
proportional relationship.

00:02:38.612 --> 00:02:42.038
In order to be proportional
the ratio between the two variables

00:02:42.038 --> 00:02:46.741
always has to be the same.
So this right over here--

00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:49.699
This is not proportional.

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:53.519
Not proportional.

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.693
So the key in identifying
a proportional relationship

00:02:56.693 --> 00:02:59.784
is look at the different values
that the variables take on

00:02:59.784 --> 00:03:01.788
when one variable is one value,

00:03:01.788 --> 00:03:03.798
and then what is the
other variable become?

00:03:03.798 --> 00:03:05.608
And then take the ratio between them.

00:03:05.608 --> 00:03:08.062
Here we took the ratio y to x,
and you see y to x,

00:03:08.062 --> 00:03:12.290
or y divided by x-- the ratio of y to x 
is always going to be the same here

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.499
so this is proportional. And you could
actually gone the other way.

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:18.893
You could have said, well
what's the ratio of x to y?

00:03:18.893 --> 00:03:22.797
Well over here it would be one to three,

00:03:22.797 --> 00:03:25.577
which is the same thing as two to six,

00:03:25.577 --> 00:03:29.588
which is the same thing as nine to 27.

00:03:29.588 --> 00:03:33.175
When you take this ratio--
if you say the ratio of x to y

00:03:33.175 --> 00:03:36.263
instead of y to x, you see that
it is always one third.

00:03:36.263 --> 00:03:39.489
But any way you look at it--
the ratio between these two variables--

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.066
if you say y to x,
it's always going to be three.

00:03:42.066 --> 00:03:44.821
Or x to y is always going to be one third.

00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:49.126
So this is proportional
while this one is not.
