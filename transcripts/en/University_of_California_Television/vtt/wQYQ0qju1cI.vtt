00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.330
- Erica is a clinical professor

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.350
in the School of Nursing at
UCSF, and she's the Director

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.100
of the Family Nurse Practitioner program.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.950
And through her collaborative work

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.440
with community-based organizations

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.760
on projects at local,
state, and national levels,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.285
she provides training
throughout the country

00:00:29.285 --> 00:00:33.060
on areas of sexual and
reproductive health;

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.840
healthy sexuality for people
with special healthcare needs;

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.370
adult and adolescent relationship abuse

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.030
and reproductive coercion;
consent, confidentiality,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.030
and care of LGBTQ youth.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.971
So Erica, please do come
up here and enlighten us.

00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:55.221
(applause)

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.660
- Wow, thank you, that
was a very warm welcome.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.460
I'm really delighted
to have an opportunity

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.143
to speak with you all today.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.850
This is an issue--I'm an
adolescent and young adult

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.430
healthcare provider, so this is an issue

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.760
that is quite salient to all the care

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.733
that I'm engaged in providing.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.170
But I'm also the mother of
an about-to-turn-20-tomorrow

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.680
young woman with Cerebral
Palsy, so I have a real

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.680
personal interest in
these issues, as well.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.080
So I'm gonna be talking with you today

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.630
about healthy sexuality and adults,

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.100
including young adults, with disabilities.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.440
And I have no disclosures.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.930
And I realize you'll see,
if you look at the slides,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.120
there are slides missing
because I'm on of those

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.570
just-in-time kind of people, so I realized

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.950
just this morning, I was like,
oh, I didn't really define

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.560
what I'm talking about with sexuality.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.590
So there are a few extra slides here

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.890
you'll see up here that
aren't in your book.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.830
So I'm not gonna read
this definition to you,

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.070
I'm gonna give you a
chance to skim over it.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.353
But I want you to look
at the broadness of it.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.950
And I want you to notice that it includes

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.820
not just the things that we think about

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.000
in terms of sex and sexual
and gender identity and roles,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.710
sexual orientation, but
of intimacy and pleasure.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.610
And these are things that
we often forget about

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.870
the needs for in our family members,

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.390
and in our patients or
clients with disabilities.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.520
The other thing that I
want you to really notice

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.560
is that sexuality is not an act.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.560
Sexuality is not an action.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.010
Sexuality can be totally internal,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.970
it can be an orientation, a
way of looking at the world,

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.700
a way of experiencing sensations.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.520
So this isn't all about having sex.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.580
Sexuality is not genitality, but often,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.373
we reduce it to genitality
when we talk about it.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.400
And then we talk about,
what is sexual health?

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.887
And again, I want you to notice that these

00:02:59.887 --> 00:03:01.970
are the WHO definitions, and
I want you to really notice

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.340
that what is required for sexual health.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.400
So a positive and respectful
approach to sexuality

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.340
and sexual relationships,
as well as the possibility

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.040
of having pleasurable and
safe sexual experiences,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.620
free of coercion,
discrimination, and violence.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.290
And these are issues that
are present for everyone,

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.863
and are particularly salient
for people with disabilities.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.340
So when we think about
growth and development,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.640
we often think about it, certainly,

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.080
from the pediatric perspective,
it's kind of you're done

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.550
with adolescence or maybe young adulthood

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.960
if you are aware of brain development

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.620
and the issues of brain maturity
maybe not being complete

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.380
until the late 20s or even early 30s,

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.210
but we think of development
as kind of over.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.020
So development isn't over for anybody

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.360
after adolescence and
it certainly isn't over

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.050
for people with
developmental disabilities.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.240
So physical development
is generally complete,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.590
what is, is, and what's done is done,

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.480
unless someone is going
to make some efforts

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.290
to make changes through
the use of hormones

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.970
in what their current
physical development is.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.740
But in terms of the rest of development,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.100
brain development, emotional development,

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.670
psychosexual, cognitive,
social, ethical, spiritual,

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.650
we talk about in my
family that you don't know

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.280
if you've hit the wall until
you've been there for a while.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.060
So what's the end point?

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.000
Do people with disabilities, people with

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.440
intellectual disabilities in particular,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.380
but people with disabilities in general,

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.280
who may be more socially isolated,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.060
have fewer social
experiences, what happens

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.470
with their social and
emotional development?

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.260
And I would posit that you don't know

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.360
you've hit the wall until
you've been there for a while,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.180
because when we talk about delays,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.740
what delay means is
that you get there later

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.900
and it takes longer, right?

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.070
So I wanna encourage you to
always meet with your clients

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.520
as people have the potential,
if they have the desire,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.390
to learn and change and develop,

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.963
regardless of their age.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.530
And then, is there typical development

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.540
for people with disabilities?

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.030
Well, first of all,
people with disabilities

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.970
is this ginormous conglomeration

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.520
of variety of differences, from typical

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.930
or neurotypical or normative development.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.495
And so it's very important
that you, like With anybody,

00:05:18.495 --> 00:05:19.880
that you really individualize your care,

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.030
and yet be aware that there are a series

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.350
of developmental tasks that are delayed

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.810
for most young adults with disabilities.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.600
These are developmental
tasks you often think of

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.330
in the context of adolescence
and young adulthood

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.700
that are pushing into young adulthood

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.860
and even middle adulthood
in terms of individuating,

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.430
separating from family, if that happens,

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.080
locus of control shifting,
so there are a lot of things

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.270
that happen developmentally in adulthood

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.060
for people with disabilities,
depending on their level

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.993
of function and the
disability that they have.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.060
There is a wide variety of
cognitive and emotional growth,

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.070
and this is more marked
with certain disabilities

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.230
than with others.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.830
And just always remember that maturation,

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.563
as with children and
adolescents and young adults,

00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:09.240
is not just this nice, smooth,
forward-moving process.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.290
It's often two steps
forward, one step back,

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.127
sometimes it's one step
forward and two steps back.

00:06:15.127 --> 00:06:18.593
But eventually, you see
forward progression.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.300
So there are lots of myths
about people with disabilities

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.140
and sexuality, and these are
some of the common myths,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.860
that people with disabilities are asexual,

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.900
their sexuality isn't part of their life,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.370
or one of their needs, or
that they're hypersexual,

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.220
or that they are solely heterosexual.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.460
Lots of assumptions about sexual behavior

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.980
and that sexual behavior
for people with disabilities

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.863
is inappropriate behavior.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.650
The assumption around
capacity and consent,

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.980
that people with disabilities
do not have the ability

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.960
to consent or are incapable of consent.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.500
That people with disabilities only partner

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.930
with others with disabilities.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.340
Now that's very unique to the individual,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.990
there actually was pretty recent research

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.249
published on people on the autism spectrum

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:07.890
who, the majority of
them, said they preferred

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.070
and felt more comfortable in relationships

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.680
with other people on the autism spectrum,

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.330
or with autism spectrum disorder.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.400
But this is unique to that study

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.390
and we don't know how generalizable it is.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.700
The issue of privacy.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.190
We are so ready to invade the privacy

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.610
of people with disabilities,
from asking them,

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.000
whether they're verbal or not,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.680
whether we may touch them,
whether we can help them

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.410
remove some clothing,
whether we can look under

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.730
a piece of clothing, or touch
under a piece of clothing,

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.560
to not thinking that they should
be able to close their door

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.333
at home and not have
anybody come bursting in.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.440
And then the assumption that
people with disabilities

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.683
can't or should not be parents.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.510
So what are the facts?

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.980
So here are some of the facts.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.790
I have to say, there's
a lot of great websites

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.630
for people with disabilities,
mostly from Australia

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.123
and Canada, not so much from the U.S.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.210
This House with No Steps has
some really beautiful material

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.010
and there's a blog for
people with disabilities,

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.410
there's a lot of great material on it.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.590
So this is from their
facts and a few things

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.580
that I threw in.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.680
So people with disabilities can be sexual,

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.010
can have sex, can enjoy sex.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.700
They don't just have to
have sex with one another.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.470
They are very diverse sexually,

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.070
and we'll talk more about that.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.600
Again, newer data about
people on the autism spectrum

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.300
shows that there's greater diversity

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.310
than with neurotypical populations.

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:35.510
And these are pretty large studies now,

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:40.510
that show much more sexual
and gender diversity

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.990
than among the neurotypical population.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.530
And with the right support,
people with disabilities

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.540
are capable of having
healthy sexual relationships.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.780
And all people, everyone of
us, every one of our clients,

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.900
need the opportunity to learn
and understand about sex

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.100
and relationships, and that
means that the teaching

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.080
has to be targeted and
in an appropriate way.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.270
And you can't assume that
whatever's happening at school,

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.830
which may be nothing for youth
and special education classes

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.790
or it may be totally
inappropriate for youth

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.970
who have different
learning styles and needs,

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.870
don't count on it happening at school.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.120
So one of the big impacts
for people with disabilities

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.130
is social isolation,
because really we learn

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.270
about relationships from our context.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.330
We learn about relationships
from our families,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.950
from our peers, from
our social interactions,

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.030
from the media.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.330
And social isolation and lack
of typical peer experiences

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.160
really limits social learning
and is a pretty typical

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.090
experience for a young
person with disabilities.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.410
So structuring and
supporting typical adult

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.260
social experiences can really
support social learning

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.783
for people with disabilities.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.680
Many people need the basics,
again, you can't assume

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.130
that the family has had
the level of comfort

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.690
or preparation to do this education,

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.130
and definitely don't
assume that it's being done

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.172
in the school context in
a way that your clients,

00:10:05.172 --> 00:10:09.333
patients, or family members
can learn or relate to.

00:10:09.333 --> 00:10:11.650
So there's just some basics
around hygiene and self care,

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.100
how do you take care of your own body?

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.410
They need a lot of help
understanding social relationships

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:19.570
and friends, particularly I said including

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.820
in the virtual world, but
I would say particularly

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.760
in the virtual world,
because this has been

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.100
a great opening,
particularly for young people

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.540
with disabilities who
may be pretty isolated,

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.125
that they can relate to
others via the Internet,

00:10:32.125 --> 00:10:35.640
that they can read blogs,
that they can blog,

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.010
that they can go on chat sites, et cetera.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.330
The risk is really when
that virtual relationship

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.450
transforms into an actual relationship,

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.160
and that's a very risky transition.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.133
And so they need education
and preparation about that.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.170
People with disabilities have higher rates

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:57.080
of exploitation and abuse and
they need appropriate safety

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.830
and exploitation prevention education.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.940
They need help understanding
what's a healthy relationship.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.070
Often what we say just in
general adolescent development

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.410
is that early adolescent
friend relationships

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.498
very much set the tone and predict

00:11:10.498 --> 00:11:13.830
romantic relationships
in later adolescence.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.410
Children with disabilities
often do not have

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.760
close friendships, they
often do not have wide social

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.760
relationships, and so what prepares them

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.980
for romantic relationships,
what informs them

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.400
about what romantic
relationships should look like,

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.750
or what they might even
want in a relationship?

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.960
So they need education
about healthy relationships,

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.380
and they also need help
identifying what's unhealthy,

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.310
what's exploitative, what's
abusive, what's unsafe.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.670
And it's not just good touch, bad touch.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.640
I mean, good touch, bad touch
is a fine place to start

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.707
with young children, but it's
not where you should end,

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.030
and certainly is not the
most appropriate messaging

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.310
for adults who are interested
in intimate relationships.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.340
And then they need
information and education

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.773
around sexual health and risk
reduction, like anybody else.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.470
Now, when we talk about people
with disabilities, again,

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.320
as I said, we have this huge
group we're talking about,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.010
so what are the issues here
in terms of individuals

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.670
with intellectual disabilities?

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.730
And these are materials that are from

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.270
the Sexuality and You, which
is a governmental website

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.163
in Canada, again, an excellent resource.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.180
So, those of you who work with people

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.420
with intellectual
disabilities, or even just

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.360
learning differences, know
that repetition is important,

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.250
it doesn't mean saying the
same thing over and over again.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.370
But it means repeating the
message in different ways,

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.550
in different contexts,
with different examples.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.310
And then always checking
back for understanding,

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.930
because if we think our
typically developing patients

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:46.080
don't get it, you can
imagine what our a-typically

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.420
developing patients might
understand from what we thought

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.880
we had communicated to them.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.993
So that teach back is really important.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.980
You need to stay concrete
with your examples.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.810
This takes practice, it's
different than working

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.470
with typically-developing individuals.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.470
But many adults with
intellectual disabilities

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.550
may not understand abstract concepts,

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.740
they may not have developed
abstract thinking.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.600
So the examples you use
need to be concrete,

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.600
tangible, specific,
individualized, personal.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.690
And the use of social
stories is a great tool

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.980
for many people with disabilities.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.020
Again, something that
we tend to leave behind

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.210
when they leave childhood
and adolescence behind,

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.693
but can be very useful for adults as well.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.770
So this is an example of concrete examples

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.300
of what are your private parts,

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.340
and the concepts of private and public.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.380
But for adults, this is even more helpful.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.720
When everybody has a
camera in their pocket now,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.150
including our clients,
you know, the smart phones

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.540
are very ubiquitous.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.280
Having pictures of private and public

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.300
that relate to their environment,

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.390
so if they're in a group living situation,

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.810
that's different from
being in a family home.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.540
What's private and public
in a group living situation?

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.550
What's private and
public in the community?

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.280
Do they have their own room
or do they share a room?

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.780
Is their room private?

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.210
Does the bathroom door lock?

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.814
So, really trying to work with them

00:14:07.814 --> 00:14:10.980
and their caregivers to
develop social stories

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.180
that really speak to their reality.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.620
So when we use the
picture of the yellow bus,

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.820
and we say, this is public.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.590
If they take paratransit,
it is not a yellow bus.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:22.632
Right?

00:14:22.632 --> 00:14:24.180
Can they take that yellow
bus and translate it

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.830
to the paratransit, which is not private?

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.490
Even if you're alone in the back,

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:30.430
you know, people in
cars think it's private.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.200
Just sit in bridge traffic and you know,

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.400
that people in cars think it's private,

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.170
but it's not private.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.790
If typically-developing
adults sitting in traffic

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.440
don't get it, you can imagine, you know,

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.940
if you're sitting in
the back of paratransit,

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.980
it might feel private, but it's not.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.530
And if you engage in any
kind of self-pleasuring

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.350
in the back of paratransit,
it's gonna be problematic

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.430
for you, you're gonna be
kicked off of paratransit,

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.770
you're gonna be kicked out of a program.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.420
So, these concepts need
to be very individualized

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.160
and specific and I'm a
great fan of social stories,

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.980
but I have really become
disenchanted with generic ones.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.490
And I think we really have the ability

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.340
to make them specific, and we should.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.050
So you need to go slow,
and this can be hard

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.790
because we as providers have
a lot of time pressures.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.550
We bargain for additional
time for our patients

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.750
with disabilities, we
get half as much time

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.460
as we think we need anyway.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.120
It's often a big deal for them
to come in multiple times,

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.400
especially if there's
a mobility disability.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.740
But even with some
behavior issues where maybe

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.320
the building is frightening to them,

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.640
or the environment, the smells, whatever,

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.560
are uncomfortable for your patient,

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.410
so you wanna get everything done at once.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:38.100
But if you just blast
them with information,

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.730
you are not really communicating

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.040
and they're not gonna get the messages.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.510
So you really do need to go slow

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.660
and take it in bite-sized chunks.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.570
Start with the basics,
do not assume they know

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.680
their body parts, the
function of their body parts,

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.870
how to care for their body
parts, and move on from there.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.550
And appreciate that your
clients are sexual beings

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.820
and this can be expressed in many ways.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.300
It doesn't mean that they're
engaging in sexual interactions

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.793
with others, but they might.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.940
And that we know that
just talking about sex

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.710
doesn't encourage them to try it,

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:07.750
it just helps them be better informed

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.833
when and if the moment arises.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.690
So I don't wanna be negative focused,

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.230
and I think that the issue
of no is really important.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.080
So clients need to understand

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.670
that they have the right to refuse.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:26.670
We program them, we condition
them to be highly compliant.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:29.100
There are strangers touching them,

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.840
moving their bodies, doing
things to them all the time.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.840
So understanding that they
have the right to refuse,

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.850
and understanding how this
fits into their context,

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.900
and where their rights might be impaired

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.090
is important for them.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.870
Again, using social stories
and social situations

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.100
to understand when they
might be in situations

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:55.100
where both volitional
romantic or sexual encounters

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.003
might be possible, but also
where abuse might be possible.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.780
The concept of expressing consent.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.840
And there are a few programs
that have been developed

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.610
for people with intellectual disabilities,

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:10.900
and there's a new program
for people with autism

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.770
that has been--it's not in
the US yet that I'm aware of--

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.960
that is sexuality
education that's oriented

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.840
toward school-based sexuality education

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.600
for people with intellectual disabilities

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.600
and people with autism,
two different programs

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.620
that are very much tailored to
people with these conditions.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.650
But what does consent mean,
and really getting down

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.223
to the nitty-gritty of what consent means.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.960
What do you do, how do
you know when somebody

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.660
wants you to kiss them?

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.470
How do you let someone know
that you want them to kiss you?

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:46.900
Why is consent important?

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.210
Why is consent on the part
of both people important?

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:52.440
Why is it important to verbalize consent,

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.623
if it's an individual who can verbalize?

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.690
What is respect and what is privacy?

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:02.040
And again, these are very baseline issues

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.650
that we really need to invest in educating

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.493
and sharing information about.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.790
So, privacy, certainly,
the public and private,

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:15.690
and that sex is private,
self-sexuality is private,

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.877
sexual interactions with
other people is private,

00:18:18.877 --> 00:18:22.010
and where is your privacy in your world?

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.320
And how do you show that
you respect someone?

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.383
Why is respect important?

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.410
For people with autism spectrum disorder,

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.560
sexuality can be impacted by
a number of different things.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.400
Certainly there are behavioral

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.680
and information processing
characteristics.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.633
They may have specific sensory
interests or aversions.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:48.090
They may be hyper or hypo
sensitive towards touching.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.750
They may have preoccupations
or compulsions

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:51.890
and specific rituals.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.320
And so really understanding your client,

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.090
their needs, their
interests, their aversions,

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:00.070
and then again, working with them

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.890
in their reality, in their context.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:04.740
Not something that really lends itself

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.359
to primary care, I have to say.

00:19:07.359 --> 00:19:11.652
It's time intensive, it takes
really time getting to know

00:19:11.652 --> 00:19:12.890
your client, they need to feel comfortable

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.360
talking about these issues,
so often these kinds of issues

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.210
are better addressed in an environment

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.610
where they have more
time, where they have time

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.410
to develop a relationship,
where it's recurrent visits,

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.010
so maybe in a therapy environment.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.790
Sometimes in a case
management environment,

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.990
but often not in a
primary care environment.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.960
With social and communicative impairments,

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.550
this has a huge impact
on social relationships

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.080
and friendships, so right
there you have this decrease

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.554
in social learning and context.

00:19:41.554 --> 00:19:44.670
Anything that impacts on the development

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:46.860
of friendships impacts on the development

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.030
of romantic relationships as well.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:51.410
They have less opportunity
to learn about sexuality

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:52.663
from their peers.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.610
It influences ones
judgment to apply sexuality

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.200
in a socially acceptable
way, or in interpreting

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.860
the sexual intentions of others.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.250
So how do you read your environment,

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.790
and how do you read
the messages of others?

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.840
And it can result in literal
or incorrect interpretations

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.060
of information related to sexuality.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.850
So often we try to make,
particularly for individuals

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.560
with intellectual disabilities
who may have social or

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.270
communicative impairments, we
try to make it really basic.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.560
It can get so basic that
it's not meaningful.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.110
And that it really doesn't give them

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:30.443
the tools or the information
they need around sexuality.

00:20:32.114 --> 00:20:35.810
So these issues around sexual codes

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.810
and interpreting other's intentions

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.730
can be an important issue as well.

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:44.880
And then, this is a study
that was done very recently

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.250
on experiences of sex
education and sexual awareness

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.530
in young adults with ASD,
and their conclusions

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.740
were that young adults
with ASD really did have

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.050
specific needs and
requirements that were separate

00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:00.360
and different from those
neurotypical young people,

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.450
and that high levels of social anxiety

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:04.370
and difficulties in forming social groups

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.510
and social bonds with
others really limited

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.120
peer interaction, and then that gives you

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.321
this whole cascade of impacts
because of that limited

00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:13.823
peer and social interaction.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.520
So they don't have as much opportunity

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.750
to talk about, joke about, learn about

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.040
sex and sexuality from their peers.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.700
They may take things literally
that are not meant literally.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.293
They may misinterpret social cues.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:31.810
And misinterpretation of social cues

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.230
can make you much more vulnerable.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.630
When you can't read someone's intention,

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.410
you may misinterpret their attention,

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.160
and so it makes you more
vulnerable to abuse.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.770
And then this is another
very recent study,

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.940
and again, the language here
is straight out of the study,

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:53.100
so I am not taking
responsibility for the language,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.040
this is how they defined
their population, as adults

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.039
with Asperger Syndrome and
high-functioning autism.

00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:01.840
Their data was that 73% indicated

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.520
that they'd had some romantic
relationship experience,

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.833
more women than men.

00:22:06.883 --> 00:22:10.650
7% had no desire for any
romantic relationship experience,

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:12.250
which does not mean they're asexual,

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:15.200
it means they're not interested
in a romantic relationship.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.430
That individuals with
Autism Spectrum Disorder

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.900
whose partner was also
on the autism spectrum

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.990
were significantly more satisfied
with their relationships

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.780
than those who had neurotypical partners.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.860
And that the severity of
autism and a range of symptoms

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.630
and empathy skills, the
need for social support,

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.950
all were not correlated
with relationship status.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.660
So the assumptions we might make

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.940
about whether people get
into relationships or not

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.690
informed by how we see
their level of function,

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.000
is not really predicting their interests

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.283
or engagement in romantic relationships.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:54.210
So, this is from a
meta-analysis, sort of a summary

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.380
of the fundings, cause there's
been this kind of big surge

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.263
in research around sexuality
and people with autism.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.400
People with ASD, especially women,

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.190
showed a higher diversity
in sexual orientation

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:10.530
as compared to the
neurotypical population.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.220
Women with ASD were more
frequently in a relationship

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.910
and reported more previous
sexual experiences

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:18.533
than young men or men in general.

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.750
Sexual education programs
specifically addressing

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:26.150
the needs of people with autism are scarce

00:23:27.166 --> 00:23:30.120
and I have not been able
to find anything in the US.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.620
Again, there is a program
that's been developed

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.380
and it's been trialed in Scotland,

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.020
with very good results.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.640
There are people here at UC
interested in bringing it here

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.690
to work in their autism
program and Langley Porter,

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:44.950
so we'll see what happens with that.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:47.833
But it is developed to be
a school-based program.

00:23:50.396 --> 00:23:54.340
And individuals with ASD show
the whole range of behaviors,

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.973
normal-to-problematic sexual behaviors,

00:23:55.973 --> 00:23:57.520
just like neurotypical people.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.033
There's nothing particularly
unique in that way.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.210
So as a provider you have to accept

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:07.080
that you may have to go
outside your comfort zone.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.390
I provide services to
adolescents and young adults,

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.310
I have for 35 years.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.330
I talk about sex with
my clients all the time.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:17.950
Many pediatricians do,
many pediatricians don't.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.230
Many adult care providers don't.

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:23.450
So you have to be willing to go there.

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.730
You need to be able to
talk about self-pleasuring,

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.630
or masturbation, as healthy and normal.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:31.341
It's a normal outlet for sexual desire

00:24:31.341 --> 00:24:33.910
and for sexual energy.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.540
Many experts believe that
inappropriate sexual behaviors

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:40.710
are the result of not having
any appropriate outlets,

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.360
so this is why I really
say you have to be willing

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.625
to go there and talk about
it and legitimize it.

00:24:46.625 --> 00:24:49.373
In my client population, half the kids

00:24:49.373 --> 00:24:52.140
think that masturbation gives you acne,

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.430
the other half thinks
that it cures your acne.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:57.760
But, you know, definitely,
they're thinking about it,

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.760
they're doing it, we're just
not talking with them about it.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.430
And be aware that people with disabilities

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:07.400
need both permission and
sometimes instruction.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.370
And so it's really important to partner

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.270
with their family or support system,

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:14.470
find where is the appropriate
place for instruction,

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:16.040
and appropriate instruction.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.660
Sometimes it's just problem-solving,

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.180
like what do you do when you have

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.200
a lot of lower-limb
spasticity and any stimulation

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.530
on your thigh is gonna
cause you to just clamp up

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:26.710
and to tighten up, and you
know, how can you have sex,

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:28.610
how can you think about positioning,

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.430
what's gonna be comfortable for you?

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.010
So problem solving.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.930
But to engage in problem-solving,
you have to engage

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.730
in a pretty intimate conversation,

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.440
I would say a very intimate conversation.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.370
And you have to anticipate
some of the problems

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.540
that might come up by thinking about

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.280
what is this person's disability,

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.472
how does it affect their function,

00:25:47.472 --> 00:25:50.670
what is their level of physical function,

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:54.020
how might sexual stimulation
or sexual encounters

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:58.563
with others impact on their
disability and their function?

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.590
So in talking about self pleasuring,

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.370
first concept is public/private.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.290
You know, where is this
appropriate behavior,

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.530
where is this not appropriate behavior.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.460
Normalizing, everybody
does it, this is normal,

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.563
this is healthy, and giving permission.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.110
Again, helping people
figure out about positioning

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.950
and helping them to
anticipate positioning.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.150
I had a client talk to me
about using a vibrator,

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.760
and that she found--this
was a client with CP--

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.980
who had intermittent spasticity,

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.810
and she said it just
made her really tight.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:33.340
And so for her it was not
a comfortable experience.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.400
And it's something that
someone had recommended to her,

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.390
a peer said, you know,
try it, you might like it,

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:40.160
because she had some issues, you know,

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.730
couldn't really do manual stimulation

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:44.170
because of her disability, but for her,

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:47.070
a vibrator, or at least on
the speed she had it set,

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.820
just caused her to be really tight.

00:26:50.014 --> 00:26:50.847
So these are not conversations
we're used to having

00:26:50.847 --> 00:26:52.690
with our clients but
these are conversations

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:54.790
our clients need us to be willing to have.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.180
People with intellectual disabilities

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.950
may need help figuring
out appropriate contexts,

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:02.850
so again, that issue of context

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:04.450
and individualizing context.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:06.450
And everyone needs privacy.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:11.080
And I'm here to acknowledge
that as a parent,

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.810
I'm so used to bursting
into my 20 year-old's room.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:17.440
It has taken me so much work, which,

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.180
with my typically-developing older child,

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.120
I never would have dreamed
of bursting into his room,

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.910
probably after the age of
12 or 13 without knocking,

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:26.510
and I'm an adolescent health provider.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:28.310
But here I'll go walking
into my daughter's room

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:31.260
at any time of the day or
night without knocking first.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.180
So we as parents forget,
we as providers forget,

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:38.010
but our clients, our
children, our family members

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.100
need us to remember that
they are full human beings,

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.423
they are adults, and
they need their privacy.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.930
Remember that some of your clients

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:49.902
are gonna remain concrete,
so they're present oriented,

00:27:49.902 --> 00:27:52.370
their experience, their
friend's experience

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.400
is what counts for them.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.750
They have pretty limited ability
to project into the future,

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.020
they're not generally
realistic in their projections,

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.920
and they really can't make that connection

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.020
between the long-range outcomes
of their current behaviors.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.050
So risk reduction is very challenging

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:13.050
to both teach to a person
who's a concrete thinker,

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.900
and to motivate them to engage in,

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.390
because they're in the moment.

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.290
Whereas abstract thinkers,
this is what we can use,

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.470
typical health education interventions,

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.610
they can envision alternatives,
they can evaluate them,

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:28.460
they can take other people's perspectives,

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.500
they can reason about
chance and probability.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.760
This is all health education.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.860
Risk reduction is based on these concepts

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.930
and yet we have many clients
who don't have the capacity

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.890
to really understand these concepts.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.300
So, what does this have
to do with sexuality?

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.630
Well, negotiating relationships
is a learned skill

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:48.150
and people with disabilities
have fewer opportunities

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.320
to practice it through friendships.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.830
Fewer social outlets, higher
levels of adult supervision,

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.610
they desire romantic relationships

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.860
but they often don't have
models among their peers.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.883
And sexual decision making
requires abstract thinking.

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.930
Parents and care givers and providers

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:09.513
have many concerns, our
concerns are legitimate.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.760
Concerns of abuse and victimization
is a legitimate concern.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.880
Concerns about partner
choice, concerns about dating.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.710
For parents, that concern about
really being able to let go,

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:25.920
and will their adult child be safe?

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.260
And concerns about their adult
child's desires to parent,

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.760
and I have to say that
healthcare providers

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.310
also kind of buy-in to this idea

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:36.463
that people with disabilities
can't or should not parent.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:41.010
So, we can't talk about
sexuality, unfortunately,

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.760
without talking about abuse
because it is a very real issue

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.340
for people with disabilities.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.550
There's greater vulnerability
with greater dependency

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:52.930
on others and with communication
limitation difficulties.

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:56.220
With mild impairments,
victimization can sometimes

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.840
be due to that desire to fit in,

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.940
I wanna be like everybody
else, I may misread

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.090
the situation but everybody's doing it,

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:03.890
I wanna do it, too.

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:06.440
Abuse does occur more frequently

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.450
with family and caregivers.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:12.710
Only 14% of reported abuse
is what we would call

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:15.030
stranger abuse, the
rest of abuse is family

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:18.050
and caregiver abuse among
people with disabilities.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.590
And the American Academy
of Pediatrics data

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.680
is that there's--look at this range--

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.300
two to 10 times, this is
because of reporting biases,

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.190
we really don't know, and it varies

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:30.400
in different populations,
but significantly

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.770
to extremely significantly, more prevalent

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:37.260
than the general population
without disabilities,

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.560
in terms of abuse.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.090
And 68 to 83% of women with
developmental disabilities

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:44.400
will be sexually assaulted
at some time in their life.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.560
So we can't talk about
this without talking about

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.973
abuse and the concerns related to abuse.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.850
So, why are people with
disabilities more vulnerable?

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:57.270
What influences these statistics?

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:58.770
People with disabilities are less able

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:02.570
to defend themselves,
they're often not alert

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:05.233
to what is a dangerous situation.

00:31:05.233 --> 00:31:08.120
Maybe they don't have that gut feeling,

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.480
or they haven't been taught
to trust that gut feeling,

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.470
and again, this
misinterpretation of signals

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:14.350
and messages from others.

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.080
They don't know to report abuse,

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.260
and when they report abuse
they are not listened to,

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.870
they are not believed,
they are not acknowledged,

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:22.420
and they are not taken care of.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.420
People with mild intellectual disabilities

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.770
may be more vulnerable, again,

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:30.480
because of this desire to
fit in with their peers.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.940
People with disabilities are exposed

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:35.170
to a huge number of caregivers who engage

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:38.500
in intimate care, whether
that's their paraprofessional

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.960
in elementary school who
might be wiping their bottom,

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.220
to as adults, people are
helping them with dressing,

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:47.040
with positioning, with
toileting, with transportation,

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.070
etcetera, so the opportunities
for inappropriate touch

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:51.513
and for abuse are myriad.

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:55.040
And, people with disabilities are taught

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.140
from a very early age to be compliant,

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.000
to follow directions,
to do what they're told,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.670
to let the person who's doing
what they don't want done,

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:05.500
do it, right?

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.010
I mean, my daughter's been
in physical and occupational

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.690
therapy since 10 months old.

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:12.270
She's had people pulling on her legs

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.790
and trying to get her to spread her legs,

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:14.910
and you know, I mean all these things

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:17.330
that she has the intellectual capacity

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:18.190
to know the difference in.

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:21.410
In fact, at age seven,
it wasn't the best way

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:23.530
to handle it, but she had a new provider,

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:24.520
she was in one of these clinics

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.520
where there was, like, 10
providers walk in the room,

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.150
and somebody walked up, a male provider,

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:29.530
and started to pull down her pants,

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:30.603
and she slapped him.

00:32:32.153 --> 00:32:35.127
(applause, laughter)

00:32:35.127 --> 00:32:37.695
So, my, don't slap the
doctor, but I'm proud of you,

00:32:37.695 --> 00:32:41.163
you did good, that's right.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.080
And she said, he didn't ask.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.000
And I was like, right, he didn't ask.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.210
So, we can counteract that compliance,

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:52.623
but we have to be aware that
there is that compliance.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:56.582
So I took a few quotes,
I tried really hard

00:32:56.582 --> 00:32:59.774
to put in the audio, how many of you

00:32:59.774 --> 00:33:02.790
listen to the NPR series
on abuse and disability.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:04.330
If you have not listened to it,

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:07.090
there's a podcast, you can Google it,

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.910
you can search it on the NPR website,

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:12.450
and I found it really excellent.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.920
And the best thing about it
was that there were so many

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.770
voices of people with disabilities.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:20.580
And so my very limited technical skills

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.340
prevent me from sharing
the literal voices,

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.480
but I wanna share the stories.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.880
So this is from a series that was called

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.800
In Their Own Words, and
this was a gentleman,

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.340
older adult, Thomas Mangrum,
who lives in Washington, D.C.,

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:38.100
and he said, We are
taught to trust grown ups

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.540
more than anyone else would be,

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.160
because when you have a disability,

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.960
people are always telling
you, do as that person says,

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.733
do as this person says,
and all this other stuff.

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:51.890
Or as Cindy Whitaker
in Austin, Texas, said,

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:54.510
it happens to people like
us--she's talking about abuse--

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:57.660
and why is because we're easy
targets to take advantage of,

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.534
we think that the people we're
around, you can trust them,

00:34:00.534 --> 00:34:03.780
but you don't know that by looking at 'em.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.283
You just can't judge a
person by their looks.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.240
Or as Debbie Robinson
from Philadelphia said,

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.550
I was thinking maybe it
was just a relationship,

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:16.380
a bad one--she's talking
about sexual assault,

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:19.150
she was raped--so I
was thinking that maybe

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:21.370
it was just a relationship, a bad one,

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:22.760
I was just in denial.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.960
I had to figure out
that it's not my fault,

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.360
I had to go through all
the memories and name it,

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.200
and open up that box you
really don't wanna open up.

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.740
Pandora's box.

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:34.990
And Debbie Robinson has
actually become an advocate

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:38.120
working against sexual
assault in vulnerability.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.370
The other things that
were really impactful

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:44.700
about this series were
stories about the response

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:49.130
of the legal system, from law enforcement,

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:51.050
but particularly the legal system,

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:53.370
where, you know, you're
not a good witness,

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:58.100
your story isn't believable,
you don't know the difference.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.940
So all of these things
really impair reporting

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:04.010
and retraumatize an
individual who's already

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:06.620
been traumatized because
the process of reporting,

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:08.660
and trying to get any legal response

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:10.003
is traumatic, as well.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:16.700
So some warning signs for children,

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.310
family members, clients,
particularly those

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:23.030
who have limited verbal abilities

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.030
or ability to communicate verbally.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:26.940
So these are things just to watch for.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.710
And it's not that one plus one equals two

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:30.040
and every time you see these behaviors

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.680
it means there's been abuse.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.990
And, abuse should be
in your differentials,

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.740
it should be on your radar,
you should be thinking about it

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:41.560
when a client, for example,
refuses to go with people,

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.750
or to places that previously
they were fine going to.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:47.970
So I had a client who was
going to a local program,

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:49.930
had been going there
for a number of years,

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:53.990
was very happy there, suddenly
started crying and moaning

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:56.513
when the bus arrived to
take her to the program.

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:00.950
And then started biting
herself, she had had

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:03.640
some self-injurious behaviors
when she was a younger child,

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.976
started engaging in those behaviors again,

00:36:05.976 --> 00:36:07.673
she was not verbal.

00:36:08.512 --> 00:36:12.570
And she had a great parent
who was really willing

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.580
to investigate and talk about this,

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.360
and on my encouragement
went, and tried to figure out

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.330
what had changed at the program,

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:23.220
and what had changed was
a staff and a supervisor.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.960
So there was new staff and
there was less supervision,

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.580
and it was actually there was staff

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:31.290
who was abusing her in her program.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:35.070
So these things happen,
we need to be aware

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:36.420
and alert to them.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.450
And when you see these
kinds of behavior changes,

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:42.580
anxiety, frustration, and
self-injurious behaviors,

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.580
and increase in sexualized
behaviors like masturbation,

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.706
just as you would with children.

00:36:47.706 --> 00:36:50.750
These can be signs of sexual abuse

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.760
and you need to be alert to it.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.330
Obviously, any distress,
they could be feeling unwell,

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:56.660
they could be having a toothache,

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.720
they could have a bladder infection,

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.570
you know, there could be
a lot of things going on.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:02.870
But you need to keep
abuse in your differential

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:03.923
and think about it.

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:09.613
So, moving away from abuse
and back to relationships.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.590
Where does capacity fit in?

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:16.240
So I just wanna remind you that legally,

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.030
the bar is very low.

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:20.810
In the state of California, any individual

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.270
seeking care for pregnancy
related services,

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:26.190
so that's pregnancy prevention,
pregnancy management,

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:29.200
pregnancy termination of any age,

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.850
can consent to their own care.

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:34.110
And yet we tell a person with
an intellectual disability,

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:35.890
we think they can't consent.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:36.723
Right?

00:37:36.723 --> 00:37:39.320
So, the bar is not high.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:43.850
But the individual needs
to be able to say no

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:46.350
or express no and they
also need to be able

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:50.920
to hear no and respond
appropriately to no.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:55.920
So, you know, again, as there
are many risks for abuse,

00:37:56.615 --> 00:37:59.310
there is also many risks for
being labeled a perpetrator

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:00.910
when you're a person with disabilities,

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:02.720
particularly a man with disabilities

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:07.720
who may, for example, engage
in self-sexual stimulation

00:38:07.954 --> 00:38:11.120
in a public rather than
private environment.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.430
You know, a mistake that people make.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:14.840
They can learn not to make that mistake,

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.953
but they get labeled.

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:18.040
So you need to be able to say no,

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.840
you need to be able to hear no.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.080
You need to understand those basic things

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.210
about what happens, what
are the adverse outcomes

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:27.120
if you have sex with another person

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.900
in terms of pregnancy and STI risk.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:32.250
You need to be able to
differentiate appropriate

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:34.410
and inappropriate places.

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:36.990
You need to be able to recognize

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:39.240
persons or situations
that might be a threat.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.240
So, this is--I know you can't read this--

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.900
but I wanted you to know that this exists.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.120
So, how many of you have ever tried

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.963
to assess capacity in a client?

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.150
Do you have tools, objective tools,

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:56.340
to assess capacity?

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.680
They just aren't.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:02.410
So this is, again, I think
this one's from Canada,

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:04.550
yeah, this is Canadian.

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:09.390
It is not perfect and it gives
you some kind of guidance

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:12.490
for informed voluntary consent checklist

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.080
and sample questions, so some way

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.100
to really assess capacity
and it even gives you--

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.040
so you have these questions
that you can ask and answer,

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.290
and then it gives you
some guide of capable,

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:24.790
not capable, or unsure.

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:27.980
So it gives you some place to start at

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.570
to think about whether this individual

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:31.763
really has the capacity to consent.

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:35.010
So it's a nice tool.

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:37.570
But, again, I think we really need

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.610
to think about whether we're
even thinking about this

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:44.150
or going there, I don't
know, you can probably read

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:46.710
this cartoon, the punchline being,

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:51.350
you're only 28, you still
have plenty of time, okay?

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:56.270
So as family members, we
often really don't feel like

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:58.810
our adult children with
disabilities are actually adults,

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:00.870
we don't treat them as actual adults,

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:02.797
and we always have other priorities

00:40:02.797 --> 00:40:05.759
besides their sexual lives, right?

00:40:05.759 --> 00:40:08.683
So, discrimination can
begin in the family.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.120
But support can also begin in the family.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.750
So all of those skills
that we teach parents,

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.540
particularly parents of children

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.510
with intellectual disabilities
or cognitive disabilities

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:25.290
around scaffolding, we can
use those same skill sets,

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.140
social stories and scaffolding,

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:30.820
to teach about dating, to
teach about relationships.

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.310
You know, provide lots
of support and gradually,

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:35.260
in appropriate ways, withdraw support.

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.800
And so, the first time,
you might go to the movies

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.510
and sit with the couple.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:42.550
And the next time you
might go to the movies

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.900
and sit in the same
movie but not with them.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.070
And the third time it might
be in the same multiplex

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.530
but you're going to a different movie.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:50.100
And eventually, you might get to the point

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:53.030
that they can go on the bus
or paratransit or whatever

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:55.240
and go to the movies by themselves.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.530
So those scaffolding
principles that we use

00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:00.300
for teaching so many
skills are very appropriate

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.923
for dating skills, as well.

00:41:05.615 --> 00:41:08.350
The Internet and social
media really can be

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:13.060
a fantastic tool to safely
explore relationships.

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.680
It requires the same skills
as face-to-face interactions,

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.580
but you have more time.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.280
You can write something,
look at it and go,

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:23.250
oh that sounds kinda weird, and
erase it and write it again.

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:26.580
I watch this process with
my daughter all the time.

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.340
She'll write it and then she'll look at it

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.800
and she'll ask me to read it, she'll go,

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.020
does that sound weird?

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.420
I'm like, ahhh, she goes,
I think it sounds weird.

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.760
So, you know, that real life one-to-one,

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.710
it's hard to reboot over and over,

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:39.860
but exploring the virtual
world can actually

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.573
be a great opportunity.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.770
It requires support and
supervision and involvement

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:50.650
of a parent or caregiver or
coach or therapist or whoever.

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:53.900
And gradual letting go, as
with all of these skills.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.060
And it's, again, as I
mentioned, that transition

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:59.880
from the virtual to the
actual world is where risk is.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:03.363
So then, click into those
issues around scaffolding,

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.930
you could use really concrete ways.

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:08.930
I had one mom tell me that
she actually--cause she had

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:12.100
a 30-something year old, I can't remember,

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:15.060
with an intellectual disability,
who was very interested

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:18.000
in relationships and was
meeting all these people on

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.940
the Internet and wanting
to meet them in real life,

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:22.330
and this mom finally,
her mom kept telling her,

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:24.290
it could be anybody, you
don't know who they are,

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:25.590
you don't know if they're
who they saying they are,

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:28.370
and so finally her mom
signed on with a fake ID,

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:31.610
identification, a fake picture,
engaged in a conversation

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:33.720
with her daughter, and then came and said,

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.020
you were talking to me, okay.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.800
So you can't get more concrete than that.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.820
I thought it was a pretty creative way

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:45.340
of trying to impress
upon her daughter that--

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.750
she said, I was very careful
to not let it go too far,

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:49.500
so it was just the
getting to know you phase.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.380
But she said, you know, you thought

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.150
you were getting to
know this guy your age,

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:53.410
and you were actually getting to know me,

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.960
pretending to be a guy your age.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.183
So if I can do that, anybody can do that.

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:03.610
So, I wanna close by
talking about pleasure,

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:06.130
because I think this is
really the missing ingredient

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:08.560
and when we have these kinds of talks,

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.540
pleasure kind of gets refined out of them.

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:16.540
And this is a quote from The
Missing Discourse of Pleasure,

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:21.640
from the year 2000, and this
is Michael Tepper, who says,

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.560
access to pleasure is the
real accessibility issue.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.770
Full inclusion means access to pleasure.

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:29.643
It means a reasonable
chance for relationships.

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:32.980
And, I don't know how many of you

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.620
are familiar with Sins Invalid,

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:38.960
but this is a group
that, they have a film,

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.710
they have performances, they do education,

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:45.160
and they really focus on
people with disabilities

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:47.940
and relationships and sexuality.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.900
And they're pretty out
there, pretty blunt,

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:54.940
pretty in your face, and
they do beautiful work.

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:58.480
So this is just a screenshot
from their website.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:01.120
And I'll close with
our more typical images

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.820
of happy couples.

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:05.692
So thank you for your time and attention.

00:44:05.692 --> 00:44:07.942
(applause)
