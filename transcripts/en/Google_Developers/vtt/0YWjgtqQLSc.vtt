MANO MARKS: I'm Mano Marks.

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.930
I'm Google Maps API developer
advocate, and I'm here with

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.090
Paul Rademacher, and Paul's
going to be talking about his

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.370
latest project which
is Stratocam.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.650
But first, we're going to take
a couple minutes just to

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.890
introduce Paul because Paul is
fairly significant in the

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.280
history of Google Maps API.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.900
He introduced the-- he actually
discovered the Google

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.920
Maps API and produced what is
widely regarded as the first

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.200
Google Maps Mashup, which
is a housingmaps.com.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.280
So Paul, why don't you tell us
a little bit about that.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.840
PAUL RADEMACHER: OK.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.220
So a little bit extra about me,
so I actually used to work

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.330
at Google for several years.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.430
I was here for five years on the
Earth team and Maps, and

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.330
left recently to go
to a new start up.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.390
Before joining Google I was
working at DreamWorks

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.530
Animation and in 2005 Google
Maps had just come out.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.450
There was no API.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.730
It was awesome working
in graphics.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.600
We dealt with large Hannibal
images all the time.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.140
You know pan and zoom-able
images.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.080
And so I literally remember the
day that Google Maps came

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.160
out, and we were all hunched
over the screen thinking, how

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.330
did nobody ever think of this?

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.400
At the time, though, Google
Maps was fairly static.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.730
This is just in the first
couple of weeks.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.690
And I started thinking about
what other kind of data might

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.620
make sense on a map.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.280
And what if it were, you know,
what's the very fast moving

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.170
data type that might
be interesting.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.940
I was looking for a place to
live, so I happened to be

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.120
spending a lot of time on
Craigslist. And I didn't

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.390
really know JavaScript.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.270
I didn't really know what
Maps was doing.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.060
But I knew enough.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.870
I knew that the Maps code was
executing on the browser.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.934
And so what I did was, I
grabbed the .js files.

00:02:10.934 --> 00:02:14.220
I basically scraped the whole
Google Maps site images.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.680
Not tiles.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.110
Everything except for tiles.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.640
Put them on my server, and then
started poking at the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.260
files one by one to
see what it did.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.060
And it was all obfuscated.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.050
So there were no symbols.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.920
Really couldn't figure out
what was going on.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.295
But I started off by looking
at strings in JavaScript.

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:33.550
So I could see, right, that's
a really good place for

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.500
reverse engineering.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.005
It's like, OK, I definitely
know this thing.

00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:39.480
You know, this string
is not obfuscated.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.250
There's a few function calls,
system calls are not

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.550
obfuscated.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.390
So starting with that, little by
little, I poked at it until

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.090
I could set the position of
the map to what I wanted.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.990
I poked at it until I could
get markers, and then info

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.510
windows to pop up.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.330
And a few weeks later
I had a website.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.490
Oh, I was also simultaneously
scraping housing listings from

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.680
Craigslist. And so about six
weeks of work later, I had

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.430
this demo put together, and
I posted on the Craigslist

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.800
housing forum, like on a
Thursday night and I said, hey

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.580
guys, I have this new thing
I'm working on, can

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.540
anybody test it?

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.640
And, in fact, I actually posted
on a Wednesday, first,

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.880
with that message, and then
people cussed me out.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.720
Called me a spammer.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.390
Because I didn't put the URL.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.700
So they thought I was
selling something.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.770
So I re-posted it the next
day with the URL.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.880
That was Thursday night.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.640
I wake up Friday and somebody,
some blogger noticed it.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.930
So basically I roll into work
on Friday and somebody asked

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.840
me, they said, hey Paul, do you
know that there's a guy

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.250
with your name that just did
a cool map thing online?

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.670
And it was immediate insanity.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.860
I had a, Gmail had just, I guess
Gmail had been out for

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.420
about a year, but my Gmail
account had, like, 100

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.190
messages in it.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.270
Up to that day.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.210
And then by the end
of the day it was,

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.820
like, a couple thousand.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.010
And, it was just crazy.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.810
That was, so this wound up being
the very first Google

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.800
Maps Mashup.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.230
The very first third-party
website.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.370
There was no API.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.190
API was released a couple months
later, but I mean,

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.360
people immediately started
hacking on it,

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.570
even before an API.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.063
And now, hundreds of thousands
of API sites later.

00:04:33.063 --> 00:04:33.750
Here we are.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.360
MANO MARKS: And we hadn't
actually intended, at Google

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.660
we hadn't intended to
release an API.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.440
It wasn't even really just
something we thought about.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.000
We're thinking, hey this
is a cool thing.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.430
People can come to our site,
they can get driving

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.830
directions, whatever.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.650
And then, that, Paul and then
later a few other people, just

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.280
showed us the tremendous, the
tremendous good that we could

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.130
do for the web by providing this
really easy way to put

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.400
maps on the site.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.020
I was actually at a conference,
WhereCamp SoCal, a

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.100
couple years ago, and
I said, we were

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.170
presented with an option.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.300
We could either hire
Paul or sue him.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.090
And somebody from another large
geographic information

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.650
companies said, or you could
have killed him.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.290
So we didn't, we chose--

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.520
PAUL RADEMACHER: Really?

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.835
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:05:22.835 --> 00:05:23.620
PAUL RADEMACHER: Oh,
I didn't know that.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.500
I didn't realize that
was an option.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.570
MANO MARKS: Well, that, if you
worked at this other large

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.880
graphic information company,
which shall remain nameless,

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.220
apparently that's an option.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.500
PAUL RADEMACHER: Wow.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.185
MANO MARKS: But yeah, so we
chose, instead, to hire Paul

00:05:41.185 --> 00:05:43.170
and set out to build
a Google Maps API.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.350
We're really excited.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.140
We're, I think, 700,000
websites now.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.330
Pretty amazing for such a
short period of time.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.190
PAUL RADEMACHER: It's
a nice number.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.510
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.440
It is the most to used
API on the web.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.030
So we're really happy and lucky
to have Paul with us.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.470
Paul was the lead for the Google
Earth API as well.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.520
He built that, and led the team
that's, that ultimately

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.360
published that.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.270
So if you're interested in
putting Google Earth on your

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.500
website, you have a
way to do that.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.580
But now I think you probably
want to talk about what you're

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.680
doing right now.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.280
PAUL RADEMACHER: Sure.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:37.930
So as a maps geek so I spend a
lot of time, obviously, as

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.990
part of my work, especially when
I was on the Earth team,

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.680
spent a lot of time looking
at satellite imagery.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.330
Google Earth has a full-screen
mode which you guys are

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.880
probably all familiar with.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.700
The word we use for, in talking
about full-screen

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.580
mode, is immersive.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.760
So that's one of the things
when you, one of the great

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.537
things about Earth is, it takes
away every, you know,

00:06:59.537 --> 00:07:05.370
the entire UI of the operating
system of, there's no browser

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.780
window decorations.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.050
It's just the satellite view.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.030
I think really few people
experience satellite imagery

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.580
with that level of immersion.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:22.730
The majority of people who run
into, and do Google Map on a

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.250
day-to-day basis.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.430
It's because they're trying to
get something else done.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.700
Right?

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.350
So searching for a location,
getting driving directions,

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.750
right, between two points.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:38.880
And map view suffices for
most of those use cases.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.200
Satellite view is still great
for the average person when

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.590
they want to look up
their own house.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.340
That's always, that's
always neat.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.910
Or maybe just to see pictures
of some other country,

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.160
something on the news,
or whatever.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.280
But still in the context of
maps.google.com, satellite

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.850
imagery is part of the show,
but it's not, it's

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.090
not 100% the star.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.440
You're there to get work done.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:11.910
So one of things that I enjoy
doing is discovering, usually

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.515
just randomly, just finding
places on the

00:08:14.515 --> 00:08:16.730
map that look amazing.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.890
Either because it's a man-made
structure looks really cool or

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.030
it's just a neat pattern
on the ground or

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.220
some colors or whatever.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:30.290
And what I've done a few times
is, I'll find something on

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.760
maps, maps.google, grab the link
and then share it on my

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.366
preferred social network.

00:08:36.366 --> 00:08:37.280
Right?

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.120
Just send it to people.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.059
Like, here's a cool mansion, in
the middle of the suburb,

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:43.039
that you had no idea existed.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.850
And that's great.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.780
But after a few of these I
realized there's actually,

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.570
there's a lot of stuff
on the planet to see.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.086
And there's more than just
one person can collect.

00:08:53.086 --> 00:08:54.050
MANO MARKS: Why don't
we, why don't we

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.790
take a look, at Stratocam.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.300
PAUL RADEMACHER: OK, and
are we full-screen?

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.630
Command Shift I think.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.330
OK, so, let's see.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.660
Josh, actually, can we
see the people again?

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.690
I want to confirm that everybody
can see this.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.640
So can you guys out
there see this?

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:28.970
Yeah?

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:29.980
OK, awesome.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.620
OK.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.680
So, as I said before, the
typical thing that people do

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.830
on Google Maps, and on Google
Earth, the first thing a lot

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.340
of people do is type in
their street address.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.370
Their home address.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.480
They want to see what their
house looks like.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:42.720
Right?

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.580
So this is somebody
else's house.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.770
These are houses in Dubai.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.960
If you happen to live in Dubai,
and you happen to have

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.410
a little bit of cash, then when
you look up your house

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.470
you'll find this.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.440
And you might be impressed,
but this is

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.640
probably old news to you.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:09:59.970
Right?

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.440
For most of the world
this is amazing.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.550
MANO MARKS: I think this is
more than the top 1%.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.950
PAUL RADEMACHER: Yes

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.540
MANO MARKS: This is
the top 0.1%.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.140
PAUL RADEMACHER: Yes.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.420
They should pay their
fair share.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:17.290
So, so this is somebody's house
and this is somebody

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.380
else's version of a house.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.060
Josh can we go to
the next one?

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.820
OK, so this is an airport.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:27.110
This is Laguardia or JFK, one
of the two, I forget.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:32.240
So we have all seen airports on
Google Maps because we're

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.430
trying to get there.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.950
So you type in the airport as
your destination, but how

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.190
often do you switch to satellite
view and pull back a

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.160
little bit and just take
a look at what the

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.270
airport looks like?

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.690
So this is actually
one of my favorite

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.800
pictures that I've found.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.940
MANO MARKS: That's really
nice, yeah.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.895
And so, so it looks like you've
got a voting mechanism

00:10:54.895 --> 00:10:56.860
on Stratocam to.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:57.820
PAUL RADEMACHER: Right.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.060
So, and before I talk about
the voting, so a couple of

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.760
these images on Stratocam, more
than a couple, as I was

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.570
working on it I collected, I try
to collect a lot of good

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:14.440
stuff for people see on
day one of lunch.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.030
And I had collected about 200
images, which I thought were

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.430
pretty good.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.730
And I had some of the greatest
hits, right.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:25.830
Yeah, Josh, you can just feel
free to fast-forward.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.490
So I had a lot of the greatest
hits, right?

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:33.270
Like Eiffel Tower, the Pentagon,
places like that.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.520
I'd grabbed about 200 at lunch
and I worried, what if I

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.780
already found all
the best stuff?

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.080
Right?

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.500
So one of the things you can do
on Stratocam is anybody can

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.160
move the map around.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.770
And, in fact, right now,
Josh, you could grab it

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.850
and just pan right.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.630
So this is a Google
Maps API site.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.910
It's built entirely on
tops of Maps API.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.440
So at any point while you're
viewing the slide show of

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:03.870
images, you can move the map
around and eventually you'll

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.280
see a little camera icon
at the bottom.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.080
That will let you take
a snapshot and

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.830
show it to other people.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.000
When it launched I
had 200 images.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.770
And then, right now the
total is around,

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.450
it's close to 30,000.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:23.370
So 30,000 images submitted
by users.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.180
And at the bottom there's a
thumbs up and thumbs down

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.910
buttons so people can also vote
for the best. And what

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.340
we're seeing here is a selection
of some of the best

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.840
images that people selected.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.160
MANO MARKS: I told Paul he
should call it the Hot or Not

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.570
for satellite imagery.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:42.770
I'm not sure if, if he's
allowed to do that.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:43.230
PAUL RADEMACHER: I like it.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.070
I think I'm allowed.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:44.395
MANO MARKS: Yeah?

00:12:44.395 --> 00:12:44.720
OK.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.495
PAUL RADEMACHER: Let's
call it that.

00:12:45.495 --> 00:12:46.610
MANO MARKS: That's your
elevator bit.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:47.320
PAUL RADEMACHER: It is done.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:47.990
MANO MARKS: This is amazing.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.380
Do you--

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:48.870
PAUL RADEMACHER: This is--

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:49.570
MANO MARKS: --happen to
know what this is?

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:49.960
PAUL RADEMACHER: OK.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.690
So I haven't been able to find
out exactly what this is.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:57.160
This is right northeast
of London.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:57.920
Some sort of island.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.390
Yeah, one of the interesting
things that happens here is

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:05.560
people choose to discover things
on the ground that just

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.040
look interesting.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.550
Asthetically pleasing.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:13.650
But then, this is a great entry
point to learning about

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:17.950
geography, or what's
on the ground.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.200
How far back are we?

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.000
Where is this?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.250
This is San Diego.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.290
This is actually not
a satellite image.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.130
This is from the, this
is 45 degree imagery.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:34.590
MANO MARKS: Yes.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:35.300
PAUL RADEMACHER: Right?

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:35.610
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.310
This is aerial imagery,
or 45 degree imagery.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.310
What we used to call obliques.

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:42.100
PAUL RADEMACHER: That's right.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.630
And Maps API is really great in
that I can set, in fact I

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:49.740
set the map to 45 degrees
always, and then it

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.180
automatically toggles to 45
degrees if it's available.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.850
And it's usually, usually
when it's

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.070
available, it's higher quality.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.920
Sharper.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.180
And lower to the ground.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.430
And go ahead Josh.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.260
In fact, hit p and we'll
just go automatically.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.820
MANO MARKS: Josh, I think
somebody's not muted.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:25.020
PAUL RADEMACHER: So this image
here, it says it's in the Baja

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.770
California region of Mexico.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.570
This is clearly a
natural feature.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:37.370
What you can't see
is that this is

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:38.900
it's over a mile across.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.160
This is actually huge.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:46.060
And it's, you know, you find all
around the planet, these

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.032
fractal shapes.

00:14:48.032 --> 00:14:49.960
Right?

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.440
And, you know, what
more can we say?

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.196
It's beautiful.

00:14:54.196 --> 00:14:55.050
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.420
PAUL RADEMACHER: This
is a great one.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:04.410
This is the now non functioning
airport in Berlin.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.810
Check out the tarmac.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.290
It's enormous.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.580
And Josh, hit minus to back
out a little bit.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:12.913
You can see a little
more of it.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.720
Again, as an entry point to
learning about geography or

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.290
history, in this case, if you
look up this airport on

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:32.440
Wikipedia you will learn
that this was the--

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.845
essentially command center
for the Berlin airlift.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.080
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.240
There are a lot of circles
on the ground.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.780
So people submitted--

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.030
MANO MARKS: These are, if I
recognize them from, if this

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.050
were in a US context, I would
definitely recognize this as

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:55.910
agricultural circles.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:56.870
PAUL RADEMACHER: Right.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:57.505
Yeah, that's what this is.

00:15:57.505 --> 00:16:00.240
MANO MARKS: The irrigation
devices that go in a circular

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.730
pattern around a central pump.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.520
PAUL RADEMACHER: Yeah.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.630
MANO MARKS: Just pulling on my
vast agricultural knowledge.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:07.370
PAUL RADEMACHER: Excellent.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:08.470
Excellent.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:09.570
What is this?

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.120
This is a picture of what?

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.073
Actually let's fast-forward
to the next one.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.520
MANO MARKS: That's amazing.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.650
I think, you know, as commuters
we don't think about

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:23.250
the beauty of highways.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:26.282
But if you, I think designers of
the highways really thought

00:16:26.282 --> 00:16:27.490
about this since they--

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.460
PAUL RADEMACHER: They definitely
thought about it.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:28.860
Yeah.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:29.610
Right, exactly.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:30.020
Exactly.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.370
The design, for all these
man-made structures, there's

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.650
some architect, who saw that
and marveled at it and said

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:36.815
I've created something
beautiful.

00:16:36.815 --> 00:16:37.140
Right?

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.350
But you can only enjoy
it from high up.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.490
Josh, let's go on.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.970
OK, I think these
are different.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.730
Crop circles.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.710
But still in Saudi Arabia.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.250
And I love the fact that that's
all desert except for

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.990
these green fields.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.590
Circles.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:00.640
More circles.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.480
This is Sweden.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.480
And go to the next one.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.865
I think the next one is, in
fact, here we are in Rome.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.270
MANO MARKS: Now you used the
Maps API to do this obviously.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.167
I noticed, as we were zooming
out, but I didn't see any, are

00:17:19.167 --> 00:17:20.569
you just using satellite mode?

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:21.750
Or, yeah.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:22.919
Just satellite mode.

00:17:22.919 --> 00:17:23.339
PAUL RADEMACHER: That was--

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:24.920
MANO MARKS: No roads or--

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.569
PAUL RADEMACHER: Back up one.

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:28.920
This is, this is the parking
lot outside Epcot Center.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:32.340
So there you go.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:32.910
Disney.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:34.390
Disney World.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:37.080
A curvy--

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:42.180
This is outside an Air Force
base in Southern California.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.500
I don't know why the roads
are curved like that.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.010
MANO MARKS: It almost looks
like a racetrack.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:47.980
PAUL RADEMACHER: It looks
like a racetrack.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.230
I don't think it is.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:55.360
MANO MARKS: Ice flows?

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.700
That's what I would guess.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.160
PAUL RADEMACHER: It is.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.660
Yeah, this is Antarctica.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.910
MANO MARKS: Antarctica.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:04.970
PAUL RADEMACHER: Serbia.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:09.050
One of the interesting things,
you can keep going Josh.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:10.840
Thanks.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.630
So one of the great things
about this site, lesson

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.780
learned for Maps
API developers.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.030
When possible--

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.310
this, oh, this is a great one.

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:26.640
I'll make my point after
we look at this one.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.800
So this is in, this is Canada.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:34.120
This one is a fan favorite.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.140
This is one of the most
up voted pictures.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.240
MANO MARKS: 25 81, up votes.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:39.750
Sensory

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:40.160
PAUL RADEMACHER: Yeah.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:40.570
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:41.810
PAUL RADEMACHER:
2,500 up votes.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:42.820
And you see the face?

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:43.190
MANO MARKS: Of course.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.450
Yeah.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:43.670
PAUL RADEMACHER: Right.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.200
MANO MARKS: It's amazing.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:50.870
PAUL RADEMACHER: And so
basically what this is, if you

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:56.050
look at the, if you could scan
the millions and millions of

00:18:56.050 --> 00:19:00.670
hillsides and just
random geological

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:01.860
erosion patterns, right?

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.310
And uplift, and everything
else.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.440
Eventually one of them
will resemble a face.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:07.765
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:19:07.765 --> 00:19:08.090
PAUL RADEMACHER: Right?

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.790
And that's what this is.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:15.310
Now that the weird thing is
that he's wearing iPod

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.700
headphones.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.850
I don't know what's
going on there.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.150
MANO MARKS: I think Apple
paid for something.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:21.860
PAUL RADEMACHER: That's right.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:22.370
That's right.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:23.360
It's an ad.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.394
Steve Jobs.

00:19:25.394 --> 00:19:26.210
Berlin.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.070
It's a beautiful building.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.120
What I was going to say before,
is this site doesn't

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.150
have really any text,
except for the

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:33.570
location of the bottom.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.230
So it winds up being very,
very internationalized.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.580
So this one is taken, by the
way, by our own Michael Jones.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.470
MANO MARKS: Oh.

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:44.805
Nice.

00:19:44.805 --> 00:19:48.810
PAUL RADEMACHER: Of the original
Google Earth team.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.740
So this is a very
internationalized site.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:56.810
So one of the neat things that I
get to witness here, is if a

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:00.830
link to Stratocam appears in,
say a Russian newspaper, which

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:05.400
has happened several times,
because the site is all

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.030
user-contributed content, then
for that time period, while

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:13.090
it's hot in Russia, all the
images on the front page will

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:14.620
start becoming images
of Russia.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.070
MANO MARKS: Oh, right.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.610
PAUL RADEMACHER: And
people will vote

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:16.910
for their own, right?

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.060
So I can actually see this app
changes constantly on the

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.010
24-hour cycle as
it goes, right.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.310
MANO MARKS: That's right.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:23.910
PAUL RADEMACHER: As
it goes around.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.570
And it also assures, it also
makes it an interesting side

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.410
effect is then, the other
viewers from Russia are seeing

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.210
things that hit home.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:31.620
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.710
PAUL RADEMACHER: Right?

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:37.710
This is the Forbidden
City in Beijing.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.980
These are bats.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.020
MANO MARKS: So we saw that
little shift there.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.180
It actually shifts from the
satellite imagery right into

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.400
the aerial imagery, 45 degree.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:47.970
PAUL RADEMACHER: That's,
that's right.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:49.710
Yeah.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:53.210
Maps transitioning.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.510
This is Algeria.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:55.760
Nothing but great colors.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:00.550
More circles.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:01.870
I think this is--

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:03.450
there's a few of these that
are really interesting.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:04.700
This is a man-made circle.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.540
Again, this is actually,
is that a spiral?

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.205
I think that's a spiral.

00:21:10.205 --> 00:21:10.640
Oh, yeah.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.690
There's a spiral pattern.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.580
Not exactly sure what's
going on there.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:19.940
MANO MARKS: That's amazing.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:20.600
Suez Canal.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.470
PAUL RADEMACHER: Suez Canal.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:22.350
Yeah.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.210
Vote captured.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:35.240
The land mass of the earth is
150 kilometers squared.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:40.240
So gives you a sense of how much
ground there is to cover.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.270
Oh, this is actually one
of my favorites.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:48.110
Favorites because it's so
beautiful and also bizarre.

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:52.840
So this is in the Congo.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:59.290
This is vegetation on the
outskirts, on the edges of a

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:02.000
lake, of a large lake
in the Congo.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.910
And you'll see those little
squiggly, little tiny spirals,

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:07.730
they're actually huge.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:12.090
Each one of those is about
200 to 300 feet across.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:12.542
MANO MARKS: Wow.

00:22:12.542 --> 00:22:14.350
PAUL RADEMACHER: Right?

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:20.620
And the spirals just end
abruptly, so I spent half an

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.930
hour on Wikipedia and online in
trying, in looking up the

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:27.520
name of the lake, and we
couldn't figure out what's

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:27.990
going on here.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.700
So this was a total mystery.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:36.565
I kind of think it's man-made
channels by which to, you

00:22:36.565 --> 00:22:37.820
know, maneuver boats.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:38.860
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.690
PAUL RADEMACHER: But why
spirals, and why do they end

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:42.760
abruptly, I don't know.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:47.750
This is, I think this is an
island outs, between Alaska

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:50.440
and Russia.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.460
This is the Bahamas.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.710
This beautiful blue.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.390
Pirate ship.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:03.340
Hannover Gardens in Germany.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.960
This ones another
fan favorite.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.260
People love this image.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.240
2,300 up votes.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.940
MANO MARKS: So I'm thinking that
it might be good to start

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.830
taking some questions
from the hangout.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:19.380
So let's see.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:25.310
If you've got a question for
Paul, why don't you raise your

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:29.676
hand and we will unmute you
and bring you back in.

00:23:29.676 --> 00:23:30.490
Yes.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.060
Eric

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.140
ERIC: Am I unmuted?

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:34.972
MANO MARKS: Yeah, you're fine.

00:23:34.972 --> 00:23:35.736
Yeah.

00:23:35.736 --> 00:23:36.420
ERIC: Oh.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:37.930
Cool.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:41.360
One of the things that I love
about Google Maps and Google

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.940
Earth is just kind of playing
with them like a video game

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:50.550
you can assimilate so much
information and understanding

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:54.540
about what's going on
with the geography.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.820
And I do that was Stratocam
as well, so I like to flip

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.300
through really quick and
understand different

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.800
places in the world.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:09.130
And I'd love it if I could
filter out the points that

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:15.000
don't have the place labeled.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.610
So what I end up doing a lot of
times is, I will zoom out

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:23.730
and try to figure out where that
place is, and then try to

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.670
pull it up in Google Maps and
then find it in Google Earth

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:31.480
and then explore around that
place if it's interesting.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.810
And further to that point, as
this gains popularity, it

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.980
seems like it would be wonderful
to be able to

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:41.520
categorize different places
like, you could cruise through

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.435
all the agriculture, interesting
agriculture spots,

00:24:44.435 --> 00:24:46.190
or the cities or villages.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.870
And you could really quickly
start to educate yourself

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:53.220
about structures of culture and
agriculture and everything

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:53.760
else like that.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.670
So I was curious about your
future development plans along

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:58.625
those lines.

00:24:58.625 --> 00:24:59.540
PAUL RADEMACHER: Yeah,
so that's a, those

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.980
are two great points.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.860
Categories, some form of
categorization, is actually

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.232
right at the top of
my to-do list.

00:25:08.232 --> 00:25:09.570
ERIC: Mmmhmm.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.620
PAUL RADEMACHER: Categorization,
both

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.090
thematically, as you said.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:18.990
Interesting agricultural items.
As I mentioned before,

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:23.860
there's tons of circles on the
ground, and I want to circles

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:24.240
collection.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.680
I actually want to just go
through and look at all the

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.810
circles that people discover.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:27.140
ERIC: Right.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:27.470
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.940
PAUL RADEMACHER: Also, also in
geography, the two, I would

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:35.750
say, I would say the three most
interesting places, or

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:39.600
sources of snapshots, are
Russia, Northeast Russia,

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.877
Saudi Arabia--

00:25:40.877 --> 00:25:42.070
ERIC: Yeah.

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.990
PAUL RADEMACHER: --and
the Netherlands.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:48.240
Surprisingly the Netherlands has
just beautiful castles and

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.830
forts and water channels, you
know, plowing through fields.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:53.570
ERIC: Yeah.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:54.760
PAUL RADEMACHER: So I would
like to see those as

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.390
collections, right.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:57.270
Just show me stuff in
the Netherlands.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.690
So that's at the top
of the list and I

00:25:58.690 --> 00:25:59.315
think it'll be great.

00:25:59.315 --> 00:26:00.680
ERIC: Awesome.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:05.620
PAUL RADEMACHER: The other, the
other point, some items,

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:10.820
some snapshots surprisingly
don't have location.

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:15.460
What I do is, the user submits
a snapshot, and that winds up

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.790
just being latitude
and longitude,

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:19.440
and the view extense.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.480
And then, on the back end,
I send it to the Google

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:25.110
geocoder, and I try to parse,
you get a big--

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.100
ERIC: Oh, OK.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.440
PAUL RADEMACHER: --dump of data
and then try to parse the

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.110
interesting stuff.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.900
I do need to run a second
geoencoding pass to pick up

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.670
some stuff that they didn't
geocode the first time that I

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:39.280
think I could do better
at on a second run.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.960
There is a secret feature.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.500
If you hit A, the letter
A, it will actually pop

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.282
up labels in Stratocam.

00:26:51.282 --> 00:26:52.305
ERIC: Oh, cool.

00:26:52.305 --> 00:26:53.535
MANO MARKS: So is that
switching to

00:26:53.535 --> 00:26:54.410
the hybrid map type?

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:55.680
PAUL RADEMACHER: It switches
to hybrid map.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.110
Right.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.510
ERIC: Awesome.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:57.456
Oh, that's awesome.

00:26:57.456 --> 00:27:01.680
PAUL RADEMACHER: So that's
useful, it's useful for that.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.300
The concept thing I ran into in
the app, is I try to keep

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.260
it the UI super,
super minimal.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:09.760
ERIC: Yeah.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.980
PAUL RADEMACHER: Because, you
know, most, 99% of people

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:12.900
don't need two labels.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.490
But for that 1% that they really
do want to see them, I

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:16.230
want to support that.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.646
So I'm going to make the labels
feature more prominent.

00:27:19.646 --> 00:27:20.030
ERIC: Cool.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:22.460
And then, and then, one other
quick question and I can give

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.400
someone else a chance.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.080
As I cruise through all of
these spots what I end up

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.820
doing when I thumb-up something,
or a place is

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.450
compelling to me, and going into
Google Earth and looking

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.300
up that location, finding
the lat/long,and

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.564
then plugging it in--

00:27:38.564 --> 00:27:41.340
[RECORDED VOICES]

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:45.090
ERIC: --I end up going
into Google Maps--

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:52.962
[RECORDED VOICE]

00:27:52.962 --> 00:27:54.580
MALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN):
OK, you're back.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.850
PAUL RADEMACHER: Time
warp going on here.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:57.606
OK, go, go ahead.

00:27:57.606 --> 00:27:58.666
I think we'll be OK.

00:27:58.666 --> 00:28:01.070
ERIC: OK, cool.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.550
Anyway,

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:04.490
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.430
ERIC: I would love to be able
to download a KML of all of

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.383
the points that I've found up
and be able to plug that into

00:28:10.383 --> 00:28:13.985
Google Earth, and explore
those places--

00:28:13.985 --> 00:28:15.235
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.060
PAUL RADEMACHER: I heard
your question.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.990
We're fixing the echo.

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:25.030
It was a good question.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:28.340
I think we got the echo
under control here.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:35.120
I did see recently a guy, Daniel
Dye, d-y-e, took the

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.380
Stratocam feed and built
a KML file out of it.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.420
And we chatted a little
bit about that.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:46.820
Yeah, having maybe, like,
Stratocam, you know, question

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:51.300
mark, output equals KML,
or something like that.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:55.040
And like right now, you can go
to, go to Stratocam slash API,

00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:00.330
and you'll see the JSON dump,
of the snapshots.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.310
That's our, you know, the
JavaScript [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:05.640
So API question mark, output
equals KML, to

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.390
give the same data.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:11.320
Format is KML would be super
easy, and then I believe you

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.230
would be able to just go to
Google Earth and just pop in

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:18.760
Stratocam da-da-da, and ingest
directly in Earth.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.540
And I could even I
put it as a tour.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:24.720
That's what Dan Dye was doing.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.760
Yeah, that'd be great.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.100
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:26.540
PAUL RADEMACHER:
That'd be fun.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:26.970
ERIC: Sweet.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:29.860
You know, again, I just love
to use it as a tool for

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:33.000
exploring and just
let, putting the

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.250
world into my brain.

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.166
PAUL RADEMACHER: Cool, thanks.

00:29:35.166 --> 00:29:36.540
ERIC: Yep.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:36.860
MANO MARKS: Cool.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.400
Thanks, Eric.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.696
Is there somebody else that
has a question for Paul?

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.220
Wave your hand if you do.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.470
Pierre.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:50.340
PIERRE: Hi Paul.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.046
MANO MARKS: It's un-muted.

00:29:52.046 --> 00:29:53.930
PIERRE: Kind of on
a similar theme.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:56.700
I'd really like to, sort of,
be able to browse the

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.835
Stratocam by the
highest rated.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.885
So is there a way to browse, you
know, to see whose got the

00:30:04.885 --> 00:30:08.660
most vote with two images,
who got the most votes?

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.250
PAUL RADEMACHER: There is.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.980
Another secret feature.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.760
I need a user guide for this.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.850
I've got a few things.

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:22.432
If you go to Stratocam/top,
you can do that today.

00:30:22.432 --> 00:30:22.910
Yeah.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:25.410
I'll do a better job of putting
links up and say

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:27.950
here's all the different
use of it.

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:31.030
But, yeah, slash top right now
works, and it'll show you the

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.530
most, the most uploaded.

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:40.050
Oh, something we're hoping to
release, myself and my friend,

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:45.430
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], is a
screen-saver, a Mac

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:48.610
screen-saver, which
actually goes to,

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:52.290
pulls from, slash top.

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:54.900
And it's a great, you know, I
show this to people and I say

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.270
this would make an awesome
screen-saver.

00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:00.580
It feels like a screen-saver.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.380
Just a couple of technical
issues to work out.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:02.840
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.260
PAUL RADEMACHER: Like making
sure that when you run the

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:10.310
screen-saver you don't rate
limit yourself on Google Maps.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.850
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:12.100
Right.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.580
Cool.

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:19.250
Anyone else have a question
for Paul?

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:25.870
Cool.

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:29.890
So how are we doing
on time Josh?

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:34.610
OK, so I think what we'll do
now is we'll shift over to

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:36.140
general Maps API questions.

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:39.200
So if anybody has any you
can ask that, or we

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.380
can go to the moderator.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.840
So if you have any, have a
question, or you want to say

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.510
something, raise your hand.

00:31:49.724 --> 00:31:52.300
I can't see if anybody's
raising their hand.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.060
Sorry.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:56.380
Raise your hand if you
have a question.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:56.630
No?

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:57.410
OK.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:00.041
I do want to pull
open the chat.

00:32:00.041 --> 00:32:03.842
So I see if anybody has written
anything in chat.

00:32:03.842 --> 00:32:04.280
OK.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:04.718
No.

00:32:04.718 --> 00:32:05.880
OK, good.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:15.340
So we're going to, go to,
the moderator and

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:16.980
see what we've got.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:20.270
OK, so the first question is,
are you still developing

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:24.250
fusion tables, and will we be
able to use this to port to

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.670
the pop-up info windows?

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:30.760
So, yeah, fusion table's
still a going

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.330
concern here at Google.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.290
It's a beta project.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:36.760
We're still working on it.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.435
It comes out of our Google
Research arm.

00:32:39.435 --> 00:32:41.690
We have an experimental feature
that allows you to put

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:46.990
that on top of a Google,
Google Maps API.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:49.160
I'm not sure what this means.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:54.430
Is that, is Jeremy part of the,
I don't know if Jeremy's

00:32:54.430 --> 00:33:01.070
part of the hangout, but
I don't see him there.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:05.870
But currently, what you can
do, is you can actually

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:09.025
capture the click event that
happens on a fusion table

00:33:09.025 --> 00:33:14.130
layer, and that allows you to,
to get the information that

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:17.490
would otherwise be into the info
window, and then you can

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.570
customize the info
window yourself.

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:23.270
So I hope that answers
your question Jeremy.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:27.550
OK, so the next one is KML.

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:29.925
What is the best way to keep
performance with no clustering

00:33:29.925 --> 00:33:32.620
and almost 100,000 points?

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.670
Try to keep the visual
distribution points while

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:39.580
keeping the ability to click
to get more info?

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:44.500
So, 100,000 points is, is a lot
of points for a KML file.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:51.970
KML, if you're talking about
on top of Google Maps, I'm

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.587
really actually not
sure if this is a

00:33:53.587 --> 00:33:56.280
Maps or Earth question.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.860
If you're talking about on top
of Google Maps, what you

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.800
probably want to do is actually
shift over to using

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:08.010
fusion tables and the fusion
table layer for the moment.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:14.989
Another thing that you can do
is you can do a network link

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:20.199
which will only open up certain,
will only load in

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:26.659
points, when you are to certain
zoom level or you're

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:28.179
close to it.

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:29.880
So you can do what's
called a originated

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:30.920
network link hierarchy.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.280
This works really well
in Google Earth.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.225
So as you zoom in, it loads in
more points [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:34:37.225 --> 00:34:40.790
the relevant areas.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:44.330
This would be a good question
for [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:46.622
figure out what we're doing
all of our tech

00:34:46.622 --> 00:34:50.046
support for KML now.

00:34:50.046 --> 00:34:52.840
Let's go on to the next.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.429
Will this app appear
on Google TV?

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:57.120
So I think this is probably
a question for Paul.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.080
PAUL RADEMACHER: It's
a great idea.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.970
Just like the screen-savers.

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:05.290
MANO MARKS: And it is HTML, so
it's just a web-page so you

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:09.240
can load onto Google TV. It'd be
great to have some sort of

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.320
app that did that, like
a screen-saver.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:11.740
PAUL RADEMACHER: Yeah.

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:12.990
Super fun.

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.150
MANO MARKS: Can you share any
points where balloon mapping

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.100
imagery has been integrated?

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:21.615
What is the submission
process?

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:29.200
So we have integrated
some elements.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:34.050
We recently got imagery from
a group called Public

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:42.630
Laboratory, and we have a lot
of the public domain imagery

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:45.450
from Public Laboratory
is in Google Earth.

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:49.290
At this point I believe what
we do is we put it into our

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:52.020
historical imagery, rather
than have it integrated

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:56.380
directly with the top-level
imagery.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:05.400
So, I don't know if, I think we
have some in New York City.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:11.550
Is that, I, I'm not sure
where that is.

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:17.640
We actually have some in New
Orleans, and I believe we

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.670
actually did a blog post on this
recently that had a KML

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:22.010
file you could download.

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:26.050
So if you go to the Google long
blog you can check out

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:30.160
that, that site, and see, I
think there's also a KML file

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.370
that can be uploaded
from there.

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:33.730
PAUL RADEMACHER: And Google
Earth also has kite imagery.

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:34.300
MANO MARKS: Yes.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:34.550
Yeah.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:36.750
We also have, we also have
kite imagery in a

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:38.590
few places as well.

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:42.290
So, yeah, this, this really
interesting thing, just for

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:44.980
those who are wondering, Public
Laboratory and many

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:52.030
others, are experimenting with
basically point and click

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:57.478
cameras that you just
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:57.478 --> 00:37:00.800
the button and send it up in the
air and it takes a bunch

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.870
of imagery.

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:04.100
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:08.560
for an hour, and it takes
a whole bunch.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.590
And you get some, you get some
really interesting, beautiful

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:13.310
and very close up imagery.

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:17.040
So you can get, you can get
something that is pretty high

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.620
resolution compared to what you
can get from satellite.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:21.450
ERIC: Am I still muted?

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:23.860
Or am I connected
with you guys?

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.445
MANO MARKS: You're, Eric
is, you're still in.

00:37:26.445 --> 00:37:27.550
ERIC: Oh, OK, cool.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:31.080
A little further to that
question, can I cut in there?

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.400
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.210
ERIC: Kind of the reason I was
interested in the balloon

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:36.780
mapping was--

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:37.700
MANO MARKS: Oh, that was you.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:38.030
ERIC: Yeah.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.730
Yeah.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:41.430
I'm Eric.

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:46.500
Was on the University of Montana
campus we have old

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.840
imagery, or old satellite
images, which don't include

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.620
some of the current
built buildings.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:58.060
And one of the criticisms that
I was getting from my

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:04.860
supervisor was that the Google
Maps API and approach wasn't

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:09.520
good enough because it didn't
keep pace with the development

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.040
of the campus.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.080
So that was kind of a little bit
of my, I participated in

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.700
that Public Laboratory
kick-starter, and bought a

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.420
balloon thing with my own;
money, and I was going to try

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:25.660
to make my own updated satellite
images and submit

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:28.440
them, and then be able, once
those were, and the problem

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.830
with the old satellite images
is that I couldn't put the

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:39.510
footprints in the mapmaker and
update the sidewalk lines

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.420
because it was still
the old images.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:47.870
So I ran up against this
continued criticism that

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:50.360
Google Maps couldn't
keep pace.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:56.040
And the Achilles heel was the
old satellite images.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.400
MANO MARKS: So that's really
good feedback for us and we do

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.770
have an imagery submission
process.

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:06.415
You can actually, if you search
it, you can find--

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.070
or is that donating imagery?

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:17.250
Giving imagery to Google for,
for Maps you can get that and

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.690
then we can make it as
part of our regular.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:20.000
ERIC: OK.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.850
And then, and then with that
note, with that note then it

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:27.140
would be hopefully be pushed
into the Google Maps instead

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:31.960
of just a historic layer
in the earth.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.600
MANO MARKS: Yeah, I mean, it
would depend on the imagery

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.440
and the quality of imagery.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.970
I'm not on imagery
team myself.

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:37.960
ERIC: OK.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.130
MANO MARKS: Yeah, so
search for that.

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:45.340
Or you can ping me on Google+
and we'll figure out how to

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.280
how to get you're imagery.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.090
ERIC: OK.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:48.340
Great.

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:50.490
MANO MARKS: All right.

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:52.540
So I think those are all the
questions from the moderator.

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.185
Are there any more
from the hangout?

00:39:56.775 --> 00:39:57.705
No?

00:39:57.705 --> 00:39:58.635
OK.

00:39:58.635 --> 00:40:01.425
Any last words Paul?

00:40:01.425 --> 00:40:02.310
PAUL RADEMACHER: None from me.

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:04.300
MANO MARKS: OK.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.480
PAUL RADEMACHER: Just
thanks everybody.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:05.800
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.500
Thanks everybody.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.750
Thanks for coming.
