00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.750
NOAH FALSTEIN: OK.

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.550
Hello, everybody.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.290
Welcome to I/O 2016.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.480
Did people enjoy the keynote?

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.030
Yeah?

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.990
All right.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.310
A lot of great stuff
there, and hopefully we'll

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.750
be segueing into
interesting ways

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.940
to use some of what you saw.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.009
We're going to be using the
Spaces app to collect comments

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:19.800
and questions so that
we can do that online

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.380
and save a little
time, so we don't

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.330
have to do the Q&amp;A here live.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.510
So if you haven't already
gotten an update about that,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.230
please look it up.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.220
It should be connected to
your I/O app, I believe.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.520
And I think there are supposed
to be some signs describing

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.270
how to use it.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.850
But let's just move on.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.880
I'm Noah Falstein.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.910
I'm Chief Game Designer
here at Google.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.730
We've got a lot of great
software, hardware, services

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.000
that are really great
for game developers

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.980
that we're going to be
showing you this year.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.410
And this is a great
place to start.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.684
We wanted to have an
orientation early at I/O

00:00:54.684 --> 00:00:57.100
so that we could point you to
some of the other cool talks

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.260
and also tell you about
some of the cool stuff--

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.832
as well as make some of
our own announcements here.

00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:03.540
So I'm going to be
starting, and then I'm

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.420
going to pass it on to
Ben Frenkel here, who's

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.900
lead PM for our Google
Play Game Services.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.240
And we're going to finish
up with Ina Fuchs, who

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.150
is with YouTube
Gaming, and they'll

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.390
talk to you a little bit about
each of their own specialties.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.460
But first, I'm just
curious-- how many of you

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.340
are here at I/O
for the first time?

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.840
OK.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.940
Quite a few.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.920
Actually, I think this
is the first I/O where

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.890
we have a majority
of returning people,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.140
but it looks like we got
a lot of new faces here.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.440
And how many people here
are actively involved

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.610
in the games industry,
one way or another?

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.370
OK, pretty much what I expected.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.260
So a lot of great stuff for you.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.400
And before I jump into
some of the new stuff,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.120
let me put it into
perspective a bit.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.420
This is actually a computer game
I wrote 40 years ago this year.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.900
The code's on the left, and the
actual game input and output

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.060
is on the right.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.350
At that point, when we
were doing computer games,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.400
we basically had sort of
glorified electric typewriters,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.960
and that was our
input and output.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.810
On this particular game, you
had a list of numerical commands

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.570
you would type in.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.020
Just a year or two
after that came out,

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.400
I saw my first
video screen and got

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.601
to code with something
that actually controlled

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:15.600
the video on the screen.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.250
And it was a revelation for me.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.390
And of course, right around that
time, as video and computers

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.980
were coming together, it made
some of the first video games

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.040
possible.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.640
And those kinds of
combinations, we've

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.098
actually become
kind of used to it.

00:02:27.098 --> 00:02:29.280
But every few years there's
some new dramatic mix

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.670
of new technologies
that can come together

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.970
in these great ways.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.824
For example, we had CD-ROMs
and a higher color resolution

00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:38.490
that enabled the kind
of modern graphics

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.760
that we're used to now.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.000
Or modems and
server-based architecture

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.790
that made MMOs and a lot of
the online games possible.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.810
And more recently,
we have smartphones

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.810
that are putting those
games right in our pocket

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.934
and connecting us with
everybody else in the world.

00:02:51.934 --> 00:02:54.552
And those are just
a few examples.

00:02:54.552 --> 00:02:56.760
The games industry now is
bigger than it's ever been.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.970
This is a picture of the GDC up
in San Francisco from a Google

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.680
session there this year.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.615
We had more people there,
I think, than even fit

00:03:07.615 --> 00:03:08.240
into this room.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.010
But right in this
room alone, we've

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.927
got almost double
the amount of people

00:03:11.927 --> 00:03:13.510
that were at the
first Game Developers

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.440
Conference I went to, the entire
conference, back 30 years ago.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.660
The games industry has grown
200-fold since then-- sorry,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.080
the GDC has grown 200-fold since
then-- and with good reason.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.980
Because there are all these
wonderful new technologies--

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.670
platforms beyond just the kind
of computers and the dedicated

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.760
consoles that we're
used to, but of course,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.340
we've seen browser-based social
gaming, downloadable games,

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.820
a lot of indie games coming
that way, and of course,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.600
mobile games of all types.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.030
In the last couple
of years, we've

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.760
now started to look at
virtual reality and wearables.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.260
So it's given us all sorts
of wonderful opportunities.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.710
And here at Google, we
make all sorts of hardware,

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.510
software, and
services that help you

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.780
develop games, grow
your audiences,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.280
and earn some profits.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.680
So today, as we're talking
about some of those things,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.400
and in the next few days as
you hear from our other groups,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.160
I hope you think
about the advantages

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.640
that you get when you combine
some of those services

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.880
together to explore new areas--
just as those examples I

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.390
mentioned, in the past, of
new things coming together

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.750
like that-- to see
what kind of new games,

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.390
or even new entire types of
games, that you can create.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.350
And the practical reasons for
the experimenting with this--

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.510
there are a lot of
payoffs for you.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.660
It's really, I think, like going
through a secluded mountain

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.600
pass.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.570
Maybe there'll be a dead
end on the other side.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.770
Maybe it'll open up
into a fertile valley.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.700
Maybe there's an entire new
continent of possibility.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.880
The smartphone games,
when they came out,

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.120
are a whole new continent.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.410
It's just amazing how
big that's gotten.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.130
And I think that we have some
really great possibilities

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.519
coming up in those areas too.

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:49.060
One of the reasons
for doing that is,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.470
if you combine some new exciting
thing, like virtual reality,

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.600
with something as big as the
billion-plus Android smartphone

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.600
users, and make a
game that works well

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.600
in both of those
fields, then you've

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.840
got something that has
the appeal and the press

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.480
attention of virtual
reality, but the huge market

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.340
of the existing
smartphones out there.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.210
And it's not easy to
do that sort of thing,

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.850
but it's certainly
possible, and the payoff

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.030
is really worthwhile.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.397
So that's just using some
existing technologies.

00:05:17.397 --> 00:05:19.480
Let's consider some of the
new ones that are being

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.074
shown in the next few days.

00:05:21.074 --> 00:05:23.240
There's a lot for you to
see in these next few days,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.140
so I've made a couple
of slides here.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.004
And this doesn't
include all of the talks

00:05:27.004 --> 00:05:29.170
that I think will be of
interest to game developers,

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.040
but I tried to cull
some of the ones

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.250
that I think you'd
find interesting.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.040
This first page is
some of the upcoming

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.680
talks about virtual reality, and
our Project Tango devices that

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.100
are quite exciting.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.010
It's not an exhaustive list, and
some sessions may move around

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.460
at the last minute, so please
check your apps and the signs

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.210
to make sure that everything's
in the right time and place.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.080
And there's a lot going on
with the game development

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.140
and distribution side
of things as well.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.740
Firebase is something
you should look

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.260
into-- it's a great
way to leverage

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.360
the Google advantage that
combines our back-end services

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.450
seamlessly in your game.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.090
And then tomorrow
and Friday, there's

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.810
some more interesting talks.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.720
You might want to look into
things like our Android N

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.590
discussions, or some of the
Firebase fundamentals, or AdMob

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.560
and how you could use that
to monetize your games.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.730
But let me make a few
specific announcements

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.330
that you may be hearing about
in some other places as well.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.050
First, I'm really
happy to be able to be

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.600
making the first announcement
of the Donation API.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.900
In the words of the developers,
what if gamers everywhere

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.940
could save the real world,
right from within your app,

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.840
powered by Google?

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.450
This is the Donation API.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.616
It's made for gamers
and generosity.

00:06:44.616 --> 00:06:45.990
And it uses
everything that we've

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.140
learned that users
like when they donate.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.210
It's got in-app donations,
automatic payment

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.620
processing and billing.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.220
There are no fees and no spam.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.940
And it has the ability
for you, the developer,

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.220
to search and support
any US-based nonprofit.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.100
It's brought to you by the same
group, the Social Good group,

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.370
that has powered donations
for Google.org and the refugee

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.350
crisis.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.310
And the newly launched donation
cards on YouTube-- and I've

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.640
got some cards
describing this that I'll

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.240
put out and back later for
people to take as they leave.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.280
Very exciting stuff.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.320
I'm really happy to be
part of a company that's

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.160
thinking not only of
entertaining people

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.210
but helping them
at the same time.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.050
Next, let me suggest
that you check out

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.370
our App Ads for Games.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.220
Making games fun is really
essential to success,

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.040
and so is identifying
which customers

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.470
are best for your game.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.200
So take a look at
App Ads for Games

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.740
to see how you can use powerful
signals from Search, YouTube,

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.340
and the Play Store to find the
best players for your games.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.170
And then finally,
earlier this year, we

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.210
announced our app
streaming service,

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.712
and that will be described
on Stage 6 later today.

00:07:51.712 --> 00:07:53.920
This is somewhat different
than the instant apps that

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.774
were announced at the keynote.

00:07:55.774 --> 00:07:57.440
They have similar
functions, but they're

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.731
used for different things,
and the app streaming people

00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:01.820
are great for letting
people try out games

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.420
by streaming them online without
actually having to download

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.430
the app onto your device.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.230
It works pretty much like
videos are streamed on YouTube.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:11.884
And it lets a
player try your game

00:08:11.884 --> 00:08:14.050
without having to first
download it, which obviously

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.390
can be a big advantage to
getting them up and running

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.700
quickly.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.900
OK, so let's think about
how some of those advantages

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.820
can boost your games and
bring them to the next level.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.600
So here, while you're at I/O,
you'll be learning about some

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.464
of the other tools we have
available to developers.

00:08:29.464 --> 00:08:30.880
And I'm urging you
to really think

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.210
about how you'd combine
them, because as I've

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.909
been saying, if you bring
them together in new ways,

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.740
it can really help you launch
new creative adventures that

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.140
draw on a really diverse
palette and increase

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.590
your chances to both get
noticed and reach new heights.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.890
So let me give you a
few thought experiments

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.370
to show you the kinds of
things I mean, to get started.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.337
What if you had a game about
exploring the universe that

00:08:53.337 --> 00:08:55.670
was played by thousands who
were in a single [? shard ?]

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:56.580
together?

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.550
You'd want to have
complex calculations,

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.990
and that could be done
with Google Cloud Platform.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.100
But the players could
view it on their phones

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.520
or use our Cast Services
that you can find out

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.900
about here, to Cast it
on through their TVs,

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.110
so that they can actually
see their televisions

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.190
with a starscape and pick
out their next destination

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.960
that way.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.940
Or you might have
heard-- I'm curious

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.510
how many people have seen
our Chrome experiment game,

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.830
Lightsaber Escape?

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.040
OK, a fair number of you.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.760
Great.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.470
I thought that was a
really exciting way

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.220
of showing the advantage
of combining what

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.000
we can do with Chrome with
what you can do with your phone

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.300
to control a lightsaber
on the screen.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.710
But it uses, as most
phones do, three degrees

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.400
of freedom in orientation.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.740
Imagine using one of our
Project Tango devices,

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.410
or one of the new
phones that Lenovo

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.070
will be making later this
year, so that as you're

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.450
using your lightsaber
to deflect bolts,

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.450
it's not just seeing
which orientation it's in,

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.740
but you can move it side
to side, up and down,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.210
and much like they
do in the movies,

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:59.560
send those blaster bolts
back at the Stormtroopers.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.450
I think that might open
up a whole new type

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.760
of action-adventure game, where
you're controlling what you're

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.270
seeing on your computer
screen with your phone,

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.210
so that can be a great
interface for you.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.290
And finally, I'll
suggest TensorFlow, which

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.910
has been getting a lot of news.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.720
And consider how that
open-source machine-learning

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.820
tool might be used in
conjunction with something

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.640
like Google Earth to create
a new kind of game that

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.410
fused alternate-reality gaming
with massively multiplayer

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.660
games.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.180
Imagine, for example, that you
have a world-spanning game that

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.670
has procedurally generated
objectives all across Google

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.930
Earth, so that TensorFlow
and machine learning

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.050
can help learn each
player's preferences

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.990
and make objectives that are
local to where they are and yet

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.540
fit into the kind
of world information

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.890
that you can pull in
with our services.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.060
So those are just
a few suggestions.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.990
As you listen to
Ben and Ina next,

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.450
and as you go out for the
next two and a half days

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.819
and hear about the
other game talks,

00:10:57.819 --> 00:10:59.610
I'd like you to consider
how you might want

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.082
to use some of those services.

00:11:01.082 --> 00:11:02.790
Any of the ones that
have been mentioned,

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.100
or new ones that we may not
have even thought of that

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.540
can be used by gamers--
that's happening all the time.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.190
Go out there, create some
groundbreaking new games,

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.740
or supercharge your
existing games.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.010
And speaking of
supercharging, I'm

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.070
going to turn it over now to Ben
Frenkel, PM of our Google Play

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.030
Game Services group,
to tell you more

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.780
about that
multi-powered service.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:23.522
Thank you.

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:29.920
BEN FRENKEL: Thank you,
Noah, for the intro.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.420
Hi.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.510
I'm Ben Frenkel.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.500
I'm a Product Manager
on the Play Games team.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.700
And our mission is
to provide developers

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:42.270
the tools and services they
need to create great games--

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.040
and make money while
they're doing it too.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.360
Very important component.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.520
And we launched Play Game
Services three years ago

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.640
at this event, at I/O, and we
launched with just the basics.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.050
We had achievements,
we had leaderboards,

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:02.000
we had a multiplayer stack,
we had a Cloud Save solution.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.520
And since then, we've become
the fastest-growing game network

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.370
ever.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:11.030
Today, hundreds of
millions of users sign

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.670
in to Play Game
Services every month,

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:19.150
and 50% at the top 500 games
on Play are integrated.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.180
But since then, since
the initial launch

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.870
and over the years,
the needs of developers

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.980
have substantially evolved.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.240
And we've had to
evolve along with them.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.990
And Play Game
Services has expanded

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.400
to include advanced features,
like video recording,

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.000
live operations, and a healthy
dose of predictive analytics.

00:12:43.792 --> 00:12:45.740
And slide-- there we go.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:50.440
So before I go into the specific
features and case studies

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.964
that I want to
talk about today, I

00:12:51.964 --> 00:12:54.380
thought it would be useful to
take a step back and provide

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.320
some context for
what we're trying

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.220
to do through the lens of
the game development process.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.090
So to start up on
the left here--

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:05.400
and I can barely see things
because of the awkward angle

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.170
here-- but starting
off on the left,

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.790
a typical game will
start off with something

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.540
like a brainstorming session.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.060
I've heard a lot
of game developers

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.340
have a game jam, where people
vote on whatever concept

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.850
they think is the best.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.650
For some, maybe,
it's a eureka moment

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.710
they have in the
bathtub-- though

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:30.150
for me, personally, I
prefer mine in the shower.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:34.230
And once you've locked
in on an amazing idea,

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.830
it's time to take it one step
further with a prototype.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.930
And after you've exhausted
your most expedient testing

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:45.660
options, like your coworkers,
your friends, your family,

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.000
maybe a distant
cousin somewhere,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.690
you need to expand your audience
by launching a beta program,

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.630
or soft-launching your game.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.050
And after iterating
awhile, and you're

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:00.390
confident your game is awesome,
it has a chance to monetize,

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.090
well, you're ready
to launch and promote

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.260
your game to the public.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.750
Hooray, right?

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.190
But these days,
launching your game

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:15.580
is just the start of the
journey for a game developer.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.110
You need to continue to
invest in acquiring new users,

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.720
and you have to
retain those users

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.270
by keeping your
community engaged,

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.850
tailoring and tuning your
content to different player

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.800
segments, and
running live events.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.030
Those are all very
important components.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.410
But today I'm going to
focus on just three things

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:39.110
that Play, and Play combined
with other Google products,

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.690
are doing to drive game
developers' success.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.210
First, we're going
to talk about how

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:48.080
we can help you find the right
users at each stage of the game

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.120
development process.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.080
Then we'll cover how we can help
you tailor and tune your game

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.340
to different player segments.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.460
And lastly, we'll talk
about how we can help you

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.080
harness the creativity
and enthusiasm

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.730
of your gaming community to
to deepen player engagement.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.030
So let's start off
with how Play can

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.510
help you find the right users.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.800
This is a very important part
for everybody's business.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.300
So at this year's I/O, we're
introducing the Early Access

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.280
section to the Play Store.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.430
And as I mentioned
earlier, once you've

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.770
built your initial prototype
and have iterated a bit,

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.710
it's important to get feedback
from the largest audience

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.600
possible before you
launch your game publicly.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.450
And that's what the Early
Access section is for.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.240
Early Access will
feature exciting games

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.080
that are still in development,
so that early adopters

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:48.040
and influencers are able to
discover and try out your game.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.810
And importantly, it also
gives them an opportunity

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.160
to give you private feedback.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.970
This is the perfect way to
experiment and fine-tune

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:01.030
your game before it's finally
released to everybody.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.180
So when you're finally
ready to launch,

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.030
you'll need to promote
your game and find a way

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.520
to drive installs.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.400
And for those of you who
are indie developers,

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.900
you'll be excited
to hear that we've

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.650
added a new way to highlight
you and your games in the Indie

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.650
Corner collection
on the Play Store

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.610
that we launched earlier
this year at GDC.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:24.260
The Indie Corner is
dedicated to highlighting

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.450
truly amazing and unique
games that users love.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:29.180
And here's how
the program works.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.860
So first, you have
to make a great game.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.609
It all starts there.

00:16:34.609 --> 00:16:36.150
And then you need
to submit your game

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:40.170
to participate in the Indie
Corner program at this URL

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:44.730
that you can see on the
left-hand side of the screen

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.660
there-- I guess
your right, sorry.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.610
Your right-hand side.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:51.840
And it's
g.co/indiecornersubmission.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.980
And from there, a
panel selects games

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.360
for featuring in the
Indie Corner collection.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.310
It's simple.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:04.970
However, there's more to
the Indie Corner program

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.550
than just the featuring, though
that's obviously a big benefit.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:13.800
It also serves as a way for
us to have the opportunity

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.700
to help indie developers
understand and improve

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.380
their game performance.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.450
And I'll walk you
through an example

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.650
of something we did with a
partner of ours, Springloaded.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.940
So when we started
working with Springloaded,

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:32.380
they had just soft-launched
their game, Last Vikings.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:36.950
And they gave us an early build,
and we tested it extensively,

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.710
and we wrote up a detailed
analysis of some things they

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:41.880
could do to improve the
game, how they could best

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.000
integrate Play Game
Services, and some

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.650
tweaks they could make
to improve monetization

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.030
and retention.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:54.930
Then Springloaded
implemented every single one

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.707
of our recommendations.

00:17:56.707 --> 00:17:59.290
It was extremely impressive to
see it all come together really

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:03.480
nicely, and the results for
them have been phenomenal.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.300
So after they made a few tweaks
here and there to their game,

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:12.390
they were able to double
average revenue per paying user

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.780
and make huge
improvements to retention.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.910
They in fact doubled
their day seven retention

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.040
on the back of the work
that we did with them.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.030
And in James
Bernard's own words,

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.940
the Indie Corner program
has been invaluable to us

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.490
in helping us believe
that as a small indie

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:34.530
we can actually
make it on our own.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.690
It has been a transformative
experience for them.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.560
And hopefully you'll
all be excited to hear,

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.400
tomorrow the Indie
Corner collection

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.080
will be live on the store.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.550
So don't forget
to check that out.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:52.390
So let's say you've-- assume
for a moment that you found

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:53.570
the right users.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.320
Now you'll want to keep them
coming back to your game

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:02.800
by turning it into an ongoing
service you deliver to players.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.660
A very important
piece of that is

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.920
being able to dynamically tailor
content to different player

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.220
segments.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:12.090
And in this case
study, what we'll cover

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:16.110
is how a developer has
combined the player stats

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:20.680
API with AdMob's
rewarded ads to increase

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:27.172
ad revenue while not negatively
impacting in-app purchases.

00:19:27.172 --> 00:19:29.380
Because that was the goal--
the original stated goal,

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.600
and they were able to
successfully do that.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.200
So let me go through
the story here.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.680
So developer Invent
Venture integrated

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.310
spend prediction into their
game "Galactic Empire."

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.200
It's a great game.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.930
They used the spend prediction
to determine whether or not

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.740
to show AdMob rewarded ads.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.380
And here's how it
works for them.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.120
If a player is
predicted to spend,

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.030
they don't show the
rewarded ad option.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:58.520
If a player is predicted
to spend-- to not spend,

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.880
sorry, they will
see rewarded ads.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.830
And they implemented
this about a month ago.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.620
And in the short
time since then,

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.290
they've been able to
increase ads revenue by 10%

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:14.110
without any negative
impact on in-app purchases.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:17.440
In fact, they've seen a
slight increase in them.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.380
And it's a great case study.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.170
And every developer,
large or small,

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:27.590
can go out today and combine
the player stats API and AdMob

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:32.610
in this way to improve
the success of their game.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.910
And since we launched the
player stats API last year,

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.480
we've continued to
invest in new predictions

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.350
to make the API
even more powerful.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.480
And we're excited to
announce the launch

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.650
of two new predictions
in the coming weeks.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.860
The first is a prediction
of how much someone

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.220
is likely to spend
in the next 28 days,

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.220
and the second is a
prediction of whether or not

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.830
someone is likely to
become a high spender.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.780
And we couldn't be more
excited to see what

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.660
creative things
you'll end up doing

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.570
with these new predictions.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:06.680
So let's turn our attention
to how Google and Play can

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.100
help you harness the
energy and creativity

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:14.730
of your gaming community to
deepen player engagement.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.940
And so, one thing that
we've recently launched

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.610
is Play Games gamer
IDs and avatars.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.370
And these are a great
way for your players

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:28.300
to create their own gaming
persona and express themselves.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.040
I mean, most of
the people I know

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.390
don't really want to play
games as their real identity.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.810
I don't want to be known as Ben
Frankel in all the potentially

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.410
strange games that I play.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:44.160
And in fact, I have--
I've used the same ID.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.560
My secret nerd
name Caldorf here,

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.270
which you can see on the screen,
since I created my Battle.net

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:56.340
account to play StarCraft a
really, really long time ago.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.910
I was no longer Ben
Frankel, computer science TA

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:01.960
and college student.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.520
I was the zerg-slaying
Caldorf the Conqueror.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.170
And it was very satisfying
to carry that persona to all

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:11.660
of my games going forward.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.090
And with gamer IDs, which we
launched earlier in the year,

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:19.840
I can in fact take this persona
with me to every game I play.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.670
And as developers, you can
actually tap into this as well.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:28.060
You can find out what a gamer
ID is when somebody signs in.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.090
So if you have a game where you
have your equivalent of a gamer

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:34.260
ID or a gamer tag, you can
pre-populate that field

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.670
with the ID that I've chosen.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:41.990
And that should speed up the
flow of people into your game.

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.360
So now I want to talk about
how the video recording

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.590
API and YouTube can
help developers amplify

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.030
their community's impact.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.270
So for a bit of
background, late last year

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.970
we made it possible for users
to record their gameplay

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.850
with the Google Play Games app.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.290
And after an extended
Early Access program,

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:04.280
today we are excited to announce
that in the coming weeks

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.490
the video recording API will
be available to all developers,

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.810
so that players can bring up
this video recording experience

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.570
directly from your games.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:16.560
In addition, players
will also soon

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:21.450
have the option to Livestream
their gameplay to YouTube.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.270
So we've seen a lot of
excitement for video recording

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.110
from the smallest developers,
all to the very largest

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.420
we have on the platform.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.120
And more than a dozen games
during the EAP program,

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.290
the Early Access program have
already launched an integration

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.670
with the video recording API.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:41.360
And they're on the store today,
so you can go check them out.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.610
But I wanted to walk you through
one particularly powerful,

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:48.360
exemplary integration of
the video recording API.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.650
And flaregames has just
such an integration

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.440
in their game, "Dawn of Steel."

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.280
And here is how it works.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.500
So before you launch a raid and
invade another base and blow

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:04.580
things up, you come to
this screen on your left.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.960
So there we go.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.305
And on this screen you
can see that red button

00:24:10.305 --> 00:24:12.410
that has launch right
in the middle of it.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.490
And you click that button,
you launch the raid,

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:15.940
and fun ensues.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.530
Just to the left of that
red button is a camera icon.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:20.310
And if you click
that camera icon,

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.380
it brings up the video
recording overlay.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.660
And then from that overlay,
you have all the controls

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:30.050
you need to mute your mic,
turn off and on the forward

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:33.500
facing camera, as well
as of course start

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.170
and stop the video recording.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:39.220
Once a recording is complete,
you can edit the video

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.410
and upload it
directly to YouTube.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:46.740
And you can see here on your
right, in this screenshot here,

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.000
that I have clipped this video a
little bit in the editing mode.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.760
And you can also see that
we've helpfully pre-populated

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.230
the title, as well
as the description,

00:24:56.230 --> 00:25:01.000
so that players can share
their replays faster.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.240
In the words of
flaregames' Jon Howard,

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.430
"The video recording API
helped activate our community

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:09.950
by enabling players to
create a let's play style

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:13.420
video in a matter of minutes
with minimal effort."

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.530
And it's not just
minimal for the players.

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:18.115
It's actually a very
easy integration to do.

00:25:18.115 --> 00:25:19.740
And many of the
developers we talked to

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.265
said it's taken
about a day to do it,

00:25:22.265 --> 00:25:25.340
so that's a big
ROI for you guys.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.630
But what particularly excited
me was how "Dawn of Steel"

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.960
incorporated the
video recording API

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:35.510
as a foundational element
of their global replay

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:36.650
competition.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:39.240
And in the view of the
folks at flaregames,

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.970
the replay share function
was the perfect tool

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.700
to kick off the
global competition

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.130
and let the community
show off their skills.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:51.470
That is exactly the intent
behind the video recording API,

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:54.480
and what we wanted
developers to do with it

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.560
to create these kind
of amazing experiences

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.580
where people can show
off their skills.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:02.250
They also did a
really, really good job

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:05.150
of incorporating YouTube
celebrity platform

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:09.920
into their marketing
campaign for the competition.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.230
And here's how it worked.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.740
To kick off the
competition, they

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.100
worked with YouTube
celebrity MasterOv

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:18.510
to create a video tutorial and
how to use the video recording

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.410
feature.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.780
It's a really
impressive video, and I

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.720
thought I would take the
opportunity to show it to you,

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.870
so cue awesome video and audio.

00:26:36.132 --> 00:26:37.340
MASTEROV: What's up everyone?

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.440
MasterOv here with an
awesome free-to-play

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.660
mobile game, "Dawn of Steel."

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.210
With the game's replay feature,
you can save your battles

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:45.740
and share them with others.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.280
To do so, simply toggle
the record button

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.680
and hit play before
battle commences.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.000
When you've destroyed an
enemy base with your squad,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.130
stop the recording,
check out your raid,

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.390
and share your videos with
the world, easy as that.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:05.800
BEN FRENKEL: It makes me want to
record video replay right now,

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.790
but I'll wait.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:12.260
So it was a really great
video, high production value,

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.520
and I think a very effective
way of driving awareness

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.620
about the competition.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.030
And to further amplify this
corresponding marketing

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:22.110
campaign, they had MasterOv
announce the competition

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.340
on his MasterOv
gaming channel, which

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:27.670
has millions of subscribers
and is a great way

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:29.520
to drive awareness
about the game.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.230
And to cap it off, when
the competition ended,

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:33.700
MasterOv then
announced the winner

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.480
and showed the winning
replay on his channel.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.840
This is exactly the type of
coordinated marketing campaign

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.560
supported by video replays that
every game developer should

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.750
aspire to.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.640
And I was blown
away when I heard

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.910
about what they were doing.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:59.760
And next-- cue
next slide please.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.830
There we go.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:04.670
So to recap, Play
Games-- whoa, OK.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:06.250
Now we're too far.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:09.470
And we also-- you're
ruining the slides!

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:12.200
Back.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.940
No, no, no, wrong way,
wrong way, wrong way.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:23.970
I think you want to go to slide
38, just the-- or slide 28.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.870
Bear with us for a moment here.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.637
We are experiencing
technical difficulties.

00:28:28.637 --> 00:28:30.970
And you can also see all the
things I'm saying on there.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:31.845
That's super helpful.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:40.460
So to recap, Play Games
and other Google services

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.500
can be combined in
powerful ways to help

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:47.310
you find the right users,
tailor and tune game experiences

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.050
to different player segments,
and harness the energy

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:52.790
and creativity of
your gaming community

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.330
to deepen player engagement.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:57.690
And now I'll hand
it off to Ina, who

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.910
you've seen some sneak
preview of her slides

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:02.550
already, to talk
about YouTube Gaming

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.590
and how the YouTube
platform has been used

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.280
to drive developer success.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.136
Thank you.

00:29:07.136 --> 00:29:08.260
KATHARINA FUCHS: Thank you.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:18.630
Hey, my name is Ina and I work
on the YouTube gaming team

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.750
as a partnerships manager.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:26.620
So that means I manage or look
after some of our top YouTube

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:30.570
Gaming creators, like
MasterOv, and gaming publishers

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:31.960
across Europe.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:37.540
And today, I'm here to tell you
about the amazing, innovative,

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:42.160
creative, and powerful community
that we have on YouTube Gaming,

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.450
and how you, as a developer,
can play an active part in it.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.040
But to truly understand
the phenomenon

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:55.200
of gaming on YouTube, I want
to share a personal story.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.970
So spoiler, this is
me and my brother

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:00.780
when we were little kids.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.280
And I guess the
socks and the sandals

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:07.960
show that I was born and
raised in Germany, though.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.980
Thanks mom and dad.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.450
Anyhow, my older brother
and I would actually

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:18.230
spend hours and hours of playing
"Monkey Island" together,

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.330
which is why for me today
it's even a greater honor

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:23.650
to be speaking
here as Noah is one

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:26.470
of the co-developers
of my childhood games.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:31.740
So in YouTube terms, I'm
fangirling a little bit here.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.950
We'll take a selfie later.

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:38.470
So back then, it was usually
me watching my brother play,

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:41.780
and I was throwing in
comments here and there.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.330
He wouldn't really pass
on the controller ever.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:47.610
But also, to me he was just
the greatest "Monkey Island"

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:52.390
player in the world, and
also the only one I knew.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:55.200
But I was just being
greatly entertained.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.730
And I kept coming
back into his room

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:01.640
to watch more and more of
his gameplay on the few games

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.010
that he had bought
with his pocket money.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.880
So we were, if you
think about it,

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:11.380
our own little gaming community,
even though quite isolated.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:15.430
Now, also on the game
development side,

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.300
the industry back then
was quite isolated.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.610
So developers and
publishers often

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.710
had no clue what was
going to happen the day

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:25.570
of the release of their game.

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:28.940
And players wouldn't
really know what

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.220
they were going to
see until they really

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:34.580
bought the game, unless they had
maybe read something about it

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:38.490
in a game specific magazine or
heard about it from friends,

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:41.330
but that was pretty much it.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:45.880
Now the future of gaming as
I had imagined it back then,

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:50.190
where I could just watch
any game I could think of,

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:51.936
is already happening today.

00:31:51.936 --> 00:31:54.530
And funnily enough,
I find myself

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:57.070
working at the very core of it.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:01.050
With YouTube, we are surfacing
all of these little gaming

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:05.210
communities and bring them
together without limitations.

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:09.460
So you see, while it was really
great watching my brother play,

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.390
I could have never imagine
a world where I could just

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:15.140
choose between different
types of personalities

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.820
to be entertained
by and seamlessly

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:21.250
switch between games, and
even get recommendations

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:24.760
to discover new games
based on my preferences.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.160
And anyone can do all of
that today on YouTube.

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:35.380
YouTube has really reshaped
the video game landscape

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.140
over the past decade.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.110
And to fully
understand how, it's

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.980
important to look at
the incredible amount

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.490
of innovative and
creative talent

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:47.630
that we have on the
platform, who are often

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:51.840
at the tip of the spear when it
comes to creating new formats,

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.670
inspiring trends,
and establishing

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:57.070
audience-building strategies.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:01.450
Creativity has gone way
beyond just gameplay.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:04.620
So today on YouTube,
you can find everything

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.570
from the most engaging and
entertaining let's play video

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:12.530
to 360 degrees
animations of games,

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:15.330
to acapella songs of
your favorite game

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:20.270
soundtrack to animated
series, to even baking

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:24.480
videos of your favorite
game character as a muffin.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.340
So people find themselves
more interested and curious

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.230
about gaming content
than ever before.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:36.950
And the community is constantly
diversifying, in which gamers

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:39.460
are not only players anymore.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.840
And every month, people
watch billions of hours

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.550
of gaming content on YouTube.

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:50.360
So gaming on YouTube has grown
so strongly that last year

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.950
in the summer we
took a step further

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:56.720
and we launched YouTube
Gaming, providing a dedicated

00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:02.100
home for users to get connected
to the games, players,

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:06.720
and culture that matter to
them with videos, Livestreams,

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.889
and actually the biggest
community of gamers on the web,

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:12.960
all in one place.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.320
So if you haven't seen
the YouTube Gaming app,

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.380
I highly encourage you to
download it to your phone.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.989
Or if you are on
desktop, you can access

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:22.280
by visiting Gaming.YouTube.com.

00:34:26.176 --> 00:34:29.929
Now gaming videos have
gained a lot of traction

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:32.429
over the past decade,
to the point where

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:35.000
YouTubers and their
videos are playing

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.750
a crucial role in the economics
of the gaming industry.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:43.969
Creator's videos are one of
the major factors influencing

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:47.630
which games get more
exposure and find success.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.100
So we've seen an incredible
amount of movement

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.420
on the developer
and publisher side.

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:56.370
One example of this is "Surgeon
Simulator," an indie game

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:58.120
by Bossa Studios.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.310
Now this is a story
from back in 2013,

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:04.600
and a thumbnail from
a PewDiePie video.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.510
PewDiePie is actually
our biggest YouTuber

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:09.590
on the platform by subscribers.

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:13.550
He uploads mostly gaming
videos, and to date his channel

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:17.280
has reached more than
44 million subscribers.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.840
And to date, he has reached
more than 12 billion views

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.920
on his videos.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.930
So I reached out to
Felix, PewDiePie,

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:29.080
to get approval to use this
image in my presentation.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:33.280
And his only comment to
it was, oh my god Ina,

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.720
what an ancient image.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.240
So considering three
years as ancient,

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:44.218
you get a sense of how fast
the industry is moving here.

00:35:44.218 --> 00:35:47.930
"Surgeon Simulator" is a game
by Bossa Studios, an indie game

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:49.220
developer in London.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.660
And so, back in 2013
they uploaded this game

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:58.220
to their game jam site without
really having any expectations.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.220
Then Felix, also
known as PewDiePie,

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.500
found the game, loved
it, and he decided

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.400
to make a video about it.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.420
Shortly after he
uploaded the video,

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.190
the game jam site
crashed, because there

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:16.690
was an overload of PewDiePie
fans accessing the site

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:18.230
to download the game.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:21.840
And to make things
worse, other YouTubers

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.890
followed and created videos
about "Surgeon Simulator,"

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:29.620
which really
skyrocketed the game.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:32.040
And to put it in
Bossa Studios' words,

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.790
the traction in the
first week was insane.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.630
This exposure and momentum
has led to "Surgeon Simulator"

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:43.480
becoming the fastest ever
Greenlit game on Steam.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.900
And they now find themselves
with an established IP

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.770
that has sold over 3
million units across five

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:51.250
different platforms.

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:55.380
Way to go for an indie game.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:59.150
And over time, Bossa Studios
has become really involved

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:02.120
with the YouTube
community, to a point where

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:05.630
in a later version of their
game, the alien version,

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:09.000
they named the organs after
some of their biggest YouTube

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.310
supporters.

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:12.600
I know that's very
flattering, but that's

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.780
kind of just the fun of YouTube.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.020
Another great example of how
they work with the YouTube

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.250
community is from their game
"I Am Bread." "I Am Bread" is

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:27.540
a very fun action adventure
simulation game where

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.120
the player is in control
of a slice of bread

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.118
and the ultimate goal is
to get the bread toasted.

00:37:34.118 --> 00:37:37.700
It turns out there was
a bug in the game, which

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:41.310
made the bread float
around in zero gravity.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:44.860
And of course, YouTubers
discovered that bug

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.280
and had a lot of fun with it.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.940
The YouTube community
actually loved that bug

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.960
so much that there were
hundreds of videos produced

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.670
around the floating bread.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:57.540
It really became a thing.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:01.150
So instead of fixing
the bug, Bossa Studios

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:03.860
really heard the community.

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.890
They built the zero
gravity mode into the game

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:09.250
and released it
as a free update.

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:11.830
So today, you can
find many, many fun

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:17.020
let's plays on YouTube
around this space bread.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:17.800
So guess what?

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:21.460
Not only indie game
developers are working

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.380
with the YouTube community.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:27.040
GTA is a very popular
game on YouTube.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.680
YouTubers just love
recording their gameplay,

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:33.540
and it's an amazing game
to develop storytelling.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.930
So Rockstar, the
publisher of GTA,

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:38.610
wanted to further
fuel that creativity

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:42.800
and enable creators to share
more of their experiences

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.940
in an entirely new way.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:51.240
So they integrated the
Rockstar editor into GTA V.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:55.610
It's a feature built within the
game that lets players record,

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:57.770
edit, and ultimately
share highlight

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:01.290
moments from their gameplay
using different camera angles,

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:03.770
filters, audio, and so on.

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:06.440
Players can record
gameplay footage

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:11.150
with only the press of a
single button within the game.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.350
There is even a
director mode where

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:17.190
you can stage your own scenes
and create custom moments.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:21.100
Players can choose from
different story mode

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:21.870
characters.

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:26.430
They can choose location, time,
day, and even the weather.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:29.523
When done editing, they can
export directly to YouTube,

00:39:29.523 --> 00:39:35.170
and we've seen some amazing
results coming through.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:39.210
We see more collaboration
between developers, YouTube

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:42.150
creators, and the
community than ever before,

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:44.190
and it's very exciting.

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:47.150
Going back to
PewDiePie, he recently

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:49.590
released his own
game, "PewDiePie,

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:52.100
Legend of the Brofist,"
in conjunction

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:55.530
with Outerminds, a video
game development company.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:58.010
Now in the process of
developing the game,

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:01.380
he constantly worked with
his fans and his community

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.050
and got their input.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:06.690
He shared sneak peeks of
levels and walkthroughs,

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:08.370
and they could
give their feedback

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:09.930
through YouTube comments.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.750
They also had a say on
which other YouTubers

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:15.460
should be included in
the game as characters.

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:19.700
And the community even voted
on the name of the game.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.860
The feedback from
the community was so

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:25.550
mind blowing that the game
became number one in the app

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:29.260
charts right after launch.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.150
But we also see
developers taking a stab

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:34.750
at becoming content
creators themselves,

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:38.010
and quite successfully so.

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:41.360
Miniclip, for example,
has done a tremendous job

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.920
on their main official
channel, Agar.io.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.700
They are not only
collaborating with YouTubers

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.580
and curating community
content, they also

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:53.370
host regular Livestreams,
bringing in the community

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:55.810
manager and feature
guest players

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:57.780
on the official channel.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.800
So this very inclusive
and very consistent

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:05.580
content strategy has led to
the Miniclip Agar.io channel

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:09.430
reach over 1 million subscribers
within only six months

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:14.050
of launch, which is
quite impressive.

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:17.930
What's great about producing
your own official content

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:21.890
is that you can then link
directly from the YouTube watch

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:26.200
page to your game through
what we call cards.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.450
Cards are clickable
from any device,

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:32.300
and can either link to
your official website,

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:36.040
or in the case of a mobile game
directly to the Google Play

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.690
Store and drive
downloads of the game.

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:44.080
Additionally, the game
pages on YouTube Gaming

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:47.400
automatically pull together
all the great content

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:51.000
that is being produced around
your game into one place.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.270
So that's actually a
great place for you

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:56.490
as a developer to discover all
the creative talent out there

00:41:56.490 --> 00:42:00.510
that's already creating videos
and Livestreams around your IP

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:02.480
and get in touch.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.650
If you've released
a game, I highly

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.620
recommend you to check
out your own game

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.330
page on YouTube Gaming.

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:11.290
And I've also included
a link in our--

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:13.750
into our space for
this session, and Noah

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:18.070
will explain a little bit
about what that is again,

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:21.740
on how you can provide us with
information around your game

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.940
for these pages.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.920
Or you could just Google
provide YouTube with game data

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.260
and you will find that link.

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:35.850
And speaking of more product
innovations, let's talk mobile.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:37.810
Now we've looked
at mobile gaming

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:42.620
and we just see
skyrocketing growth.

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.190
Looking at those numbers,
it was very clear to us

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:48.960
that we not only wanted to
make it an awesome experience

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.710
to watch people play
from a mobile phone,

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:54.260
but also to share your
own mobile gameplay

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.730
and broadcast it to the world.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:00.510
Now Ben has already told
you about the amazing stuff

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:03.600
you can do around
integrations within your game,

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:07.370
but we want to also be
inclusive of any type of game.

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:10.060
So part of our update to
the YouTube Gaming app,

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:14.100
as well as to Google Play
Games, as Ben mentioned earlier,

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:15.740
was mobile capture.

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:19.280
Mobile capture on YouTube
Gaming is drop dead simple.

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.210
You can select any
game on your phone,

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:25.680
and just tap the record
button and start capturing.

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:30.060
You could choose to add video
of yourself, sound via the mic.

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.220
And adding to the
fun of it, you can

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:36.600
Livestream all of that gameplay
directly to your channel

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.700
on YouTube already today.

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:42.780
So really your limit to your
mobile gameplay recording

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:46.380
is only your
phone's battery now.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.480
And speaking of
Livestreaming, we're

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.360
building up amazing
features on that front.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.240
As I said earlier, we
see constant innovation

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.300
around formats on YouTube.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.160
And more and more
creators are now

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.980
connecting to their
fans real-time through

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.140
Livestreaming.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.530
Also, developers
and publishers often

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:06.970
use Livestreams to
make announcements,

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:10.300
to host tournaments, to
host community streams

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.860
around their launches, and
really engage with their fans

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.440
through live chat.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.710
Life is becoming an ever
immersive experience.

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:21.790
And we even recently announced
360 degrees Livestreaming.

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:28.720
It's a very exciting era to be
in today in the games industry.

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.460
And there are so
many cool products

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:33.770
available to the people
who love and make games.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:36.440
In the past 15 minutes
or so, I was only

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.230
able to give you a
glimpse into this world,

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:42.510
and there are so many
more inspirational stories

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:44.960
from games that have
become really big

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.190
and known through the power
of the YouTube community.

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:50.740
The discovery of games
has really changed,

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:52.820
and you don't need
to spend millions

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:56.690
of dollars of marketing budget
anymore to get exposure.

00:44:56.690 --> 00:45:00.340
So I highly encourage you
to play an active role

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:04.220
in our community by embracing
the content that's out there,

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:08.140
or creating your own, by really
listening to the community's

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.040
feedback, maybe even including
them in the development

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.330
of your game.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:16.000
It all really boils down
to making great games,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.740
and to the combined passion
that we share for games.

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.270
And with that, I want to
hand it back over to Noah.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:25.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:30.087 --> 00:45:31.920
NOAH FALSTEIN: Thank
you Ina, thank you Ben,

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.830
and thank you everyone.

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:36.464
I hope this has been
intriguing, inspiring.

00:45:36.464 --> 00:45:38.130
I hope you can see
some ways you can use

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:40.050
these services in your games.

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.050
Please go out there and
make some great games

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:44.480
with our technology,
and let us know

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.170
what you've done so we can
show you up here next year.

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:49.700
Thank you very much.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.450
