MALE SPEAKER 1: The things
I love about Google Cloud

00:00:02.346 --> 00:00:05.260
platform is scalability, fault
tolerance, and performance.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.570
MALE SPEAKER 2: Performance.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.315
MALE SPEAKER 3: App Engine.

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:07.110
FEMALE SPEAKER: Big query.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.380
MALE SPEAKER 4: The
scaling ability.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.700
MALE SPEAKER 5: We've been
able to scale from thousands

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.250
of users to millions of users.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.930
MALE SPEAKER 6: It allowed
us to focus on our product,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:14.931
and we grew really fast.

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.138
MALE SPEAKER 5: Because of
the Google Cloud Platform,

00:00:17.138 --> 00:00:18.940
we could make investments
in our product

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.461
first as opposed
to infrastructure.

00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:21.960
And so we could
iterate really quick

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.090
on building the right product.
