00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:17.640
 Today is google developer program that response to that raw wood 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.640
 Today I will tell you about the latest web views 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.550
 The implementation of web views from android 4.4 kitkat has been completely revamped 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:31.030
 It is based on chromium 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:36.340
 Significant improvements in web standards compliance and performance 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:37.510
 The implementation of the live has changed significantly, but the app is basically web view as before 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.090
 You can use 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.730
 However, there are some points to be noted and additional functions that are useful for development. 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.100
 To do 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:55.589
 Introduce the relationship between arch set and web view 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:01:01.230
 The code you're looking at is just an example, but in the background thread launched 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:06.540
 Working on web views web views as well as other views 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:10.360
 It should also be done from the main thread originally, but until now android 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:15.780
 Then, such a code was working for the time being 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:20.580
 Such code will stop working from android 4.4 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:26.990
 Eg using the run on ui thread method of the activity class 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.990
 Make sure to handle the web view from the main thread 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:35.260
 Run in javascript background from java side in relation to this 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:40.600
 It became easy to receive the result 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:42.490
 For example, the code to be executed on the first argument of the 8th javascript method 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.490
 Argument callback 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:52.340
 Or pass null if you do not need the results 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:57.259
 There are also changes in the handling of custom urls 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:01.969
 If you click a link in html to display in web view 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:07.700
 Override url loading may not be called 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:12.330
 As above, if you specify just a string as a link destination, load data or 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:17.700
 load data with base url without specifying base url 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.300
 When html is loaded, overriding url loading is 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.840
 Not called 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:29.060
 Please use some custom schema as below 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:36.670
 The code you see is an example of what happens when a link is clicked 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.670
 Parse and handle url when passed url matching your own schema 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:45.170
 Remote debugging of web views is now possible 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:49.280
 Here, it is assumed that the development environment of android has been set up 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:54.080
 We will show you how to set up remote debugging 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.360
 To debug web views remotely extension to the latest chrome 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.150
 Must be installed 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:06.159
 Please install the extension from the url you see 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:11.019
 It is necessary for the app side to handle it. To make web views debuggable 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:16.480
 Invoke backing method-blue method on set web content 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:20.879
 In the code you see, drinking with android 4.4 or later introduced remote debugging 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.879
 Is to activate the bag 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.650
 I want to match the web view debug enable setting with the app's own debug enable setting 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:34.560
 If 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:39.230
 As you can see it can be achieved by using build config. Debug 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:42.319
 Let's look at the steps to actually do remote debugging 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:47.420
 I installed earlier to open the device list 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:49.080
 Select View Inspection Month from the menu of the chrome extension 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:54.780
 please 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:57.930
 When you open a list of devices, you can debug them running on each device 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:02.520
 The web view is displayed in a list 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:08.810
 As it shows where each web view is displayed on the screen 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:12.770
 Click Inspect next to the web view you want to debug 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.840
 As you can see, the debug screen is a regular crew chrome developer 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:19.459
 same as tool 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:24.340
 For example, when you move the cursor to html like chrome is remote 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:28.540
 Highlights elements in real time on debug 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:34.560
 How is it? By all means android 4.4 greatly evolved web view 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.560
 Please try to make an application using Thank you for watching
