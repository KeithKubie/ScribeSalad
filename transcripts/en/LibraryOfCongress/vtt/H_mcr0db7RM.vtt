00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.250
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Harbster: So, good
morning and good afternoon.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.890
This is always the
time where it's both.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.340
I'm Jennifer Harbster.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.800
I'm a reference and research
specialist here at the Library

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.200
of Congress with the Science,
Technology and Business Division.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.080
I'd like to welcome you
guys to today's program,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.080
<i>Discovering the North-West Passage,
The Four-Year Arctic Odyssey</i>

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.590
<i>of the H.M.S. Investigator
and the McClure Expedition </i>.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.540
As I said before, we have a
lot in store for you today.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.490
Author, Glen Stein, will be
talking about his recent book,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.350
which I'd like to note has been
placed in the Royal Library

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.000
of Her Majesty, Queen
Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.880
We also have a special presentation

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.060
by Parks Canada Senior Underwater
Archaeologist, Ryan Harris,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.250
who dove on the wreck
of the HMS Investigator.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.260
We have extended the time
today for this program

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.440
to allow these two speakers, also
a question and answer period,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.610
which will be after each speaker.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.480
Glenn will start first and then
we'll have a question/answer period

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.720
that we need to limit to
about maybe 10 minutes or so,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.860
and then Ryan will speak and
then we'll have a question

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.850
and answer period after that.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.140
And then, following all of that,
we're going to have a book signing.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.390
So to keep us on track,
I really need

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.480
to keep this introduction short,
but I want to let you know

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.890
about our speakers a little bit.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.840
So it is definitely
my great pleasure

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.220
to introduce our speaker
today, Glenn Marty Stein,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.760
who has been researching
and writing about maritime

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.920
and polar history since 1975.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.640
He is a fellow of the geography
-- the Royal Geographical Society.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.970
He's a life member of the
American Polar Society,

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.920
a member of the Orders and
Medals Research Society

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.810
and Lifesaving Awards
Research Society.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.790
So in 2006, Stein began to do
in depth research for this book

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.150 position:56%
and he published a two part article,
The Voyage of HMS Investigator 1850

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.690 position:56%
to '54, which was awarded the Orders

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.820
and Medals Research Society
Journal prize in 2008, '09.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.850
This is not Glenn's first visit
to the Library of Congress.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.090
In February of 2013, Glenn was a
co-presenter for a program by --

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.750
a program called, By Endurance We
Conquer, Shackleton and Lessons

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.460
of Leadership from the Imperial
Trans-Arctic Centenary Expedition.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.990
Glenn is also a formal
editorial cartoonist

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.270
for the newspaper La Prensa.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.520
And the library recently acquired
some of his drawings to add

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.890
to our amazing cartoon
and caricature collection.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.520
So anchors away and join
me in welcoming back,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.510
Author and Historian, Glenn
Stein to the Library of Congress.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:19.850
[ Applause ]

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.150
&gt;&gt; Glenn Stein: Well, thank
you very much, Jennifer.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.990
I appreciate that introduction.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.370
And also too, I want to make
a little announcement here

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.350
about the room we're
in because it --

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.820
it somewhat has a connection to
what I'm going to talk about.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.230
We of course, are in the Mumford
Room and one of the investigators

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.420
on the expedition was
named James Nelson.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.740
And in the Arctic, he
became quite friendly

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.040
with a gentleman named
William Mumford, who was on --

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.260
on one of the rescue ships
called H.M.S. Resolute.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.000
So they actually stayed friends

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.160
after they came home
from the Arctic.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.590
So there's a little bit
of serendipity there.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.310
But thank you to the Library of
Congress and to everyone involved

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.610
with this production today.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.940
I appreciate the welcome very much.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.640
And of course, to Ryan Harris
for so graciously coming down

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.700
and presenting with me today.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.130
And I also want to mention the
tremendous support I received

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.450
for many years now in
researching and producing the book

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.470
from my editor, Layla Milholen
and everyone at McFarland Books.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.220
I also wanted to thank you for
being here today and also, my wife,

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.170
Marsha, for her kind support
all throughout these years.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.430
And also have mentioned
that our twin daughters,

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.120
Aliyah and Rebecca
would be here today,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.770
except their college studies
trumped even dad's book launch.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.970
That's okay, that's okay, I --
I can appreciate that and --

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.960
and I respect them for that.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.410
There's also a couple
anniversaries of sorts

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.140
that I would like to mention.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.400
I have a slight connection
with exploration myself.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.390
In fact, 26 years ago this month
when I was working at Cape Kennedy,

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.440
I used to work in security
out there.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.050
I supported my first space mission

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.590
and it was the Galileo
Spacecraft that went to Jupiter.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.640
So at that time, they
launched the spacecraft

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.790
and it took six years before
it reached the planet.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.110
So there's a connection there
between the length of time

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.060
and the days of old
exploration and space travel.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.500
There's also another
anniversary of sorts today,

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.640
it was 20 years ago this month
when fellow polar historian,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.180
A.G.E. Jones wrote to me and put
it -- things in perspective here.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.700
Jones and I have become
very friendly

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.590
and corresponded quite a bit.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.990
And he wrote to me once that he
had seen Charles Lindberg land

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.040
in Croydon, England in 1927.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.350
So, Jones had been at it a
little bit longer than I had

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.790
and in the last letter
of the line --

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.020
last line of the letter that he
wrote to me on this occasion,

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.050 position:56%
he wrote, "Carry on wondering as
that is the way to get to the bottom

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.630
of a story that everybody
has taken for granted."

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.410
I've always remembered that.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.880 position:56%
Four years after this time, I was at
a convention in San Jose, California

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.870
and I had seen a woman
named Diana Birch,

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.190
who I had never personally met, but
we had corresponded over the years

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.440 position:56%
and I went up and introduced myself.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:35.160 position:56%
Well, as my name left my lips she
shouted, "Oh, you're the polar man."

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.980
And this is the kind of response
I often receive from people.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.610
In part, because I'm a
native Floridian, so --

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.810
so nobody ever puts that
together, they never quite expect

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.790
that when I tell them I --
I research polar history.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.850
They -- they look at me rather
strangely and I have to explain it.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.540 position:56%
And then afterwards, I actually came
across a man named John Tamplin,

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.750
who is medal -- was a medal
collector and researcher himself,

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.570
who I again, had never
met face-to-face,

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.690
but we had corresponded
quite a bit over the years.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.380
At this time, John was in his early
70's and I was 36 years of age.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.810 position:56%
And I when I introduced myself,
this huge grin swept across his face

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.370
and he took me by my
shoulders and shook me

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.040
and exclaimed how wonderful
it was to meet me.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.960
And I found out later that John
was shocked at my youth for someone

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.560
who was interested in
polar exploration and --

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.870
and had the knowledge that
I had acquired at that time.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.650
He just couldn't believe
that I was that young.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.990
So this is -- the experiences
I've had on occasion from people

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.730
that I've run across over
the now almost 41 years

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.440
that I've been doing research.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.730
What I'm going to do to start off
with is I'm going to read part

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.140
of the preface from my book,

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.470
<i>Discovering the North-West
Passage </i>.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:01.990
It gives you something of a --
of a overview of what I had hoped

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.770
to achieve when I started
the book and of course,

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.230
what I did eventually
I hope achieve.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:11.030
The story that follows is true.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.770
This is a balanced account

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.890
of the human story behind the
Four-Year Arctic Odyssey of the men

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.500
of Her Majesty's ship
Investigator, during their search

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.060
for the missing Franklin Expedition
in the North-West Passage.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.950
Through an unfiltered lens, I have
gone to great lengths to understand

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:33.720
and accurately depict
the events and the people

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.030
in which they were involved.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:40.440
On April 11, 1970, I stood in
amazement on a Florida beach,

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:45.570
gazing upon Apollo 13 as
she hurdled to the moon.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:50.230
Two days later, hundreds of human
and computerized minds melded

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.000
in a race to save three
explorers trapped

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.470
within the frigid void of space.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:01.400
To the Victorian mind,
the Arctic was the moon.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.020
Like outer space, the Polar
Regions offer life and death.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:10.280
And the difference between
them hangs by a thread.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.480
Exploration has always been
as much about, if not more,

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.590
the human species'
struggle with itself

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.240
as its struggle with
the natural world.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.040
With the investigators, I focused
on seeking out possibilities

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.110
and then finding answers.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:30.000
In the following pages
understanding emerges

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.250
through the careful
peeling away of layers

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.470
of reality these men
confronted during the expedition.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.320
As I immersed myself in
the journals, documents,

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.560 position:56%
and letters of the investigators and
other polar explorers of the period,

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.130
their words washed over me.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.450
I delved into Naval customs,
ship construction, oceanography,

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:56.120
ice navigation and the effects
of extreme cold and starvation

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.090
on the human body, anything
that allowed me to inch closer

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.330
to their 19th Century world.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.790
At the same time, I strived to
understand the indigenous peoples

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.120
with whom the sailors and
marines came into contact

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.490
and obtaining a sense of their
culture and in particular,

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.280
their relationship with Europeans.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:23.290
What I'd like to do is give you an
overview of how this book evolved

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.160
and some of the highlights, some of
the things that I actually was able

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:32.180
to discover during my research and
very much focus on the word evolve

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:38.050
because the book did change
as I wrote it and grew.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.920
And I was very, very pleased
with the result in that regard

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.170
because I was able, I think, to
bring out even a richer story

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.310
than I had intended to or foresaw.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.760
And perhaps there's no better
way to begin than the end.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.410
After the book was finished
and it went to press,

00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:01.980 position:56%
I remarked to my wife one night, "If
I never write another word again,

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.900
it will have been worth it."

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.720
And a word about writing, I
think is very appropriate here.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.580
I often tell people that the -- the
thing that really should be kept

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.440
in mind is that I spend a lot more
time thinking about what I'm going

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.550
to write than actually writing.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:30.250
So -- so that has really remained
uppermost in the whole process.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.780
And this along with the
self editing that I did

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.580
through the whole process meant

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.200
that there was a tremendous
timesaving in the long run.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.890
Another example is, I built my
bibliography as I went along,

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.650
so I had a quick reference
myself and I was able

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:51.710
to actually make corrections
in it at the end

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.070
because I had already built a full
bibliography instead of trying

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.370
to create one at that time.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:02.150
From the beginning, I was very
concerned about getting it right

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.470
and preserving the memories
of the investigators,

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:07.970
that was extremely important to me.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.450
I've been in contact with a lot
of descendents of the expedition

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:15.310
and I certainly did not
want to write things

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.360
that were not true
about these people.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:23.650 position:56%
And one of the things that I did was
I wrote a letter to the historian,

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.170
David McCullough and
expressed my concern.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:33.040
And he was very gracious in writing
back that in part, "What a fine

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.100
and engaging letter from you.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:39.410
Thank you very much for your good
spirits and understanding of what's

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.270
at stake in writing a book.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.120
Gives me a great lift."

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.760
So from that, I thought, well, I'm
probably on the right track here.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.000
I probably -- I'm probably
heading the right direction.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.580
So, one of the things that
really impressed me in going

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.390
into this was -- or made an
impression on me I should say,

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:03.540
is how I needed to make the writing
and the experience for the reader

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.360
as authentic as possible.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.960
And in a way, what I wanted

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.870
to do was use the investigators
words as much as possible.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.520
And I found a lot of unpublished
material that was out there

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.150
and fortunately, I was
able to really go through

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.150
and juxtapose all the published
and unpublished material

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.810
and hopefully come up with
a really authentic idea

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.820
of what occurred in
many circumstances.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:34.960
These are typical sailors
of the time period,

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:41.750
although there was nobody as young
as the boy you see right here.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:46.730
Let's see here -- right
there, that's a boy,

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.420
small boy who was not uncommon
during Victorian days aboard ship.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.220
They could be as young
as nine or ten years old.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.960
But these other sailors really
represent very typical sailors

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.260
of the period.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.860
Also, these are Royal Marines from
the same time period and again,

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.060
very, very typical of who you
would see except for again --

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.540
whoops, sorry about that,

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:17.790
the drummer boy right
here -- the drummer boy.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.540
Now in order to do
what I set out to do

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.160
and really present an
authentic narrative,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.510 position:56%
I needed to create an infrastructure

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.470
and I knew this right
from the very beginning.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:33.580
And by that, I assembled a whole
host of folders in my computer,

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.370
anything from the Franklin
search expeditions all the way

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:38.670
through to something

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.310 position:56%
like specialized medical information
related to the Polar Regions.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.560
So I set everything up
and I was able to easy --

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.540
easily juxtapose all this
information and move forward

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.260
in my writing and explain things,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.990
hopefully in a very
clear way to the reader.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.840
Also too, I knew illustrations were
going to be extremely important,

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.450
so I began gathering as many
illustration as I could related

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:07.910
to Arctic scenes, ships to
various people, anything I could

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.880
which I felt was going
to be important.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.710
And I figured that the best
thing to do was to infuse these

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:17.570
in the text relative to
the subject matter at hand,

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:22.230
so the reader would see the subject
matter that I was writing about

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:26.110
or was being written
about and relate to it.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.070
Also too, I wanted to bring
people as close as I could

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:34.100
to the investigators themselves and
this meant displaying and writing

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.480
about particular artifacts, the
very, very personal artifacts

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:43.160 position:56%
like -- whoops, this one here, okay.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.910
This is a naval general
service medal, which was given

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:49.950
to Private First Class,
George Parfitt.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:54.530
He was one of the eight Royal
Marines who was board investigator

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:58.070
and the medal was given to
him only in the months prior

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.700
to leaving for the expedition.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.790
Now, the Marines in particular
were required to wear these medals

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:06.100
on formal occasions and since
the ship was going to be away

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:12.170
for several years, every reason to
believe that medal was with Parfitt

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:19.830
through the entire voyage and went
through the North-West Passage.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.310
I also set about to create
individual biographies

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:26.590
of all 66 men onboard.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:31.100
And in this regard, a lot of
things came to the surface.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.410
One of the things that came to
the surface is that over 39 --

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:40.370
sorry, 39 men over -- out
of the 66 who were onboard,

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:45.080
actually had served together in the
nine years prior to the expedition.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.110
This meant that there was a certain
unity among the crew before the

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:52.310
expedition ever began and
that was very, very important

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.150
for the cohesiveness of the ship.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.900
In assembling the biographies,
I also investigated the ships

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.540
that the men had served on
before and after the expedition.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:07.910
I created physical profiles for
them and I even compared them

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.410
by the counties from
which they were born.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.590
As you can see, many of the --

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:18.060
many of the men actually came

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.510
from the southern counties
of England here.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.640 position:56%
Now this only represents England and
Wales, there were people represented

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.920
from Ireland as well, and Scotland.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.570
Two of the men actually
stood out in particular

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.720
because they were men of color.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.830
They were of African descent.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:43.830
One of them was born in England,
the other claimed to have been born

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:49.020
in British North America or
today as we know, Canada.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:54.510
I looked into him much more closely
and I was able to actually come

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.910
up with a good bit of
circumstantial evidence,

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:02.710
very strong circumstantial evidence
that he wasn't Canadian at all,

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:09.320 position:56%
he was a runaway American slave, or
at the very least, his parents were.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.550
And again, there was a lot
of circumstantial evidence

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.990
that pointed to this fact.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:19.400
So, I was very, very pleased with
-- with that because it's very hard

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.280
to actually come across
that sort of individual

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.060
and that sort of information.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.170
Certainly a lot of men of color
served in the Royal Navy for --

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.270 position:56%
for many years throughout the years,
but to find that sort of information

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.670
and connect it to a particular
individual and a particular place

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.730
and time is very difficult.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:43.870
Now, the driving force behind the
ship was of course, the captain,

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.210
Robert John Le Mesurier McClure.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.530
There were portions of his
character that can be explained

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:56.800
in different ways and -- let
me get to him, there we go.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.330
And what is so important about
McClure is the more I looked

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:04.520 position:56%
into his family records -- and there
were quite a few different family

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.930
records from different
people throughout the years,

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.600
the more contradictions
I ran across.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.660
So, I really had to
-- to work those out,

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.320
I had to find out what
was true and what was not.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.200
And some of these things were --
were innocent things, things to --

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:21.220
just mistakes of years, mistakes
of locations and things like that.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.760 position:56%
But it's very difficult with McClure

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.730
because his father died
before he was even born.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:31.740
He died when he was
serving in Egypt,

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.720
in the early part of
the Napoleonic Wars.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.770 position:56%
So it -- it was very difficult to
come across some information in part

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:43.600
because of that, but also because
his mother was a wife, a mother

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.660
and a widow all within a year.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.020
So she went through a
tremendous experience.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:54.820
The baby McClure was actually
given up to his godfather to raise.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:20:00.000
Now, this in and of
itself, was not unusual,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.430
but what was really
interesting was the fact

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:07.780
that McClure was the only child
of that household for many,

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:11.830
many years before his godparents
had children of their own.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.520 position:56%
I think this had a big effect on him

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.860
because he wasn't the
golden child anymore.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.650
And his godfather was a
former Army officer --

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:26.130
former general, and when McClure
rejected going into an Army career

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.040
and chose a naval career instead,

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.120
he was behind the curve
by several years.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.370
So he actually joined the
Navy at a much later age

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:38.030
in his youth than normal.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:42.440
So again, these things
had a cumulative effect

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.180
on McClure getting
ahead, making rank,

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.740
and progressing in a naval career.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.990
I'll read briefly from my book
and it will give you an idea

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:56.380
about McClure's naval
environment and some of the things

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.010
that had a direct impact
on the expedition.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.880
"The post-Napoleonic War
Navy was spit and polish.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.400 position:56%
And the naval officer prided himself

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.040
in the keen ship handling
throughout harnessing --

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.990
through harnessing the wind.

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:13.850
McClure was caught in the midst
of this transition from sail

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:17.250
to steam propulsion that
began in fits and starts

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.260
in the 1820's and 1830's.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:26.310
But the steam engine was an
inefficient and unsightly thing.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.410
Steam, whose grotesque
and clumsy engines,

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.350
whose monstrous smokestacks
there belched from --

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.120
belched forth the smuts,
the constant traded mess

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.160
from the combustion of filthy,
Newcastle coal and the smell --

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.240
first smell in contamination
of oil."

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:48.100
So, steam was seen as an ugly
thing, something to be [inaudible].

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.960
And that was the environment
that McClure knew.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.750
It wasn't just McClure who
was affected, there were many,

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:59.440
many other people, including
one of his commanding officers,

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.570
who impressed this upon
McClure quite heavily.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.750
His name was John Ross.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:10.760
The way this played into the story
was McClure had a bitter conflict

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.680
from the very start with
his second in command,

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.900
Lieutenant William H. Haswell.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.350
Again, from my book.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:20.100
"While McClure's crewmen were
bounding through the renewal

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.710
of old acquaintances,
a grave fracture

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.090
in his command was taking place,

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:27.460
threatening the ship before
she ever left England.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:32.120
And the problem started at the
top, during the tow down river,

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.330
Lieutenant Samuel Creswell's
pen painted an ugly scene

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.330
for his parents.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.210
The captain continues
to be very civil to me,

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:44.360
but poor Haswell catches
it on every occasion.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.980
Yesterday the captain went on
in a most foolish way with him,

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:52.170
saying he should not be in this
ship, that he was incompetent

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:57.450
to be first lieutenant, that he
would write to I don't know whom.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:01.430
So why did McClure insist on
humiliating his first lieutenant,

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:05.200
a man who's support would
be crucial during the long

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.960
and difficult voyage ahead by
declaring Haswell should not be

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.690
in this ship and that
he was incompetent?

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:15.590
To some degree, the
answer as wrapped

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.590
up in Haswell's previous postings,

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:23.310
the Devastation and
Penelope steamships.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:29.510
Haswell had served in several --
several sailing ships before this

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:34.380
and had been successfully promoted,
but he was now well on his way

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:37.240
to becoming Investigator's
persona non grata

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:41.850
because of the stern warnings John
Ross has repeatedly given McClure

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:47.500
against ever taking anyone with a
background in steam propulsion."

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.380
So this had a tremendous
effect on the structure

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.830
of the expedition again,
before it ever left England.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:58.470
One of the things that I was very
concerned about in my writing was

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.500
to appeal to the broadest
possible audience.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.890
And when I say that, I'm
talking about anybody

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.460
from the lay person all
the way to the scholar.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.000
So bridging that gap as you were,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.480
was going to be something
of a challenge.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.280
And what it meant was I needed
to make the text very readable

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.350
and I also need to set the stage

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.920
in the first two chapters
for what lay ahead.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:26.000
What lay ahead was a tremendous
amount of unpublished information

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.280
that was very detailed
and as time went on,

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.480 position:56%
I realized there were certain things
that would never be understandable

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:38.750
within that framework, so I had
to create indexes or indices

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:41.330
in order to deal with them.

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:46.750
One of these indices, for instance,
was the primary sources indices

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:52.550
and this was so important because
there was a web of intrigue

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:56.420
and unanswered questions among
the journals that I had read

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.620
from the captain, from the
assistant surgeon Peers,

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.660
even from the carpenter Ford.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.010
There were a lot of things
that weren't adding up,

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.570
a lot of missing parts,
literally missing parts.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.030
Let me give you an example.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:16.020
I was able to prove beyond a doubt
that McClure kept two journals.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:22.140
So this is a multipart
journal and there was a copy.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:26.430
And what happened is through
time as far as I know,

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:30.320
there's only one volume of
that journal in existence.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:35.010
The question comes, is that the
copy or is that the original?

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:37.970
And this sort of thing
actually reverberated

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.450
through the other journals as well,

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.830
particularly the surgeon's
journal, Dr. Armstrong.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:51.970
I also created an index
of notable sled journeys.

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:53.630
And the reason I did this is

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:57.120
because when you can
attach a particular person

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:01.090
to a particular place at a
particular time, you can track them

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:03.970
and you can associate those
people with specific events

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.830
or disassociate them
with other events.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:11.490
So I created an entire index so you
can go back and you can see who was

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:15.600
where and when they were
participating in various events.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:20.060
These sled journeys actually
created stories within themselves

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.310
because you see certain
people appear again and again.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:26.450
In other words, they were
favorites among the officers.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:30.180
This isn't unusual because there's
a certain connection that you get

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.770
with someone when you
spend days, weeks,

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:35.350
months on the sledding
trail with the same people.

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.290
You get to know them,
they get to know you,

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:40.970
you get to trust them,
they trust you.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.050
And it also played into
the story very much

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:49.700
because Haswell being somebody who
was desperately hated by McClure,

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:53.700
was kept out of the
picture more and more.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.040 position:56%
So he doesn't show up a lot of times
in the writings or he's referred

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:04.390
to only slightly, sometimes
not even by name.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:10.910 position:56%
Several years ago, I began work on
a two-part article about this award,

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:15.190
the Arctic medal, 1818, 1855.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:18.160
And I had intended to --
to publish it eventually,

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.610
but as I did the research for
the book, it became obvious

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:26.190
that this award is
actually an integral part

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:29.320
of the overall story, here's why.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:34.110
The reverse of the
medal itself -- whoops.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:39.000
The reverse of the -- of the
actual award here was designed

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.580
by Samuel Creswell.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.370
And that was no mistake.

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:48.210
Creswell had been called to
an audience of Queen Victoria

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.420
and had done paintings
during the expedition

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.900
and she was very impressed
with them.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.850
So he had an inn right there.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:28:00.400
The other thing is that Her
Majesty, Queen Victoria herself,

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.190
since she was a princess, had a
great interest in exploration,

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:07.660
particularly polar exploration.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:13.280
And she became convinced that
the shape of the medal needed

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:19.800
to be octagonal, not round like
war medals before and after it.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.700
So it stood out.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.070
She wanted something that
was going to stand out,

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:27.480
it was going to be
different and recognizable.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.850
For that information, I'm very
grateful to the Royal Archives

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:36.350
at Windsor Castle because I was
able to get special permission

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.640
to actually access letters to

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.670
and from Queen Victoria
on this very subject.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:46.320
Now, for all this rich detail
and explanations and there --

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.780
believe me, there's a lot more,
there's so much that's new

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.150
in regards to this expedition
that I have in my book.

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:54.770
I have to tell you, I'm actually
going through the book now

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:59.600 position:56%
and making my own notes because I
-- I can't even keep up with it all,

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.220
so I want to have my own
notes on some of this

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.670
and where it actually
falls in the book and --

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:07.530
and that is an ongoing process.

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:12.100
But for all this detail and
all the richness of the story,

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.150
it's important to step back and
take a look at the big picture

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:17.070
and the big picture is this.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.570
There is no one route through
the North-West Passage,

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:21.960
it's actually several routes.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.830
McClure discovered two of them.

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:30.800
And through the years while these
guys were out there exploring,

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.310
the ice conditions made it

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:36.360
so that things could change
tremendously year to year.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:40.830 position:56%
In one year, an explorer may have a
lot of luck getting through the ice,

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:42.220 position:56%
a lot of ways to go through the ice,

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.940
and another year, be
entirely blocked.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.630
So you're really at
the mercy of nature.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:51.290
That's very important to remember.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:54.580
The other thing is, no
one man can actually claim

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.780
to have found the North-West
Passage.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:01.330
McClure's experience has really
capped 30 years of experiences

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:05.370
of many other men who
had gone before him,

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:10.950
most of them British explorers, in
finding a way through the Arctic.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:14.900
And during this time,
these men relied very,

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:19.780
very heavily on native peoples
for guides and assistance.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:26.190
Perhaps most importantly in this
regard, McClure's experiences

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:30.350
and those of his fellow
investigators really can be used

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:36.480
as a yardstick and understanding
what happened to Sir John Franklin

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.290
and the men of the
missing Erebus and Terror.

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:43.520
And it is my earnest wish

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:48.210
that my writings will be
applied to that very end.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:50.010
Thank you.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:56.700
[ Applause ]

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.790
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Harbster: So
now, we can do a question

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:02.430
and answer period before
we have Ryan Harris come

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.720
up from Parks Canada.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.520
So, are there questions for Glenn?

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.820
&gt;&gt; Glenn Stein: Yes?

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.120
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Harbster: And
overly repeat the question

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.420
for the cameras so we know --

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Glenn Stein: Repeat the question?

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.020
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Harbster: -- yeah.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.320
&gt;&gt; Glenn Stein: Sure.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.620
Yes?

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:19.920
&gt;&gt; Mr. Stein, I enjoyed
your book very much.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.220
&gt;&gt; Glenn Stein: Thank you.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.520
&gt;&gt; There -- the question I
have about Lieutenant Haswell,

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.700
what is your judgment
of Lieutenant Haswell?

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:30.540 position:56%
Did he merit the condemnation and
criticism of his commanding officer?

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.390
&gt;&gt; Glenn Stein: Well, it was --
it was -- for what I could find,

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:36.640
it was very, very enlightening to
show that there was an incident

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.930
where one of the masts was
damaged in a storm, for example,

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:46.160
and Haswell was indifferent
about inspecting the damage.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.490
And McClure was furious about
this and -- and literally wrote --

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.700
wrote him up to the Admiralty.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:57.300
And McClure rode him very
hard, so at one point,

00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:00.310
Haswell supposedly said
to him, "I've been told

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:07.000
by people much your superior that
I'm a very good naval officer."

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.660
So -- so it's hard to understand
whether Haswell was saying

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:14.220
that because he was being arrogant
or he was saying that because,

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.620
"Look I'm really tired of you
-- you riding my back, okay.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.580
And I can do my job."

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.940 position:56%
And I think when you consider the --

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.140
the situation and the confines of
a ship, that Haswell had a really,

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:31.130
really difficult time staying on
-- on even civil grounds with a man

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:34.100
who went out of his way
to humiliate and hate him.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.510
I mean, McClure tried to
get the guy off the ship;

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:39.070
he tried to kick him
off the ship in Hawaii.

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:43.450
And he was basically told by -- by
other naval officers on the scene,

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:46.190
"You really don't want to
do this, you know, you --

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:49.010
you don't want to kick your
first lieutenant off the ship."

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.610
For one thing, there was
nobody to replace him.

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:56.420
The other thing too is Haswell
was actually the flag lieutenant

00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:01.420
of the commanding officer in
his prior command, prior ship.

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.070
Now that meant that he was
basically a political officer,

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.590
he was the guy's right arm.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:11.030
And I think very much Haswell had
some sort of political connections

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.940
that probably irritated McClure.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:17.140
He probably didn't like that
because McClure was not someone

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.240
that had grown up with these
or gone through his service

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.540
with political connections.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.850
He got them only very late.

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:26.850
So -- so it's a good
question as far as, you know,

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:30.620
was Haswell really deserving
of McClure condemnation

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.910
because it's really
a double edged sword

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:36.330
in those -- those circumstances.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:39.130
One of the things by the
way, I would love to find,

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.190
anybody finds it I'll give
you a million dollars,

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:44.340 position:56%
I kid you not, is Haswell's journal.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:49.250
Haswell's journal was actually
retrieved from the investigator

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:53.370
after it had been abandoned, but
I've never been able to track it.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:57.590
And I even went to the -- to the
lengths of going to the wills

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.740
of his descendants to try to see if
it was passed down in the family.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.650
I could never find a trace of it.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:07.300
I get the impression that he
never wanted it to be shown,

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:11.430
he never wanted it to get out
there, certainly never published,

00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:14.130
so it's possible it was destroyed.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.200
But as far as I can tell, it was
never passed down in the family.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.040
But stranger things have
happened, so you never know.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.340
Another question?

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:23.020
Anybody?

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Harbster: Onto the next.

00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:27.000
&gt;&gt; Glenn Stein: Okay, oh
and then there -- thank you.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.040
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Harbster:
All right, oh wow,

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:38.180 position:56%
that did that without even -- magic.

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:42.580
So our next speaker is Ryan Harris.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:48.660
He is a senior underwater
archeologist with Parks Canada.

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:52.400
Ryan received his bachelor's degree
in anthropology from the University

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.040
of Toronto and a master's
degree in maritime history

00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:00.380
and nautical archaeology from
East Carolina University.

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:05.750 position:56%
He has been working with Parks
Canada since 1999 and has taken part

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:09.840
in more than 50 underwater
archaeology projects.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.770
His archaeology work has
helped to locate the wreck

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.990
of the H.M.S. Investigator
of which he then dove

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:18.570 position:56%
onto conduct a survey of the vessel.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:23.170
Just recently the Parks Canada
underwater archaeology team located

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:27.730
one of Franklin's vessels,
missing vessels, the H.M.S. Erebus.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:30.630
So today, Ryan is going to
share with us some of his work

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:32.750 position:56%
that he's done with the Investigator

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:37.450
and I think some updates
of the Erebus work too.

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:41.950 position:56%
I should also note outside at the
book display, we have a book called,

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:43.570
<i>Lost at Sea </i>-- <i>Lost in Sea </i>.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.070
&gt;&gt; <i>Lost Beneath the Ice </i>.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:47.070
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Harbster:
<i>Lost Beneath the Ice </i>,

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.570
which has actually documents
some of the work that he's done.

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:52.700
It's a beautiful, colorful book.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:56.510
So please join me in welcoming
Ryan to the Library of Congress.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:36:02.040
[ Applause ]

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.340
&gt;&gt; Ryan Harris: Good afternoon.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.400 position:56%
Thank you for the warm introduction.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.850
More or less, I'm just going to
offer some eye candy here to --

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:11.410
to support the launch
of Glenn's book,

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:15.830 position:56%
something I've been looking
forward to with anticipation myself.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:20.490
And I think that's --
in the close of time,

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:23.520
I think this book might
stand as the --

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.480
the authoritative history of
H.M.S. Investigator, perhaps for --

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.050
for generations in the same way
that Richard Cyriax's seminal work

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:33.910
on the Franklin Expedition
remains the --

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:37.840
the authority since its
publication in 1939.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:42.750
It is, I think in 2010 or
maybe 2011, where Glenn

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:44.780
and I first began to communicate.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.880
We had just recently discovered
the wreck of H.M.S. Investigator

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.160
in Canada's high arctic and
so we had a mutual interest

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.400
in the -- one another's research.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.860
And fairly early on, I was
able to come to a sense of --

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:02.020
or come to respect Glenn's
meticulous research nature,

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:06.910
his thoroughness and his
humility in which is quite a --

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:15.050
quite an attractive trait, which
is a pleasure to work with.

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:17.220
And yeah, I look forward
to getting back to Ottawa

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.560
and dissecting this work
which will be instrumental

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:24.310
in our ongoing research on the
wreck site of H.M.S. Investigator.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:27.530
I'll provide a bit of
historical background just

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:31.460
to facilitate my talk, but it'll
include a lot of images of --

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.760
of these two rather
extraordinary wreck sites

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.240
which hope you'll take interest in.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.330
Of course, in broad strokes,

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:42.340
the Franklin Expedition
departed Greenhithe County Kent

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.780
in England in May of 1845.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:49.680
With a significant fanfare and --
and seemingly justified optimism

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:55.280 position:56%
that finally this sublimely equipped
expedition would finally, you know,

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:59.880 position:56%
find the elusive North-West Passage,
something that had been the --

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.270
the object of the English
mariners since Elizabethan times

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:05.420
and the times of Frobisher
and -- and Hudson later on.

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:11.020
And so the -- the two ships
Erebus and Terror with 129 men

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.020
that ultimately entered the
Arctic, including Franklin himself.

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:18.740 position:56%
Obviously, things didn't work out so
well and all of these men perished

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:23.040
under certainly, rather
grim circumstances.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:28.260
This of course, launched -- I'll
start with the Investigator,

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.220
but this launched what
is often described

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:34.440
as the largest rescue operation
that's ever been staged

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.740
in human history.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:39.330
Countless expeditions were
launched by the Royal Navy,

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:43.620
privately thereafter,
American expeditions as well,

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:48.200
to try to locate these two missing
ships and -- and the missing men.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.280
H.M.S. Investigator among its
-- amongst its claims to fame,

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.410
of course, that it was part of the
first Royal Navy expedition to --

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:58.870
to look for Franklin and his men.

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:03.210
In fact, it was three years in
that the Admiralty, I think started

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:07.780
to grow apprehensive as to the --
the wellbeing of the expedition

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.640
and gave Clark Ross,
who actually was offered

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.980
but declined the command.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.990
And probably feeling a
certain tinge of guilt perhaps,

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:23.490 position:56%
started to develop a rescue plan
and it's under Ross's recommendation

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:26.520
that the Investigator was
purchased into the Royal Navy.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.230
It was actually building in
Greenock, Scotland we believe

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:30.890
as -- as a -- as a whaler.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:34.850
And it was converted for
Arctic service and along

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:41.520
with H.M.S. Enterprise, made the
first search expedition in 1848,

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.570
heavily modified to
withstand Arctic conditions.

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:49.830
In fact, the -- also under the
supervision of William Rice,

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:52.510
a master shipwright
in the Royal Navy --

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:56.970 position:56%
heavily reinforced with iron plating
in the bow and very thick deck beams

00:39:56.970 --> 00:40:00.150 position:56%
and all kinds of internal iron work.

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:04.010
And so in 1848, Enterprise and
Investigator, under the command

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:07.460
of James Clark Ross -- I think
he took it upon himself to try

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:10.410
to spearhead the -- the search.

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:13.440
They essentially followed in
the wake of Franklin essentially

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:17.400
where he was ordered to
proceed into Lancaster Sound.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:21.270
And that's where they themselves
encountered impenetrable ice

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:23.600
and they were [inaudible]
winter, the northern end

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.970
of Somerset Island at Port Leopold.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:30.760
By the time they did send a
sledge expedition down Peel Sound

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.860
and finding absolutely
no concrete trace

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.660
of the Franklin party having
ventured in that direction,

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:41.270
that may in fact have sealed the
fate of Franklin and his men.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:43.610
The -- given that -- it
persuaded the -- the --

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:46.170
the Admiralty that Franklin did
not proceed in that direction

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:47.620
and it really refocused a lot

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:51.220
of their search efforts
farther west and -- and north.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:56.120
That said, Franklin was certainly
up against a ticking clock

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.320
and it ultimately may have
not have made a difference.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.310
So returning to [inaudible] 1849,

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:06.880
Investigator Enterprise were
hastily outfitted again,

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.340
reprovisioned for a return trip.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:13.160
This time anticipating as we said,

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.760 position:56%
that Franklin must have made it much
farther west, they were sound --

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:20.260
sent around South America and
through the Straits of Magellan,

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:24.300
stopping at the Sandwich Islands
where Hawaii is as Glenn mentioned.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.510
Where the -- by this time, the
two ships had been separated

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:33.190
in a storm off of -- off of
South American and in 1850,

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:37.620
McClure led the Investigator alone
and plunged into the Western Arctic

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.350
and automated into fame and infamy.

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:43.130
So he made very steady progress

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:46.380
in 1850 following along the
North American mainland.

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.010
Again, with the explicit orders
to try to locate some trace

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:51.240
of -- of the Franklin party.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:57.170
So in late 1850, they had
identified Prince of Wales Strait,

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:01.400
one of the -- one of the arteries
of the North-West Passage now.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:05.700 position:56%
And sending a sledge team by October
26, they had identified the --

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.480
in fact, this communicated
with this open body of water

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.780
that had been surveyed

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.840
by Sir William Edward
Perry many years before,

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:17.570
identifying indeed
as a navigable route.

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:22.320
Over wintering in the open pack,
the following navigation season,

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.400
Investigator proceeded
clockwise around Banks Island

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.040
and encountering treacherous
conditions such as this.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:34.790
This is a -- one of Left-tenant
Creswell's iconic paintings

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:37.290
and ironically is almost always
used in the context of talking

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:40.580
about Franklin, not about
Investigator itself.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.800
And I -- hopefully the --
this book and the discovery

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.400
of the wreck site will help to --

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:50.330
to properly restore the
significance of this work.

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:56.020
But as the navigation
season drew close to an end,

00:42:56.020 --> 00:43:02.030
as dusk was descending
and with a driving snow,

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:05.980
the investigators were
following along the northern end

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:10.150
of Banks Island and inadvertently
blundered really into the confines

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:13.600
of -- of what is now
called Mercy Bay.

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.540
They -- stranded on a --

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.960
on a sandbar and spent much of
the next day lightening ship

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.690
and were able to get
it off and that's

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:24.860
where McClure made
the often criticized,

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:28.150
but somewhat logical decision not
to press their luck any further

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:31.060
and that they would
overwinter in Mercy Bay.

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:36.620
Ultimately, they spent two
increasingly harrowing winters

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:39.350
with their provisions
and rations being reduced

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:42.540
and their health failing.

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:47.460
And when things were looking
rather grim and McClure had to --

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:51.630
hatched a plan to send half of
the ship's company off to try

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:55.960
to secure rescue, which would
-- is generally admitted --

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:58.470
have amounted to a death
sentence for all of these men.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:59.940 position:56%
And would simply have delayed the --

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:03.490
the demise of everyone
else left onboard the ship.

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:07.340 position:56%
When a solitary figure appeared over
the horizon coming across the Strait

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:11.200 position:56%
that now bears McClure name, and
Left-tenant Pim from H.M.S. Resolute

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.050
which just happened to
be across the Strait.

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:19.640
And this ultimately is what spared
the investigators the same fate

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.400
that Franklin had by
then experienced,

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:27.110
just the serendipitous
rescue that came

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:30.410
from another Royal
Navy ship in the area.

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:36.490
So, of course, we start -- we
had already started on the --

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:39.700
the more -- more recent search
for the Franklin wrecks,

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.610
Erebus and Terror, when we
took a parallel interest

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:44.910
in H.M.S. Investigator.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:48.730
This shows Banks Island
that we had mentioned

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:52.130
and our interest was supported
by the fact, in Parks Canada

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:56.750
that we happened to
have a national park

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.370
that borders Mercy
Bay here on all sides.

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:04.210 position:56%
This Aulavik National Park or second
northern most park in the country,

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:05.610
which gave us something of a --

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:08.190
of a pretense to go and
search for the ship.

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:13.220
Given that much of the ship's
stores, spars, ship's boats,

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:16.690
significant number of
provisions were landing on shore

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:20.500
as an emergency depot by the
crew and a subsequent party,

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:24.970
after the ship was abandoned
in 1853, and after the rescue.

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:28.380
Beyond that, we had a certain
amount of useful information to go

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.300 position:56%
on archeologically as to where we
might find this ship and this coming

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.810
to us by the hands of Frederick
Cravay [assumed spelling],

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:37.790
who was the master of
H.M.S Intrepid in company

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:40.550
with -- with the Resolute.

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:44.110
And he was sent by the
Resolute's captain, Captain Kellett

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:47.810
to conduct a condition
assessment of Investigator,

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:50.820
a year after it had been abandoned.

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.550
And his sledge team arrived

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:56.200
and encountered Investigator
looking much like this

00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:00.490
with significant amount of
water, solid ice actually

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:04.360
in the forward hold washing over
the freshwater holding tanks,

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.480
down by the head and
listing to starboard.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.990
And that convinced them that
the ship would soon flounder.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:15.700
So he, and his men, and the
sledge team took the opportunity

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:18.920
to batten the hatches, but only
after removing what remained

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.040
of the ship's stores
that were firmly frozen

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.510
in the ice in the hold.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:25.630
And they were added to the --

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:30.850
the depot of stores on the
western side of Mercy Bay.

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:34.610 position:56%
So in 2010, our team, the underwater
archaeology team working closely

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:38.740
with our Western Arctic field unit,
undertook a fairly ambitious search

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.240
for this ship in hopes that
it might be found close

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:45.210
to where it was left
at anchor by the crew.

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:49.820
That said there were competing
possibilities, different hypothesis

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:54.500 position:56%
as to what may have befell the
Investigator after it was abandoned.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.460
The Inuvialuit, which to say the --

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:58.820
the indigenous people
of the Western Arctic,

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:02.880
their reports to the Canadian
Arctic Expedition in 1915 suggested

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.990
that in fact the ship had either
been broken apart on shore

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:08.150
or that it had drifted
out into the open --

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:10.740
open Strait and had
sank in deep water,

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:13.400
which for us would
not be very good news.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.920
But we went to Mercy Bay anyway.

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:20.970 position:56%
And so in July, this is what -- what
the site appeared like after all

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:23.440
of the ice had cleared from
the harbor, sort of the --

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.740
from the -- from the bay.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.250
And in fact as we flew over it

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:29.420 position:56%
for the first time it was
completely stogged with -- with ice.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:31.700
That's what my Newfoundland
wife would say.

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.590
And so after a year of preparation,

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:36.480
we thought that we might
not stand any chance to look

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.030
for it at all -- after all.

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:43.950
But we spent some time setting up
a base camp on the western shore,

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:48.740
slinging load after load by
helicopter from a nearby airstrip,

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:52.920
the ominously named Polar Bear
Cabin and the northern part

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.130
of Aulavik National Park.

00:47:56.130 --> 00:48:00.230
And while we readied our
Marine survey equipment

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:02.300
and inflated our zodiac boats,

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:06.200
a [inaudible] archaeology team
undertook a detailed study

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.590
of the depot or cache site
as it's generally known.

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:11.770
This is Henry Carrie from our
Western Arctic field unit,

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:14.530
an archeologist looking at
the most prominent feature

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:19.870
that survived onshore from the
Investigator Expedition prior

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:21.480
to the discovery of
the wreck site that is.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.950
And that's what -- that's what
remains of the seven tons of coal

00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:31.570 position:56%
that was landed on shore, as well as
a large scattering of barrel staves,

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:35.060
hundreds and hundreds from the
provisions that were put there.

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:39.720 position:56%
This is something that really speaks
not just to the nautical nature

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.550
of -- of the cache, but
the fact that the -- the --

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:47.300
the Inuvialuit made repeated
visits to Mercy Bay to make use

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.680
of these materials for
upwards of 60 years it is said.

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:54.040
And this is actually a frame from
one of the investigator's boats,

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.060
from one of the ribs so to speak
of the boat, and we can tell

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:02.500
that it's a lapstraker, a
clinker built boat given the --

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.100
the edges of this frame.

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:07.510
But every piece you'd find is
broken into links no longer than --

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:10.300
than let's say a foot and
that's so they could harvest

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:13.750
and extract every single copper
and iron fastener from all

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:17.460
of these boats to assist,
you know, their --

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:21.710
survival really, which
affected their material culture.

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:27.280
There are many, many interesting
historical, archaeological

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:31.760
and anthropological parallels that
can be drawn between Investigator

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.920
and Franklin's ships and this
is one of them in a small way.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:41.240 position:56%
Right on top of the cache site faced
down was this bit of boat timber,

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.890
this is actually the stem
of one of the bow timber

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:44.410
from -- from one of the boats.

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:47.950
And as you turn it over, you can
actually see that it's engraved,

00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:50.900
there's a W that stands for the
Woolwich Dockyard, where the --

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:53.200
the ship outfitted in 1850.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.940
A Royal Navy broad arrow mark --
this is government property mark

00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:59.840
which you'll see repeatedly in this
presentation, as well as the length

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:03.110
of this particular
boat, likely 22 feet.

00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:06.280
This immediately reminded
us of a find made

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.580
by the McClintock Expedition, 1859.

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:11.420
All kinds of McClintock
Expedition maps

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:14.320
and books on display here today.

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.510
And by his subordinate
Left-tenant Hobson

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:20.410
on King William Island found the
remains of one of the ship's boats

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:25.630
from Erebus or Terror with
three skeletons in -- inside.

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:29.700 position:56%
And ultimately, the boat's stem was
recovered by the Schwatka Expedition

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:33.380
in 1879 and now is on -- visible

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:36.420
at the National Maritime
Museum in Greenwich, London.

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:39.900
Here we see again, the W
for Woolwich, the date April

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:46.060
of 1845, length of the boat.

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.750
And this was actually
built by contract,

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:51.000
it didn't have a broad arrow
mark, so this a carvel built boat,

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.180
which was often provided to the
Navy -- sorry, a clinker bit --

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:57.870
built boat that was provided
to the Navy under contract

00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:00.110
because the doctors
were doing this anymore.

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:07.840
Also the analysis of the cache
included a systematic magnetometer

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.770
or walking gradiometer survey,

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:13.940
which identified all the magnetic
anomalies from the cache --

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:18.300
hoops from the -- the [inaudible],
small nails, whatever the --

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.210
the Inuvialuit didn't
-- didn't detect.

00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:30.470
But also these three anomalies here
and at east of western [inaudible]

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:34.580
of Western Ontario suspected these
might in fact represent the graves

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:38.180
of the three investigator
crewmen who were not rescued.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:42.650
We know their names, John
Boyle, John Ames and John Kerr,

00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:47.440
who also come to scurvy just before
the -- the Resolute rescued them.

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:51.770
And actually John Moore,
my colleague in the unit --

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:53.070
oddly enough, he was
eating a lot more --

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:57.940
more oranges, not wanting to suffer
the curse of Johns in Mercy Bay.

00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:02.810
And ultimately, if you go exact to
that point on the magnetometer map,

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:05.600
well, you see them,
these outlines of --

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:10.390 position:56%
of three graves where the permafrost
has not slumped because it's held

00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:15.320
up by a coffin, these are
coffin shaped outlines,

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:20.310
which makes us think of the three
Beechey Island graves that were

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:23.240
from the H.M.S. Erebus
and the Terror.

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:29.230
So as the [inaudible] team did
their work, we took to our --

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:33.080
our 19 foot zodiac and conducted a
towed side scan sonar survey to try

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:35.310
to locate the wreck site.

00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:38.060
And in contrast to what you'll see
with the search for Erebus later

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:40.770
in this presentation, this
actually went very, very quickly.

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:45.510
And after a year of
preparation and the effort

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:46.890
of getting all this equipment to --

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:49.710
to the Arctic, ultimately
it took us three minutes

00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:51.030
to locate this wreck site.

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:54.470
I wish it was always that -- that
easy and it certainly is not.

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:57.430
But this is one of the
earlier images, the showing --

00:52:57.430 --> 00:53:01.410 position:56%
showing the Investigator wreck site,
this being the stern and the bow.

00:53:01.410 --> 00:53:05.640
We could tell right away that it
was in remarkably sound condition,

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:08.910
still preserved to, really to the
height of -- of the weather deck,

00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:11.310
the upper deck, although
impacted by the ice.

00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:14.460
And you see ice scouring all
about the perimeter of the site.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:19.230
And this is a little sketch by --
by John, showing the ice conditions

00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:21.210
and we weren't really even
intending to survey that day,

00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:23.230
we were just testing the
equipment because the --

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:25.670
the bay was still solidly
full of ice.

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:29.180
We just had this small serpentine
route that we could follow

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.620
to test the equipment and that just
happened to be exactly where --

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.620
where the wreck was located
and generally very close

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:40.300 position:56%
to where Frederick Cravay pinpointed
it for us kindly enough in 1854.

00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:44.030
So it was a follow -- it was
another year before we can return

00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:46.580
to the wreck site of the
Investigator to dive it,

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:51.900
a very long year for us in the unit
to waiting within anticipation.

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.420
And the -- just an
extraordinary experience

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:57.860
of diving a pristine
shipwreck site this far north,

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:01.850
at 74 degrees northern latitude.

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:04.850
And only when you see it
up -- up close can you --

00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:07.810
can you really appreciate
just the magnitude of it,

00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:09.850
but really just how
well preserved it is.

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:14.460
This is a close up looking at
the stern and the entire hull

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.170
of the ship is clad with
copper because the ship went

00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:20.290
around South America through
the Tropics, stopping at Hawaii,

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:25.700
it was clad in copper to deter ship
boring teredo navalis, a shipworm

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.170
and gribble and that sort of
thing, which would eat the wood.

00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:31.240
And we could still see the copper
and draft marks, which here shows

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:35.150
that we're 12 feet above -- above
the keel and the [inaudible] upon

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:36.450
which the rudder would have --

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:40.630
the hinges essentially that
the rudder would have swung on.

00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:46.270
So we had a very productive time,
we made over 100 dives on the site

00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:50.340
or nine intense day of diving,
often diving until 4 o'clock

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:51.640
in the morning because
at this time of --

00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.450
of the summer, we enjoyed
perpetual daylight.

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:56.460
And here we're inserting
a high definition point

00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:59.310
of view inspection camera into the
nooks and crannies below the decks,

00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:02.570
trying to identify what
spaces would preserve their

00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:04.390
archeological integrity.

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:07.830
Ultimately what we found is that
the entire ship was silted --

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:11.150
silted in, which was disappointing
in a way, but actually bodes very,

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:15.870 position:56%
very well for the preservation of --
of materials down in the lower deck.

00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:19.650
And here we see the 20 odd
cabins for the ship's officers

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:23.430 position:56%
and including the great cabin for --

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:28.930
for McClure in the stern with
Haswell and Creswell and Armstrong

00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:31.240
and -- and everyone else.

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:35.780
And we think that many of these
spaces will actually survive intact

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:39.580
representing small time capsules,
representing the shipboard life

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:41.750
of those specific individuals
which is very exciting

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:44.130
for us as archaeologists.

00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:46.040
And then deeper down into
the bows of the ship,

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.340
beyond what we can glimpse,

00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:52.420
certainly there's just enormous
potential, the botanical

00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:54.050
and biological samples
that are preserved,

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:57.240
probably with their labels even
intact down in the bread room,

00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:02.620
whatever would perhaps remain in
the spirits locker down below.

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:06.950
But other structures like Mr.
Sylvester's patent heating

00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:09.650
apparatus, a coal fired heater

00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:11.890
for warming the ship
in Arctic conditions.

00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:16.350
And we had enough time
to have a good look

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:19.410
and to recover a certain
number of representative

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:22.330
and diagnostic artifacts, not
sure you can see it in this light,

00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:26.300
but the entire site is
covered by a thin lens of silt.

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:29.640
Here you see the outline of a --

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:34.290
of a boot, which upon recovery you
can see is a typical square toed

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:39.020
Arctic sea service boot
very, very much like finds

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:41.310
that have been contributed
to the Erebus and the Terror.

00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:46.540
This Arctic boot from Starvation
Cove where the final survivors

00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:50.450
at that time succumbed we believe.

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:52.850
And really demonstrating
just the very close parallels

00:56:52.850 --> 00:56:57.240
and material culture
that we stand to identify

00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:00.730
between the two shipwreck sites.

00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:04.580 position:56%
Probably the most [inaudible] fact
that was recovered from Investigator

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:10.220
in 2011, and you can just see
it as it was lying in situ,

00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:14.210
there's the trigger
and over here the --

00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:20.790
the butt plate for this very
well preserved 1839 pattern,

00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:22.160
procession-sidewall musket.

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:26.350
Which we carefully wrapped up and
were able to recover to the surface

00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:30.830
and now it's in conservation
treatment at our labs in Ottawa.

00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:34.910
And again, we can find close
parallels to this sort of firearm

00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:37.570
in the relic collection at
the National Maritime Museum.

00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:40.290
From all these implements
from the Erebus and Terror

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:43.520
that were recovered by the
Inuit and ultimately purchased

00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:45.290
by various search parties
in the mid-19th Century.

00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:52.480
In fact, the -- the brass tang
plate on this particular firearm is

00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.660
so well preserved, it
preserves a lot number or a --

00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:55.960
or perhaps even a serial number.

00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:01.650
The date likely of assembly in 1842
and a WXD, which during this period

00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:03.750
of time, actually stands

00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:05.890
for the Woolwich Division
of the Royal Marines.

00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:09.970
So we can actually attribute this
particular firearm to the handful

00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:11.810
of Royal Marines that
were garrisoned to --

00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:16.620
to Investigator for this
second Arctic voyage.

00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:20.320
So in broad strokes, of course,
we can see the progress of --

00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:23.150
of the investigators
where they overwintered,

00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:28.900
ultimately where the ship
was abandoned in 1853.

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:31.330
And they made their way
across the North-West Passage,

00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:33.020
ultimately largely on foot.

00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:36.830
As the Resolute and the Intrepid
were ordered to be abandoned

00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:38.330
when they got trapped
on the ice by --

00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:41.840
by Commander Belcher off of
Cape Covern [assumed spelling],

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:46.940 position:56%
but eventually they all piled onto
a small number of transport vessels,

00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:50.720
including the H.M.S. North Star
and made their way back home again.

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.950
So discovering the
North-West Passage,

00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:57.420
but also affecting the first
European, let's say, transit.

00:58:57.420 --> 00:59:00.460
Although largely on
foot and in the process,

00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:02.520
really the first circumnavigation
of all of north

00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:05.520
and South America at the same time.

00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:08.190
Here of course, is the
reconstructive route taken

00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:12.910
by the Franklin party just to
change gears, which obviously ends

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:17.620
in a dead end here off of
-- of King William Island.

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:20.880
Where the two ships, Erebus and
Terror, are last seen by whalers

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:24.960
in Baffin Bay, where they first
overwintered in 1845 to 1846 off

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.070
of Beechey Island, where
those three graves from --

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:29.490
from that party are located.

00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:31.830
And the following navigation
season 1846,

00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:36.530
we believe they descended Peel
Sound, were beset in ice or trapped

00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:41.280
in ice, the grip of which would
not release these two ships

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:43.320
for the following two years.

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:49.040
So we know from this rather
iconic [inaudible] note that's now

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:53.040
on display at the National Maritime
Museum in Greenwich, which tells us

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:57.800 position:56%
until the discovery really of the
Erebus wreck site of really the most

00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:02.170
of what we -- we know at
least from European sources.

01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:06.410
So in this note, this is kind of
a terse form letter that announced

01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:07.730
that things were going
reasonably well.

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:14.020
In 1847, where they overwintered ,
was signed by Left-tenant Gram Gore

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:19.760
of -- of the Erebus, but they
return to this note a year later

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.890
and left a far more chilling
account in the marginalia.

01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:30.500
This signed now by a -- by
Captain Crozier of H.M.S. Terror

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.880
who now had assumed the --

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.170
the command of the overall
expedition announces

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:37.060
in typically terse
Royal Navy style that --

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.620
that Franklin had died
the previous year

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:42.200
and they don't bother
to say why or how.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.500
And announced their intention

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.990
to desert the two ships
five leagues northwest --

01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:50.030
north north west of this point,
giving us sort of a last report

01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:52.550
of position of where
the ships were last seen

01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:56.250
by their European cruise,
supposedly.

01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:58.730
And that's really where
the historical record ends

01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:00.880
when it comes to Erebus and Terror.

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:05.020
So what we had to rely
on archaeologically

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:08.630
in the search was a
corpus of Inuit's testimony

01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:13.210
from mid-19th Century that
was recorded by a succession

01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:17.660
of search parties and including
McClintock we mentioned, in 1859,

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:21.900
10 years later, Charles Francis
Hall, an American publisher

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:25.150
who felt he was on a mission
from God to -- to save these men.

01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:28.180
Ten years late -- sorry,
10 years after McClintock

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.540
and certainly 20 years too late.

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:35.330
And Frederick Schwatka, a U.S.
Army cavalry officer who was --

01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:39.450
in around 1879 who
probably maintained no hope

01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:41.140
of actually finding survivors,

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:43.240
but the hope that they
might find some --

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:46.170
some telling, written record.

01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:49.610
So, all of this evidence is
kind of [inaudible] captured

01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:52.330
in this UK Admiralty chart --

01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:58.190
chart 5101, which in red shows
observations of skeletal remains,

01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:02.070 position:56%
the -- the sun bleached bones of the
Franklin crew as -- as they are --

01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:04.290
now are strewed across
the landscape.

01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:07.080
But in blue, and this is
all color coded and --

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.290
and mentioned in the legend,
which I've dropped off here

01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:13.550
for display purposes, but the
blue is the Inuit accounts

01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:14.980
and actually specifically
says in the --

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.950
in legend that they're not
inherently trustworthy given

01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:19.250
the source.

01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:23.430
Ironically, with benefit of
hindsight, we now see that in fact,

01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:28.130
it was Inuit testimony
that was instrumental in --

01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:29.800
in our ability to locate the wreck

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:34.860
of H.M.S. Erebus just the
last September in 2014.

01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:38.470 position:56%
Let this shows two possible
trajectories for on one of the ships

01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:43.020
that end up in the -- the southern
Queen [inaudible] Gulf area.

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:46.180
The Inuit's suggest that
the fate of the two ships

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.890
after they're abandoned
somehow parted ways.

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:51.350
That one of the ships
somehow made it farther south,

01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:55.630
the other ship sunk earlier
on in deeper water, they claim

01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:59.100
and that they weren't able
harvest any materials from it.

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:06.180 position:56%
So we've been looking for both -- in
both areas since 2008 and by 2014,

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:10.600
we had amassed over 1200 square --
actually, 1400 square kilometers

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:15.030
of side scan sonar coverage, an
area significantly larger even

01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:19.590
in the area of Los
Angeles, substantial area.

01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:24.970 position:56%
Typically using this tool as the
mainstay of our toolbox in searching

01:03:24.970 --> 01:03:29.420
for shipwreck targets, this is
a toad side scan sonar system,

01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:34.200 position:56%
which produces acoustic two
dimensional images of the sea floor,

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:38.260
identifying superpose objects
including hopefully shipwrecks.

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:43.740
So, over the course of six years,
towing a side scan sonar system all

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:46.680
over the place and staring at
the monotonous flow of the data

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.850
down the sonar screen,
something called a waterfall.

01:03:49.850 --> 01:03:52.830
We had not encountered
a single solitary trace

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:54.710
of anything cultural,
not a log, nothing.

01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:58.150
It is a very barren
landscape, at least to our eyes

01:03:58.150 --> 01:04:02.050
and there was just
nothing, no promising leads.

01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:07.300
Finally in 2014, we
actually caught a break

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:09.560
and actually our trustworthy
archaeology counterparts have been

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:12.850
working with us side
by side since 2008 --

01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:17.220
came across this object
during their effort to set

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.070
up a GPS reference station
with our hydrographic service

01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:21.570
on a nearby island.

01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:25.710
And the helicopter pilot, Andrew
Sterling, came across this object,

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:27.740
which was brought back to the ship

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.580
and pretty quickly
we were actually able

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:32.570
to identify what specifically
it -- it represented.

01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:34.040
And I don't think you can
see it in this lighting,

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.390
but there are two broad arrow marks

01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:40.080
of these ubiquitous
government property marks

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:44.460
that clearly told us this object
came from one of Franklin's ships.

01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:48.980
There are only so many Royal Navy
ships sunk in the area after all.

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:52.780 position:56%
And in consultation with the ship's
plans of Erebus and Terror, in fact,

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:54.620
it is only a couple
of hours before John,

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:57.510
he was able to decipher
what exactly this was.

01:04:57.510 --> 01:05:01.070
And that was a lower pintle,
the anchor point for one

01:05:01.070 --> 01:05:05.280
of the ship's davits for deploying
and recovering the ship's boats

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:10.950
over the quarter -- the
string quarters of the ship.

01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:15.490
So this also told us that a large,
heavy iron object likely indicated

01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:17.190
that a wreck was close at hand.

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:19.820
Something that the Inuit
[inaudible] who had cached

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:22.520
that behind a large boulder would
not want to carry with them all

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:26.300
across the Arctic, being rather
heavy and not terribly useful.

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:29.770 position:56%
So it appears that they broke off
the pintle end and probably fastened

01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:34.290
that into something useful, and
then dumped it where it was found.

01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:38.050
So excitedly the next day
we took to the water again

01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:41.830
and shifted our survey area
a little bit to the east.

01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:44.700
And with our survey vessel,

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:47.280
the [inaudible] research
vessel investigator,

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:51.910
where H.M.S. Investigator was
unsuccessful in locating any sign

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:54.700
of the ship's investigator, the --

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:59.870
the second got lucky
on September 2, 2014.

01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:03.630
And under absolutely
sublime surveying conditions,

01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:07.700
at long last we found
the first images

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.680
and it was absolutely unmistakable

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:10.980
when it first appeared
on the screen.

01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:16.080
This is actually a few passes later
after we approached it differently,

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:21.920
but just the cathartic,
you know, release --

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:28.360
relief really, that after six years
of searching with growing comments

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.850
from the -- the media that,
why were we wasting our time,

01:06:31.850 --> 01:06:35.010
suggestions that even if we found
something, it would be nothing

01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:36.370
but toothpicks on the bottom.

01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:37.670
Why were you bothering?

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:42.130
Finally, this remarkably intact
Royal Navy shipwreck appeared

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:43.430
on our screen.

01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:45.010
At this time, we didn't
know which ship it was,

01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:46.470
that would take quite
a bit of research

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:49.560
as subsequent investigation.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.310
But from the initial sonar
images, we're able to tell

01:06:52.310 --> 01:06:55.310
that it was intact again, to the
-- the height of the weather deck,

01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:59.180
that it was standing given the
acoustic shadow, a full four

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:01.380
and a half or five meters
proud of the seafloor.

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:04.510 position:56%
And we could actually see telltale
signs of the Royal Navy modification

01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:06.000
for Arctic service, so we --

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.740
we were absolutely convinced that
was the ship we were looking for,

01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:12.410
as if there's much doubt.

01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:15.660 position:56%
So excitedly after the announcements
made by our prime minister,

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:18.760
in Ottawa we were all
sent back to the site

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:22.790
and our entire dive team deployed
and excitedly made the first dives

01:07:22.790 --> 01:07:26.980
on the wreck of -- of the --
well, we now know it to be Erebus.

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:30.690
But I would certainly describe
as the most remarkable sensation

01:07:30.690 --> 01:07:31.990
of my professional career.

01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:33.290
There's no doubt about that.

01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:34.920
As everywhere, your eyes were dark,

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.710
there's something remarkable
just lying there,

01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:38.610
tucked in amongst the
collapsed timbers.

01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:42.060
And it was one of the first
things you could see are these two

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:45.450
beautiful brass six
pounder canon just lying

01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:49.070
on the seafloor right
stern of -- of the wreck.

01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:54.230
And this is something I find
interesting is someone who's

01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:55.770 position:56%
interested in -- in steam propulsion

01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:59.840
in the Royal Navy in
the mid-19th Century.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:04.020
This is the outer stern post
and the inner stern post

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:05.320
to get excessively tactical,

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:09.570
but you'll see these cast bronze
railings, these are tracks

01:08:09.570 --> 01:08:13.910
that actually allowed the ship's
two bladed propeller to be lowered

01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:15.490
into position and then
retracted again.

01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:19.770
The Erebus and the Terror were
the first ships to be outfitted

01:08:19.770 --> 01:08:21.280
with a steam driven screw propeller

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:23.410
for the purposes of
polar navigation.

01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:25.870
And so, we're very interested
in studying this as --

01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:30.140
this time Marines -- the Marine's
steam power was still very much

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:31.530
at its infancy.

01:08:31.530 --> 01:08:34.890
And here you can actually see the
-- the tracks and the little slot,

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:38.650
this is where the propeller shaft
would've -- would've rotated.

01:08:38.650 --> 01:08:42.580
And we have, of course, the
reference from the ship's plans,

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:43.920
the National Maritime Museum,

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:47.380
and this shows this rather crude
looking two bladed propeller,

01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:48.870
they didn't even have
the terminology set yet.

01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:52.640 position:56%
They called it the -- the fan blades
of the -- of the -- of the screw.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:56.480
And this does detail what both
the tracks, but the mechanism

01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:58.650
that they would -- they would --

01:08:58.650 --> 01:09:00.960
when retracted, they would
lower these chalks wooden

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.680
and access the tank,
to stop up the plate --

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.830
the space because they wouldn't
want the ice to get a purchase

01:09:06.830 --> 01:09:10.010
on where the propeller was
and -- and rip the stern off.

01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:14.650
And we actually have referenced
this interesting sketch

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:18.280
by Left-tenant Irving
from the expedition,

01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:21.270
actually during their dispatches
sent home from Greenland.

01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:25.760
And in a letter to his sister,
Katie, he, you know, shows a sketch

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.920
and this is one of the
-- the steam engines.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.540
And worth mentioning, of course,

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.940
these were not purpose-built
Marine steam engines,

01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:36.100
they were adapted locomotive
engines from the Greenwich Railway.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:38.940 position:56%
Basically dropped into the aft hold,
turned sideways and with the --

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:40.720
the wheels removed to
drop the propeller shaft,

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:43.790
so really, really interesting.

01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:48.390 position:56%
Something that is interesting about
both ships again, is that they're --

01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:52.060
they represent these
rather unique repositories

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:55.810
of a very obscure Victorian
industrial technology.

01:09:55.810 --> 01:09:59.010
These are the ships
main bilge pumps,

01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:03.120
these are patented Massey double
action lift and force bilge pumps.

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:07.310 position:56%
Something you can't find anywhere
else in the world, you can't even go

01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:10.020
to the science museum and --
and see what these look like

01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:12.980
and how they operate, really
we only have recourse done

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:15.450 position:56%
through the -- our archaeology here.

01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:16.840
There is a close up of
the -- these are the --

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:21.040
the pump heads to be turned
with a big bell crank to --

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.480
to siphon the water
out of the ship's hold.

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:28.270
They wanted to outfit
these ships with the --

01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:31.300
the most capable technology
available given the difficulty

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:34.340
of the task that was hand to them.

01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:36.050
So this is a plan of
the upper deck of --

01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:42.930
of the Erebus, trying
to build pumps there.

01:10:42.930 --> 01:10:46.040
And these illuminators
or deck prisms

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.990
that would filter ambient
light below decks

01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:52.900
to make the place a bit more
hospitable during the long

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.290
winter months.

01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:59.030
And this is actually kind
of hard to see I got to say,

01:10:59.030 --> 01:11:03.010
but here I'm actually looking
through a deck combing,

01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:05.750
so right on top of
the -- the upper deck.

01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:09.360
This is a skylight that would've
been situated directly over top

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:14.430 position:56%
of the -- the ward room, so I can
imagine the sailors casually walking

01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:16.830
by here and eavesdropping
conversations just below here

01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:20.200
between the senior
officers, where probably a lot

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.490
of significant decisions were
-- were -- were mulled over.

01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:27.600
And this is the -- something
we don't commonly see on --

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.650
on shipwrecks, certainly in Canada.

01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:33.350
This is the ship's tiller, but
it's actually solid bronze,

01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:35.470
usually be something
made out of wood.

01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:38.770
And there's the end of its
12 feet long and this is

01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:40.070
where we would notch
into the rudder.

01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:41.840
Essentially this is a big
beam that allowed the --

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.540
the rudder to articulate.

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:46.690
It's bronze, we think,
because the --

01:11:46.690 --> 01:11:50.010 position:56%
the ship's hull was lengthened to
accommodate the propeller, so now --

01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:52.650
all of a sudden the rudder's now
at several feet farther raft,

01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:55.840
so they need a really strong
rudder, this is maneuvered

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.720
by the ship's helm, the
tiller -- or the wheel.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:01.270
So they -- like many features of
these ships, they are heavily,

01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:04.110
heavily overbuilt to
withstand Arctic conditions.

01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:08.780
The -- certainly the
most iconic artifacts

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:12.190
that we encountered right away,
on actually the very first dive,

01:12:12.190 --> 01:12:17.900
this is the ship's bell, the
only artifact we recovered

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:20.740
in the first series
of dives in September.

01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:26.600
And again, it's emblazed into the
-- or embossed actually with the --

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.160
the Royal Navy broad arrow.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.130
And very conveniently, the
date 1845 that would --

01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:33.130
archaeology should always
be that straightforward.

01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:40.380 position:56%
So quickly, we wanted to get back to
the site, we only had two days to --

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:44.130
to reconnoiter the site before the
-- the season ended in September,

01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:47.780
so we went back with our Department
of National Defense in April.

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:50.900
As you could see, it's solid
ice in this point in time.

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:55.890
And the Department of National
Defense set up an ice camp

01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:59.840
for about 50 people right
over top of the wreck site.

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:06.310
And by boring these large holes,
we're able to dive through the ice

01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:09.890
and access the wreck under
very, very stable conditions.

01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:13.720 position:56%
One of these blocks would take about
five hours to painstakingly melt

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:21.070
with -- with a special tool and
then to lift clear of the surface.

01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:25.140
And so working closer with our
fleet diving units of Halifax

01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:30.620
and elsewhere in Pacific Region, we
conducted 80 dives over the course

01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:34.330
of five days and got to know the
wreck site a little bit better.

01:13:34.330 --> 01:13:37.440
I should mention this is
called Operation Inuvialuit,

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.460
who was supported by
the United States in --

01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:44.460
in one respect, that
the camp was demobilized

01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:47.080
by two ski equipped C130 Hercules

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.820
from the New York International
Guard.

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:52.460
And so, these poor guys built
a runway on the ice for weeks,

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:54.310
just plowing snow for weeks on end.

01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:58.160 position:56%
And finally, they were able to land
these gigantic Hercules planes to --

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:02.650
to load all the camp in, which
made things much easier at the end.

01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:06.630 position:56%
So after the April dives, we
started preparing again for a return

01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:09.100
to the site this last
August and September,

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.680
a year after the wreck discovery.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.190 position:56%
And enjoying some of the best
weather conditions we have ever seen

01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:16.920
working in the Arctic.

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:22.970
Our team made in excess of 150
dives, clearing the overgrowth

01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:26.540
of kelp, which concealed a
lot of the ship's structures.

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:30.380
And here you can see just
the remarkable water clarity

01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:32.220 position:56%
that they were enjoying at the time.

01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:35.310
This is like diving the Caribbean
in terms of how far you can see.

01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:37.840
So this is a view of the
port side of the Erebus

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.460
with the exposed upper
deck beams where the --

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:40.810
the deck planking has peeled away.

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:44.720
And looking up at the
bow and you can get a --

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.350
get a sense of how close
is just the surface,

01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:50.190 position:56%
the wreck being only 11 meters deep,

01:14:50.190 --> 01:14:53.750
the top being six meters below
the -- below the surface.

01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:59.720 position:56%
And along the port side, this again,
after all the kelp has been removed,

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:03.420
you -- you really get a sense of
how well preserved the ship is,

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:08.390
the ice channels on either
side of the hull, typical of --

01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:12.350
of Royal Navy ships
of Arctic exploration.

01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:15.870
And subtle details we can
finally see with the kelp removed,

01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:17.170
including the draft marks.

01:15:17.170 --> 01:15:20.310
Here you see this copper
cutout roman numerals,

01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:23.490
showing 20 feet this
height above the keel.

01:15:23.490 --> 01:15:28.150
And what's neat is that they're
half obscured by this iron plating.

01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:32.080
Like Investigator, Erebus
and Terror were both fitted

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:35.650
with a five-sixteenths layer of
-- of plating of the bow to --

01:15:35.650 --> 01:15:38.650
to help protect the bows
from -- from ice damage.

01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:45.800 position:56%
But it's really the -- the artifacts
that tell an evocative story.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.190
Only after they were cleaned
in the lab, could you make much

01:15:48.190 --> 01:15:52.110
out of these two buttons
recovered from the lower deck,

01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:54.010
from actually inside
the ship and it --

01:15:54.010 --> 01:15:56.370
it is hard to see unless
you're holding it in your hand,

01:15:56.370 --> 01:16:01.020
but both show a fouled anchor
over the crown over top of it,

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:02.850
symbol of the Royal Navy.

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:06.600
And the lettering which took us a
while to make out, Royal Marines.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:10.350 position:56%
So both these buttons would
apparently derive from one of the --

01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:12.320
the jackets or tunics
from one of the --

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.770
could be any from either ship,

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:18.030
so one of the 13 Royal Marines
that entered the Arctic.

01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:22.980
And also really delicate
artifacts which tell us something

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:26.680
about life onboard the ship
would only scratch the surface,

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.580
but this is a patented
medicine bottle

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:33.650
and it's embossed the name Samuel
Oxley and the other side, London.

01:16:33.650 --> 01:16:35.970
And Mr. Oxley was a royal chemist

01:16:35.970 --> 01:16:38.960
who at this time had
patented concentrated essence

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:42.690 position:56%
of Jamaican ginger, which apparently
could cure just about anything,

01:16:42.690 --> 01:16:46.250 position:56%
including arthritis and seasickness,
which makes sense given the ginger.

01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:52.940
But also is a cure for
hypochondria ironically enough.

01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:56.470
And then the artifacts
just lying in plain view,

01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:59.670
here you see from [inaudible]
ceramic plates.

01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:03.470
Over here is a -- either a pewter

01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:07.230
or even perhaps a silver
plate, serving platter.

01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:10.410
And this is the circular
deck illuminator,

01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:15.000
one in which has fallen
down into the ship.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.090
After cleaning some
of the -- the poor --

01:17:18.090 --> 01:17:21.550
some of the ceramics
is really quite vivid.

01:17:21.550 --> 01:17:26.260 position:56%
And actually it preserves the -- the
stamps on the back and even the --

01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:31.780
the type, which is a Whampoa
pattern, which a lot of --

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:35.320
of officers serving
in the -- in the --

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.790
in the orient of would
return back to England

01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:39.810 position:56%
with their own personal collections.

01:17:39.810 --> 01:17:45.460
And this is where -- make reference
to when the ship was last seen,

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:50.390
really before -- before we
stumbled upon it in 2014.

01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:54.140
And the Inuit's specifically
mention going onboard this ship,

01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:59.110
that they saw four sets
of footsteps trialing off

01:17:59.110 --> 01:18:03.970
to Adelaide Peninsula nearby,
perhaps the final survivors.

01:18:03.970 --> 01:18:08.820
That finally after the ship was
deserted, we think it would seem

01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:12.620
for a second time [inaudible]
that they went onboard

01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:14.260
and found everything
in complete order --

01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:18.880
the China plates that we see
there, spoons and knives and forks,

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:22.620
likely which if they saw them, they
probably would have taken them,

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.160
being quite useful
to modify the tools.

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:28.750
And this rather interesting
artifact,

01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:31.060
this is a turned wooden table leg,

01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:34.460
it's mahogany with a detach
-- attached stretcher.

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:39.090
And clearly, a table,
of -- but we --

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:40.630
we suspected it might
in fact be this table.

01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:44.510 position:56%
This is an illustration from -- of
the Illustrated London News of 1845,

01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:46.120
during the month of departure.

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:47.480
And actually, purports

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:51.290
to show Franklin's own
cabin and this table here.

01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:55.880
And actually the -- the sonar
imagery shows that a big bite

01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:59.670
of the stern, the great cabin was
bitten away by the ice and a lot

01:18:59.670 --> 01:19:02.580
of these materials now have been
deposited straight to the seafloor.

01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:07.460
So, it's quite possibly
what we see right there.

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:10.160
So this is the area in the --

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:14.550
in the lower deck where we are
encountering a lot of these plates

01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:18.200
and -- and other scientific
instruments

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.550 position:56%
and some other things I'll show you.

01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:24.210
But this is the area where the
common sailors would sling --

01:19:24.210 --> 01:19:26.880
sling their hammocks
and take their meals.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.830
In fact, if you look up at the
-- the upper deck beams overhead,

01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:32.600
you can see the hammock tags with
the numbers on them showing you

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.970
where your particular
allotted space is.

01:19:35.970 --> 01:19:37.450
This is incredible detail.

01:19:37.450 --> 01:19:40.950
Again on the lower
deck inside the ship,

01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:44.740
this is a large chest
apparently some

01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:47.500
of the contents preserved inside.

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:50.230
This we believe would have doubled
as the seats that they used for --

01:19:50.230 --> 01:19:53.560
at the mess tables as
the ship's plans show.

01:19:53.560 --> 01:20:00.540
This very delicate thing here
is -- you can see it here.

01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:06.630
This is a sword hilt or the
handle of a -- of a naval cutlass,

01:20:06.630 --> 01:20:09.400
which still preserves the --
all these subtle details, the --

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:14.820
the sharkskin grip, the lion head
-- the [inaudible] and the --

01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:19.070
even the gold wire braid that kind
of holds the -- the grip together.

01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:23.400
Very, very ornate and really
interesting to us archaeologically,

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:26.460
but quite possibly of no
interest whatsoever to the Inuit

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:30.100
who quite possibly snapped off the
-- the steel blade and discarded,

01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:34.920
you know, this piece of, you know,
useless junk, as they would see it.

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:38.210
So as we go ahead with
the archeological study

01:20:38.210 --> 01:20:40.440
of the wreck of the Erebus.

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:44.270
We now go through -- we now enter
in to a very interesting stage

01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:47.420
where this is showing how
we've divided the area

01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:49.990
into [inaudible] areas
in order to contextualize

01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:53.750
where artifacts come from, to help
us identify associations with --

01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:58.960
with other finds to learn
more about the ship.

01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:03.000
And it's where we'll be in --

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.370
in a position to answer some

01:21:04.370 --> 01:21:06.250
of these more interesting
archaeological questions.

01:21:06.250 --> 01:21:10.870
We believe that the ship was likely
re-manned, as the Inuit's suggest.

01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:14.300
We hope to go and identify
and show how it sank.

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:17.860
We note that there's a [inaudible]
nearby with some materials lost

01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:21.080
or -- or deposited nearby
which possibly means

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:23.650
that they may have escaped
the clutches of the ice only

01:21:23.650 --> 01:21:25.840
to run aground and
have the ship sink.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:29.070
Perhaps they didn't have enough
manpower at this point to --

01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:32.540
to adequate man the ship's pumps
and/or to lighten to get it off.

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:35.050
Hopefully we'll find out.

01:21:35.050 --> 01:21:36.350
In the case of --

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:43.310
of the Investigator where
you can start seeing the --

01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:48.550
the tensions simmering as
men who are on short rations

01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:52.120
and the officers are starting
to second guess, perhaps the --

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:55.860
the command decisions
or at least privately.

01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:58.480
Did the discipline of the
Franklin Expedition breakdown?

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.820
If the men came back to the
ship, was it because the --

01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:06.690
the party had fractured or was
it all survivors at that point

01:22:06.690 --> 01:22:07.990
who returned to the ship?

01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:09.290
We don't know.

01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:12.520
Is -- anthropologically, is there
evidence of the Inuit going onboard

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:15.570 position:56%
and harvesting useful raw
materials, sifting through materials

01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:19.490
on the lower deck, collecting the
knives and discarding the ship's,

01:22:19.490 --> 01:22:24.100
you know, portraits and
paintings and that sort of thing?

01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:28.380
We have to be able to test some
of the prevailing hypothesis

01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:31.650
about what happened to
the Franklin Expedition,

01:22:31.650 --> 01:22:35.180
Inuit reports seeing
unopened tins of -- of meat.

01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:38.760
Maybe we'll find them, maybe
we'll be able to test the quality.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:43.110
The theory of lead poisoning being
a longstanding contributing factor,

01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:45.820
as -- as has been hypothesized.

01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:48.760
So we'll beable to test
some of these views.

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:52.450
And ultimately, archaeologically
we want to figure out what happened

01:22:52.450 --> 01:22:53.890
in the final stages of
the Franklin Expedition

01:22:53.890 --> 01:22:57.280
and what really caused
the expedition to fail.

01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:00.470
Although I -- I think that's
really [inaudible] question

01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:05.390
because I think the Franklin
Expedition failed on May 1845,

01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:07.400
when they received their
orders from the Admiralty.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:10.670
And really that's when
they were directed into one

01:23:10.670 --> 01:23:13.190
of the worst ice choke points
in the Canadian Arctic.

01:23:13.190 --> 01:23:16.300
A place situated along the west
coast of King William Island

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:17.940
where the Inuit would
almost never travel

01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:20.910
because there's nothing
to subsist on.

01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:22.290
What we can tell from the --

01:23:22.290 --> 01:23:26.350
the [inaudible] note left on
King William Island recovered

01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:29.380
by the McClintock party, as
Franklin apparently ordered his --

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:31.770
followed his orders to the letter.

01:23:31.770 --> 01:23:36.080
He was proceeding after trying
to identify a north Polar Sea,

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:39.530
which doesn't exist, but proceeding
southwest to the surveyed part

01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:41.960
of the North American mainland.

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:44.280
I'm not sure that -- that Franklin

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:46.840
and his men really
ever stood a chance,

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:49.450
no matter what they would have
done, which as most brings us

01:23:49.450 --> 01:23:51.860 position:56%
to this interesting question of the
discovery of the North-West Passage,

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:55.640
which -- which Glenn
was speaking to.

01:23:55.640 --> 01:24:00.790 position:56%
And I can't help but think of the --
the Franklin Monument that is placed

01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:06.950 position:56%
in Waterloo Place in London, where
really at the assistance of his wife

01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:11.000
or widow, Lady Jane Franklin,
the credit was given to Franklin

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.060
and his men for forging
the last link

01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:15.130
of the North-West Passage
with their lives.

01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:17.280
This years after the Investigator

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:20.930
and the crew had been awarded
the 10,000 pound Admiralty prize

01:24:20.930 --> 01:24:23.080
for accomplishing that feat.

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:24.650
Of course, they live
to tell the tale

01:24:24.650 --> 01:24:27.520
and that really is the
fundamental difference.

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:31.090
Significantly whoever --
finding Erebus where it lies,

01:24:31.090 --> 01:24:32.850
and given the possibility
that we might be able

01:24:32.850 --> 01:24:34.850
to test archaeologically
that it had been re-manned.

01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:37.420
There's every possibility that the
men onboard that ship new exactly

01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:40.290
where they were and in fact,
knew that they had affected

01:24:40.290 --> 01:24:45.490
that last link and had
linked up with the --

01:24:45.490 --> 01:24:48.130
the shoreline survey by
Simpson [inaudible] in 1839.

01:24:48.130 --> 01:24:51.520
It was probably a small
consolation for the fate

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:52.910 position:56%
that would surely befall on whoever.

01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:55.290
I'll leave it at that and in hopes

01:24:55.290 --> 01:24:57.650 position:56%
that we might have some
interesting questions and discussion

01:24:57.650 --> 01:24:59.070
with whatever time remains.

01:24:59.070 --> 01:25:00.840
And I thank you very
much for your interest.

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.640
Cheers.

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:07.040
[ Applause ]

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:12.960
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Harbster: If you can
-- if you can repeat the questions.

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:14.260
&gt;&gt; Ryan Harris: Yes.

01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:17.490
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Harbster: Do we
have any questions for Ryan?

01:25:17.490 --> 01:25:18.790
Sir?

01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:22.280
&gt;&gt; I'm surprised Canada [inaudible]
analysis of the Erebus site

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:25.440
or search for the Terror
[inaudible] before?

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.740
&gt;&gt; Ryan Harris: Yes.

01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:28.570
The question is whether we're
going to concentrate our efforts

01:25:28.570 --> 01:25:33.030
on steadying the wreck site of
H.M.S. Erebus or also continue

01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:35.520
in searching for the
second ship, the Terror.

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:39.680
And yes, last summer we
did both concurrently,

01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.250
which is quite a challenge.

01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:44.440
And we have instructions
to continue to --

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.710
to try to locate the
second wreck as well.

01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:49.400
And ultimately we look at it

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:53.280
as together these ships are a
designated national historic site

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.640
in Canada.

01:25:54.640 --> 01:26:00.180 position:56%
And really together, we need to have
both to flush out all the details

01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:05.760
of what happened to the
-- to the Franklin party.

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:09.240
Also, first to protect and preserve
that second wreck site for --

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:11.020 position:56%
for posterity, for the benefit of --

01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:14.210
of Canadians and people who
are interested worldwide.

01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:16.640
We have to identify the
wreck site and figure

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:17.940
out what sort of condition it's in.

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:22.860
So yes, we will be continuing that
effort for the foreseeable future.

01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:30.810
&gt;&gt; Two things on the demise
that came to my detection.

01:26:30.810 --> 01:26:34.610
Could Franklin had backed
out when he hit that ice

01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:36.650
that you and I were discussing?

01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:39.480
I had an impression that he had a
shot at getting out [inaudible].

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:45.620
And the second thing, the food
poisoning, hadn't it already set

01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:50.760
into the extent that without
some alternate source of food,

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:53.700
they were going to die anyway?

01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:55.130
&gt;&gt; Ryan Harris: Yes,
very good questions.

01:26:55.130 --> 01:26:58.820
I wish I could say demise with
that sort of a dramatic emphasis

01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:02.870
that you were capable
of, and that's great.

01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:08.040
You has asked when -- when the
ships became beset in Larson Sound,

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:12.720
so north of King William Island
in 1846, was that avoidable?

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:16.680
Ultimately, was -- was
that an error in judgment?

01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:19.050
Well, we don't necessarily know,
I mean, that's sort of difficult

01:27:19.050 --> 01:27:20.350
to reconstruct those moments,

01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:23.720
but what we certainly can say
having surveyed in those waters

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:28.910
for several years now, that the
ice conditions can change very,

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:30.210
very quickly.

01:27:30.210 --> 01:27:33.430
Particularly late in the
season, come late September,

01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:37.290
there's an almost inexhaustible
supply of ice constantly coming

01:27:37.290 --> 01:27:39.450
down McClintock Channel
to the northwest.

01:27:39.450 --> 01:27:44.250 position:56%
And that if the wind -- the wind had
been blowing easterly and then all

01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:47.260
of a sudden swung to the northwest,
very quickly there would be a wall

01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:50.650
of ice right on top of them.

01:27:50.650 --> 01:27:55.730
You can also experience
flash freezes where a change

01:27:55.730 --> 01:27:58.990
in wind direction will bring
remarkably colder temperatures

01:27:58.990 --> 01:28:03.200
and you can have dramatic
freezing right away.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.890
A lot of this information
comes to us

01:28:04.890 --> 01:28:08.480
from a historical ice climatology
study that was conducted for us

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:12.120
by Tom Zagonoff -- Zagon of
our Canadian Ice Service,

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:15.500 position:56%
trying to reconstruct the prevailing
patterns of ice formation drift

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:18.950
and breakup in Victoria Strait to
help us try to narrow our search,

01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:21.780
because otherwise we're left
with a considerable area.

01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:25.350
Also a -- yeah, it's -- it's --

01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:30.340
it's [inaudible] safe if they
would have had anywhere else to go,

01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:32.030
they couldn't necessarily
have just doubled back

01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:33.960
and gone up Peel Sound again.

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.260
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] you
say they could not --

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:37.740
&gt;&gt; Ryan Harris: We don't know, but
it's almost amazing that they got

01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:39.790
down Peel Sound in the first place.

01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:44.100
In the same way that unusual ice
conditions allowed Investigator

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:47.240 position:56%
to enter Mercy Bay in late
September, which we never see today.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:51.520
Somehow Peel Sound happened to be
navigable for Franklin and his men

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:54.420
when it hadn't been for
any other expedition prior.

01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:56.980
So really, the ice it sort
of set the -- the trap.

01:28:56.980 --> 01:29:01.530
I think you might have used this
reference in your book, but yeah,

01:29:01.530 --> 01:29:03.490
they kind of blundered
into it in both cases

01:29:03.490 --> 01:29:06.580
and then couldn't get
out, it's like a snare.

01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:09.840
Also they didn't know at that
time, unless they explored it,

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:12.830
that there was water to the
east of King William Island,

01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:15.110 position:56%
what is now James Clark Ross Strait.

01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:16.410
This was still perceived

01:29:16.410 --> 01:29:20.610
to be a peninsula attaching
to -- to Boothia.

01:29:20.610 --> 01:29:24.660
So yeah, it's a difficult
question, but it's tough -- it's --

01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:26.970
I don't think we can second
guess what happened to them, I --

01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:30.520
I'm sure they were making every
effort to avoid being beset

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.970
in the ice if they
could possibly help it,

01:29:31.970 --> 01:29:34.530
but I doubt it was avoidable.

01:29:34.530 --> 01:29:38.420
And the second part of your
question, sorry I -- I --

01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:40.270
&gt;&gt; Food poisoning --

01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:41.760
&gt;&gt; Ryan Harris: -- food poisoning.

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:45.050 position:56%
Which of course, relates to the work

01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:48.290
of forensic anthropologist Owen
Beattie from the University

01:29:48.290 --> 01:29:53.250
of Alberta, who disinterred the
three graves on Beechey Island,

01:29:53.250 --> 01:29:57.470
was able to collect tissue
samples from -- from hair and --

01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:59.790
and what have you, and was able

01:29:59.790 --> 01:30:03.370
to identify a significantly
elevated concentration

01:30:03.370 --> 01:30:04.670
of lead in those tissues.

01:30:04.670 --> 01:30:07.620
And that led him to hypothesize

01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:12.440
that lead poisoning not necessarily
would've been the fatal outdoing

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:15.140 position:56%
of the expedition, but it may have
been a significant mitigating factor

01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:18.070
that would've clouded their
judgement and made these --

01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:23.170
well would've made it even more
miserable than it already was.

01:30:23.170 --> 01:30:26.560
The theory of lead poisoning has
been subjected to a lot of scrutiny

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:33.940
in recent years and it might be a
prevailing view that we really need

01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:35.930
to revisit that -- that hypothesis.

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:40.190 position:56%
I think the research needs to be
done to identify whether their level

01:30:40.190 --> 01:30:42.970
of lead poisoning was in
any way unusual for people

01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:45.500
from Victorian England,
where lead was ubiquitous.

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:49.190
Used in pencils and
paint, and tobacco tins,

01:30:49.190 --> 01:30:51.860
and lead crystal, lead pipes.

01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:54.580
It was used everywhere and they
didn't know the pernicious effects

01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:55.880
at the time.

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:57.370
So were these lead
levels any different

01:30:57.370 --> 01:31:00.810
from anyone else at the time?

01:31:00.810 --> 01:31:03.420
It's tough to say.

01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:08.280 position:56%
But if it was a problem, then it
would've been exasperated over time.

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:11.330
It would have theoretically
have worsened.

01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:14.650
But no doubt there are other things
that would have been at play.

01:31:14.650 --> 01:31:19.710
Scurvy being the typical ailment
that befalls most artic expeditions

01:31:19.710 --> 01:31:21.610
that happen to linger
past three years.

01:31:21.610 --> 01:31:25.290
And three years really seems to
be this kind of pivotal moment

01:31:25.290 --> 01:31:29.930
where in Mercy Bay, in 1853,
under shortened rations,

01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:34.000
where your body is weaker and
weaker, you hear a concept called

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.470
"Artic Scurvy," I think that
Andrew Lambert talks about.

01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:40.120
Where you're even more subject to
the debilitating effects of scurvy

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:42.680
when you're on shortened
rations and your body is cold,

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:47.180
and you just never get a
chance to recover fully.

01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:50.420
So yeah, I think there's a lot
of research to do to figure

01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:54.100
out really what happened.

01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:56.300
In the back?

01:31:56.300 --> 01:32:01.470
&gt;&gt; I'm curious about your minimum
sources and what form those take,

01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:05.020
and what sort of records
[inaudible]?

01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:07.250
&gt;&gt; Ryan Harris: Yeah, with
a bit more time to drone on,

01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:11.140
I would've gone into
some of those details.

01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:16.400
Really, the search parties in the
mid-19th century, so John Rae,

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:23.210 position:56%
McClintock, Hall, Schlaka [phonetic]
they all interviewed Inuit

01:32:23.210 --> 01:32:25.760
informants, often with the
question, "Do you know anything

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:27.970
about these kabloonak,
these white men

01:32:27.970 --> 01:32:29.930
that appeared however
many years ago?"

01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:31.230
Do you know where they went?

01:32:31.230 --> 01:32:33.580
Do you know where these ships are?

01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:39.830
And in some cases those
accounts are amazingly detailed.

01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:44.910
I mentioned Mr. Petorak [phonetic],
who gives clear indications

01:32:44.910 --> 01:32:48.810
that as they saw, the ship had
been remand in the Queen Mont Gulf.

01:32:48.810 --> 01:32:52.150
That there were fresh sweepings
from under a ship's doors

01:32:52.150 --> 01:32:54.340
that were still being maintained.

01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:57.390
Ultimately, they found
a corpse on board.

01:32:57.390 --> 01:33:00.610
That a heavyset individual
they had difficulty removing,

01:33:00.610 --> 01:33:02.910
so they just left him
on the cabin floor.

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:06.850
An individual we may have come
across archeologically and be able

01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:10.910
to figure out who it was
through DNA sampling,

01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:13.200
and surely that possibility.

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:17.890
And -- but a fairly substantial
of corpus of Inuit observations

01:33:17.890 --> 01:33:19.920
that have been picked
over through the years.

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.790
Certainly David Woodman, the author
from Victoria, British Columbia,

01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:26.640
has probably done the most to try
to weave all of this information

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:28.390
into a coherent narrative.

01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:33.040
As he will point out, the challenge
for historians and archeologists

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:35.530
in trying to Inuit testimony
is that it has been filtered

01:33:35.530 --> 01:33:39.150
through several different
lenses by that time,

01:33:39.150 --> 01:33:41.190
and then well we have
recorded references

01:33:41.190 --> 01:33:45.920
to a shipwreck being gasunken
[phonetic] in Schlaka's [phonetic]

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:52.310
and his party's account eight
miles west of Grant Point.

01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:54.250
The Inuit would not have been west.

01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:55.550 position:56%
They wouldn't have said Grant Point.

01:33:55.550 --> 01:34:00.820
They wouldn't have said east
either -- or west rather.

01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:03.480
That a completely different
world view

01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:07.840
that makes these observations
difficult to decipher.

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:11.490
When they talk about days'
travel -- well a day of travel --

01:34:11.490 --> 01:34:12.790
in terms of gauging distance --

01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:15.730
is a very different thing for
a well Navy sled party as it

01:34:15.730 --> 01:34:22.280 position:56%
with a lightly laden and experienced
group of Inuit who habituated

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.000
to Arctic travel for
their entire lives.

01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:31.940
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:39.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was going to say one
more, because I know we have

01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:49.110
to do the book signing and we
have a lunch reservation at 1:30.

01:34:49.110 --> 01:34:57.350
&gt;&gt; Really quickly, down at the
national archives we're working

01:34:57.350 --> 01:35:06.450
on digitization project where we
are digitizing all the US Navy,

01:35:06.450 --> 01:35:09.550 position:56%
Coast Guard vessel log books,
[inaudible] and posting them online.

01:35:09.550 --> 01:35:12.670
And [inaudible], I was hoping you
could comment on how these types

01:35:12.670 --> 01:35:15.770
of projects -- although many
are going on here at the library

01:35:15.770 --> 01:35:17.710
as well -- how those
projects impact you

01:35:17.710 --> 01:35:21.620
as an underwater archeologist
and [inaudible]?

01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:24.100
&gt;&gt; Ryan Harris: Yes, I could
certainly say that I wish

01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:27.560
that the Smithsonian had
digitized the manuscripts

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:29.980 position:56%
of the Charles Frances Hall, because
they would've saved us the effort

01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:32.630
of coming down and
copy them in facsimile.

01:35:32.630 --> 01:35:33.930
Yes, these are incredible
repositories.

01:35:33.930 --> 01:35:35.230
Research afoot to really
pour into the log books

01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:36.530
of all these expeditions to try

01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:37.830
to recreate climatological
patterns of the mid-19th century.

01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:39.130
It's really an untapped resource
and definitely those sort

01:35:39.130 --> 01:35:40.430 position:56%
of journals will contribute to that.

01:35:45.690 --> 01:35:48.270
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, repeat again what
you're specifically asking?

01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:50.060
&gt;&gt; As an historian, how --

01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:51.590
&gt;&gt; I knew you had fallen asleep.

01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:55.840
&gt;&gt; Well what more resources
are available online

01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:59.750
for these [inaudible] projects
here at the library and elsewhere,

01:35:59.750 --> 01:36:02.340
I'm just wondering how's
that -- how as a historian,

01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:06.800
how is that changing the way
you do internet research or?

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:09.870
&gt;&gt; Glenn Stein: It changes it
slightly in that I use the,

01:36:09.870 --> 01:36:13.400
throughout the time I was writing
the book, I used the internet

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:16.550
as a pointer for where artifacts,

01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:20.130
and certainly repository
for art projects stored.

01:36:20.130 --> 01:36:23.180
But the problem is this, is that
you wouldn't get the whole picture

01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:25.120
unless you were onsite.

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:29.340
And unfortunately you can't
always trust some of the things

01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:33.510
that are actually said in the
records as to what the objects are.

01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:36.840
For instance, one journal
that was described

01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:39.740
in the archives was
not a journal at all.

01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:43.520
It was a book manuscript, a
draft of a manuscript written

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.710
in the form of a journal.

01:36:45.710 --> 01:36:49.110
So it was totally misleading
until I got onsite and I looked

01:36:49.110 --> 01:36:52.780
at the actual item and I said,
"Well, this is not a journal.

01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:57.780 position:56%
This is written like a journal,"
which means, okay, it's been edited.

01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:02.220
So it's very helpful to have these
things onsite or online for me,

01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:05.050
but there's nothing like being
there -- let's put it that way.

01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:06.350
There's nothing like being there.

01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:08.280
You really have to take it all in.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.640
And you will not believe
how much I found

01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:14.160
where I did not expect
to find anything.

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:16.740
Because again, there were
errors in cataloguing.

01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:19.410
Things were not catalogued
necessarily as well.

01:37:19.410 --> 01:37:24.570
And I found other correspondence
in certain folders,

01:37:24.570 --> 01:37:27.760 position:56%
which sometimes was very helpful
and other times had nothing whatever

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.060
to do with what I was looking at.

01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:31.520
So I think you have to be
very careful about that.

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:33.880 position:56%
I think you have to really be there.

01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:35.740
I went twice to England
and spent a lot

01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:37.920
of time looking at
everything I could.

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:39.880
Having my hands on it.

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:43.260
And by the way -- just to
finish off, there's nothing

01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:45.590
like comparing handwriting.

01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:47.750
Because I found-- and this
is what I did with my book --

01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:52.080
I found it very important to
put that an item was a copy

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:54.810 position:56%
of a letter, or a copy of something.

01:37:54.810 --> 01:37:57.510
And you would notice that the
handwriting was not the same.

01:37:57.510 --> 01:38:00.120
So, yes, it was a copy not
in that same person's hand.

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:05.020
It becomes very subtle -- a lot
of subtleties involved here --

01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:08.670
which I hope translated
well into my writing.

01:38:08.670 --> 01:38:14.040
Oh, by the way, I want to mention
that I misspoke when I was talking

01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:16.550
about McClure's anti-steam
[inaudible] mentor,

01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:31.510 position:56%
it was James Clark Ross, not his
uncle, John Ross, who was anti-steam

01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:34.720
and impressed that
so much on McClure.

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:38.000
&gt;&gt; All right.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.950
Thank you.

01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:41.250
So [inaudible]?

01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:45.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just -- can I
sneak in one more question.

01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:49.320
What's left to be done
with the investigation?

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.410
[Inaudible], what has
to be done still?

01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:58.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ryan Harris: Yeah, I mean, of the
200 hours that we have on the wreck

01:38:58.490 --> 01:39:02.820
of the Erebus, we have much
time on record investigator.

01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:09.020
So in fact if we had our druthers,
we probably would've been happy

01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:13.870
with diving on the investigator
to this date, but we're encouraged

01:39:13.870 --> 01:39:17.190
to continue the search for
Erebus and [inaudible].

01:39:17.190 --> 01:39:21.270
It became certainly a source of
great interest for our cabinet.

01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:26.250
So we're eager to go back
to the investigator site,

01:39:26.250 --> 01:39:28.210
but really we're just
scratching the surface.

01:39:28.210 --> 01:39:30.460
In many ways, what we
might stand to learn

01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:34.700
from the Erebus wreck
archeologically might be more

01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:37.810
influential in reconstructing
than the history of what happened.

01:39:37.810 --> 01:39:41.650
As the fate of the investigators
is pretty well documented.

01:39:41.650 --> 01:39:44.350
It is -- I am sure what
Glenn would hope for is

01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:48.080 position:56%
that at some point we'll come across
some preserved paper, materials --

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:49.380
which is not impossible at all.

01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:50.680
With all that silt and the
cold water temperatures,

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:52.170
and the darkness, being covered by
ice for, you know, 85% of the year

01:39:52.170 --> 01:39:53.470
or longer, there's
definitely the prospect

01:39:53.470 --> 01:39:54.770
of those sort of materials
surviving.

01:39:54.770 --> 01:39:56.070
Is there a journal cached in
one of the cabins somewhere

01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:57.370
that never made it off the ship?

01:39:57.370 --> 01:39:58.670
You never know.

01:39:58.670 --> 01:39:59.970
&gt;&gt;Thank you.

01:39:59.970 --> 01:40:01.270
