&gt;&gt; Peter Vankevich:
Welcome this afternoon.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.250
This has been a wonderful day
for the fiction stage here.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.730
I just do want to
introduce Roswell Encina,

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.450
who's Communications Officer
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.850
That sound like one of the best
jobs in the district here, so.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.900
And welcome and we'll go
ahead and let you two proceed.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.200
Thank you.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.500
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Thank you, Peter.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.800
Let's give Peter a
round of applause.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.550
He's been the longest volunteer
for all book festivals,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.050
so we're proud to have him.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.120
And I want to welcome everyone
to the National Book Festival

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.900
on behalf of the Librarian
of Congress, Carla Hayden.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.490
She welcomes everyone.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.790
It's been exciting day.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.200
I know many of you have
been falling inline outside.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.550
We appreciate your patience.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.180
But this is one of our
biggest events that we do here

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.850
at the library not only
here in Washington,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.370
but to all the people who
are watching online as well.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.670
If you're tweeting
or instagramming,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.760
please use our hashtag at, you
know, #natbookfest and we hope,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.490
you know, we'll follow
you around as well.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.850
So, I'm not going to go on and
on about this introduction.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.470
The first time I heard
about Andrew was about maybe

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.530
like 14 years ago, when
the today show picked

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.200
"The Confessions of Max Tivoli".

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.540
I still have my copy
here actually,

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.730
as their book selection
for that month.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.230
I don't think they even
do the book club anymore.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.880
But I think I remember reading
this entire book in one weekend

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.180
and going like who is
this Andrew Sean Greer,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.480
like he's definitely
going to make a mark.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.780
Fast forward to 2018,
earlier this year

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.080
when he wins the Pulitzer
for fiction for his book,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.880
"Less" that everybody
has been raving about.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.120
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.760
Which clearly leads us to today.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.060
So please welcome

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.400
to the National Book Festival
Pulitzer Prize Winner,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.200
Andrew Sean Greer.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.950
[ Applause ]

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.740
And I'm not sure if you guys
can see it, I think we have

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.110
like matching shoes on too,
some to think about it.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.100
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: And
pants further right down.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.830
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: We
didn't plan it, so.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.480
Now, people don't know
here that you're kind

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.780
of like a Washingtonian.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.310
You used to work at
Politics and Prose.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.610
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Yeah, I did.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.910
Yeah.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.210
[ Applause ]

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.240
Back when they were on the
other side of the street,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.540
if anyone remembers that.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.840
Someone must.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.140
Where they box up the books,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.180
all the customers helped
them moved to the other side.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.480
Yeah.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.860
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: So make
sure you go and buy a book

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.990
from Politics and Prose and
get it signed up afterward, so.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.290
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Yeah.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.590
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Let's
talk about the book.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.270
The reviews for it have been
like ridiculously amazing.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.930
So, because I work for
the Library of Congress,

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.910
I feel like I need
to quote a librarian.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.760
During Nancy Pearl's interview
with you, she says, it's funny,

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.520
tender, meaningful and he
hits all the right notes.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.910
And in the interview,
your jaw dropped,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.950
how were you thinking all
these excellent reviews?

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.200
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Well,
I've given instructions

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.420
to my publisher and
my husband only

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.560
to show me the good reviewers.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.660
So, I-- for me, it always just--

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.830
it feels like I miss America
every day and I don't see--

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.650
I'm not aware of any
other ones though.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.950
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Well, here's--

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.010
just a couple weeks ago,
I think you retweeted this

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.310
and it made me chuckle
a little bit.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.610
I don't know who this woman is,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.500
but her tweet is
at Marieke Hardy.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.350
"I just finished a Greer's
exquisite masterpiece less.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.940
And if I ever meet him,
I fear I may just fall

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.420
into his arms and weep."

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.870
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Is she here?

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.870
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: This
is your chance, Marieke.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.340
I mean, this is crazy.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.700
Most people like when
you win the Pulitzer,

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.820
it's always some
tragic or, you know,

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.360
a book that's this thick
but this is a comedy.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.660
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
I think somehow--

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.720
and it made people giddy
online, you know, that that--

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.440
and also other writers
who I talked to got--

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.050
there were sort of like a
wicked chuckle about it because,

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.210
of course, we enjoy
writing all kinds of work

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.580
and then somehow I think a
lot of writers are afraid

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.850
that they're going
to get smashed

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.780
if they do something
funny or satirical

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.080
about the same material

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.310
that they're not taking
it seriously enough.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.610
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Wow.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.910
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: But--

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.210
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Now,
let's get to the book.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.620
I should say I'm a man heading
certain age, I'm not proud

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.960
of it but it's happening.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.460
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Be proud of it.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.040
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: But I can
relate to a lot of the stuff

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.670
that was happening in the book.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.970
There's this one line,
I've got to read it.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.270
So I'm sorry.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.570
Yes, I don't over prepare.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.730
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: I told
him not to over prepare.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.990
The rainbow flag
of tags on this.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.540
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: There's this
one line in the book, it says,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.950
"Strange to be almost 50.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.350
No. I feel like I just
understood how to be young.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.070
Yes, it's like the last
day in a foreign country.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.080
He finally figured out where
to get coffee and drinks

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.760
and a good steak and
then you have to leave

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.790
and you won't ever be back."

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.930
Is that how it is?

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.230
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: A
little poignant too, right?

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.280
It says that-- Well, I'm
only 47 so I have no idea.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.830
But most of my friends are
older than me up into their 60s

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.710
and things and so I've
watched everyone--

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.480
or 90s in crossover a
different thresholds of age

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.350
and they've consistently
given me the advice

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.390
of like what the hell
are you worrying about,

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.690
enjoy yourself right now.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.660
You've got five good years left.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.520
But then they say that they've
been saying that a whole time

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.590
as they got 50 and
60 and then older

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.890
and then I get the impression

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.230
like you always have
five good years left

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.060
until you suddenly don't.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.900
But it is on my mind.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.350
And, in fact, when I was writing
"The Confessions of Max Tivoli",

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.910
which is about a man aging
backwards and where--

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.680
well, as mind goes
forward, I was turning 30

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.990
and I was worried about.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.450
It's adorable now.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.460
It was about a body getting old,
you know, that kind of thing.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.880
So this is me in
preparation for the end.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.300
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Now
despite-- I'm hitting there too.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.120
So, despite the book
being very funny,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.850
I think it's still very sad.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.320
Was this meant to be a
comedy or was it ever--

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.950
did you go through a journey
for it to be a comedy?

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.330
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Well, I
bet you know the answer to this,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.160
which is that it was-- I
actually work on it for year

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.180
as a wistful poignant novel
about a man approaching 50

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.100
and it has the same
characters in it.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.450
And it has about four pages
left of the original draft.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.800
And I really struggled
with it the whole time.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.100
I wasn't happy.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.130
And I didn't know what
I was going to do.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.000
And-- because I couldn't
feel sorry for him, you know.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.970
It just didn't-- It's
too much like me.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.730
And also in the present day in
age, like maybe in 15 years ago,

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.030
I could have written a book

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.640
about like a middle age
white man fairly well to do

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.940
and been like, oh
what a hard life.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.860
But right now, just
doesn't feeling that way.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.740
So I couldn't feel like his
problems were that solid.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.910
So it occurred to me one
day that while swimming

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.430
in the San Francisco
Bay, that, yeah,

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.410
I should just make
it a comedy instead.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.830
And I threw everything
away except three pages.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.840
And I made it the same
problems but made fun of them

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.300
as being not really
worth worrying about.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.400
And I had such a good time
ridiculing someone like myself

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.620
but not entirely like myself,
so that I could use a lot

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.820
of things finally
in my life and--

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.670
and you know what also help me
every day because I would try

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.830
to think of like-- I
would sit in my chair

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.660
and I think what is the
most humiliating thing

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.580
that is ever happen
to you, Andy.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.840
And how could you make it funny.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.030
And it was a great
way to get over it.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.680
And every-- the minor
humiliations of the day

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.740
where you trip over something
in the sidewalk and you try

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.500
to pretend you were doing a
wild dance in the sidewalk kind

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.750
of thing, I would take
notes on all of those

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.100
and it would make
the day a lot easier.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.170
I wouldn't immediately
think it was funny,

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.220
but a few hours later, when you
meet your friends for drinks

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.740
and they say how is your day,

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.850
then I would tell
them this funny story.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.550
And I realized I have
friends, so I think,

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.900
why do funny things
happen to them all the time

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.250
and I realize they don't,
they've just figured

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.920
out through I think sadness
that they can't bear to tell it

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.270
as a sad story and they're
always making it a funny story

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.360
and those people are usually the
professional comedians I know,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.880
are pretty sensitive
to sad things

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.330
and they just turn around.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.770
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: You mentioned
a middle age white man.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.690
There's a part in a book
that talks about the other,

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.910
the book-- within
the book, swift.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.210
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Yeah.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.720
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: That a middle
age white man is not really

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.930
sympathetic and I feel the
same way towards Arthur

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.150
and like am I suppose to like
him or am I suppose to hate him

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.690
because I'm a little
jealous of him

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.960
that everything kind
of came easy for him.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.960
He may be-- you know,
he dated someone

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.910
who was clearly very
successful and was well-known,

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:36.790
then everything just kind of
went very nicely from there.

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.220
Is that supposed how
it's supposed to be?

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.710
I mean, are we supposed
to like him or hate him?

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.010
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: I
think you're supposed to--

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.390
in fact, when I come
across reviews on Twitter

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.100
that say something like I didn't
think I was going to like, oh,

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.430
Roxane Gay is on-- review
on Goodreads was great.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:55.220
She said, "I didn't want to like
this book at all for all kinds

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.810
of ridiculous reasons but I
just couldn't help myself."

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.760
And I was like that's
exactly what I wanted

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.870
in a way I wanted you
to understand like--

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.730
to like enjoy his
minor suffering

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.240
and then eventually
come around and be like,

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.170
well I hope it turns out OK.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.640
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I think
I've got another passage that's

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.630
connected to this,
which I think is kind

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.020
of describes my feelings
about Arthur.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.320
And I guess everybody
else was too

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.640
about if we should hate
him or dislike him.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.300
Here it is, it says, "What
if it isn't even sad?

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.040
For a moment, his entire
novel reveals to himself

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.530
like those shimmering
castles that appear

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.610
to men crawling through
the desert."

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.920
And that's when he realizes that
Swift is not really a person

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.450
that you want him to be.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:41.570
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Yeah, that
you could-- and because, I mean,

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.970
you spend a lot of time in
his head and when you do

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.070
that as a writer it means
that characters going

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:51.310
to seem self-centered
and neurotic and--

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.960
if you like spending time with
the character, you never thinks

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.170
about anything but just
thinks action, right?

00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:01.310
And like Hamlet, you're like, oh
my god, just kill him or move.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:07.830
Yes, so I was-- that
was my game.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.390
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Arthur was
accused of being a bad gay, too.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.390
I mean, maybe some of us
could relate to that but was

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.530
that from any personal
experience as--

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.940
have you been accused of being
a bad gay, have you seen people

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.100
that you think are bad gay men?

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.840
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: I would
never-- maybe some politicians.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.710
But it's not for me to say,

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.020
because what the hell
would that even mean.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.060
No one has said that to me.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:37.070
But except the person in my head
who tells me that I'm a bad gay

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:42.610
for not writing books that are

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.840
about the gay experience
completely.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.350
Like before this book, there
was always been a gay character

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.580
on this as a side character
and that I would be--

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.710
I think I told myself
I was a bad gay

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.490
for not making like
a big gay book.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.380
And I-- and maybe I am,
but I couldn't do it

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.680
like I couldn't figure it

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.510
out without being the wistful
point itself [inaudible] book

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.510
that I was almost going
to write for this one

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.080
until I turned it around.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:14.230
And, you know, I tell
my students I don't--

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:18.110
I teach sometimes and I think
the first day I tell them

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.390
and that's usually a
diverse crowd of people,

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.590
which is wonderful and
I say I know there's

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.390
like a middle age white guy
up here again teaching you

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:27.340
about writing and I know
what you're thinking.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.560
And I say, I think all of
us come from a community

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.890
that we want to speak
for, and that we're going

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.850
to have a conflict in
our writing that we want

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.640
to celebrate and tell the
stories of that community

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.260
and then we also want to
tell the truth about it

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.550
which will sometimes be at
odds with that community

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.690
and the myth it has for itself
and wanting to celebrate it

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.740
but also make it real and human,
you're going to have to figure

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.770
out some middle ground
and you're going

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.790
to let somebody down somewhere.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.490
And you're going to each have to
make your own choice about that

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.530
and I tell them the kind
of choices that I've made.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.630
So, I'm sure I let
somebody down to this book

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.720
but I hope they're
not in this audience.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.020
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: You
brought up a good point though,

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.860
because many books that have a
central character who is gay,

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.410
it's either-- there's always
something tragic that's going

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.650
to happen like-- I mean,
from "A Little Life"

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.190
to "Brokeback Mountain" to that
new book, "The Immortalists",

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.860
always something awful
happens to these people.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.850
But there's this-- including
last but like "Call Me

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.510
By Your Name" and the
"Love, Simon" book,

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.090
they're all just cheerful happy
books that I think no matter

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.400
if you're gay or
straight, you can relate

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.970
to because the central
theme is love.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.360
Is that how you look at it?

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.020
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: I have
nothing else to say to that.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.330
That seems wonderful.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.560
But here's something else
I have to say about it,

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.010
which is that when after
I won the Pulitzer Prize--

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.650
[ Laughter ]

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.990
[ Applause ]

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.060
-- I was-- I tried to
start every sentence like.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:59.310
I think I have one more
month of getting to do that.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.060
And I was-- I had a
job, I was working at--

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.270
I was the director of "A
Writers Retreat" in Tuscany.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.720
I have a very hard life.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.250
It was stranger than you think.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.870
And there was a great writer
there, Terry Tempest Williams,

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:15.960
who's a wonderful nonfiction
writer and naturalist

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:20.790
and wise person and strategist
at Harvard Divinity School

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.020
and I asked her why I should
wear to this ceremony.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.010
And I was looking online
at things I was going

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.290
to get on the reelreal.com.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.980
And she's-- And I was

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.210
like I think I should wear
something very sober and serious

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.210
because it's such
a grand occasion.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.780
And she said, oh no, no.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.380
When people in the
world-- I'm trying to say,

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.060
when people tell you that you
don't count as a human being

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.340
and that your celebrations
aren't real and aren't valid,

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.340
sometimes the greatest
protest you can do is a defiant

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.310
expression of joy
by the red suit.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.610
[ Laughter ]

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.690
And I thought, well, I think
she was-- I think in the book,

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.220
that was me being a good gay was

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:07.240
to have the book be a
defiant expression of joy.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.080
And I wore a red suit.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.620
You can see on Instagram.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.070
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I
remember the tweets.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.460
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
It's really bright.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.370
Vulgar.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.080
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Now,
after reading this book,

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.500
I guess the central
theme is, you know,

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.460
Arthur accepts all
these invitations

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.760
that go around the world.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.630
When was the last time we did
something absurd or last minute

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:29.320
or spontaneous or
as crazy as that?

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.000
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: A few
months ago, or in March.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.020
I-- Departures magazine
asked me if I could go--

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:44.600
it's like dinosaur
attack, right?

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.030
Jurassic Park 7.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:54.880
Book festival, something, oh
my gosh, it's really dramatic.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.760
I'm going to try to talk over
it or work it into my story.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.660
It was something else, super
glamorous, it was like,

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.130
we want someone to
go to the Swiss Alps

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.530
and write about spas there.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.210
And I said I have a job.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.470
Like, I mean, I'm in
Italy but I can't leave.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.500
I mean, I can go away for
three days and they said, OK,

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.220
three days, can you
force bus in three days?

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.920
And I'm like, well,
who couldn't?

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.780
Well, I couldn't because it
involved driving a four-wheel

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:27.410
drive car over the
alps like over glaciers

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.310
where people were
skiing and I would

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.400
like leave a place
in the morning.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.360
I was like, I'm sorry
I have to get a massage

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.300
on the mountain like, two, I
would go as like I can't talk

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.600
to you, I have to
get the massage.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.130
I get the massage, I would sit
in the sauna for long enough

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.580
to be able to write about,
I mean like I have to drive

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.480
to the next massage and-- which
is four hours away and I did

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.060
that for three days
and it was ridiculous.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.810
But also, of course,
like luxurious.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:51.110
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Aha.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:52.410
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
So you can't complain

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:58.810
but you can make fun of yourself
for thinking that was relaxing.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.780
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: How fun was
it doing research on this book?

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.460
Did you have to go to
each of those countries

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.790
to experience everything so
you could cram it all in there?

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.090
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
I mean, I did.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:13.540
It was-- half of-- I was
trying to make money,

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.160
and so I was pitching ideas

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.380
to travel magazines
and food magazines.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.290
And I was the guy who didn't
have like children or a job

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.610
so like I was available
to go to Japan for--

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.900
I was there for four days.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.220
And, you know, I was a couple
trips in before I realize

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.930
that I wanted to put all
of these into my book

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:35.830
because I'm an anxious
person, I would take notes.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.750
If you're alone by yourself,
you just sort of take--

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.720
I just sit and take
notes in a restaurant.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.020
You're there for two hours.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.170
So, you know, I'm not on
my phone taking notes.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.970
And I made-- and then
I realized I was going

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.580
to use all these stuff and then
I had to start pitching ideas

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.570
where I wanted to go, you know.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.350
Japan was when I had pitched,
because I'd thought I mean

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.500
if you go there and I needed
to go India which is hard

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:03.400
to get to, and I forget
where I was going with this.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.840
It was great.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.370
I needed the dinosaur.

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:10.180
Oh, I made-- I have two rules
for myself in writing the book.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.860
One was that I could not
put in any physical detail

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.880
that I had not written
down in my notes.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.660
So, I-- so, none of the
characters are true in the book

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.110
and those things didn't
happen, but every little rock

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:24.960
and like tree and
everything was real.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.350
I took down in my-- it's
because I didn't want to write

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:30.360
like a fantasy over foreign
country and get caught

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.900
up in any cliches
or stereotypes.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.460
I wanted to write down only
what was actually there.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.780
And the second one was that the
joke always had to be on Arthur.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.390
I couldn't make fun of
the country he's visiting

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.920
because I discovered, of
course, going to these places

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.380
that every one there, everything
was running perfectly fine.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.990
I was the thing that
was wrong, you know.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.290
If I couldn't catch the bus,

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.300
it was because I hadn't
figured it out the system.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.740
That because the
system was crazy.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.040
And that's easy to do.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.340
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: It's
such a good point here.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.200
How much of your personal
life are in your books?

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.500
I mean, are you more
like Arthur?

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.800
Are you more like Carlos?

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.700
I think everybody has a Carlos
in their life, you know.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.900
Or more of a Freddie
or [inaudible], so.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.400
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Oh my word?

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.210
Well, I think most writers
would say, no, all part of me.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.730
But this, book, I am a lot
like Arthur because I have

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.400
to really admit even I have
a bright blue suit myself.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.900
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: And you wore
that in your PBS interview.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.590
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Yeah, I
wore it to my PBS interview.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.040
I would have brought it
here but it's really warm.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.290
It was supposed to be
a summer white suit

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.370
but it's really,
really warm, so.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:32.670
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Any inspiration

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.660
from the other people, the
other characters in your books

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.940
from any other people?

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:42.980
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Some are
real and some are not at all.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:47.580
And I hope you can't
tell the difference.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.880
My husband can't.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.290
He got very jealous of Javier.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:54.040
And I'm like, it's not a
real person, it's not real,

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.750
like it's a complete invention,

00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:00.300
and like he didn't notice the
real people in the book at all.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.760
But like some people did because
I will borrow like a dress

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.130
from a friend of mine and put
it in on the character, Zora.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.060
She's dressed just
like a friend of mine.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.100
But she's not like
her any other way,

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.830
but my friend recognized
the dress and she said--

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:19.830
thank me for putting
her in the book.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.650
But it's not her, I know--
my mom always thinks it's her

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.950
if there's a mom in the book.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.110
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: There is
a conundrum here in the book

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.950
that I guess faces a
lot of generation X game

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:34.310
that is the first time we
don't know what the future is

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.700
because I guess the
generation before us it's

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.940
when the AIDS epidemic
hit, so we don't know what

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.240
to do when we get old.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.830
And you confronted this and I
haven't even thought about it

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.520
until I read it on the book.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.040
Where did that come from?

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.570
I mean, I feel like it is very
true and it's very relatable.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.490
But what do we do?

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.210
How do we get old?

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:55.510
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: I
don't know where it came.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:56.910
I was something I had
been thinking about.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:59.330
When the serious
version of the book,

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:03.580
that's what I really
thought about of--

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:08.000
I certainly have older
male friends with HIV

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.300
who sort of survived that.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.130
They're doing great,
young friends with HIV.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.900
But, you know, we
live through a time

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.910
where we watch a generation
died tens of thousands of men.

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:22.490
And those men were the first
men who were out and proud

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:26.290
in the world and making art
and, of course, that's all,

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:31.470
that's all lost, so we never
got to see tons of men get old.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.260
And I guess dignified is
what we're supposed to get.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:40.400
I'm not sure, because it's-- I
guess we should get dignified.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.700
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Yeah.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.000
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
I started to try

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.300
to buy clothes that
aren't as tight.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.190
[ Laughter ]

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:49.600
These pants aren't
a very good example.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.900
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Yeah.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.200
There's a line here that says,

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.220
Arthur Less is the first
ever homosexual to grow old.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.600
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
See, it's overstated.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.900
Humor, yeah.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.770
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: He's never
seen any gay man age past 50,

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:02.220
none except Robert.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.330
He met them all at 40 or so

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.620
but never saw them
make it much beyond.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.160
They died of AIDS,
that generation, lest,

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.940
this generation almost
often feels like the first

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.180
to explore the land beyond 50.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.480
How are they meant to do it?

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.650
I think we're all trying
to answer that question.

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:18.950
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Well, what do you think?

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.250
What your plan?

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.210
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
I don't know either.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.210
Actually, I may have to go
on a trip around the world.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.070
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Trip around the world.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:31.180
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
And discover myself.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.480
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Yeah.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.780
I mean it's-- one good thing

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.080
about being our generation is
I think we came out at a time

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.290
where we were-- had
to like make sac--

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.930
real sacrifices to come out and
the sacrifice would be like,

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.000
I guess I'm just
going to be myself.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.600
And so that seems
like a good pattern

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.740
to go forward is to--
I mean watch out.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:50.350
I would be more and more
myself as I get older.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:55.410
Not to become conservative in
some way and fade in because

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:57.880
that was never what
we were ever doing.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.270
But I don't know what
that would look like.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:09.280
I mean it's-- it was-- I
think it was a political plan

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.090
to be defiantly joyous,
you know, in the face of--

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:17.170
I remember marching on
Washington in the AIDS epidemic,

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.270
and our signs were--
everyone was like,

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.010
like people wearing dragon, you
would have signs that would say,

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:28.590
you know, high heels not
tank wheels, you know,

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.300
stop the Gulf War kind of thing

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.470
like we were funnier
than everyone else.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.270
And that's still my plan like
I don't know if that's going

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.200
to work but it's all I've got.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.180
You know, that's what I
learned in those battles was

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:45.160
to like dress brightly and
like kiss openly and be funny

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.240
and unapologetic, but
be kind and empathetic.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.300
That's my plan.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.200
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I may
have to acknowledge it.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.500
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: See?

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.800
Look at the shirt.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.100
Look, this is how
it's going, right?

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.400
[ Applause ]

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.700
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Should be more opposite

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.000
in my white t-shirt.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.830
I heard somebody say this
like the past couple months

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:06.080
that this is like a
man's "Eat, Pray, Love".

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.380
Do you agree with
that assessment?

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.020
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Oh, eat, gay, love.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.320
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I
don't agree, right?

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.620
But I want to see if
you'd think about it.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.920
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: I
haven't read "Eat, Pray,

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.220
Love", so I don't know.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.660
But I specifically
like he goes to India

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.050
but he does not have a spiritual
experience of any kind.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:26.110
And I spec-- in fact, I
specifically-- he gets himself,

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.380
he thinks he's going
to have this amazing

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.640
like spiritual Indian
experience, but he books himself

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.380
into a loser and retreat scent.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.740
[ Laughter ]

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:41.080
So he doesn't-- but, you
know, come across the--

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.860
his sort of stereotype
of what it's going to be.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.160
He has a different experience.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.720
You know, I did that
specifically

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.740
so that he wouldn't
have a spiritual moment.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.660
It's just him facing
himself, so.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.100
But I guess there must be
like an emotional resolution

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.530
at the end and I guess, love.

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:59.490
There's no eating to speak of.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:01.090
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Well,
he ate in Japan a lot.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:02.390
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Yeah, but that's the end.

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:03.690
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Yeah.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:04.990
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
That's like love--

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.290
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Yeah.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:07.590
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: --

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:08.890
love-eat, love-eat,
love-eat, love-eat.

[ Laughter ]

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:11.490

Time has a lot to do

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:12.790
with a lot of your books.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:14.090
This one's aging.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:15.610
I guess Max Tivoli is aging-ish.

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:19.990
Is that a conscious decision?

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:23.130
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: I remember
sitting next to him on a plane

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:27.360
like 10 years ago or something
and she asked me what--

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.000
you know, you have
that conversation

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.300
of like what do you do?

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.600
I'm a writer.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.900
What kind of writer?

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.200
I'm a novelist.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.500
What kind of novels?

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.800
Fiction. There's no
other kind of novel.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.220
I see how this is going to go.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.770
And she's-- And then she said,
well what do you write about?

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:44.960
And I said love in
the passage of time.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.300
And damn if I wasn't right,

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.380
the whole like it's
been pretty consistent,

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.780
but I don't know why.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.080
I don't know.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.550
I wish I didn't think
about that all the time.

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:55.850
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Before we take questions

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:58.750
from the audience,
has this been--

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.040
have you been approached to
turn this book into a movie

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.960
or like HBO miniseries?

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.110
It could be like big little lies
like each country is an episode.

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:07.940
And have you, do you--

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.440
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: All right,
do you want to produce it--

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.740
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Well--

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.040
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
-- Roswell?

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.910
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Produced by
the Library of Congress, yes.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:15.590
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Oh
produced by Library of Congress.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.080
I don't know if I'm allowed
to talk about it right now.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.380
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Oh boy.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.160
That's a little hint, right?

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.460
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
This could be exciting.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.760
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Yes.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.060
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
If it happens.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.360
That's the thing
about Hollywood like--

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.960
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Who do yo
picture of playing the roles,

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.840
like who do you picture
as Arthur?

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.140
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: I'm
not very good at that.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.140
I was trying to-- like
cast it in my head

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:37.200
but just I'm not very
good because you're

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.130
like Neil Patrick Harris, right?

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:40.430
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Yes.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.730
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Seems obvious.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:43.030
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: A good friend

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:44.330
of mine says, maybe
Jude Law too.

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:45.630
Do you agree?

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:46.930
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Oh Jude Law?

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.230
Sure. But also in my
mind, it was like--

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:49.530
why couldn't Daniel Craig
give it a shot, you know,

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:52.090
like cast against type.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:53.390
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I
think Robert could also be

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.330
like a Richard Chamberlain
from the '80s too.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:57.630
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Oh that sounds great.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:58.930
I mean I think Robert
is exciting --

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.230
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: "Thorn Birds"
like Richard Chamberlain, so.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:01.530
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
-- Thorn Bird, yeah.

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.490
I haven't cast it in my head.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:04.790
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
I think I'm over--

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:06.090
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:09.130
Do you have more
casting ideas from you?

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:10.430
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Let me think about it.

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:11.730
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
And Fred is

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.140
like 35 year olds
dark curly hair.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.440
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Maybe
the guy from "Entourage".

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.740
What's his name?

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.040
Adrian-- what's his name?

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.340
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Great.

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.540
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Yes, anyway though.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.840
Let's keep going on.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.140
OK. Now have to do questions.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:25.440
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Yeah, any ideas.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.740
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: We have
two microphones right here

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.570
to the side.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.840
Oh then we'll keep on
chatting while people are--

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.230
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Like
come up to the microphones

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.160
as slowly as you need to.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.180
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: While
we're waiting, there--

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:42.090
there's been a lot of
debate about the gay novel.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:45.730
Should it be-- should we keep
on calling them a gay novel?

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:47.050
Considering I feel

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:50.830
like literature we've come more
mainstream compared to movies

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:54.690
and TV shows that the main
character in books have

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.320
like for-- I'd say for years,

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.720
there's always been
a gay character.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.750
Should we stop calling them
gay novels or gay books?

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.050
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
There's a reader

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.590
who set main Instagram photo
of her book from the library,

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:11.510
"Less" and on the side of it had
a big sticker that said, gay.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:14.190
[ Laughter ]

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:18.100
It's like-- like
it needs a sticker.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:22.530
But-- and I was-- I found myself
really upset because I was

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.140
like am I in some other
part of the book store?

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.940
Because in her take
she was like,

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.240
look at my progressive
book story

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.540
that labeled the gay
book the way it is.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.010
And I wrote back and I said,
just ask them if I'm next

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:34.650
to the other Pulitzer
Prize winners.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.900
And whatever section there is,

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.440
I'm assuming they have multiple
copies, you know [applause].

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:46.420
That's all, because I
think those labels are

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:50.060
for librarians to decide.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.800
And that-- we're going to--

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.410
because look some of the
greatest stories are--

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:58.460
Andre Aciman is not a gay
man, but he wrote an amazing,

00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:59.870
I guess gay novel, you know?

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:01.880
But what do you call
it at that point?

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.240
Or like Annie Proulx, we
celebrated here has one

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.540
of the great gay love stories--

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:06.840
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.140
And Albertalli's
[assumed spelling]--

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.450
she's a young woman who
wrote about teenage gay.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.750
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Yeah.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.050
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: OK.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.050
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
It's so-- it's, it's um--

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:18.220
then you don't really know who
gets to be in that category

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:22.470
and I think as long
as-- during Prague Week,

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.490
they get brought out, have
a nice display, MO for that.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:28.100
Then anything could go in
that display that celebrates.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.650
And I also-- the gay
novel feels old fashion

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:33.140
because it focuses
so much on men.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:37.250
And that certainly-- I don't
need to see literally myself

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:42.080
in a book to feel moved and
like my experiences being--

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.380
is being celebrated.

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:47.870
So you would want
it to be a book of--

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.800
that reaches out to people who
feel hidden and not understood

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.320
and like the story
hasn't been told.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.140
And there's lots of those, so.

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.440
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
There's plenty.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.910
Well, speaking of plenty,
we've got some questions here.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:58.340
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Oh yeah.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.510
&gt;&gt; So spoiler alert, I
want to talk a little bit

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:02.810
about the end of the book.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:04.110
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Oh dear, oh no.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.410
[ Laughter ]

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:09.070
Everyone has read it.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.370
Can we do it vaguely?

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:11.670
Can we be abstract?

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:12.970
&gt;&gt; I will do my best.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:14.350
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: OK.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:15.650
Be very--

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:19.350
&gt;&gt; I'm gone, I'm done.

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:21.690
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Wait, comment?

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.560
Oh no. Do you want to
whisper it in my ear

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.050
and I'll be abstractly
answer it?

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:29.350
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Well, let me-- well--

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:30.650
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:31.950
Do you want to know whether I
planned it from the beginning?

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.250
[Inaudible].

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:34.550
All right.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:36.630
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Let's
move without giving it away.

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:38.620
The narrator here
is the big mystery.

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:41.040
Was that a conscious
decision to keep

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.710
that little mystery going
throughout the book?

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:45.110
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Yeah, it's actually--

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:49.450
I have to give credit to
Vladimir Nabokov for his book

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:52.710
"Pnin" which has a
similar device in it.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:55.630
And there's-- it's--
and other books do that.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:00.390
And I also like that there's an
old fashion narrator who says I

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:02.150
like the first time that
I met the character,

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:04.040
which is something like books
a hundred years ago used to do.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.720
So there's this play of this,
there are first person narrator

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.200
or third person narrator
throughout the book

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.890
which I think I irritated
some readers initially,

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:14.870
but I think they got over it.

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.980
They're fine now.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.280
Here's one here.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.180
Did that answer your quest--
look, anyway, talk to me later.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.000
We should have not booed her.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.350
No. Celebrate her,
that was excellent.

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:28.650
&gt;&gt; Oh, hi.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:29.950
Oh my god, so I finished "Less"

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.030
about two weeks ago
and I loved it.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.550
And I know that this question
is probably kind of cliché

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:37.010
but if I was going to ask
anyone I want to ask you.

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:40.320
What advice would you
give to aspiring authors?

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.620
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
You're an aspiring author.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.700
Oh my gosh, I mean, enjoy
the hell out of it, I think,

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.130
and trying new things.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:50.740
And I know this sounds
like weird advice,

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.470
but I don't think you should
be afraid to mimic things

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:58.250
or write fan fiction if that
finds you like in the way

00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:59.840
that like art students go

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.630
and they copy Rembrandt
or something.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.510
I don't think you should be
nervous about that as long

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:09.550
as you openly say what
you're sort of learning from.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.820
You don't have to
appear suddenly

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.440
with your own brand
new voice talking

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.440
about things no ones
ever talked about before.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:19.430
The way you get there is by
reading a lot is the main thing

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:21.060
and a variety of things.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.760
And finding the ones
that really respond--

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.290
you respond to and not the
ones that people tell you

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:28.160
to respond to, but the ones
that you really do like I

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:33.470
like to take my students,
I give them each a $5 bill,

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:35.160
someone like 15 students
but still.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.810
And we go to used
bookstore and I tell them

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:38.680
to buy a book they solely--

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.210
that they've never heard of
before based on the cover

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:42.570
and what they read
and see on the back,

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:44.190
something that just calls
to them in some way.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:46.980
And if you do that,
you'll build some sort

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.070
of special library,
all your own.

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:51.200
And then you'll end up
sounding like yourself

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.710
because your influences
would be the ones

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.010
that you chose for yourself.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.170
But mostly, just try
do things all the time.

00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:59.010
Enjoy yourself, yeah.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.310

dreamy, an answer?

I was, no, that's the answer.

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.790

&gt;&gt; Your friends at Green

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.400
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Yeah, of
course, I remember Green Acres.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.700

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.000

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.300
Oh wait, is it Susan?

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.600
You're back.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.070
Oh this is, oh my
god, Susan, hi.

Wait come up, let
me give you a hug.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:30.230

We'll get a picture
altogether afterwards.

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:56.390
How amazing, I just saw
Allison in New Hampshire

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:58.760
and it's-- it was delightful.

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:05.870
&gt;&gt; Just--

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:07.170
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Do I also know you?

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:08.470
What's happening?

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:09.770
&gt;&gt; I'm too old.

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:15.370
I recently finish reading
"Less" and just before that,

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:19.320
I had read a book about the
love life of Gore Vidal.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.050
And it was late-- there's
several books I've read

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:25.430
about Gore Vidal
and by Gore Vidal.

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:29.940
And after listening to you, I
have to say, thank goodness,

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:33.070
you are not going to
wind up my Gore Vidal.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.070
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Because he was so bitter.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:36.370
&gt;&gt; So bitter and sad.

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:40.320
And Gore Vidal went though
his life saying he was not gay

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:45.870
and then he was infuriated if
he was called a gay novelist.

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:49.800
You know, don't-- it
seems like you don't care

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.100
if you're called a gay
novelist, you're just going

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.920
to write what you think
is right for you to write.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.420
And all I've got to say is
that's the best approach.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:02.500
You won't wind up old and bitter
and alone like Gore Vidal.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.800
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Thank you [applause].

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:10.360
But there's still time for
me to do that, but I give--

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.590
for me, I feel like
there was a generation

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:16.780
of the great male
writers that were all

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:18.280
in competition with each other.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.430
And Norman Mailer and
like they all were--

00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:24.350
they didn't seem to have
ended up very happy from it.

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:25.650
&gt;&gt; No.

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:27.540
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: And
when I moved to San Francisco,

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.950
there was a community there
of writers who were open

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:33.060
and generous and
didn't care about rank

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:38.660
and it was Amy Tan who's here
right now, and Armistead Maupin

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:42.380
and Michael Chabon and Dave
Eggers and Daniel Handler

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:48.420
and Khaled Hosseini who were
all supporting each other.

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.070
They were not in
competition at all.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:53.760
And that taught me how
writers are supposed

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.100
to be with one another.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.450
And it is how writers-- I see
them right now like Min Jin Lee

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:00.580
and I have never met but we
talked on Twitter and we were

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.760
so excited to meet each other
right now because we're fans

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.170
of each other, we're
not in competition

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:10.770
because she sells way more
books anyway but like--

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:13.710
I would prefer to be in that
world and there must be another,

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:15.630
well, but writers
are bitter and angry

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:17.670
and I don't want
to participate in.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:20.820
It doesn't seem like
it mix with books.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.920

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.590
[ Applause ]

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:28.940
And someone's like such a
Pollyanna today, I don't know,

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:31.840
but I'm just-- I'm in
a very good mood ever

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.140
since April, yeah.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.440
&gt;&gt; I'm thinking less--

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:39.960
about "Less", but this question
more I think about a story

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.860
of a marriage and a few
of your other books.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.720
But, when you're writing
from the perspective

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.290
of a character who's not
very much like yourself,

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:50.340
how do you get into
that mindset?

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.370
And is that a challenge for you

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:57.700
or how do you go
about doing that?

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.290
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Well,
to me, I feel like it's my job

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:03.260
to write about people
not like myself.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:07.960
It feels like that that fiction
is to try to have empathy

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.000
for people especially
people you disagree with.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.210
But also to represent
other people in the world

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:18.540
that you see with diligence.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:22.990
And that means a lot of thought.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:24.290
And one thing you're touching

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:27.120
on is something that's a touchy
topic right now among novelist

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.990
which is about representation
of people

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:32.140
who are different
racial ethnic groups

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.550
that like how do we
dare represent them.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:40.600
And I think it's a conversation
that is not over yet.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:46.700
But, certainly, it calls upon
us to be basically decent people

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:50.820
and good writers like you're
supposed to write real people

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:56.730
who come alive on the page and
that the reader connects with

00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:01.630
and sees their flaws and their
good points like a person.

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:03.280
That's the job as a writer.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.190
And so, anyone who just dashes
off like I'm going to put

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:10.180
in a sassy drag queen waiter,

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:12.470
like you haven't thought
about long enough.

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:15.000
But that's just your job anyway,
like you should be thinking

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.690
about the characters
more than the metaphors.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:21.920
But I think it's sloppy to--
but-- so I think really hard.

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.130
Like this book I really lost
a lot of sleep putting my--

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:29.600
sending my character to other
countries, like a lot of sleep.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.930
And so I just try to
be really diligent

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:34.760
and not making any
character like a throwaway

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.220
because I wouldn't want to
have throwaway human being,

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:43.700
so I just-- anxiety and doubt
helps you make characters maybe.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.990
Does that answer it?

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:47.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:48.590

My name is Alex and I also
went to college in Montana

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.100
and that's when I was--

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.400
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Yeah, where did you go?

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.700

00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.000
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Awesome.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.300
&gt;&gt; Alex: So-- yeah, but I spend
a lot of time in Missoula.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.600
And it's not always the
place, we have like a lot

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.240
of drag branches
or rainbow flags.

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.220
So I'm wondering if any
of your experiences going

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.740
to school there made it
into this book, and if not,

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.670
how living in Montana
kind of impacted you

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:10.970
as a developing writer?

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:12.270
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: This is--

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:13.570
No one's ever asked
me this before.

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:15.800
I went to graduate school at
the University of Montana,

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.500
in Missoula, Montana
for a few years.

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:21.700
And it was a great experience.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.060
But it was strange.

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.820
I remember people
would say to me,

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:27.770
I've never met a
gay person before.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:29.390
What's it like?

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:31.710
[ Laughter ]

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:34.280
And I had just move from
the West Village which was

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.690
at that point, the gay part
of New York and I'm going

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:37.990
to be like, what's it like?

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:41.530
I don't know, it's great
and terrible and what's it

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:42.830
like for you, and I'm just--

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:45.060
yeah, I get different
experience.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:48.300
Or I did-- I mean this will
sound familiar that like,

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:51.220
you know, like one morning,
I had to word fags keyed

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.010
in to the front of my car.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:56.790
And more upset than me
were my straight friends

00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:00.860
who had never seen this before
and like sanded it off all day

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.970
for me and they were to get
back and I'm like, it's like,

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:07.730
it's not OK but like
it's a shitty car anyway.

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:10.760
So thank you for
sanding it down.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:15.690
But I had to learn in Montana.

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:22.410
You're not going to believe it
how to butch it up a little bit

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:26.360
in like a bar like [inaudible]
bar which was a tough one.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.130
And which was funny
to see that I could

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:31.040
if I bought the right
clothes, I can totally pass

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:35.460
and like play pool and things.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:38.440
And it was interesting to
see that I didn't have to be

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:42.690
in like a bubble of a ghetto
like the West Village was

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:47.290
to find people-- actually, I was
with other writers and I felt

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:49.140
like I had more in
common with them

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:52.770
than I did the man I was meeting
in the bars in the West Village.

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:56.010
And in Montana, people who were
willing to take me out camping

00:39:56.010 --> 00:40:00.100
and who were adventurous and
open minded and explorative,

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.310

found my people there.

Weirdly, even though it
wasn't easy to be openly gay,

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:09.580
it was easy to be yourself
in a different way.

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.800
So, I loved it.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.940

one question on this side.

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:45.230
&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm a middle age woman,

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:47.740
if I plan to live
to be over a 120.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.040
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Yeah!

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.340
&gt;&gt; So I just want to say that as
an older-than-middle-age black

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.640
woman, I absolutely
love that book.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.940
I loved every moment of it and
there's a certain universality

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.240
to it that was wonderful.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.540
I read it and I spoke to my
husband who also would have

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.840
to live to be 140 to
be middle age now.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.140
And he was so happy for me.

00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.440
So when I was getting
ready to come today,

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.740
he was so excited for me.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.040
And I just wanted to kind
of share that with you.

&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Andrew,

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:08.920
do you think you could
have read this book

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.220
like maybe 10 years
ago, 20 years ago

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:14.060
or do you think the tone
of the country helps?

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.600
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Well now,

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:20.770
I finished the book
before 2016 but as--

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:22.080
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Not
today's country, yeah.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.850
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: But that
doesn't mean I didn't feel the

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:27.300
tone of the country
and I think what--

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.210
I didn't know then that
people have told me was

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:37.440
that they needed to read
a book that was, I guess,

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:42.040
uplifting without lying to
them about the way things are.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:46.090
And I deserve that for myself.

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:48.740
And I can't tell you what it
means to have written something

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:52.920
like that and to have
people write me and say,

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.520
people tell me how humane it is.

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:58.510
And I-- that's the best
complement to me when they say

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:02.130
that they've sort of felt
good about other people.

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:04.300
And I don't really know how
that happens from that book,

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.640
but I feel like I can
take credit for it.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:11.980
I think people are in such a
bad way right now and what--

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:16.070
you pick up the news everyday
and you say, God damn it.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:18.400
That, you could go to
something that feels

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:22.210
like maybe reminds you of what
you would really like to be.

00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:25.480
I don't know how
to talk about that.

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.840
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: You've
got a little life shirt on.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.140

Oh yeah you do.

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.740

we'll take your question.

&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
I should do that.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.240
&gt;&gt; So I've really love
the way the last--

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.780
the book end especially the
last word of bucket, so smart--

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.080
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:
Don't give it away though.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.850
&gt;&gt; So, I'm not giving-- I
didn't say the word but I wanted

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:46.980
to know when in the writing
process you knew how you wanted

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.890
to end it and how you wanted--

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:50.550
the specific words
choices you've used

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:51.850
for the ending to be used.

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:53.160
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Now, this
is a kind of question readers--

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.360
writers really like and
readers are very bored

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.960
by which is a technical
question about language

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.250
because we spent a lot of time
on it and then we spend a lot

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:02.730
of time trying for you not

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:05.690
to notice we spent
all the time on it.

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:07.330
But I will say that
I wanted it to--

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:10.350
now it's going to give
away that I wanted--

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:14.010
it won't give away to
the audience but you--

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:19.290
I wanted to joke on the
ending of Joyce's Ulysses,

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:22.350
and the way Molly
Bloom's speech ends there.

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:26.450
And that's kind of-- I based
the rhythm of it all on that.

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.300
And I thought is
this just too much?

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:29.600
Can I really do this?

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.940
But my editor didn't stop me
and I'm like, I'm just going

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.630
to publish it that way.

Because I just thought it would
over the top but like knowing

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.980
that it's a little
absurd and-- why not?

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.280

you see how your book

up your book right when it came

in because I can see
clearly just kind

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.620
of take it home before
it gets processed.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.500

You can't do that.

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:11.460

to buy more and more and more.

take one last question.

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:09.880
&gt;&gt; Hi, just another
word nerd question.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.950
Why did you choose the word--

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:17.850
the name "Less" and were there
any other names or adjectives

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:25.280
that you had considered
for naming a character?

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:29.060
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: I never
considered another name for--

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:35.390
It was mostly-- now it seems
like it's maybe a little too

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:39.330
on the nose but at that
time, it was to remind myself

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:46.870
that I was trying to torture the
character and produce his ego

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:51.440
and his stature so
I could get him.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:57.550
Because I thought-- it's very
hard to write a funny book

00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:01.820
about someone except
if you sort of--

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:05.780
you have to take everything
away to give it back to them.

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:11.250
Because the other thing about a
funny book is, you have to kind

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:16.800
of know from the beginning that
it's going to turn out all right

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:21.720
because otherwise it's
sort of a cruel book.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.910
So-- And then I just--
the name stuck with me

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:29.790
and no one stopped
me so, again, yeah.

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:35.710
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: We'll
squeeze in one quick question?

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:37.010
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:38.310
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Hi.

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:39.610
&gt;&gt; So "Less" was
really enjoyable to read

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:43.560
and like many people in the
audience, we want to read more.

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:46.840
So are there titles that you
can recommend the same vain

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:50.060
as "Less" that are
near and dear to you?

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.850
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Oh
well, that's a good question.

00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:56.090
The same vain gives you the
same kind of feeling like--

00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:57.390
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:58.690
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Because
there's other comic novels

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:01.660
recently like Paul
Beatty's the "Sellout".

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:07.520
I think Lorrie Moore who was
here somewhere is the funniest

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.820
writer I know.

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.380
Also there are sad funny stories
but she's a master of them.

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.480
And I was reading, I think
"Pnin" is funny but it's cruel.

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:15.780
[Inaudible] books
are very funny.

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:17.920
Weirdly, I've been reading
Graham Greene books recently

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.220
because on my next
book I'm hoping

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:20.520
to make also a comic novel.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.820
"Travels with my Aunt",
I find to be a book

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.120
that makes me feel really
wonderful about life.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.420
And we don't think of
Graham Greene doing that

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:25.720
but I think he did
it in that book.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:27.020
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:28.320
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Yeah.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:29.620
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encima: I'll
ask the last question.

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:30.920
So, you said you're 47, any
big plans when you turn 50?

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.220
A friend of mine gave me
an idea to have a party

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.520
at different country
or different city

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.820
for each decade of my life, so.

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:36.120
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer:

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.420
Oh I thought your friend
had an idea for my party.

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:38.720
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encima: Oh yeah.

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.020
Well, there's that.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.320
&gt;&gt; Andrew Sean Greer: Oh we
could, when do you turn 50?

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.620
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encima: I don't want

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:43.920
to share it with
like 500 people.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.220

when I turn 50.

I've got-- don't know.

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:51.720
I've been to a lot of
50th birthday parties,

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.020
and the first friend who've--
turns 50, you like flight it

00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.320
to loom and you're in
an island and you're--

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.620
get drunk and, you
know, there's costumes.

So I think I'm like
the last one.

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.820

No it won't--

it's going to be fun.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.020
Well, thank you everyone.

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:07.320
I hope you go see
Andrew downstairs.
