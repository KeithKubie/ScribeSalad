00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.690
Firmly entrenched in American society, the
seemingly capricious nature of the Fahrenheit

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.270
temperature scale could lead one to think
that its Dutch inventor, Daniel Fahrenheit,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.369
pulled the number for the freezing point (32°F)
of water out of his hat.

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.250
But, in fact, its designation, as well as
that of 0°F were precisely (for the early

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.910
18th century) calculated based upon deliberate
choices about how to establish fixed points

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.910
of temperature.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.960
Engineer, physicist and glass blower, Fahrenheit
(1686-1736) decided to create a temperature

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.910
scale based upon three fixed temperature points
– that of freezing water, human body temperature,

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.800
and the coldest point that he could repeatably
cool a solution of water, ice and a kind of

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.750
salt, ammonium chloride.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.210
It is generally thought he chose these three
points based on an older temperature scale

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.990
created by Ole Christensen Rømer (1644-1710)
20 years earlier.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.280
Under Rømer’s system, brine (the salt-/ice-
water mixture) freezes at 0°, water at 7.5°,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.230
normal human body temperature was 22.5° and
water’s boiling point was 60°.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.720
Desiring to make calculations easier (i.e.,
produce fewer fractions), and to increase

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.530
the precision of the scale by increasing the
number of distinguishable parts within it

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.540
(granularity), Fahrenheit decided to multiply
each value by a factor of about 4, and set

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.740
to work.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.050
According to his published article on the
subject, he started with the brine and a blank

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.020
thermometer; he then assigned the point where
the thermometer was the lowest as 0°F. Next,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.110
he placed the thermometer in still water just
as ice was beginning to form, and eventually

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.090
assigned this 32°F. He then measured human
body temperature and assigned this 96°F.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:07.380
He ultimately chose these two numbers, as
opposed to 30°F (7.5*4) and 90°F (22.5*4)

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.140
in no small part due to the fact that the
64 degrees between the two points made marking

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.380
lines on the thermometer easier (due to the
six equal intervals).

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.770
As water (at sea level and standard atmospheric
pressure) boils at about 212°F in the original

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.780
scale, 180° above its freezing point, this
number was eventually defined as the scale’s

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.000
exact boiling point of water.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.090
This more precise definition ultimately forced
a slight adjustment of normal body temperature

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.460
to about 98°F from 96°F. (Of course, “normal”
body temperature is a bit of a misnomer here,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.660
with it varying from person to person, and
even varying quite a bit in an individual

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.930
based on a variety of factors such as time
of day, age, etc., commonly ranging between

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.120
about 97°F and 99°F.)

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.270
ThermometerAs for the Celsius temperature
scale, it has been around for almost as long

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.080
as Fahrenheit, but it wasn’t nearly as widely
used as today until the conversion of most

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.040
of the world to the metric system in the 1960s
and 1970s.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.510
Anders Celsius (1701-1744) was also a physicist,
as well as an astronomer and mathematician.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.430
Interested in atmospheric sciences, in 1742
Celsius published his finding that the freezing

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.880
point of water was independent of latitude
(something previously debated); he also developed

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.530
a consistent method of calculating the boiling
point of water as barometric pressure changes.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.700
To accommodate his findings, bring even more
rationality to measuring temperature, and

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.940
avoid negative numbers, Celsius designed his
own temperature scale, and assigned 100°C

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.950
as the freezing point of water and 0°C as
its boiling point at sea level (and no, that’s

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.150
not a typo).

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.430
Celsius’ colleague from Uppsala University,
Carl Linnaeus (of the famous taxonomy) is

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.450
reputed to be responsible for reversing the
numbers.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.640
Specifically, in the 1730s, Linnaeus built
an orangery (a kind of conservatory originally

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.980
erected to grow citrus fruits) in Uppsala.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.330
In order to maintain the proper temperature
for his exotic plants, he needed an accurate

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.220
thermometer, which he ordered from the Swedish
instrument maker, Daniel Ekström.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.970
It was delivered in December of 1745, and
in a contemporaneous publication, Linnaeus

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.400
noted that “our thermometer shows 0 (zero)
at the point where water freezes and 100 degrees

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.530
at the boiling-point of water.”

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.630
As this is the earliest record of having switched
the degrees to the modern form, Linnaeus is

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.770
often given credit for the idea.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.660
Up until the latter half of the 20th century,
it was much more common to say “centigrade”

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.220
rather than “Celsius,” with centigrade
deriving from the Latin “centum” (100)

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.040
and “gradus” (steps)- “100 steps.”

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.680
This officially switched in 1948 partially
due to confusion between many other uses of

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.100
“centigrade” in various languages, such
as French where it is used as a name for a

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.750
unit of angular measurement.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.280
However, many did not immediately switch to
using “Celsius” right away.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.060
For instance, the BBC continued to use “centigrade”
all the way up into the mid-1980s on their

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:20.260
weather reports, before finally relenting
and going with Celsius.
