REBECCA MOORE: Thanks
everyone for coming.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.190
My name's Rebecca Moore.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.100
I lead the Google Earth Outreach
Intervention Teams in Geo.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.330
This is a very special talk.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.190
Welcome to the Shaman and
political leader of the Kogi

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.350
people of Colombia, and to
our friends Mark Plotkin

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.130
and Liliana Madrigal of the
Amazon Conservation Team.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.850
We first started working
with ACT in 2007, almost

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.170
exactly seven years ago.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.990
June 7, 2007, ACT brought to
Google the chief of the Amazon

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.480
Surui tribe, Chief Almir Surui.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.980
And he explained to
us the challenges

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.240
that many indigenous people
face around the world

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.260
as their lands are invaded
for timber and for mining,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.760
as their traditional ways
of life are under threat,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.530
and as they struggle to maintain
their traditions and the links

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.320
between the elders in the
youth in the midst of exposure

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.860
to the Western world.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.470
And ironically, Chief
Almir had discovered,

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.230
as the first member of his
tribe to go to university,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.590
that Google Earth could be
a powerful tool in defending

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.480
the lands of his people,
and raising awareness

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.170
around the world of
how their territory was

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.570
under threat, and in fact
use not only Google's mapping

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.710
tools, but tools like Android
smart phones to empower

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.810
indigenous people to,
as Chief Almir said,

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.490
take their destiny
into their own hands,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.930
and strengthen them as a people.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.270
And in fact, through that
collaboration that was,

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.375
again, fostered by ACT
working with Google

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:59.850
and the Surui tribe has
now mapped and measured

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.880
the carbon in their trees
on their traditional lands,

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.210
and they've sold offsets on
the carbon marketplace that

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.840
is bringing millions of dollars
of income into their tribe,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.710
and has enabled them now
to successfully resist

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.980
the illegal logging.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.970
So there's a very
positive case study

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.340
there of the blending
of traditional ways

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.970
with modern technology.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.220
Chief Almir actually
said, the time

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.430
had come to put down
the bow and arrow,

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.510
and to pick up the
laptop, in order

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.160
to defend and
strengthen his people.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.330
So today, we're really excited
to have visitors from Colombia,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.840
again facilitated by
ACT, who've taught us

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.320
that we're not helping.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.810
It's not about Google giving
to these people, these tribes.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.650
It's about creating
a partnership.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.700
In fact, Chief Almir was
quoted in the press as saying,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.770
the Surui don't know
much about technology,

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.200
but Google doesn't know much
about the forests, and we do.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.540
And together we can form
a stronger partnership

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.510
for the benefit of
people and benefit

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.140
of the environment
and the rainforest.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.732
So thank you for coming.

00:03:15.732 --> 00:03:17.690
I'm going to let Jenifer
give a little bit more

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.367
of a detailed
introduction, but I

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:20.950
think you're all in
for a treat today.

00:03:22.664 --> 00:03:24.080
JENIFER AUSTIN:
Thank you, Rebecca

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.720
for coming and introducing,
and for all your work

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.490
in this area with
the Outreach Team.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.610
So my name is Jenifer Austin,
and I manage our Ocean Program.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.240
And I'm excited that
Mark and his colleagues

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.080
are here to talk about
their work in Colombia.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.720
So first I'm going to
introduce Mark Plotkin.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.510
So he studied at Harvard
under Richard Evans Schultes,

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.690
and went on to study at
Yale, and finished his Ph.D.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.690
At Tufts, where he
studied medicinal plants

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.200
in the rainforests
of South America.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.910
And I first met Mark when
the first google.org hire--

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.180
I think that was eight
years ago-- introduced us.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.530
And she said, you've got to
meet Mark, He's really great.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.060
He wrote this
amazing book called

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.050
"Tales of the
Shaman's Apprentice."

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.260
And so I was like, OK.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.170
So we hosted Mark to
come give a book talk--

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.419
I think it was eight years
ago-- and since then, it's

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.000
led to a lot of the work
that Rebecca spoke about.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.200
So it's very exciting
to have him back.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.310
And with that, I'm just going
to go ahead and turn it over

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.060
to you to talk about your work
with the shaman at Colombia.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.830
Thank you, Mark.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.760
MARK PLOTKIN: Thanks Jennifer.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.970
It's great to be back here.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.260
And Jenifer and Rebecca were
the ones who ushered ACT in.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.640
Actually we're a Trojan
horse, because we

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.950
opened the door and all
sorts of Shamans pour out.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.720
That's why we're here.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.075
The power of a partnership with
Google for us is immeasurable,

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:53.750
and I'll give you
a concrete example.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.500
Because when Rebecca and
Mark Austin and Shawn

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.210
went to Brazil, we insisted they
stop at the Federal University

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.310
and do a workshop.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.454
And this is a quote.

00:05:02.454 --> 00:05:03.620
I want you to remember this.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.490
This woman raised
her hand and said,

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.980
why are you here with
all these savages?

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.830
And she pointed at the Indians.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.470
And Rebecca looked
at her and said,

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.060
if it wasn't for
these Indians, we

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.120
wouldn't be here teaching
your kids from Google.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.600
That was a very powerful moment.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.590
Now we have lots to talk about.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.375
And I really want to
turn the floor over

00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:23.600
to our indigenous colleagues.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.820
I will say this, that outside
of the uncontacted tribes

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.360
in the Amazon, these are
the most traditional people

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.810
in the Western hemisphere.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.960
When the Europeans first came
to California 500 years ago,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.260
the Incas ruled Peru,
the Aztecs ruled Mexico,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.340
and the Kogis ruled
the Sierra Nevada.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.770
There are no Aztecs,
text there are Incas,

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.300
but the Kogis thrive.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.830
In the age of climate
change, these people

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.570
are clearly the
masters of survival.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.290
They're the only indigenous
group that lives and manages

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.850
ecosystems from the snow
fields at the top of the Sierra

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.770
Nevada, 15,000 feet high, all
the way down into the oceans.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.624
We never say or think that
these indigenous peoples

00:06:00.624 --> 00:06:01.290
know everything.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.470
Clearly they don't.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.260
But as Rebecca mentioned, we
find that Google doesn't quite

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.220
know everything either.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.060
And it's that type
of partnership

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.360
of you guys in the sky looking
down on the forest canopy,

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.420
and these guys looking
up at the forest

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.840
from underneath, which is
the type of partnership which

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.140
we consider the perfect marriage
of ancient shamanic wisdom,

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.840
and 21st century
Google technology.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.724
And we're proud to
be a part of that.

00:06:24.724 --> 00:06:26.640
Now among the many things
are here to do today

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.520
is launch our map
of Chiribiquete.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.880
Chiribiquete is the
largest and most important

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.480
national park in the Amazon.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.940
It's the biggest repository
of pre-Colombian paintings--

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.670
over 250,000 images-- it's home
to three uncontacted tribes.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.740
So it's biodiversity, it's
art, and it's culture.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.050
And it's fighting climate
change by keeping that forest

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.930
in place.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.290
We have lots of stories to tell.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.887
But most important of all,
is we like to pat ourselves

00:06:50.887 --> 00:06:53.220
on the back and say, the
Americans at the Constitutional

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.890
Convention of 1787 invented the
separation of church and state.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:57.880
Well, we didn't.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.070
That was originally from
Iroquois Confederacy.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.850
And if you read Ben
Franklin's biography,

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.280
you'll get more detail on that.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.930
But that's why today you
have the political leader

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.145
of the Kogis, and you
have the shamanic leader--

00:07:09.145 --> 00:07:11.020
or one of the shamanic
leaders of the Kogis--

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.990
he's actually the
keeper of the oceans.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.070
I want you guys to hear
firsthand from them

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.150
and to be able to ask them
firsthand from your questions.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.990
But I promise you this, you
will leave here frustrated,

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.130
because you will
want to know more.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.412
And the idea of having these
guys come out of the forest,

00:07:27.412 --> 00:07:29.870
come away from the coast where
they're protecting the coral

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.970
reefs, and be able
to address you,

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.760
is the type of thing in
which we take great pride,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.540
and the type of
relationship which

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.780
makes conservation sustainable
and the fight against climate

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.150
change possible and successful.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.130
Because we know we
can't do it alone.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.580
They know they
can't do it alone.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.750
And that's why they're here.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.000
Those of you who leave here
wanting more information--

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.499
which I assume will
be most of you--

00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:54.050
are free to a great movie
called "Elder Brother's, Heart

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.980
of the World."

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.640
30 years ago, a
British filmmaker

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.690
named Alan Ereira
went to Colombia,

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.600
fell in love with the Kogis,
and the Kogis came down

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.520
from the ice fields
and they said, hey,

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.970
what are you little
brothers doing down there?

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.000
You're making a
mess of the world.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.105
Our glaciers are melting.

00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:08.730
And everybody said,
well, that's weird.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.271
That's funny.

00:08:09.271 --> 00:08:10.710
Look at those cute little hats.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.626
Well now we know what
they were talking about.

00:08:12.626 --> 00:08:14.300
They were talking
about climate change.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.880
They were the harbingers of the
fact the climate is changing.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.140
They live close to the land.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.770
They know more
about it than we do.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.390
They've come back to
deliver a message of worry

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.424
and a message of hope, saying if
we work better with them, if we

00:08:25.424 --> 00:08:27.590
work closer with them, and
with the other indigenous

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.130
people and the other
peasant people,

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.040
and form these types
of new partnerships,

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.429
there is hope for all of us.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.710
But I'm going to turn
it over to Liliana,

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.075
who will act as
translator for the Kogis.

00:08:38.075 --> 00:08:39.700
But before we do
that, I'm going to ask

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.002
Brian, our ace cartographer--
who I hope all of you

00:08:42.002 --> 00:08:43.710
will meet, especially
the engineers-- who

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.470
will show a brief piece
that he just put together

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.830
based on the work with
the Kogis by using

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.450
some of your technology and
software here from Google.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.130
Brian.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.220
BRIAN: Thank you, Mark.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.130
And thank you Google for
having us here today.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.220
So as Mark said, I'll be giving
a presentation in Google Earth,

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.092
establishing the context of
where the Kogis are from.

00:09:03.092 --> 00:09:04.800
Talking a little bit
about the geography,

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.870
and the culture, some of
the threats to the area,

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.570
and also what the
Kogis and what ACT

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.250
are doing to help
combat these threats.

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:17.970
So the Kogis are from the
Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.210
It is located in
northern Colombia,

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.460
on the Caribbean coast near
the border with Venezuela.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.890
This is what the Kogis call
the heart of the world.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.260
The Kogis reside on the
northern coast of the Sierra.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.190
The reserve is just
over 400,000 hectares.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.471
There's two other indigenous
groups within the Sierra

00:09:38.471 --> 00:09:38.970
as well.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.860
The Arhuacos and the Kankuamos.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.050
They are very culturally
similar to the Kogis,

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.380
although the Kogis are probably
the most unacculturated out

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.347
of the three.

00:09:48.347 --> 00:09:50.680
As you see, they have a fairly
large indigenous reserve,

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.810
but unfortunately it's
just a small portion

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.450
of their original
ancestral territory, which

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.070
is delineated by the black
line circling the Sierra.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.880
The black line is a project
that the indigenous groups

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.190
been doing to
delineate the extent

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.480
of their formal
ancestral territory.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.940
The white pins represent sacred
sites, which originally started

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.520
off at about 50 you see
here, but they've since

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.800
been elaborating into over 350
sacred sites around the Sierra

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.940
Nevada.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.370
And they're working
very carefully

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.540
to try to reestablish their
control of those sites.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.080
The Sierra Nevada is
5,771 meters high.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.292
Just over 3 1/2 miles.

00:10:32.292 --> 00:10:34.500
It's the highest coastal
mountain range in the world.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.310
The glaciated peaks of the
Sierra Nevada, the melt water

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.810
from these glaciated
peaks feeds all the rivers

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.450
that flow in all directions.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.270
And these are very
sacred to the Kogis.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.387
In fact, the entire
highland area

00:10:50.387 --> 00:10:51.970
is the most sacred
area for the Kogis.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.070
It's where the Kogi
Mamos, or the priests,

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.575
like Mamo Chibolata.

00:10:55.575 --> 00:10:57.700
Only they're allowed to
go, because it's so sacred.

00:11:01.292 --> 00:11:03.000
Among the most sacred
things in this area

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.820
are the glacial-fed lakes.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.910
These are thought to be the
daughters of the great mother

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.030
creator.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.677
And they're also portals
to other dimensions where

00:11:11.677 --> 00:11:13.260
they can communicate
with the spirits.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.230
And as such, the
Mamos leave offerings

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.360
along the banks of these lakes.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.225
They also collect
medicinal plants.

00:11:19.225 --> 00:11:21.100
The Mamos are not only
the spiritual leaders,

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.266
but they also have extensive
environmental knowledge

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.710
of medicinal plants, planting
cycles, things like that.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.610
So they are really the
most important figures

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.670
in the Kogi society.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.284
So this being a
very sacred area,

00:11:32.284 --> 00:11:33.700
it plays an important
role in many

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.380
of the religious ceremonies.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.564
For example, the adolescent
Kogi Mamo apprentices,

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:40.980
they live the first nine years
of their lives in darkness.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.350
And then they're brought up
here around nine-years-old,

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.259
and they are allowed
to see the world

00:11:46.259 --> 00:11:47.550
in daylight for the first time.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.960
It's hard to
imagine the awe they

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.800
must feel to seeing such
a spectacular landscape

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.950
for the first time after living
so many years in darkness.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.522
So the Kogis live on the north
side of the Sierra Nevada.

00:11:58.522 --> 00:12:00.230
This is one of the
most important regions

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:04.390
for biodiversity conservation
because it receives the most

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.280
rain anywhere in
the Sierra Nevada,

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.280
due to the proximity
of the ocean.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.460
So the Sierra Nevada
has many ecosystems

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.300
distributed through thin belts.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.670
The snow line begins
at about 5,000 meters.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.090
The paramo extends from about
3,000 meters above sea level

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.390
to 5,000.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.820
Below that are cloud forest
ecosystems, and below that

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.160
are transitional
rainforest extending down

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.340
to very dry, seasonally
dry, forest along the coast.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.885
So the yellow line here is
the Kogi Indigenous Reserve.

00:12:37.885 --> 00:12:40.260
As you can see, they have very
limited access to the sea.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.830
And this is unfortunate
because the connection

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.420
between the glaciers
and sea is one

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.400
of the most important
things in their culture.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.608
They bring offerings from
the sea up to the glaciers,

00:12:47.608 --> 00:12:51.310
and from the glaciers down to
the sea, representing the water

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.430
cycles of the glaciers
melting, the water going down

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.110
the rivers to the sea,
then being returned

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.920
to the highlands
via clouds and rain.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.806
So the Kogis are very finely
attuned to this cycle,

00:13:02.806 --> 00:13:04.222
and it's because
of that that they

00:13:04.222 --> 00:13:06.570
were able to recognize the
changes that were happening

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.340
in the highlands due
to climate change.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:09.840
And of course,
tropical highlands

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.024
are some of the most affected
areas by climate change.

00:13:14.024 --> 00:13:15.690
You can see along the
coast that there's

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.170
many of the Kogi
sacred sites that

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.197
are outside of their
territory, which

00:13:19.197 --> 00:13:21.780
is very unfortunate, something
we will be talking about later.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.120
Looking closer at
the Kogi villages.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.740
The typical Kogi village
is about 1,500 meters

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.540
above sea level.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.480
Most of the villages are
not inhabited most the time.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.450
The families live in
other scattered houses.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.070
And they only return
to the villages

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.440
occasionally to
participate in ceremonies.

00:13:46.947 --> 00:13:48.280
So this is a photo of a village.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.810
You can see there's-- some
of the larger buildings are

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:52.379
temples.

00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:53.920
Some of these only
the men can enter,

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.730
but they all serve very
important spiritual roles.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.234
These are some of the Kogi men.

00:14:02.234 --> 00:14:03.900
What they're holding
is called a poporo.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.620
It's a gourd filled
with crushed seashells.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.890
And its the alkaloid
that triggers the coca

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.050
leaves that they chew
almost constantly.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:14.190
And the coca leaves
are very important.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:15.849
They provide many
essential vitamins.

00:14:15.849 --> 00:14:17.390
And they also help
with the digestion

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:21.500
of tubers such as potatoes
and manioc at high elevations.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.330
The gourd that they have,
it symbolizes women,

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.900
and the stick
represents the man.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.370
And the act of
sticking the stick in

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.010
is akin to fertilization.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:34.390
So the coca is an important
part of their marriage cycles.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.060
And when a boy becomes a
man, he receives the poporo.

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:41.440
The women in the community
aren't allowed to chew coca,

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.280
but they're the ones
that harvest and grow it.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.529
The threads shown here are
very important to Kogi culture.

00:14:47.529 --> 00:14:49.820
Threads are symbolic of pretty
much everything they do.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.340
Not only the threads
for the bracelets

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.227
and the necklaces and
the beads, but also

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:56.060
all the clothes, which
they make themselves.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:03.410
So the Kogi Mamos tell the
rest of the community what

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.750
to plant, where to plant
it, when to plant it,

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.600
and they always stress
equilibrium and diversity.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.150
So they make sure that
each of the fields

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.180
is planted with many
different crops, which

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.560
is a way to avoid risk in
the Sierra Nevada, which

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:21.620
is a very-- the weather
changes very frequently.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:26.540
And so the Kogis work from
the highlands to the lowlands.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.030
They grow potatoes and
onions in the highlands,

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.160
plantains, bananas, manioc
in the mid elevations,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.280
as well as coca.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.230
And in the lower elevations
they have more tropical fruits,

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:41.000
as well as cash crops such
as pineapple and coffee.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.670
And this range of
elevations that they

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.690
take advantage of
for food results

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:50.060
in a lot of pilgrimages
up and down the mountain,

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:54.130
which is a very characteristic
part of Kogi society.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.460
It's very common to see
them walking up and down

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.530
the mountain, passing
coca leaves to each other

00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:59.571
as they greet each other.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:06.690
The Kogis maintain many
of the cultural traditions

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.080
of the Tairona society, which
is the pre-conquest culture

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.200
in this area.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.410
There's still many
remnants of this society,

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.217
including what's known
as the Ciudad Perdida--

00:16:17.217 --> 00:16:18.425
the Machu Picchu of Colombia.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.450
This is the Tairona
settlement that was first

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:29.130
inhabited around 400
A.D. And at one point,

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.670
the entire Sierra
Nevada was inhabited

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.780
by the Tairona
culture, particularly

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.210
the Northeastern part
near the sea, which is now

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:41.380
the location of the
city of Santa Marta.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.130
So at one point,
this entire valley

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:46.100
along the Northwest
part of the mountains

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.342
would have been
irrigated and there

00:16:48.342 --> 00:16:50.300
would've been scattered
settlements throughout.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.480
And now it's major sprawling
cities, banana plantations,

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.720
and things like that.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.170
Also notice the Parque
Tairona, in the front

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.060
of the screen with the
green line around it.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.270
That's one of the most
beautiful coastal landscapes

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:01.936
you'll ever see.

00:17:01.936 --> 00:17:03.600
It's where the
mountains meet the sea.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.260
And it's also the
location of only one

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.447
of three reefs in Colombia.

00:17:08.447 --> 00:17:10.530
The other two are actually
far away from Colombia,

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:15.680
so this is the only reef
near the Colombian mainland.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.359
It's also of note because
there were several Tairona

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.970
settlements within the park.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.910
And those are being
returned to Kogi control

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.159
after having been out of
their control for many years,

00:17:25.159 --> 00:17:27.450
and victims of grave robbers
and things like that.

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.300
So there are four major
sites that the government

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.970
is returning control
of to the Kogis.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.760
Which is a very positive thing.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.090
Unfortunately there
are many threats

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.725
to the Kogi way of life.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.980
The first of which
is-- this is an area

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.194
with a lot of carbon
extraction shipping going on.

00:17:51.194 --> 00:17:52.860
So this is an example
of one of the coal

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.360
ports around Santa Marta.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.890
There's not only
extractive industries,

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:06.050
but this is also a very
heavily touristted area.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.850
There's resorts all
along the shores,

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:10.210
and they're building
water slides and hotels

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:14.140
on top of Kogi sacred sites.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.290
And just the sprawling
urban environments

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.420
have really taken over
many of the sacred sites

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.510
along the coast.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:25.420
Also notice, this is the
first coal port in the area.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.720
It was also around this area
where just recently there

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.700
was a massive coal spill
where the company had

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.977
overloaded one of the barges.

00:18:32.977 --> 00:18:34.810
And in order for the
whole ship not to sink,

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.920
they had to dump
coal into the bay.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.600
This was one of the worst
environmental catastrophes

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.160
in Colombia.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.260
It was recently outlined
in the Economist magazine.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.916
But this was such a
bad event that Colombia

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:47.790
had to completely rethink
their coal exports,

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.390
the way they're regulating
coal extraction and everything.

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.650
So It actually
halted their exports

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.347
to the United States
because of this.

00:18:54.347 --> 00:18:55.930
And they're trying
to clean it up now,

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.070
but they dumped so
much coal into the bay,

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.890
that it's pretty devastating.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.430
And this is very close
to where the reefs are

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.420
in Parque Tairona.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.570
Looking at the other
side of the Sierra,

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:12.150
there's also many extractive
industries going on.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.880
This is Cerrejon.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.840
This is one of the
major mining sites.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.001
This is along the
Rio Rancheria, which

00:19:18.001 --> 00:19:19.750
is one of the major
rivers that comes down

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.057
from the glaciers to the sea.

00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:27.180
And also along the Rio
Rancheria is the major dam

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.060
which has completely
stopped up the river.

00:19:35.647 --> 00:19:36.480
There's some photos.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.990
So that's--
particularly the damn.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.596
It's really-- the Kogis
are very concerned with how

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:41.720
we're affecting the rivers.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.985
Not only at the lower
areas, but the way

00:19:43.985 --> 00:19:45.860
that those changes are
going to affect what's

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.985
happening in the highlands.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.680
And now looking at what's been
ACT and the Kogi's main area

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.040
of focus, is the coastal
region along the north

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.890
side of the Sierra.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.790
So this is a coal port.

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.090
And a coal power plant.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.380
And the port shown on
the left was actually

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.720
built on top of one of the
Kogi sacred sites called

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.010
[INAUDIBLE].

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.722
So this is the port
in construction.

00:20:14.722 --> 00:20:16.180
It's now fully
finished and they're

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.250
exploring coal from here.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.820
And this was the Kogis
trying to access this site.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.767
And the police got called in.

00:20:22.767 --> 00:20:24.850
You can't see in the band,
but this is essentially

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:26.660
a SWAT team/riot police.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.340
They came in to
prevent the Kogis

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.110
from entering their sacred site.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.610
Now in response to
these challenges,

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:35.010
the Kogis have been very
aggressive in trying

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.060
to reclaim their territory.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.590
The Kogis are
extremely cohesive.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.775
It's very unusual for
an indigenous group,

00:20:41.775 --> 00:20:43.900
but they've managed to they
save up a lot of money,

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.630
and are working to reclaim
some of their territories.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.030
Starting with Habatani Guaxaca.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.130
This was a sacred
site that the Kogis,

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.370
with help from ACT and
the Colombian government,

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:57.709
bought last year.

00:20:57.709 --> 00:20:59.500
This is one of the
first times that they've

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.500
been able to recapture
one of their sacred sites

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.582
along the coast.

00:21:02.582 --> 00:21:04.040
We're also looking
at consolidating

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.680
the other territory with the
other property along the Rio

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:11.200
Jerez to the west.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.670
So you can see the Kogis are
now able to go to the site.

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:17.181
They built a temple there
where they can have ceremonies.

00:21:17.181 --> 00:21:19.180
They're also working on
cleaning up the beaches.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.580
Most of the beaches
in the Sierra Nevada

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.663
are littered with garbage.

00:21:21.663 --> 00:21:23.225
So this is one site
where the Kogis

00:21:23.225 --> 00:21:24.350
have been able to clean up.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.320
And it's an important
site, because it's

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.778
one of the major sites where
they were able to find the sea

00:21:28.778 --> 00:21:30.450
shells they use to
trigger the coca.

00:21:33.826 --> 00:21:35.700
And this is just the
first step in the larger

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.982
territorial process.

00:21:36.982 --> 00:21:38.940
As you can see, there's
many other properties--

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.398
as shown in the
orange boundaries--

00:21:40.398 --> 00:21:45.420
that the Kogis are looking to
acquire with the goal of not

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.030
only establishing another
connection from reserve

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:50.991
to the sea, but also a
corridor along the sea

00:21:50.991 --> 00:21:53.126
to protect all those
coastal sacred sites.

00:21:53.126 --> 00:21:55.500
Not only are they looking at
acquiring some of these most

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.083
sacred properties,
but they're looking

00:21:57.083 --> 00:21:59.080
at working with some
of their neighbors

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.740
who are currently
practicing environmentally

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.260
destructive habits
around their land.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.380
And the Kogi have found
that these neighbors are

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:10.380
very willing to learn to
manage their properties more

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.910
sustainably if they know how.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.580
So the Kogis are
working with them

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.330
to better manage these
coastal properties.

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.960
So this is just an overview
of their entire territory,

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.820
showing some sacred sites
they're trying to reclaim.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:27.380
And I guess in closing, it's
important for the Kogis,

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.717
for their culture, their
diet, pretty much everything

00:22:29.717 --> 00:22:31.550
about their society,
to have this connection

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.320
from the mountains to the sea.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:38.107
So we think there's a lot of
potential of using programs

00:22:38.107 --> 00:22:39.690
like Google Earth
and things like that

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:43.329
to help the Kogis
do characterizations

00:22:43.329 --> 00:22:45.620
of these properties, map out
the corridors that they're

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.200
trying to preserve.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.929
And we hope to help
the Kogis reclaim

00:22:48.929 --> 00:22:50.470
their ancestral
territory and protect

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.330
their coastal sacred sites.

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:55.710
So we're going to turn
it over to the Kogis now.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:23:36.170
KOGI SHAMAN 1: [SPEAKING KOGI]

00:23:36.170 --> 00:24:01.795
INTERPRETER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:24:01.795 --> 00:24:03.170
INTERPRETER 2: So
good afternoon.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:05.540
My name is Jose [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.560
I come from the Sierra Nevada
Santa Marta in Colombia.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:14.020
And I live in a sacred
village called [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:20.080
And we've come out to share
the message of our ancestors.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:26:24.780
KOGI SHAMAN 1: [SPEAKING KOGI]

00:26:24.780 --> 00:27:24.140
INTERPRETER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.790
INTERPRETER 2: So for
a very long time-- 30,

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:31.430
40 years, we didn't want to
come down from the Sierra.

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:35.970
But when we did, we found
that the younger brother that

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:40.890
is non-Kogis, have
gotten really big.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:44.260
And they've grown, but they've
grown in material ways.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:51.910
And what they've done is they
haven't grown with nature,

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:56.990
with spirituality,
with the forest.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.420
We continue to do that.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:04.285
And this is why we come
out to share this message.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:29:59.260
KOGI SHAMAN 1: [SPEAKING KOGI]

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:59.430
INTERPRETER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:00.890
INTERPRETER 2: OK.

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:04.470
I'm sure you know we're losing
a lot in this translation.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:08.360
But yeah.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:12.160
So it's going from Kogi to
Spanish to English, right?

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.990
And this is
following a protocol,

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.770
because even though he's
the governor of the Kogi,

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:18.620
the elders are the
ones who speak.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:19.770
They always do that.

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:23.300
So he has to be very
obedient about that.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:30.405
But what he just said is
that our creator [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:30.405 --> 00:31:33.601
and there are other two
names which I don't remember.

00:31:33.601 --> 00:31:34.100
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:36.631 --> 00:31:38.350
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:42.400
Those are deities, creators.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:48.500
And they were charged with
taking care of the planet,

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.500
with taking care of diversity.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:57.770
And they were left with the
legacy-- a map, if you will--

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:03.980
of that diversity
that cannot be seen.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:10.006
The diversity of
thought and spirit,

00:32:10.006 --> 00:32:17.330
of being able to-- a map that
doesn't exist in writing,

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.140
in material form.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.210
A map of how to
interpret the oceans.

00:32:27.810 --> 00:35:21.030
KOGI SHAMAN 1: [SPEAKING KOGI]

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:55.030
INTERPRETER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:56.880
INTERPRETER 2: He--
Mamo [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:02.020
says that it is the
spirits of the trees,

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.930
and the spirits of the
water, and the oceans

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:12.170
that have conveyed to them how
sick the oceans are becoming.

00:36:14.730 --> 00:37:14.380
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:17.730
INTERPRETER 2: So he says
that the younger brother is

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:24.460
able to fly, and is able to
have a lot of technology.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.310
And they see a lot of things.

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:31.850
But what they don't
see is that they see.

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:35.590
OK?

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:44.060
So it would be very important
if you could have the two

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.440
and grow in that way.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.110
Is what I am understanding.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:52.590
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:55.120
So it's those two.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.500
Yes, you can do a lot of things.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:01.580
But there are others that
you'll never be able to see.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:40:01.170
KOGI SHAMAN 1: [SPEAKING KOGI]

00:40:01.170 --> 00:43:05.385
INTERPRETER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:43:05.385 --> 00:43:06.760
INTERPRETER 2: So
a long time ago

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:11.401
when it was just indigenous
people all over South America,

00:43:11.401 --> 00:43:12.650
they didn't have any problems.

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:14.840
But then nowadays
obviously, you know,

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:20.560
we had to learn to
coexist with other people.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:26.900
And so now we need to be
able to explain to the world

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:31.880
that in the sacred site, in
the Sierra Nevada, that's

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:38.770
where our wisdom, our
spirituality, our culture,

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:41.570
that's where these
things are kept.

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:47.280
And if we don't protect them,
we're going to disappear.

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:55.050
So we need a map to be
able to get other people

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:58.270
from the outside
world to understand

00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:00.080
why we are important.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.960
Because otherwise, they're
destroying us little

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.740
by little out of ignorance.

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.700
And so we need to
have those maps.

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:11.960
Now yesterday I heard that
we were going to a place

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.640
where they do these maps.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.150
And I had no idea what it was.

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:19.990
I felt that it was maybe
there was this huge apparatus,

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.320
or a giant mountain.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.020
I had no idea what to expect.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.920
And I walk in here
and they say this

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.010
is the place where
they make the maps.

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:30.470
And I said, really, this is
where these maps are made?

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:37.660
And he says and so, we are
here because Lilia, and Mark,

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:40.680
and Juana, and ACT
are our messengers,

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.490
because otherwise we
wouldn't be able to be here.

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:47.940
So I was shocked that you
took me to my village.

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:51.560
And he says, I'm sitting
here, and you went down there.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.620
You took me there.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:56.670
So that tells me that we
need to work together.

00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:00.400
So that people can
understand what's at stake.

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:42.760
[SPEAKING KOGI]

00:45:42.760 --> 00:47:23.795
INTERPRETER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:47:23.795 --> 00:47:25.170
INTERPRETER 2: So
he wants to end

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:27.397
by saying that he feels
really strange being here

00:47:27.397 --> 00:47:28.730
because everything is so square.

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:32.560
No pun intended.

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:44.170
And but yet he sees that
you guys can see a lot.

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:48.250
And that it would
be really great

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:54.840
if you could work with them
in some really basic things

00:47:54.840 --> 00:48:01.060
in their territories,
so that you can see.

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:08.680
And being here, his thoughts
will be here with you.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.090
His way of thinking
will be here with you.

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:12.890
There's some very
basic things that

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:19.790
can be a huge help to them, and
thank you for receiving them.

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.850
I just want to say, just
one little thing that Mamo

00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:30.620
[INAUDIBLE]-- the way that
these people make decisions,

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:33.440
it's all by consensus, and
it's all by the elders.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:39.880
And everybody else is-- it
has to be very deferential.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.370
And Mamo [INAUDIBLE]
is one of the five most

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:47.810
knowledgeable Mamos,
and he is the one

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:50.057
that has a relationship
with the ocean.

00:48:50.057 --> 00:48:52.390
And it was weird, because
another guy was going to come,

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:54.723
and at the last minute he
decided he couldn't handle it.

00:48:54.723 --> 00:48:59.630
So we had already sent out
invitations with his picture

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:00.310
on there.

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:02.080
And then it was like,
no, he's coming.

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:05.330
So it's been really great
because sitting around,

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:07.070
especially at night,
talking to him,

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:12.230
he's able to convey
information and ideas

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:15.490
about the relationship between
the mountains, and the forest,

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:21.080
and the oceans in ways that
are incredible and fascinating.

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.610
So it's a real treat
having them here.

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:27.430
MALE SPEAKER: I have a question
about the Kogi language.

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:29.140
And there must be
so much information

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:32.220
encoded about your
tradition and the heritage

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:34.150
that you've been
able to protect,

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:36.100
encoded into this language.

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:39.500
And I understand that most
members of the Kogi community

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:41.260
are monolingual, and
right now the threat

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:43.630
is very low of language shift.

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:46.860
But I was wondering if younger
members of the Kogi Community

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:48.680
are adapting to learn Spanish.

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:53.380
And if that is in any way a
distant or immediate threat.

00:49:53.380 --> 00:50:33.271
INTERPRETER 2:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:50:33.271 --> 00:51:06.062
INTERPRETER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:51:06.062 --> 00:51:07.520
INTERPRETER 2: So
the way that they

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:11.260
manage language, culture,
and everything else is,

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.530
the elders manage that.

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:15.090
And it's under their care.

00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:16.780
And they don't
put it in writing.

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:18.800
So the knowledge
of those who are

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:21.230
going to be knowledge
keepers and Mamos,

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:22.650
it's all oral transmission.

00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:28.760
INTERPRETER 2:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:33.450
INTERPRETER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:36.160
INTERPRETER 2: And you
have places like the cave

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:40.410
that they talked
about before, where

00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:43.820
the knowledge transfer happens.

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:47.110
And they do like, reading of
bubbles, and things like that.

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:52.700
FEMALE SPEAKER:
What stressing signs

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:58.200
do you see in the ocean that
are most concerning to you?

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:07.290
INTERPRETER 2:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:20.689
INTERPRETER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:52:20.689 --> 00:52:22.105
INTERPRETER 2: So
the first change

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:24.270
is along the
mountain range, it's

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:27.420
just the climate and
how it's shifted.

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:32.810
It's no longer its normal range.

00:52:32.810 --> 00:53:43.350
INTERPRETER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:45.320
INTERPRETER 2: So
at first he said,

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:50.050
we've been able to persevere
through a lot of-- climate

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:52.460
change is causing
a lot of stress

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:56.550
and causing a lot
of cultural changes.

00:53:56.550 --> 00:54:00.620
But we adapt.

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:06.930
Even from before, when there
was war, and illicit crops,

00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:10.200
and other threats, we adapted.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:14.550
But now that we're
going-- this is

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:16.000
due to the Mamos
and the influence

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.430
that they have over us.

00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:21.570
So I said but they want to know
specifically about the oceans.

00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:23.760
And what he's
saying is that, they

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.650
rely on these sacred sites
for getting the offerings.

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:31.060
Because everything that they
use has to have an offering

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:32.850
when its used.

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:35.860
And so what they
are noticing is how

00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:40.350
those offerings, those materials
from the ocean, are shifting.

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:59.210
INTERPRETER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:01.730
INTERPRETER 2: So
they have-- the poporo

00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:04.570
that he has is filled
with pulverized shells--

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:06.310
a specific shell.

00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:10.470
And that's shifting.

00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:13.530
And so the minute
that those disappear,

00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:17.560
they're going to
have to either adapt,

00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:19.730
or I don't know what's
going to happen,

00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:21.570
but that to them is fundamental.

00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:24.360
And that's changing.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:51.510
INTERPRETER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:52.940
INTERPRETER 2: And
so before, they

00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:55.000
used to live a very long time.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.105
It was normal to live to 120.

00:55:58.105 --> 00:56:01.280
But people are living
shorter lives now.

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:04.096
And they see that as a weakness.

00:56:04.096 --> 00:56:09.900
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:22.802
INTERPRETER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:56:22.802 --> 00:56:24.260
INTERPRETER 2: So
they're finding--

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:27.110
they're doing these
surveys to recognize--

00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:29.380
to do surveys of the sacred
sites along the coast.

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:32.276
And what they found is
that a lot of the shells

00:56:32.276 --> 00:56:33.620
that they use, they're deformed.

00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:36.230
Totally deformed.

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:37.537
Or huge.

00:56:37.537 --> 00:56:39.370
REBECCA MOORE: We
probably have to stop now.

00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:44.900
But I wanted to give you
guys all a 20% opportunity,

00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:46.910
including Google Colombia.

00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:50.590
That we're going
to be having lunch

00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:55.440
in Crave with our guests
from Colombia and ACT.

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:57.750
You're welcome to join us.

00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:59.680
If you're interested
in collaborating

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:04.820
on this kind of project,
contact me or Jenifer.

00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:06.270
If you have any
time and you want

00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:10.700
to get into using Google Earth,
Google Maps, or some whatever

00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:14.140
tools might be useful
to help them on behalf

00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:17.840
of the little brother
working with these

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.320
indigenous folks from Kogi.

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:24.600
So please thank them for
bringing the message to us.
