00:00:00.065 --> 00:00:01.565
- [Voiceover] In the
introduction to ecology,

00:00:01.565 --> 00:00:04.692
we introduce the idea of a community,

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:07.758
which is all about different populations

00:00:07.758 --> 00:00:09.600
that are in the same habitat,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.632
that share the same area or
that are in the same area.

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:15.091
So populations, and if we're thinking

00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:16.657
in terms of water or in the air,

00:00:16.657 --> 00:00:18.823
it could be to share
a similar volume even,

00:00:18.823 --> 00:00:21.323
populations sharing a habitat.

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:26.958
Sharing a habitat.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.658
And in particular in this video,

00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:30.658
we're going to focus on

00:00:30.658 --> 00:00:33.524
the interactions between
those populations,

00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:36.758
the interactions between
the different species.

00:00:36.758 --> 00:00:40.390
The technical term for that
is interspecific interactions.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.257
I like to just say
interactions between species.

00:00:44.257 --> 00:00:46.557
Now the first one that
is often thought about

00:00:46.557 --> 00:00:48.974
is the notion of competition.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.192
And this is when different
populations, different species,

00:00:54.192 --> 00:00:57.603
are competing for the same resources.

00:00:57.603 --> 00:00:59.025
You can imagine a forest,

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.491
where you have different
populations of plants

00:01:01.491 --> 00:01:03.457
that are competing for sunlight,

00:01:03.457 --> 00:01:05.057
that are competing for water,

00:01:05.057 --> 00:01:07.693
that are competing for
nutrients in the soil.

00:01:07.693 --> 00:01:09.359
Even in this picture right over here,

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:10.925
this is a picture of a community.

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:13.125
All of these different
populations of fish,

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:15.948
and other things, sea anemones and coral,

00:01:15.948 --> 00:01:18.767
they are sharing this same region,

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:22.236
and many of them could be in
competition with each other.

00:01:22.236 --> 00:01:23.924
They might be going after the same food,

00:01:23.924 --> 00:01:27.726
or they might be going after
the same shelter someplace.

00:01:27.726 --> 00:01:30.092
And oftentimes, when people
are talking about these

00:01:30.092 --> 00:01:33.158
inter-species or
interspecific interactions,

00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:34.957
you'll see something like this,

00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:37.257
a minus slash minus,

00:01:37.257 --> 00:01:38.992
or a negative sign slash a negative sign.

00:01:38.992 --> 00:01:41.858
And that means that this
type of interaction,

00:01:41.858 --> 00:01:43.492
when you have two species
or two populations

00:01:43.492 --> 00:01:45.624
that are in competition with each other,

00:01:45.624 --> 00:01:47.090
the more that you have of one,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.924
it's going to have a
negative effect on the other,

00:01:48.924 --> 00:01:50.824
and vice versa.

00:01:50.824 --> 00:01:53.290
If I'm a plant, and if I'm in competition

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.424
with another plant,

00:01:54.424 --> 00:01:56.149
and that one's taking my light,

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.202
and if there's more of it taking my light,

00:01:58.202 --> 00:02:00.691
that's gonna have a negative
impact on me and vice versa.

00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:02.325
If I'm in competition with you,

00:02:02.325 --> 00:02:03.957
and we eat the same thing,

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.475
the more of me that there's
around eating your food,

00:02:06.475 --> 00:02:10.891
that's gonna have a negative
impact on you, and vice versa.

00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:14.157
So the next form of
interspecific interaction,

00:02:14.157 --> 00:02:17.907
or interaction between
species, is predation.

00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:23.723
This is when one population
likes to eat another population.

00:02:23.723 --> 00:02:26.192
And you might often associate predation

00:02:26.192 --> 00:02:29.817
with pictures like this that
you see on television shows,

00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:32.890
on documentaries, you
see a cheetah hunting,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.458
it looks like a cheetah hunting a gazelle

00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:37.299
or a deer of some kind.

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.724
Actually it says right
here it's a young bushback.

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:41.399
And this is predation.

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.824
But this is not the
only form of predation.

00:02:43.824 --> 00:02:46.190
This picture here of
the goat eating grass,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.000
this is also predation.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.990
It's not quite as bloody and as violent,

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.624
but it is still predation,

00:02:51.624 --> 00:02:54.832
because you have one species
eating another species.

00:02:54.832 --> 00:02:56.591
In this case you have
this animal, the goat,

00:02:56.591 --> 00:02:58.625
that is eating the grass.

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:01.257
And this type of predation,
this specific type of predation,

00:03:01.257 --> 00:03:02.924
is called herbivory.

00:03:04.532 --> 00:03:07.623
But it is a type of predation.

00:03:07.623 --> 00:03:11.290
So we could say,
predation, slash herbivory.

00:03:12.402 --> 00:03:14.124
Let me do a little slash here.

00:03:14.124 --> 00:03:18.291
Slash herbivory, which is a
special case of predation.

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:22.742
And you'll often see a plus slash minus.

00:03:22.742 --> 00:03:26.399
The more of, let's say
this species that you have,

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:28.890
the species that is being eaten,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.458
it's going to benefit the predator,

00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:31.958
but the more of the
predator that you have,

00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:36.125
it's going to have a negative
effect on the actual prey.

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:39.090
The next types of interactions

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.158
are ones where you have long-term,

00:03:41.158 --> 00:03:43.249
fairly intimate interactions,

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:46.132
where you have organisms that oftentime

00:03:46.132 --> 00:03:49.325
live with each other,
or often on each other.

00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:52.091
And this general term of organisms

00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:54.691
that have these long-term
intimate interactions

00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:55.774
is symbiosis.

00:03:59.467 --> 00:04:00.958
Now, in every day language,

00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.626
when people talk about symbiosis,

00:04:02.626 --> 00:04:04.292
they're often talking about organisms

00:04:04.292 --> 00:04:06.324
that really benefit each other.

00:04:06.324 --> 00:04:08.624
But technically, symbiosis isn't

00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:10.467
just about benefiting each other.

00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:11.767
It could be that they're even

00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:13.033
hurting each other in some way,

00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:14.824
or that maybe one benefits

00:04:14.824 --> 00:04:17.691
while the other one really doesn't care.

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:20.125
And so there're several
types of symbiosis.

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:24.208
The first that we could
talk about is parasitism.

00:04:25.267 --> 00:04:26.184
Parasitism.

00:04:29.567 --> 00:04:31.658
And this looks a lot like predation,

00:04:31.658 --> 00:04:35.158
where the more that the parasite benefits,

00:04:36.358 --> 00:04:38.258
the most of the host that there is,

00:04:38.258 --> 00:04:41.458
but the host is actually
hurt by the parasite.

00:04:41.458 --> 00:04:44.491
And there's all sorts of
examples of parasitism.

00:04:44.491 --> 00:04:48.658
We have, right over here, a
zoomed in picture of a louse.

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:52.357
So why is this parasitism?

00:04:52.357 --> 00:04:55.824
Well if this lice, if
this louse, I should say,

00:04:55.824 --> 00:04:57.657
so this is parasitism.

00:04:59.998 --> 00:05:04.165
And we would call the louse
here a parasite, parasitism.

00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:08.925
And this benefits by living in your hair

00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:11.125
because that's where
it gets its food from,

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:13.159
it can lay, or living on your scalp,

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:14.625
it gets your food by sucking your blood,

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:16.966
it can also lay eggs in your hair.

00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:19.025
In some ways you could
view it as almost a shelter

00:05:19.025 --> 00:05:21.291
from the rest of the environment.

00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:22.924
But it's negative for you.

00:05:22.924 --> 00:05:24.724
It will make you itchy,
it is taking your blood,

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:26.899
it is uncomfortable.

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:29.426
And so, parasitism, once again,

00:05:29.426 --> 00:05:31.190
it's good for the parasite,

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.824
just like predation is
good for the predator,

00:05:33.824 --> 00:05:38.199
but not so good for the host
in the case of parasitism.

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.790
Now you have another situation,

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.057
where it is benefiting both sides.

00:05:43.057 --> 00:05:45.474
And that is called mutualism.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.091
Mutualism, let me do that
in a different color.

00:05:50.091 --> 00:05:51.174
So mutualism.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.098
This is where both sides benefit.

00:05:56.098 --> 00:05:58.191
And oftentimes when people
talk about symbiosis,

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.959
they're really talking about mutualism,

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.824
which is a specific type of symbiosis,

00:06:01.824 --> 00:06:06.099
where both species, or both
animals, organisms, benefit.

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.291
They don't have to just be animals.

00:06:08.291 --> 00:06:11.185
This is an example of
mutualism right here.

00:06:11.185 --> 00:06:15.066
Let me do that in a color you can see.

00:06:15.066 --> 00:06:16.816
So this is mutualism,

00:06:18.549 --> 00:06:22.716
where you have a clownfish
living within a sea anemone.

00:06:24.332 --> 00:06:27.392
The sea anemone is providing
the clownfish shelter,

00:06:27.392 --> 00:06:30.592
while the clownfish is
keeping away other fish

00:06:30.592 --> 00:06:33.233
that might eat that sea anemone.

00:06:33.233 --> 00:06:35.490
So they are both benefiting
from that interaction,

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.573
and so that is mutualism.

00:06:38.558 --> 00:06:40.183
Now you have another category,

00:06:40.183 --> 00:06:42.850
where one species is benefiting,

00:06:44.465 --> 00:06:47.800
and the other one is maybe a
little bit more indifferent.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.791
So one species is benefiting,
and then the other one,

00:06:50.791 --> 00:06:53.993
well, maybe it is a
little bit indifferent.

00:06:53.993 --> 00:06:56.966
And we call that commensalism.

00:06:56.966 --> 00:06:58.049
Commensalism.

00:06:59.066 --> 00:07:02.891
And once again, there's many
examples of commensalism.

00:07:02.891 --> 00:07:04.883
This right over here is a picture of

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:07.058
bacteria living on your skin,

00:07:07.058 --> 00:07:10.690
and you do have bacteria
living on your skin right now.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.733
Accept it.

00:07:11.733 --> 00:07:13.599
And actually, well
oftentimes it's a good thing.

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.024
Sometimes it's mutualism,

00:07:15.024 --> 00:07:17.758
that it's providing protection
from harmful bacteria.

00:07:17.758 --> 00:07:20.157
But sometimes it, the bacteria
are surely benefiting,

00:07:20.157 --> 00:07:23.191
it's living off of nutrients on your skin.

00:07:23.191 --> 00:07:25.384
The skin is its habitat.

00:07:25.384 --> 00:07:29.459
But oftentimes, it doesn't
really have an impact on you.

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:32.408
Now, commensalism, let me write this down.

00:07:32.408 --> 00:07:35.291
Commensalism, oftentimes
the more that we study it

00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:36.659
and the more that we understand it,

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:38.323
we realize that actually maybe

00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:40.658
the host actually is benefiting,

00:07:40.658 --> 00:07:42.258
which it is mutualism,

00:07:42.258 --> 00:07:44.525
or maybe the host
actually is getting hurt,

00:07:44.525 --> 00:07:46.968
in which case it is parasitism.

00:07:46.968 --> 00:07:48.425
So oftentimes commensalism

00:07:48.425 --> 00:07:50.757
isn't completely neutral for the host.

00:07:50.757 --> 00:07:53.257
It could go either way.

00:07:53.257 --> 00:07:56.566
And so these are all the
different types of interactions.

00:07:56.566 --> 00:07:58.060
So I encourage you to look around you,

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.323
look at the world around you,

00:07:59.323 --> 00:08:00.658
and don't just limit yourself to animals,

00:08:00.658 --> 00:08:02.658
think about bacteria, think about plants.

00:08:02.658 --> 00:08:04.558
And think about within a habitat,

00:08:04.558 --> 00:08:07.724
what're all of the different
interspecies interactions,

00:08:07.724 --> 00:08:10.865
and how you might wanna classify them.
