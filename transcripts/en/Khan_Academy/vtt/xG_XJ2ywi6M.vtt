00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.290
- [Instructor] Mario started
the day with five fire flowers.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.400
He used some, and now only has three left.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.520
If U is the number of flowers he's used,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.740
we can write the following equation.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.580
How many fire flowers did Mario use?

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.930
So he started with five,

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.040
he uses some of them.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.850
So we subtract the number he used

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.960
and he ends up with three.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.860
So there's a bunch of
ways that you could do it.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.760
One way is you literally

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.900
could probably do this in your head.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.210
Hey I took away some number
from five and I got three.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.360
And you probably know,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.100
hey well if I take two away
from five I'm gonna get three.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.500
So he used two flowers.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.230
The other way that you
could think about doing it

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.180
is a little, hey we got
only four options here.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.780
Let me substitute each of them in here.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.900
Maybe I was able to do
this one in my head,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.270
but if I had something more complicated

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.722
let me try out these choices.

00:00:45.722 --> 00:00:47.950
So if he only took zero away,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:48.960
it'd five minus zero,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.470
he'd still of course be left with five.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.490
If he took one away,

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.980
then of course he'd only
have, he'd have four left.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.900
If you took three away,
he'd have two left.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.950
But if he took two away,

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.550
five minus two is indeed three.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.550
And the third way,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.600
you'll learn this as we go into more,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.090
more of how, of the how of algebra

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.670
and also the why,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.360
is that you could systematically solve it,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.770
but we'll go into that in future videos.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.633
So he used two fire flowers.
