00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.330
So, you just learned how
to make a hamburger menu,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.230
which is pretty darn cool.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.290
So I want you to think
about what that means for

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.850
your site layouts and transitions.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.030
I want you to pretend that
you're developing a website,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.080
with an off canvas navigation menu.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.680
When the user clicks
on the hamburger icon,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.410
a nav element should show up
alongside some main content.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.800
On mobile viewports though,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.590
the nav isn't going to be visible, until
the user actually makes that click.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.230
Take a look at the CSS here,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.904
which handles the nav menu's transition,
from hidden to visible.

00:00:31.904 --> 00:00:35.160
This open class,
is going to be applied on click,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.730
which means when the user
clicks on the hamburger menu.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.160
This class will be applied.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.430
Which of the following four diagrams,
accurately shows what's going on?

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.420
In them,
the gray box represents the viewpoint.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.740
The bluish,
purplish box represents an odd menu.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.020
And of course,
there's site content inside.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.120
So, pick the diagram,
best represented by the CSS here.
