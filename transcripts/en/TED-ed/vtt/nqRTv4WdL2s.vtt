00:00:15.086 --> 00:00:16.979
So I work on trying to understand

00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:20.547
how the universe works at the very basic level,

00:00:20.547 --> 00:00:22.380
the most basic level we can find.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.802
So, when you try in your everyday life

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:26.916
to try and work out how something works,

00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:28.405
what you're actually doing is you're looking for

00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:30.378
what I call hidden structures.

00:00:30.378 --> 00:00:32.482
For example, you take something like your cell phone,

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:33.388
your smart phone,

00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:34.944
it's a complicated object,

00:00:34.944 --> 00:00:36.694
and you might wonder how it works.

00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:38.637
Well, what you can do is go in

00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:40.030
and actually take it apart.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.281
You'll void the warranty, but that's OK.

00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:43.259
And you'll go in and what you'll find

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:47.076
is that it's made of tiny little electronic components.

00:00:47.076 --> 00:00:49.516
And those electronic components are actually moving around

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.125
a certain kind of particle that we know

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:52.926
that's called the electron,

00:00:52.926 --> 00:00:54.979
and that's where the name "electronics" comes from.

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:56.233
So if you know the actual rules

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:57.634
of how to put those things together,

00:00:57.634 --> 00:01:00.011
you can actually make your smart phone

00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:03.918
or you could make various other electronic devices as well.

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:05.847
So, there are people like myself

00:01:05.847 --> 00:01:09.228
who, actually for a living, try and do this sort of thing

00:01:09.228 --> 00:01:12.568
not just for, say, a cell phone or its components,

00:01:12.568 --> 00:01:15.601
but asking what, say, your hand is made of,

00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:17.335
or the chair you're sitting in,

00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:18.648
or the planet Earth,

00:01:18.648 --> 00:01:19.311
the sun,

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:19.857
the stars,

00:01:19.857 --> 00:01:21.564
the entire universe.

00:01:21.564 --> 00:01:24.708
And so, using various kinds of instruments

00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:25.875
and observations

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:27.030
and experiments,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.657
we've been able to probe deeper and deeper over the years,

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:33.419
and we now know that the matter that we're made of

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:34.543
and that we see around us

00:01:34.543 --> 00:01:39.003
is actually made of tiny little elementary particles.

00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:41.652
And elementary particles interact with each other

00:01:41.652 --> 00:01:43.418
via the forces of nature,

00:01:43.418 --> 00:01:44.311
but we've also discovered

00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:47.908
that those forces of nature themselves actually operate

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:50.059
by exchanging elementary particles as well.

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:52.428
They're actually particles of force that are exchanged

00:01:52.428 --> 00:01:53.972
by the particles of matter.

00:01:53.972 --> 00:01:55.508
And you may have heard this year

00:01:55.508 --> 00:01:56.817
that there was big news,

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:58.884
a major announcement in this story,

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:01.393
the Large Hadron Collider, the LHC,

00:02:01.393 --> 00:02:03.486
a huge experiment in Europe,

00:02:03.486 --> 00:02:06.798
has actually uncovered a Higgs boson,

00:02:06.798 --> 00:02:08.486
and that particle's job is to interact

00:02:08.486 --> 00:02:10.645
with the various elementary particles

00:02:10.645 --> 00:02:13.124
and give them the masses that we observe.

00:02:13.124 --> 00:02:15.891
So, this exciting picture is analogous

00:02:15.891 --> 00:02:17.761
to the one I showed you for the cell phone.

00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:19.023
We have the components

00:02:19.023 --> 00:02:21.460
and we have the rules of particle theory,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.239
as it's called,

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.607
by which these all operate

00:02:23.607 --> 00:02:25.307
and give rise to the various things.

00:02:25.307 --> 00:02:27.479
Now, we actually think that we've only just

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.433
scratched the surface of finding this quantum world,

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:32.912
the hidden structure of our world.

00:02:32.912 --> 00:02:34.038
Let me give you three examples

00:02:34.038 --> 00:02:36.859
of the puzzles we're still working on.

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.795
So, what I did is I gathered the particles up

00:02:38.795 --> 00:02:40.984
into the patterns that they tend to form,

00:02:40.984 --> 00:02:43.147
but we don't know where those patterns come from.

00:02:43.147 --> 00:02:44.409
We know how to describe the particles,

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.073
but we don't know where the patterns come from.

00:02:46.073 --> 00:02:47.326
When you see patterns in science,

00:02:47.326 --> 00:02:48.907
you look for a hidden structure,

00:02:48.907 --> 00:02:50.402
so that's one of the things.

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:53.554
Also, we now know that there's a huge amount

00:02:53.554 --> 00:02:55.107
more matter out there

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:57.661
than just the things that I was just talking about.

00:02:57.661 --> 00:02:59.465
That stuff is called dark matter.

00:02:59.465 --> 00:03:00.801
We don't know what it is,

00:03:00.801 --> 00:03:02.316
and we'd like to be able to get it

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:05.153
and experiment with it and figure out what it is.

00:03:05.153 --> 00:03:07.503
And then, the other thing I'd like to talk about

00:03:07.503 --> 00:03:09.380
is the fact that the force of gravity,

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.676
perhaps the most familiar force we know,

00:03:11.676 --> 00:03:13.579
when you get down to the quantum level,

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.432
it actually doesn't operate

00:03:15.432 --> 00:03:17.758
according to those rules of particle theory.

00:03:17.758 --> 00:03:20.491
So, given that gravity is actually about the shape

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:23.118
of space and time as Einstein taught us,

00:03:23.118 --> 00:03:26.622
we, in working out what the quantum story of gravity is,

00:03:26.622 --> 00:03:28.282
which we call quantum gravity,

00:03:28.282 --> 00:03:29.953
we hope to get to groups of questions like,

00:03:29.953 --> 00:03:32.403
are there particles of space and time itself

00:03:32.403 --> 00:03:33.578
and how do they fit together?

00:03:33.578 --> 00:03:34.623
What are the rules?

00:03:34.623 --> 00:03:35.667
So, this leads us to things

00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:37.543
like studying where it all began,

00:03:37.543 --> 00:03:39.617
13.7 billion years ago,

00:03:39.617 --> 00:03:40.690
the Big Bang.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.859
We know matter and energy

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.422
as we understand it was created,

00:03:44.422 --> 00:03:46.408
but also, space and time itself.

00:03:46.408 --> 00:03:47.515
So those are the sorts of things

00:03:47.515 --> 00:03:49.226
we study in this quest.

00:03:49.226 --> 00:03:52.904
Also, we have things that are around us today,

00:03:52.904 --> 00:03:54.272
such as black holes,

00:03:54.272 --> 00:03:55.741
which are very important clues.

00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:57.108
They're actually holes in space

00:03:57.108 --> 00:03:58.733
that we'd like to understand.

00:03:58.733 --> 00:04:01.639
Also, the newly discovered dark energy,

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.368
which is the tendency of space

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:06.303
all through the universe to accelerate its expansion.

00:04:06.303 --> 00:04:08.522
So scientists are working on these kinds of things,

00:04:08.522 --> 00:04:11.575
trying to understand what we think is now the case

00:04:11.575 --> 00:04:13.384
that there's not just hidden structures

00:04:13.384 --> 00:04:14.730
of matter and energy,

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.522
but also space and time.

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:19.132
So the question is, what are the rules?

00:04:19.132 --> 00:04:20.544
And there are many approaches to this,

00:04:20.544 --> 00:04:22.584
and one of them is one you may have heard of,

00:04:22.584 --> 00:04:23.744
called string theory.

00:04:23.744 --> 00:04:25.652
And so it is one of many approaches

00:04:25.652 --> 00:04:27.323
and we don't know if it's right yet,

00:04:27.323 --> 00:04:29.076
we're not finished developing the theory,

00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:31.969
but it's given us some really exciting, tantalizing hints.

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:33.910
I'd like to tell you about a few of them.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.811
So, one of them is simply that you take away

00:04:36.811 --> 00:04:39.403
the idea of looking for a tiny quantum particle,

00:04:39.403 --> 00:04:41.186
you look instead for an extended object,

00:04:41.186 --> 00:04:43.325
a string, which can vibrate.

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:45.785
And it actually gives you some exciting opportunities

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:48.275
because, for example, it would say

00:04:48.275 --> 00:04:49.854
if we've missed that hidden structure

00:04:49.854 --> 00:04:51.855
by not looking closely enough,

00:04:51.855 --> 00:04:54.887
we wouldn't realize that many different kinds of particles

00:04:54.887 --> 00:04:57.454
are just different vibrations of the same string,

00:04:57.454 --> 00:04:59.906
which is a really exciting possibility

00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:01.617
and a huge simplification.

00:05:01.617 --> 00:05:03.316
So that's one of the ideas.

00:05:03.316 --> 00:05:05.921
The other thing that's really exciting about string theory

00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:08.299
is that one of those particles it describes

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:11.587
is actually the missing quantum of gravity

00:05:11.587 --> 00:05:13.653
that we have been trying to understand.

00:05:13.653 --> 00:05:16.439
And then the other thing is that strings actually,

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:18.876
instead of one wanting just to move in the dimensions,

00:05:18.876 --> 00:05:21.523
the three space dimensions that we are familiar with,

00:05:21.523 --> 00:05:24.612
actually seem to want to move in higher dimensions.

00:05:24.612 --> 00:05:27.097
So we have this idea, then,

00:05:27.097 --> 00:05:29.107
what would it mean for our world,

00:05:29.107 --> 00:05:31.256
if this were anything to do with our world,

00:05:31.256 --> 00:05:32.289
and we don't know that yet?

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.879
Here's a way that our world would arise from that.

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:36.261
You would have our world,

00:05:36.261 --> 00:05:38.018
and then one of the hidden structures

00:05:38.018 --> 00:05:40.650
would be hidden chunks in space time

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.785
that are not visible, those extra dimensions.

00:05:44.785 --> 00:05:46.917
And then the various particles that we see in the world

00:05:46.917 --> 00:05:49.302
would come from being vibrations of strings

00:05:49.302 --> 00:05:52.523
and those patterns we saw that we can't explain

00:05:52.523 --> 00:05:54.677
come from the fact that the strings can probe

00:05:54.677 --> 00:05:57.612
and feel the shape of those internal dimensions.

00:05:57.612 --> 00:05:59.039
So, one of the things, then, is

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.263
can we actually test this?

00:06:00.263 --> 00:06:02.606
This is a lovely idea, but how do we confront this

00:06:02.606 --> 00:06:04.423
with real experiments and observations

00:06:04.423 --> 00:06:06.134
because we're doing science here?

00:06:06.134 --> 00:06:07.976
And that's the hard thing.

00:06:07.976 --> 00:06:09.994
We think that the energy you need

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:12.236
to probe the tiny-enough scales

00:06:12.236 --> 00:06:14.073
to see the strings if they're there,

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:17.453
is more than we can hope to get any time soon.

00:06:17.453 --> 00:06:18.969
But what we can do is we can look

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:21.538
for the consequences of those hidden structures,

00:06:21.538 --> 00:06:24.536
we can look for how those things show up in physics

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:26.157
that we can get access to.

00:06:26.157 --> 00:06:27.457
So, that's why we study things like

00:06:27.457 --> 00:06:28.354
dark matter,

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:29.036
black holes,

00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:29.816
dark energy,

00:06:29.816 --> 00:06:33.912
and we also look at remnants of the early universe,

00:06:33.912 --> 00:06:36.301
the cosmic microwave background that satellites.

00:06:36.301 --> 00:06:39.103
And, importantly, we look for clues

00:06:39.103 --> 00:06:41.584
from the various kinds of particle physics experiments,

00:06:41.584 --> 00:06:42.698
like the LHC.

00:06:42.698 --> 00:06:44.242
So, one last thing, then,

00:06:44.242 --> 00:06:46.777
is a new thing that's been going on.

00:06:46.777 --> 00:06:48.359
String theory may turn out to be useful

00:06:48.359 --> 00:06:49.812
in other areas of physics.

00:06:49.812 --> 00:06:51.034
There are new kinds of experiments

00:06:51.034 --> 00:06:54.541
that start out, say, with our friend the electron,

00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:58.017
and actually show that in certain circumstances,

00:06:58.017 --> 00:06:59.783
the electrons interact in a way

00:06:59.783 --> 00:07:01.435
that give you completely new,

00:07:01.435 --> 00:07:02.955
weird kinds of behavior.

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.320
And there are models that show

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.679
that string theory's actually the best way.

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:09.201
In some circumstances,

00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:10.768
using the rules of string theory,

00:07:10.768 --> 00:07:13.059
you can actually explain that sort of behavior.

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:14.682
So this gives us an exciting possibility,

00:07:14.682 --> 00:07:16.527
there's real experiments you can do

00:07:16.527 --> 00:07:17.297
with these electrons

00:07:17.297 --> 00:07:19.189
that will help us shape the rules

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:20.589
for what string theory is.

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:21.059
And you might go,

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:22.669
"Well, OK, that's going to give us

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:24.936
maybe some fancy new kind of electronics

00:07:24.936 --> 00:07:26.799
that we can make a better cell phone with."

00:07:26.799 --> 00:07:28.442
But, what I'm saying that those rules

00:07:28.442 --> 00:07:30.556
may actually be the same rules we're looking for

00:07:30.556 --> 00:07:31.927
to see if string theory can help us

00:07:31.927 --> 00:07:33.698
with these bigger questions.

00:07:33.698 --> 00:07:35.206
So, at the end of the day,

00:07:35.206 --> 00:07:37.770
the hidden structures of the universe we're looking for,

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.491
may, one day, be right under our noses.

00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:42.039
Thank you.
