00:00:07.196 --> 00:00:08.320
MALE SPEAKER: Good morning.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.930
Welcome to Talks at Google,
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.940
Today, it's my great pleasure
to introduce Gershon Ben Keren.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.830
Gershon is here to
discuss this book,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.050
"Krav Maga-- Real
World Solutions

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.310
to Real World Violence."

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.430
Gershon is head instructor
at Krav Maga Yashir Boston,

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.580
which is located in Charlestown.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.500
Krav Maga means "contact
combat" in Hebrew,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.710
and is a generic term
given by the IDF,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.630
or Israeli Defense
Forces, to refer

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.090
to the close combat
and fighting programs.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.255
Krav maga yashir refers
to the distinct system

00:00:48.255 --> 00:00:51.700
of krav maga that
Gershon teachers.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.690
Yashir in Hebrew means
"direct," and emphasizes

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.400
his krav maga system's
no-nonsense approach

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.710
to ending violence quickly.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.430
The book describes and
explains the situations

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.300
in which various threats
and assaults happen

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.010
and the indicators
that precede them.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.480
This gives you a chance to
identify, predict, and avoid

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.380
violence before it occurs
so that complete solutions

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.690
to violence are described rather
than just physical techniques.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.730
Gershon holds a
third-degree black belt,

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.220
was tested and
certified in Israel,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.330
and was inducted into the
Museum of Israeli Martial

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.930
Arts in 2011.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.337
Please join me in welcoming
Gershon Ben Keren.

00:01:37.337 --> 00:01:39.822
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.830
GERSHON BEN KEREN: It's
always good to have

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.705
somebody else introduce
you, because it means

00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:48.360
you don't have to
talk about yourself.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.985
It's also quite unique
to have somebody

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:52.430
actually do all the Hebrew
pronunciations correctly.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.670
So there's a good one
there for Johnathan.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.570
I'm not going to talk straight
about what people may think

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.990
the book is about, which is
a set of physical techniques

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.550
for dealing with
violent situations.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.270
We chose the title of
the book, "Solutions

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.760
Rather Than Techniques," because
we wanted to present solutions

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.290
in their entirety.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.180
Often, when people start
thinking about self defense,

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.390
they get caught up on what
do I do if a knife is placed

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.970
in my throat, a
gun to my stomach,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.780
or somebody grabs me
in a particular hold.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.360
What we like to
emphasize is, how

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.400
can you prevent those
situations from occurring?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.330
How can you identify
them before they occur?

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.670
What are the pre-violence
indicators in a situation?

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.730
That doesn't mean
that you're guaranteed

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.830
to avoid having to be in
a physical confrontation,

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.310
but it means at least
you'll be better prepared.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.930
And hopefully, it means
you'll be able to avoid.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.010
And that's what we
mean by solutions.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.760
And solutions have to
contain modern techniques.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.230
For us, a solution has
to contain information

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.450
about personal safety skills.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.680
How can you identify,
predict, and avoid violence

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.120
in the first place?

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.780
It has to include
skills and understanding

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.030
about threat recognition.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.940
Can you actually identify
a threat before it occurs,

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.840
and how do you identify it?

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.730
It also looks at the
decision making process.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.780
When you're placed in a violent
situation or a potentially

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.710
violent situation,
you need to be

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.810
able to decide on what to do,
what's your course of action.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.950
An not only that, you have to
be able to make those decisions

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.550
under high stress and emotion.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.880
A lot of martial arts may
give off the impression

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.210
that the way you
deal with violence

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.080
is by adopting a
state of Zen calmness.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.640
My background is in
the security industry.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.400
I don't think in any
situation where I actually

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.270
had to deal with
somebody physically,

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.640
I was in a state
of Zen calmness.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.650
There are probably
better people than me

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.920
who can adopt this state.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.100
I'm not one of them.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.740
And I don't believe that
for the average person

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.720
off the street who's
only able to do

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.680
a limited amount of
training, that they

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.250
will be able to
adopt that state.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.150
So if you think about
how difficult it

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.200
might be to make decisions
in everyday life,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.120
couple that with the stress
and emotion and duress

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.899
of an imminent, threatening,
and dangerous situation.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.670
So I'd like to start off going
through some of those things--

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.270
personal safety, threat
recognition, the decision

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.410
making process-- before we get
to the physical techniques.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.280
Because really, if we can
get all of those parts

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.330
in place and together,
we might never

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.666
need the physical techniques.

00:04:36.666 --> 00:04:38.540
And this might seem very
strange for somebody

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.820
who's just written a book
which by and large contains

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.170
techniques.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.050
So please don't take that as
don't buy the book because I'm

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.460
going to give you everything you
need to know and not read it.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.602
Again, we're looking at
solutions in their entirety.

00:04:54.602 --> 00:04:56.310
One of the questions
I like to ask people

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.880
when we're talking about
personal safety is,

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.840
would you ever get into
a car with a stranger?

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.420
Just think about
it for one moment.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.600
A lot of people have a
default-- no, I never would.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.990
And yet there are adults
who, despite having

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.162
that rule in their head, do
get into cars with strangers.

00:05:16.162 --> 00:05:17.870
And this tells us
something about the way

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.420
that we often view
personal safety.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.490
We often take a rules-based
approach to personal safety.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.110
We have a list of
do's and don'ts.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.720
And the problem
is, sometimes those

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.600
do's and don'ts aren't
applicable to us where we are

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.320
in our particular life stage.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.580
Probably the first
piece of safety advice

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.380
you were given by
a parent was don't

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.330
get into a car with a stranger.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.010
That's my first remembrance
of being told something

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.300
that was intended
to keep me safe.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.410
And my parents and
myself at that time

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.920
were working off the premise
that that information was

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.910
to protect me
whilst I was playing

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.150
in the front garden or yard
about a guy pulling up in a car

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.400
and asking whether I
wanted to see some puppies

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.630
or come with a ride,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.190
As an adult, any
predatory individual

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.439
who wants to get
me into their car

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:12.980
is probably not
going to be so stupid

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.700
as to pull up in
front of me and say,

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.690
would you like to
get into a car.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.773
Because they know what I'm
going to say, which is,

00:06:19.773 --> 00:06:22.230
no way, mate, just back away.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.540
So I have to understand
that that rule is working

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.710
to a model of violence
which isn't really

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.810
applicable to where
I am in my life.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.860
So I have to understand that
a predatory individual who's

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.580
trying to get an
adult into a car

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.280
is going to use very
different means to get them

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.960
into that car.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.550
And if we start to understand
how to predatory individuals

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.670
operate and exploit
these rules that we build

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.810
and our so-called common
sense, we're well on our way to

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.235
actually developing a system
of protective measures

00:06:55.235 --> 00:06:57.900
that can keep us safe.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.760
So a few examples of where
predatory individuals do

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.040
get people into cars and how
they get people into cars-- I'm

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.590
just going to explain
so we can start

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.006
to get into the
mindset of the way

00:07:08.006 --> 00:07:11.560
that these individuals operate.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.800
One sexual predator's
particular MO, modus operandi,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.200
was to troll internet
dating sites.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.390
And he would set up dates,
and everything would be fine.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.290
So he'd set them
up in public places

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.630
where the individual in
question, the potential victim,

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.240
would feel safe.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.180
He was charming.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.880
He was good looking--
something that we often

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.587
don't think about
sexual predators.

00:07:38.587 --> 00:07:40.420
But if you think about
it, these individuals

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.620
have to be socially
adept or they'll

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.150
get caught very, very quickly.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.280
And they're extremely
good at disarming people

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.810
through big nice
and being charming.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.010
And over the course of
the meal, everything

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.830
would be going fantastic.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.760
And towards the end, he'd say,
this has been a fantastic meal.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.300
I really, really
enjoyed your company.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.240
And it would be a shame if
we ended the evening now.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.030
Tell you what.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.040
I know a bar just across town.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.850
Why don't we go
there, one drink.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.480
I know it's a weekday
night, you might

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.020
have work tomorrow,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.140
We'll have one drink, and
we'll finish the night there.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.030
So the person is
thinking, this is great.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.980
This is a polite person
who likes, who's in to me,

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.110
and who wants to
continue seeing me.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.290
They're not too pushy.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.760
Fine, I'll go.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.500
As they were walking to the
parking lot, the guy would go,

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.830
tell you what, why
don't we take my car?

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.059
I'll be designated driver.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:44.120
And this individual has created
a socially awkward situation

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.730
where the person's
agreed to go with them.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.700
They seemingly have
taken responsibility--

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.660
I'll be designated driver.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.029
This is a responsible
individual.

00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:55.820
And now you've got to
come up with a reason

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.470
why you're not going
to get into the car.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.710
So predatory
individuals are really

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.470
great at creating these socially
awkward situations where really

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.547
your only option is to call
them on the safety aspect.

00:09:08.547 --> 00:09:10.130
No, I don't want to
get into your car.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.010
I don't feel safe.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.400
And now that seems to go
in total contradiction

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.680
with what the planned
drink was, which

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.990
was to be in a socially
comfortable situation.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:26.970
Another sexual predator's MO
was to basically drive around

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:31.530
in remote areas where there
was bad cellphone reception,

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:37.356
and he would rear end female
drivers, like [MAKES NOISE].

00:09:37.356 --> 00:09:40.570
The first thing you do when
you're involved in a car crash,

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.060
get out of your car.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.180
So again, these
individuals know how

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:49.430
to use common behaviors and
actions in one situation

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:54.390
to get us to basically lower
our personal safety defenses

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.320
and just behave on the norm.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.680
In a car crash, I get
out, I inspect the damage.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.000
What would happen?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.100
The car was undriveable,
and he would say,

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.790
tell you what, this
is all my fault.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.605
Let me drive you
to the next town.

00:10:12.605 --> 00:10:15.790
The person couldn't get
cellphone reception.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.470
They have created what
seems like the only option

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:23.080
available to them, which
is to get in the car.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.420
So when we start looking
at rules that we have,

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.940
such as don't into
cars with strangers,

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.450
don't let strangers
into our homes,

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:35.085
these predatory individuals
are really, really skilled

00:10:35.085 --> 00:10:37.280
at exploiting that rule.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:42.640
I often get contacted by
newspapers, magazines, asking

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.520
for me to give my
top 10 safety tips.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.180
What they're basically
asking me to do

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.870
is to give them a
list of 10 rules.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.970
And I know-- and
this is not me being

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.590
paranoid-- that the very
individuals this advice

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:02.770
is meant to protect, those
individuals, those predators,

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:06.200
are reading this advice,
and they're formulating ways

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.610
to get around one
of those rules.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.200
And this tells us something
about personal safety.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.440
We can't just adopt this
rules-based approach.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.500
Don't walk down a dark alley.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.500
Who hears don't walk
down a dark alley?

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.830
So we don't even listen
to the rules that we make.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.470
And we have to understand
that ourselves.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.890
We can also understand how
a rule, such as walking down

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.140
a dark alley, might
be detrimental.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.360
And I'm going to give you
a contrived but obvious

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.490
situation.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.980
Let's say you're
walking home at night,

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.670
and there's a well lit
route where there's maybe

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.340
some bars, and some
clubs, and some shops,

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.470
and there's a dark alley route.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.920
And as you're walking along
to this well-lit route,

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.270
suddenly a bar fight erupts
and bursts out onto the street.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.830
You have a choice now.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.420
Do you walk through
the bar fight,

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.870
or do you go down
the dark alley?

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.660
It's a contrived
example, but it shows

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.916
how a rule that's
meant to keep us safe

00:12:02.916 --> 00:12:05.109
can actually put us in danger.

00:12:05.109 --> 00:12:06.650
So one of the things
that we advocate

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.880
when we're talking
about personal safety

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.040
is that we don't take
a rules-based approach.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.420
That what we do is present
information around the way

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.640
that predatory individuals
work and operate,

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.170
and then say, right,
now it's up to you

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.080
to make a dynamic risk
assessment of that situation

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.550
that you face.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.670
You understand the components.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:31.400
You understand how these
individuals operate.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.190
Now form a solution
for that situation.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.720
And the tagline for our system
is, basically, the situation

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.830
determines the solution.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:45.330
So one solution that might be
appropriate in one situation

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.500
might not be for another.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.160
So what we try and
do-- and this is

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.620
part of what the book
tries to do-- is empower

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.510
and educate you so
that you can make

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.900
the correct decisions
concerning the threats

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.965
you face rather than blindly
follow a set of rules.

00:12:59.965 --> 00:13:02.140
And one of the things now
I want to work through

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.400
is basically the situational
components of violence

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.840
and how predatory
individuals operate.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.660
So we actually have five
situational components.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.460
The first one-- location.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.530
Where does the
assault take place?

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.420
Many of us will start
thinking of locations

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.502
of dark, deserted places.

00:13:28.502 --> 00:13:30.460
That's probably if you
ask most people and say,

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.150
where do you think the
majority of muggings occur?

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.180
They'll say dark,
deserted places.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.470
The problem with
deserted places is,

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.790
by default, they're deserted.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:44.310
There's no victims
or potential victims.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.602
So we're thinking,
location-- if I

00:13:47.602 --> 00:13:50.060
was going to commit a mugging,
I wouldn't want other people

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.070
to see it.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.890
Therefore, I would go
to a deserted place.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.570
What a predator is thinking--
where are the victims?

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.910
And the larger the
supply, the better.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.950
Because that's going to help
my victim selection process.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:11.980
So again, we can often rule out
these dark, deserted alleyways.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.200
I'm not saying walk down
dark, deserted alleyways.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.340
They have issues of their own.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.100
But they might not be
those crime high spots

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.910
and hot spots that we
naturally think of.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.186
The next situational
component is relationship.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:32.090
We often think or imagine
that the person who's

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:38.170
going to assault us or cause us
harm is going to be a stranger.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.860
That might not be the case.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.690
It might be somebody we know.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.530
If we're looking at
college campus violence,

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.690
most likely because
of that community--

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.510
people know each
other-- its going

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.050
to be a friend or acquaintance.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.460
And I use friend
in inverted commas.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:57.900
A motive.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:01.700
What do they want?

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.940
Do they want me?

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.880
Do they want to
assault me, abuse me?

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:10.470
Do they want my wallet, my
goods, et cetera, et cetera?

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.320
And when we understand
violence, we really

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.236
need-- I'll get to the
fourth and fifth points

00:15:14.236 --> 00:15:16.800
in a minute-- we need to
understand how a location

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.430
and relationship interact.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.520
If you take, let's say,
a crime that happened,

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.340
an assault that happened
a few years ago when

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:31.330
a young lady from South Boston
was abducted and murdered--

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.110
what we saw in my
studio, because we

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.700
run a free women's self
defense program-- is we

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.620
were inundated with
women from South Boston.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.310
Because to them-- and I'm
not saying this is wrong--

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.135
the key component in that
assault was the location.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.800
South Boston.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.346
So if I live in
South Boston and I'm

00:15:50.346 --> 00:15:55.510
a female the fits the same
demographic, then I'm at risk.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:56.840
And that might be the case.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.830
But let's say that the person
who abducted and murdered

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:04.197
the victim actually had
a relationship with her.

00:16:04.197 --> 00:16:06.030
Maybe it was an ex-partner,
an ex-boyfriend.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.710
I'm not saying
this was the case.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:11.240
Suddenly, the location
doesn't become so important.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.970
It's the relationship
that becomes important.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.580
And if you're trying to make
sense of newspaper and media

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.250
reports of violence,
these are really

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.790
the first two things
to bear in mind.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:24.770
Was it the location
that was significant,

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.140
or was it the relationship
that the victim

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.050
had with their assailant?

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.470
So these two kind of
work hand in hand.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.990
After motive, third
parties with you.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.180
Who says you're going to be
alone when you're assaulted?

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:49.330
If you have children and you
spend 23 hours out of the day

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:53.210
with them, chances are,
when you're assaulted,

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.640
you're going to have
your kids with you.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.720
Do you have a strategy
and a plan for that,

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.300
or is your strategy
and plan solely based

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.420
on you being on your own?

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.020
And so again, we
have to understand

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.240
that violence can be a
little bit more complicated.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.380
And what if the
predatory individual

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:15.359
tries to exploit that, that
they threaten our child

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:17.980
as a means of getting us
to comply and acquiesce

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:18.859
to their demands?

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:21.750
And that does happen.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.645
The other one, state of mind.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.750
What's your mental state?

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.450
Are you prepared?

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:37.540
Have you ever even thought about
the likelihood or the chance

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.050
that you might be involved
in a violent altercation

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.470
or situation?

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:45.790
There's a lot of people who
will put their head in the sand

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:49.130
and say, you know what,
this'll never happen to me.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.840
I don't lead a lifestyle
that basically brings me

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:58.080
into contact with such
individuals and threats.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.410
I would countenance against
that and argue against it.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.520
But by and large, we're
optimistic people.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.400
If you ask-- and these are
basically standard survey

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.000
facts-- you make a statement
that the average life

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.330
expectancy for an
American is 87 years old

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.580
and then ask individuals how old
they'll think they'll live to,

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.410
nobody puts 87 or lower.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.920
Everybody is going to
live to 88, 93, 104.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.920
The stats don't apply to us.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.790
Because bad things happen
to other people, not to us.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.340
And that's our default
way of thinking.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:43.030
So if that is your kind of
way of thinking as you're

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:47.165
confronted by
violence-- everybody

00:18:47.165 --> 00:18:52.830
has heard about freezing--
that's what you're going to do.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:56.440
If you've accepted the
possibility that you might

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.402
one day be facing a
violent situation--

00:18:58.402 --> 00:19:00.110
I'm not even going to
say the likelihood,

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.800
but the possibility-- you'll
be better prepared emotionally

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.650
to cope with that.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:08.870
Professional people who work
in the security industry,

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.260
they expect to be
facing violence,

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:16.210
so they're much better mentally
prepared to deal with it.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:20.120
And there are things that
can affect our state of mind.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.290
For example, alcohol.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:27.190
If you've been drinking, your
state of mind is affected.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:30.880
So these are our five
situational components.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.010
And you could almost
come up with matrices

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:37.000
of all the different
variables to create

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.310
all the different potential
violent situations

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:42.900
that you could face.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.220
Does that make sense to people?

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.500
So we have those
situational components.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.841
To keep things really
straightforward and easy,

00:19:51.841 --> 00:19:53.340
I'm going to work
through a predator

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:58.120
profile and methodology where
your relationship with them

00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.770
is a stranger.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.400
And I'll explain the process
that they operate to.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.170
And the great thing
about understanding

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.530
that crime and
violence is a process

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:10.964
is we can recognize that there
are steps and stages in it.

00:20:10.964 --> 00:20:12.380
And if there are
steps and stages,

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.000
then there are things
that we can identify.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.580
And if we can identify
them, we can disengage them

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.580
and move away.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.710
And this is, again, all
part of that approach

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.220
to using a solution rather
than just a technique

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.110
to deal with a
physical altercation.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.530
Just very quickly
clear the board.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.650
Remember what I
said about location?

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:41.430
This is the first thing that
any predatory individual

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:43.750
is going to do.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.895
They're going to
select a location.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.990
Remember what I said
about deserted places?

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.430
They're probably not going
to go to deserted places.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.470
If we take the
example of a mugger,

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:04.370
he's going to want the largest
number of cash rich victims

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.507
possible.

00:21:06.507 --> 00:21:07.590
So where's he going to go?

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:12.090
He's going to go to shopping
malls, parking lots, transit

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.530
stops, where there's
a good supply

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:18.420
of ever-changing
potential victims.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:24.070
And we call these places as
having crime attractors, what

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:27.530
attracts people to them.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.990
One of the funny things about
being in a crowd, most of us

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:33.750
feel safer when we're
with other people.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:37.780
That's a default
position that we hold.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.570
Part of the reason
for that is we

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.510
start to rely on them
to identify and pick up

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.320
threats for us.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.160
And what that ends up
happening is our general sense

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.300
of situational awareness
starts to go down and drop.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.620
So one of the things we
might feel safer in a crowd,

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.660
because there's other people
who should be looking out

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.200
for threats for
us, the problem is,

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.010
they're expecting
us to be looking out

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:05.730
for threats for them as well,
and our situational awareness

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:06.520
goes down.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.936
And I'll actually
talk in a minute

00:22:07.936 --> 00:22:09.690
about what situational
awareness actually

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:11.692
is from a practical standpoint.

00:22:11.692 --> 00:22:13.150
Because a lot of
times when there's

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.700
been a spate of
crimes in an area,

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.800
the local police will come on--
and I'm not criticizing them--

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.184
and they say, people
need to be more aware.

00:22:22.184 --> 00:22:24.100
And that's kind of like
saying to me, Gershon,

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.940
you need to be better looking.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.120
I totally agree with you.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.090
I don't know how to achieve it.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.550
So the same to me is true
of situational awareness.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.110
It's all very well
saying, you've

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:34.680
got to be situationally aware.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.930
But what does that really mean?

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.750
And so I'll start to
explain that in a bit.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:43.110
So there's crime attractors.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:51.630
There's also preventers in
a location-- lighting, CCTV.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:57.600
One of the best preventers in
an area for crimes of violence

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.270
and any crime in general is what
we call natural surveillance.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.240
A lot of times when people tell
you about parking your car,

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.300
they'll talk about park
in a well-lit area,

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.370
which is good advice.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:10.740
I'm not saying don't.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.240
But even better
than that is park

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.050
in an area which enjoys
natural surveillance.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.704
That is where there's a
lot of eyes on your car.

00:23:19.704 --> 00:23:21.620
And that normally means
the entrance and exits

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.090
of parking lots.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:25.310
They might be a little
further to walk to,

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.070
but you know what, you're
getting the most traffic

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.980
past them, the most
eyes on your car.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.130
So if we start
looking at preventers

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:36.980
and we look at something like
natural surveillance, boom,

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:37.950
that's a preventer.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.616
And that's something
we can actually do.

00:23:39.616 --> 00:23:43.530
We can park our car in a place
enjoying natural surveillance.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:48.030
The promoters.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:51.550
One big promoter is the
number of exit opportunities

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.754
for an assailant.

00:23:53.754 --> 00:23:55.920
Because they'll be planning
their getaway as well as

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.240
the crime itself.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.140
So if they have multiple
routes to go down,

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:05.520
which is why transit stops
are often high mugging areas,

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.580
because there's a number
of different routes

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.450
that somebody can exit down.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.510
So they select a location--
primarily maximum number

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.630
of victims or potential victims.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:26.350
The next step in the
process is victim selection,

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.350
who to actually assault.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.550
And if we start understanding
how predatory individuals see

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:35.390
the world, we can
start to develop ways

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.620
where we step off their radar.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.680
There was a famous
study done in 1984

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:45.180
by two New York psychologists,
Grayson and Stein.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:46.910
Very, very simple experiment.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:51.070
They set up a video camera
on a New York street,

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.420
and they just filmed people.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.970
They then took that
footage and showed it

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.400
to prisoners who had
been incarcerated

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.730
for violent crimes.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:04.810
And they said, show me
who the victims are.

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:08.000
There was somewhere
around 87% agreement

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.270
amongst all those
different inmates

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:12.400
about who they would select.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.910
And the process never took
them longer than five seconds.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:20.900
I actually believe that they
identified them immediately

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.290
and spent the rest of the time
just making sure to themselves

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.730
that that was the person.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:31.100
And I'll explain a bit about
that as well in the process.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.440
None of them could explain
why they chose a victim.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.740
They would just go, it's them.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.060
I remember once watching
a nature documentary

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:44.770
where it was a pack of
wolves hunting, hunting elk.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:49.100
And the wolves surrounded this
herd and started the moving.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:54.180
And suddenly, all the wolves
veered off after one animal.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:58.702
Now, one elk looks very
much like another elk to me.

00:25:58.702 --> 00:26:00.160
I couldn't tell
the difference, why

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.980
they had chosen this one animal.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:05.090
The camera man zoomed in
on one of the hind legs,

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.150
and it was slightly hocked.

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:11.304
Something I wouldn't
see, but the wolf saw.

00:26:11.304 --> 00:26:12.720
And this is something
we also need

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.720
to understand about
predatory individuals-- they

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.780
see the world a little
bit differently to us.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.900
So they'll notice things
that we don't notice.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.740
And it will be a
subconscious process.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.240
They'll just go,
that's a victim.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.840
They won't be able to
verbalize or explain why.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.700
It's just that person,
they're a victim.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.180
So what Grayson
and Stein did was

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:39.280
they took the
footage to analysts

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.850
who do Laban Movement Analysis,
which is the study of movement.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:48.430
I think it's around 24 or 28
different component parts.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.750
And they said, these
are the victims,

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.620
these are the non-victims.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.590
Show me the differences.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.610
And there were three
things that were picked up

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:03.330
which separated the victims
from the non-victims.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:04.910
The first one, looking down.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.840
And that seems obvious.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.080
Because if somebody
is not looking,

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.380
they're not aware of their
surroundings, which is true.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:21.340
But looking down also gives
off an emotional state.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.030
If you're depressed,
have low self-worth

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:26.850
and are feeling
down about yourself,

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.270
you kind of hang your head.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:32.660
And if you're
looking for a victim,

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.777
you're looking for somebody
who is not going to fight back.

00:27:36.777 --> 00:27:38.610
That's basically what
a predatory individual

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.690
is looking for-- a person who
is going to acquiesce, not

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.210
confront, and not fight back.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:49.350
And so if somebody has got
that depressed look about them,

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.090
they're more likely
to be selected.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:53.870
Awareness obviously
does come into it,

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:57.740
but your emotional state
and what you give off

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:02.850
and those signals also
identify you as a victim.

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:08.170
The other one was
unnatural stride length.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:17.430
So when I walk, that's
my natural stride length

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.050
for my height.

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:23.460
If I'm walking
with smaller steps,

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.840
it's an unnatural stride length.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.180
Let's go back to
emotional state.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:31.560
Hanging down, shuffling
steps-- giving off

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.950
an image of low self-esteem,
less likely to fight back.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.990
The other thing that's
interesting from a self-defense

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:43.160
perspective is, I've heard a
lot of instructors talk about,

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.220
you need to present
yourself as a person

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.720
they don't want to mess with.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:54.390
You need to puff out the
chest, you need to walk tall,

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:57.660
and you need to look like you're
somebody not to be messed with.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.810
What that often
ends up doing is you

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:04.050
start to lengthen your
stride length as you

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.360
make yourself look bigger.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.480
And it wasn't just people
with shorter stride

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.370
length that were selected.

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.326
It was people with
longer stride length.

00:29:14.326 --> 00:29:15.700
We have a term in
security, which

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.766
is the gray man, that you
don't want to be seen.

00:29:19.766 --> 00:29:21.140
So you don't want
to be picked up

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:25.484
as a guy who looks like he's
not wanting to be messed with.

00:29:25.484 --> 00:29:27.150
At the same time, you
don't want to look

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:29.750
like the person with
low self-esteem.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.930
You want to go unnoticed.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:32.800
That's your goal.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.990
Be the gray man.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:38.637
Walk natural stride
length, eye line up.

00:29:38.637 --> 00:29:40.220
That's one of the
ways that you're not

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:43.490
going to be picked up.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:46.890
The third one was
there was a difference

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:50.170
between the movements of
the upper and lower body.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:52.430
So what do I mean by this?

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:59.760
When you walk, basically,
your arms swing with the legs.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.810
Now, if I walk with the same
arm and same leg movement--

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:08.230
I'm doing it exaggerated--
it's basically

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:12.890
my upper body doesn't
flow with the lower body.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:16.980
And they refer to it
as a lack of wholeness.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.140
So if we start to
understand those things

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.680
and we look at the
physical cues and signals

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.700
that we give off to
predatory individuals,

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:29.830
if we walk with
our eye line ahead,

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.850
if we have a natural
stride length,

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:35.890
and our upper body moves
with the lower body,

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:38.870
chances are, we'll not be
picked up on the radar.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.480
And it really can be
as simple as that.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.210
People can get really,
really complex about,

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:47.270
this is how you need to make
sure that you're not seen.

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:51.069
It's kind of the easiest
way to be safe is be normal.

00:30:51.069 --> 00:30:51.860
Just walk normally.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:57.630
One of the things
with victim selection

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.350
is somebody will be selected.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:02.370
This is the unfortunate thing.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:06.340
If there's a mugger in
a shopping mall looking

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.080
for victims, he'll
find a victim.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.890
We call it victim displacement.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:13.790
You just don't
want it to be you.

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:15.970
It will be somebody else.

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:17.470
And this is
sometimes-- people get

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.260
confused with
professional safety.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.360
You're not trying
to stop the rapist

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:25.780
from being a rapist or the
mugger from being a mugger.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.930
You're stopping yourself
from being the victim,

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:30.190
preventing yourself.

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:31.260
That's the goal.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.760
The mugger will
still be the mugger.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.090
The rapist will
still be the rapist.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:38.390
That's for social
change to deal with.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:42.720
Your personal goal is
to keep yourself safe.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.750
There's other things
around victim selection

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.950
as well if we're looking
at physical cues.

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:51.540
There was one sexual
assailant whose particular MO

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:55.970
was to watch women
shopping in supermarkets.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:59.390
And he'd watch them as they
were pushing the shopping carts.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:02.060
And let's say I'm
pushing my shopping cart

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:07.180
and somebody else bangs into it,
and I go, I'm terribly sorry.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:11.440
So I'm apologizing for something
which really wasn't my fault.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.450
The other person
should be apologizing.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:23.320
This sexual predator would take
this as, this individual so

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.130
wanted to avoid any
form of confrontation

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:28.520
that they would take the
blame for something which

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.730
wasn't their fault.

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:35.820
That lack of confrontation
or the ability to confront,

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.420
that's a big victim signal.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.720
If you look at the way that
you move through a crowd,

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.810
are you the person who's
continually moving out

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:47.200
of everybody else's way for
fear of bumping into them,

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.390
or are you the person who sets
your own course and everybody

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:52.460
else moves around you?

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.010
And again, I'm not
saying in that,

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:55.940
pushing people out of the way.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:56.710
You can move.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.980
But are you the guy that
keeps your course, or are you

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:03.070
the guy that is apologetic
to everybody else's movement?

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:06.475
So how you move in relation to
other people is also important.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.470
Third, surveillance.

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:24.090
If you're a mugger working
a busy shopping mall

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:26.180
and you've selected
your victim, you're

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.750
going to want to make sure
that that victim is actually

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.660
victim material.

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:35.140
Because if you make a wrong
choice and confront them

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.800
and they confront
you, now you've

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.260
just created a whole
scene and an incident.

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:44.950
So again, this predator
is going to want

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:50.640
to make sure about who they have
in their sights is a victim.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.880
I always say in terms of
part of situational awareness

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.330
is picking up who has
an interest in you

00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:01.360
rather an interest in
what they're doing.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:05.480
Who's more interested in you
than about what they're doing?

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.810
That's a really good cue
that somebody is carrying out

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:11.790
some form of
surveillance on you.

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:14.159
Simple things you can do
to pick up surveillance

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:16.440
when you're walking--
choose a side

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:21.120
of the road where you see
the traffic coming onto you.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.190
You're much more likely
to notice the car that's

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:27.110
done the second swipe because
they're interested in you

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:30.320
than if that car is
going the other way.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.830
So even just choosing the side
of the street that you walk

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:35.280
can be a way of identifying
those people who

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.219
have an interest in you.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:40.960
So now we're getting on to
the actual meat and bones

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:46.860
of practically what our
situational awareness is.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:50.570
If somebody wants to
attack or assault you,

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:56.360
they have to sync
their movement,

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.890
i.e., if I want to
assault any one of you

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:04.740
out there who's listening to me,
I have to get off this podium,

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.980
and I need to come
down, and I actually

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:11.570
need to be in physical
proximity to make an assault.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:13.990
When we talk about
situational awareness

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:17.480
from a practical level,
really what it is, is it's

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:21.040
picking up somebody
else's movement

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.930
that's in relation to yours.

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:25.140
That's what it is.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.800
So when somebody is
telling you, you've

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.220
got to be situationally
aware and you're wondering,

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.620
how do I become
situationally aware--

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:35.810
you need to learn to identify
people's movement as it

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.070
relates to you.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.340
And there's four basic types
of synchronization of movement.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:45.450
The first one, following.

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:47.850
If I directly follow
somebody, I've

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:52.530
tied my movement to theirs.

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:55.990
Has everybody had that feeling
that somebody is behind you?

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.490
Yeah?

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:03.290
Is everybody here aware
that you're wearing clothes?

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:06.980
You kind of are now because I
brought your attention to it.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:10.370
Our subconscious processes
a lot of information,

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:12.550
and it filters out
that which isn't

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:15.680
deemed necessary for
our conscious mind

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.110
to process, such
as wearing clothes.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.140
Sound is another one.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.180
I can hear fans going,
the air conditioning,

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.440
but until that moment,
we've all blocked it out,

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.862
because we are focusing
on this information.

00:36:27.862 --> 00:36:29.320
Because that was
what was pertinent

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:32.690
for our conscious
brain to process.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:35.760
Your fear system runs
in the background.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.692
And it will pick up those
footsteps behind you.

00:36:39.692 --> 00:36:41.900
And what it will do is give
you a shot of adrenaline.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.270
You'll get the hairs going
up on the back of you neck.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:46.000
You'll feel uneasy.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.990
And you go, there's
somebody behind me.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:51.960
We used to think in
psychology-- and I'll

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:56.370
use the analogy that's commonly
used-- that you saw a bear,

00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:00.010
you became afraid,
and then you ran.

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:03.570
What we understand now is a
process-- you see the bear,

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:04.875
you start running.

00:37:04.875 --> 00:37:08.460
And because you're
running, you're afraid.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.030
So basically, it's
my physical change

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:14.810
which alerts me to danger,
not me consciously picking up

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:16.170
the footsteps.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:17.580
So we basically
have what we call

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:26.020
tracking is one means of
synchronizing movement.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.400
Another mean, direct approach.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.500
I could just walk up to you.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:34.300
That's fairly obvious, though,
if I just walk up to you,

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.370
that I've synchronized
my movement.

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:39.560
So what I might do-- if
we come back to location--

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:44.340
is use a crowd to
disguise my approach.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:48.490
So I'll move through the
crowd approaching you

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:50.180
till I'm really, really close.

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:52.520
And this is the way that
most muggers will work.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.790
And they'll basically
blade their body,

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:56.360
stick the knife to you.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.810
You'll be kind of slightly
turned, and nobody around you

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:01.050
will see what's going on.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.200
And that's how somebody
can do a mugging

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.071
in a very crowded place.

00:38:05.071 --> 00:38:06.320
And you've got a knife on you.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.832
You're probably not
going to scream.

00:38:07.832 --> 00:38:09.290
You're probably
not going to shout.

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:10.810
You'll probably
hand over the money,

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:13.130
and they'll move off
through the crowd.

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:14.705
And that crowd--
also when we look

00:38:14.705 --> 00:38:17.730
at what we're talking about
promoters with exit routes--

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:21.710
basically gives a
number of exit routes.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:23.290
So I have approach.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.938
If I know where you're
going, I can wait for you.

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.740
A lot of people use the
remote on their car key fob

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:42.690
to locate their car
in a parking lot.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.600
They come out-- I don't
know where I parked.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.260
Beep beep-- oh, there.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.400
You've just unlocked
your car, which

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.490
was the one safe place
in the environment.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:56.290
If there's a predatory
individual in the vicinity,

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.790
there's nothing to stop
them getting in your car.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:02.120
Another thing people often do
is they'll turn up at a parking

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.940
lot, realize they've
got their laptop

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.180
and valuables in the
front seat of the car,

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.270
know that they shouldn't
be in plain sight,

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.360
and so they move them
to the trunk of the car.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.960
If there's a criminal
or criminal element

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.550
in that vicinity,
they've seen you do that.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:22.520
They know that there's something
valuable in your trunk.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:26.860
They can wait by it, and when
you do beep beep and unlock it,

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:29.220
they can either pull the
trunk-- or move, depending

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:32.070
on the model of the car--
open you driver side,

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:35.500
unlock it from there, and
take what's in the trunk.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.850
So I can synchronize
movement by waiting.

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:39.570
So people know where
I'm going to be.

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:42.295
I'm on my mobile
phone telling people,

00:39:42.295 --> 00:39:44.170
I'll meet you at the
Starbucks on Mill Street

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:46.826
in three minutes.

00:39:46.826 --> 00:39:48.450
Somebody listening
to that conversation

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.520
knows the route that
you're going to take

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:54.880
and can synchronize their
movement and wait for you.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:58.490
The fourth, interception.

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:01.940
I apologize if my writing
is getting scratchy

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.480
as I come to the bottom.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.150
Interception.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:07.360
I don't have to directly
tie my movement to you.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.920
I can tie it to
where you're going.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.170
And that's a really
difficult form

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:16.710
of synchronization of
movement to identify.

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:19.160
But one of the things I look
for is natural choke points

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:23.780
in movement, such
as road crossings,

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.250
and who's going to get there
at the same time as me.

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:28.800
So this is, again,
ways that I train

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.980
my situational awareness--
by looking at other people's

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:36.480
movements and identifying
how it relates to me.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.420
The last step in the process
is what we call the interview.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:45.470
And the interview can be
as really, really simple

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:50.750
as somebody saying, hand
over your wallet to something

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:53.530
much more involved.

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:56.702
Anybody who talks to me,
why are you talking to me?

00:40:56.702 --> 00:40:58.590
That's not me being antisocial.

00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:00.210
I'm interested.

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:03.660
Why are you showing
interest in me?

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:06.800
People who ask you for
the time-- who here now

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.069
doesn't have a mobile phone?

00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:11.735
Why does somebody
need to know the time?

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:13.140
Are you the one
guy on the planet

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:15.510
that doesn't have
a mobile phone?

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:17.625
I'm suspicious.

00:41:17.625 --> 00:41:20.590
And I'm suspicious of your
synchronization of movement,

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:25.040
that you've intercepted me and
you're asking me for the time.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.980
Something is not right.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:30.870
Or I'm, at the very least,
within my personal safety

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:33.530
rights to be suspicious of you.

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:37.220
So when we understand that
crime is a process and violence

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:40.190
is a process, we
can go a long way

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:43.495
to actually predicting,
preventing, and avoiding.

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:48.320
We also need to develop
what I was saying

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.760
was threat recognition and
decision-making skills.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.450
We generally have two
ways we make decisions.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.680
We have what's called
rationalistic decision

00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:00.590
making, which is maybe when
you're looking for the job

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:02.680
here, you had maybe
a few other job

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.440
offers that you
were thinking about.

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.780
Do I come work for Google?

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.760
Do I come work
for somebody else?

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.480
And you'll have taken
into consideration

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:15.390
your travel time,
which today was murder.

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:20.640
You'll take into account
the money, the benefits.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.930
Maybe if you have to
move-- do I have to move,

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:25.065
do I have to relocate?

00:42:25.065 --> 00:42:26.690
And you're weighing
all of these things

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:31.510
up against the same things of
another job, because you're

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:34.310
looking for the best solution.

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:37.604
The problem is, in
a violent encounter,

00:42:37.604 --> 00:42:39.020
one of the things
that will happen

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.990
is your assailant will try and
complete this process in record

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:45.780
time so that you don't
have time to respond

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:46.912
to what they're doing.

00:42:46.912 --> 00:42:49.120
So part of what we need to
do is try and create time,

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.280
but that's another issue.

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.290
And so you don't have time
to look for the best solution

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:57.420
and weigh up all
the pros and cons.

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.890
If I see somebody coming
towards me, should I run?

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:01.710
Should I shout?

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:04.930
Should I pick up some
forms of improvised weapon?

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:07.050
Should I try and
get some obstacle,

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:10.260
barrier between me and
them, such as a car?

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.720
I don't have time to weigh
up all the different costs

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.242
and benefits of each option.

00:43:15.242 --> 00:43:17.700
What I need to do is something
called naturalistic decision

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.720
making, which is
I need to choose

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.940
the first effective solution.

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:24.100
That's it.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:29.750
So if I see somebody coming
towards me, and I go,

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:30.730
will running work?

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:31.760
Yes?

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.460
That's what I do.

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:35.530
I don't worry about
all the other solutions

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.060
which might be better.

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:40.320
I have an effective solution.

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.690
And when you're operating
under stress and duress,

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:48.200
you want to work like that--
first simple solution.

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.960
Because your mind's bandwidth
for making these choices

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.090
is starting to shrink.

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:54.050
That's one of the
effects of adrenalin.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:58.222
So if you have an effective
solution, you should take it.

00:43:58.222 --> 00:43:59.680
Another thing we
have to understand

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.820
when we're confronted
by violence and danger

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:06.532
is, what's our normal
responses to it?

00:44:06.532 --> 00:44:07.990
your first response--
remember what

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:09.573
I was saying about
when you're walking

00:44:09.573 --> 00:44:12.620
and you picked up somebody was
behind you-- the first thing

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:17.200
you probably did was go into
a sate of denial and went,

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.990
oh, I'm being stupid.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.460
The can't be following me.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.700
Maybe they're in a hurry.

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.795
Maybe they've just
fallen into step with me.

00:44:24.795 --> 00:44:28.670
The first thing we do is
go into a state of denial.

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:32.970
The report on the Twin
Towers after the two planes

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:37.210
hit them showed that
the average evacuation

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:41.960
time after the second plane hit
the second power was somewhere

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.050
around six minutes.

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:45.950
And that was people
who knew what

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:47.940
had happened to
one of the towers,

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:52.800
had felt their tower shutter,
and waited six minutes

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.510
on average before
they left their desk.

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:57.210
Some people obviously
left sooner.

00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:01.260
Some people left later, and
some people never left at all.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.510
That is how strong that
sense of denial is.

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.010
Remember how I said
at the beginning

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:10.160
about you tell Americans
average age life

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.990
expectancy of
Americans, 87 years old,

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:15.030
how old do you think
you're going to live to?

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:17.930
88, 89, 94.

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:19.800
That's denial.

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.860
People often stay in
that state of denial

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:23.660
and don't come out of it.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:26.300
So the first thing when
you're adrenalized,

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:29.410
you need to accept that
something in that vicinity

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:31.980
has triggered your fear system.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.610
You've got to now work out
whether it's a real threat,

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:36.930
and imagined threat,
et cetera, et cetera,

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:38.960
but having this
kind of knowledge

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.230
and understanding of how
predatory individuals operate

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:44.770
gives you a good cue into that.

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:47.710
After denial is deliberation.

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:48.550
What should I do?

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:49.792
Should I run?

00:45:49.792 --> 00:45:50.750
Should I confront them?

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:54.440
Should I shout, improvise a
weapon, et cetera, et cetera.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.570
And you go through
that deliberation loop

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:58.970
till you reach a decision,
and after the decision,

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:01.090
you go to act.

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:03.760
That's how we
operate under stress.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.590
So if we can simplify
that deliberation phase,

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:09.610
acknowledge that we
will be in denial,

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:12.480
move out of that quickly,
look for the first effective

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:17.090
solution, and act upon
it, we've basically

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:21.110
cut down all that time we would
have spent processing the best

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:24.580
solution into boom,
we have a solution.

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.830
If we go further
than that and start

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:30.220
building pre-built
decision trees,

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.250
we can speed it up even further.

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:35.170
So I work through some
really simple heuristics.

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:38.090
Heuristics is just a rule
of thumb, something that's

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:40.200
going to work in the
majority of situations.

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.650
And I'll give you
an outline of one

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:45.080
of my very, very
simple decision trees.

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.960
If I take a mugging situation--
if somebody comes up to me,

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:52.450
puts a knife to me, and
says, give me your wallet,

00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:54.590
I'm going to give
them the wallet.

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:55.360
Why?

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.950
In their mind, they
leave with the wallet.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:01.160
The variable is whether
I get cut or out.

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.510
So if they cut me
and take my wallet

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:05.120
or don't cut me
and take my wallet,

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.117
I know which is the
best solution for me.

00:47:08.117 --> 00:47:09.950
Often, you'll get people
who say, well, I'll

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:12.830
hand over the wallet if
there's like $50 in it.

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.700
But if I've got $500, no way.

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.740
My question back to that
is, how does your ability

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.610
to handle this situation
get any better according

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:23.620
to the money you've
gone in your wallet?

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:25.770
They're not related.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:28.760
So have that as, you
know what, if somebody

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:33.100
asks for my wallet, my iPod,
my laptop, there you go.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:37.110
99 times out of 100,
people are going to leave.

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:41.480
If they don't leave, then
I need physical solutions.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.330
And that's what we're starting
to present in the book.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:47.720
So all of this is leading
up to that physical stuff.

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:51.440
If somebody sticks a
knife to me and says move,

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.060
I'm going to act.

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:57.840
Because I know this location
represents my best chance

00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:59.030
of survival.

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:01.040
And that's why they want
to take me out of it

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:04.540
and move me to another location.

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:07.400
So I have a really
simple decision tree.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.830
You want something off
me, you can have it.

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:12.350
If you're still here I'll act.

00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:15.470
If you want me, I'll act.

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:17.770
It's a really, really
simple decision tree.

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:20.350
And what that's going to mean
is when I have to enact it,

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:21.433
I'm not going to hesitate.

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:25.270
The wallet is going to be out.

00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:27.020
You can substitute that wallet.

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:30.260
The majority of muggings
are conducted, basically,

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.290
to support a drug habit.

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:33.529
Have $20 in your back pocket.

00:48:33.529 --> 00:48:34.320
There you go, mate.

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.100
All I've got.

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:40.770
That muggers wants the
situation over ASAP.

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:43.900
You've given them what they
want, enough for the next fix.

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:48.600
They're going to leave
99 times out of 100.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:53.630
If they stay, now I'm
wondering whether the assault

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:56.980
morphs into something else.

00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:00.840
So I like working off really,
really simple decision trees

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:05.180
that get me through that
deliberation process.

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:07.050
And this is what
the book goes into.

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:11.190
It talks about the processes
that different individuals use.

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:14.330
We don't just
present a technique.

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:17.870
We explain how that
situation developed,

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:21.380
how you ended up with a
knife to your stomach.

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:24.790
We also show the
physical technique.

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:28.410
But violence doesn't just happen
like that, as we've learned.

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:30.290
It's a process.

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:32.320
And if I understand
that and the situations

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.235
where things are
going to occur, I

00:49:34.235 --> 00:49:36.600
have a much better chance
of dealing with them.

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.600
Even if it just means
from a mental preparation,

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:41.440
I've spotted this guy
who's intent on causing

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:45.910
me harm, maybe I can do things
such as controlling range,

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:48.440
my actual position
to them, making sure

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:51.060
I've not got my back to a wall.

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:52.450
I can alter the situation.

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:54.310
I have a chance to do things.

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:59.300
If I recognize them long enough
off, maybe I can move away.

00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:03.130
If I recognize the
signs and signals

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:07.290
that they're looking for--
eyeline down, shuffling steps--

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:11.110
I'm not going to be pick up on
the radar in the first place.

00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:13.140
So we talk about all
of this in the book

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.910
and then present the
worst case scenario,

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:17.700
which is the person
has actually managed

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:21.400
to get into a position
to assault you.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:24.400
And by giving you
that complete scenario

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:28.200
and a complete solution,
what we're hoping

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.330
is, yes, that you
learn the techniques,

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:33.050
but also that you
learn what to do

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:37.130
to avoid having to
do the techniques.

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:40.570
I've worked in close
protection, bodyguarding,

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:44.940
and have a saying there which
says, dead clients don't pay.

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:48.460
Your job is basically to
be a bodyguard to yourself.

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:51.940
And when I look at the processes
that we operate and use

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:54.360
in close protection,
a large part of that

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:59.060
is planning-- recognizing the
routes we shouldn't be going

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:03.150
down, recognizing what could
be the potential dangers

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:07.809
and threats, and accepting them,
finding ways to mitigate them.

00:51:07.809 --> 00:51:09.600
And then when we're
out with the principal,

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.760
the person we're
looking after, we're

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.690
looking a long way
down that road.

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:16.420
Because we want to see
a situation develop

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:20.740
in its infancy rather
than as it evolves.

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:24.450
And when we see
that, we move away.

00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:26.350
And that should be our
goals for ourselves.

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:29.570
We should basically
be our own bodyguards.

00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:33.720
And if I was trying to sum up
anything about what the book is

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.700
trying to communicate,
it's that.

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.480
And yes, it's full
of techniques.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.340
We film them all
in the locations

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:43.100
in which the types of
assault are likely to happen.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:43.600
Why?

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.690
It helps you visualize.

00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:49.364
If you can't get any form
of physical training,

00:51:49.364 --> 00:51:51.030
one of the things you
can do is at least

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:54.520
visualize the situation
as it develops.

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.612
And that's a great
form of training.

00:51:56.612 --> 00:51:59.070
Because one, you're accepting
the possibility and potential

00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:02.480
for violence, and also, you're
starting to train yourself

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:06.576
as to what things look like
in their very early stages.

00:52:06.576 --> 00:52:08.825
So part of what you can do
is take the principles that

00:52:08.825 --> 00:52:13.260
were laid out in the book, look
at the situational components,

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.500
change them around, and start
to understand what real world

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.580
violence actually looks like.

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:21.960
We've now got time
for questions.

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:27.260
I'm happy to answer on anything
that is security related.

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:30.520
And that can be stuff
from personal safety tips

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:32.860
you've heard about this
is what I should do,

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:35.340
this is how I
should behave, and I

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:38.440
can shed some professional light
on them as to whether they're

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:42.740
valid or maybe a little
bit left of center

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.220
right down to physical
stuff you've heard.

00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:47.810
So the floor,
guys, is now really

00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:50.355
open to you, any
questions you want to ask.

00:52:50.355 --> 00:52:52.730
AUDIENCE: Could you talk a
little bit about your decision

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:54.885
tree if somebody
breaks into your house

00:52:54.885 --> 00:52:56.010
in the middle of the night?

00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:57.280
GERSHON BEN KEREN: Yeah, sure.

00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:57.780
OK.

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:00.040
There's different
types of criminals.

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:06.040
And individuals choose a
crime for a set of reasons.

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:09.815
A good example is to
compare a burglar, somebody

00:53:09.815 --> 00:53:12.440
who breaks in, to a mugger.

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:16.650
Burglary by and large nets
the person more money.

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:19.510
So it's more profitable
to be a burglar

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:21.780
than it is to be a mugger.

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.970
The problem is, if
you're a burglar,

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:27.030
you need to be tapped into
a criminal network who

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:30.140
can change the goods
stolen into cash.

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:33.170
So you need to know a fence.

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:36.400
The other thing is,
that's going to take time.

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:40.702
So you've got to have some
delayed gratification.

00:53:40.702 --> 00:53:41.910
The mugger doesn't have that.

00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:45.000
He wants that $20 so
he can go to his dealer

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.094
and get the next fix.

00:53:47.094 --> 00:53:49.010
So you start to understand
when you understand

00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:51.790
what motivates people
towards crime a little bit

00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:55.190
about their different
characteristics.

00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:59.890
A burglar by and large is
going to burgle your house

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:02.130
during the day whilst
you're at work.

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:03.740
That's by and large.

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.990
If you're looking at
things to deter burglars,

00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:09.430
occupancy is one,
giving the impression

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:11.100
that you're actually home.

00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:14.070
Because burglars,
unlike muggers,

00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:16.429
don't really want to
interact with you.

00:54:16.429 --> 00:54:17.970
They want to go
about their business,

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:20.770
because it takes time
to find everything,

00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:24.060
basically unhindered by the
potential presence of somebody

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.170
there.

00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:27.650
The other one is a dog.

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:32.460
If you don't have a dog, put
a dog bowl out on the porch.

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:33.564
It's victim displacement.

00:54:33.564 --> 00:54:35.980
If it's your house or your
neighbor's-- I know this sounds

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:36.710
horrible.

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:40.720
I'm not promoting that you
get your neighbors burgled.

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.920
But if you put dog bowl
out, and the burglar,

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.340
I have a choice of
two houses, which

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:48.880
one am I naturally
going to go towards?

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:51.790
Burglars are funny individuals
in that they're always

00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:53.680
on the lookout for property.

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:57.634
They've got this
subconscious process going.

00:54:57.634 --> 00:54:59.050
Interesting stuff
about burglary--

00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:01.160
if you live on a
corner house, you're

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:04.700
more likely to be burgled than
if you live on the street.

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:07.660
Remember what I was saying about
promoters, crime promoters,

00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:12.500
exit routes, corner house,
multiple exit routes.

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:15.440
That's by the by.

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.939
So I understand something
about the burglar's mentality.

00:55:17.939 --> 00:55:19.480
So the burglar, by
and large, doesn't

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:21.100
want to interact with you.

00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:23.230
They want to steal
the stuff and go.

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:25.420
So let's say you hear
that bump in the night.

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:32.865
You want to give that
burglar time to escape.

00:55:32.865 --> 00:55:34.240
Because what you
don't want to do

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:37.210
is put them on the spot
where they feel hemmed in,

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:40.400
pressurized, and now it's going
to be some sort of a hostage

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.260
type situation in
your house or they

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:46.240
feel they need to deal
with you as a threat.

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:52.570
Maybe if it's downstairs, get
your partner, call the police.

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:56.000
As they're doing that, stand
at the top of the stairs

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.900
or somewhere and just shout
down, we've called the police,

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:01.460
they're going to be
here in five minutes.

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:05.204
Five minutes is enough
time for somebody to go.

00:56:05.204 --> 00:56:06.620
If you say something
like, they're

00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:12.880
going to be here any minute,
or hear the sirens coming up,

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:15.485
that's when you
might spook them.

00:56:15.485 --> 00:56:17.860
And remember what we were
talking about stress and duress

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:22.140
and how your decision-making
ability is affected?

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:24.920
It's the same of the
aggressor and predator.

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:28.110
They will also be adrenalized,
and their decision making

00:56:28.110 --> 00:56:30.480
process will be affected.

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.920
So again, you've got to
accept the possibility

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:36.420
that they might
do something rash.

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:38.260
But by and large,
most burglars don't

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:39.860
want to interact with you.

00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:43.170
They want to steal your
goods, and they want to go.

00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:46.940
Another thing to be aware
of, if you have been burgled,

00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:49.270
most burglars know that
your insurance takes

00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:52.150
a certain amount
of time to clear

00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:56.050
and that you'll go out and
buy new goods to replace.

00:56:56.050 --> 00:57:01.570
So never go light in terms
of upping your security.

00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:04.170
A lot people will go,
I've been burgled,

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:06.580
and it's kind of like, I ought
to do something about it.

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:08.240
I ought to get a
security system.

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.700
I ought to do something.

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:12.290
And after a week
or so, it doesn't

00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:14.430
seem so immediate a need.

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:15.780
I'll see to it later.

00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.740
Be aware that your house
is kind of-- they've

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:21.940
broken into it once,
they know how to get in.

00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:23.690
And you really want
to be doing a security

00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:25.530
assessment of your property.

00:57:25.530 --> 00:57:30.250
And that includes basement
doors and garage doors.

00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:32.780
They're probably the two
which get overlooked.

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:35.430
I've got this sturdy front door.

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:37.920
But if your basement
door is rotting

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:42.430
and I can kick the lock down,
I'm now in your basement,

00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:46.220
and there's no natural
surveillance in your basement.

00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:49.510
So I've got all the time in the
world to effectively hack away

00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:52.816
at that interior door
to get into your house.

00:57:52.816 --> 00:57:54.190
And this goes,
again, what you're

00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:55.810
looking for is
natural surveillance.

00:57:55.810 --> 00:58:00.260
So if you've got high fences,
bushes, shrubbery, cut it down

00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:03.440
so people can actually
see in so there's not

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.835
anywhere for somebody to
spend time breaking in.

00:58:06.835 --> 00:58:08.640
So that makes sense.

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.570
Any other questions?

00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:11.160
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:12.800
So you talked at
length about how

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:15.040
to be aware and
recognize situations

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.771
when there's a threat coming.

00:58:16.771 --> 00:58:19.020
And you also talked about
what to do when it's already

00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:22.260
the point of the knife
being held against you.

00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:25.380
So what can you do in
the five or ten seconds

00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:27.200
preceding that to avoid it?

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:27.797
Do you run?

00:58:27.797 --> 00:58:30.130
What do you do if someone is
following right behind you?

00:58:30.130 --> 00:58:30.690
Do you run?

00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:31.564
Do you confront them?

00:58:31.564 --> 00:58:33.034
Do you change course, et cetera?

00:58:33.034 --> 00:58:34.700
GERSHON BEN KEREN:
It's a good question,

00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:36.200
and it's probably
that middle ground

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.790
which confuses most people.

00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:40.320
So you've identified the threat.

00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:42.650
It's not yet to you.

00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:45.135
What can I do in
that interim phase?

00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:50.652
And again, situation
determines the solution,

00:58:50.652 --> 00:58:52.360
so not every one of
these is appropriate.

00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:59.100
Maybe I want to let the person
know that I've identified them,

00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:01.701
that they've lost that
element of surprise.

00:59:01.701 --> 00:59:04.200
And that could be as simple as
making eye contact with them.

00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:08.820
And that's, again,
depending what I believe

00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:11.540
or kind of working
to their motive.

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:14.190
I probably know that in
a crowded shopping mall,

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:16.780
somebody is not
trying to abduct me.

00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:20.240
They'll do that more in the
parking lot than in the mall

00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:24.230
itself, so it's more likely
be somebody like a mugger.

00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:27.410
And if they've lost
that element of surprise

00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:30.410
and I can move away,
the chances are

00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:32.990
they're going to just
pick another victim.

00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:37.430
Because I'm making myself
a harder target for them.

00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:39.720
I'm a big fan, where
possible, of getting

00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:42.970
barriers and objects between
me and the person I believe

00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:44.870
who's a potential assailant.

00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:47.340
Parked cars are fantastic.

00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:49.265
Parked cars make a
really good barrier.

00:59:49.265 --> 00:59:50.890
If you're walking on
the street and you

00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:57.070
think somebody's behind
you, move behind it.

00:59:57.070 --> 00:59:59.560
Again, if you interrupt
the plan early enough on,

00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:03.050
they're probably going to pick
somebody else that's a victim.

01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:07.090
And this is why they go
to areas where there's

01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:09.670
a large number of
potential victims.

01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:11.840
And that's why they're
carrying out surveillance--

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.630
to see not only are you
a good potential victim,

01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:17.750
but have you picked up on them.

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:22.890
So making distance, putting
objects and barriers

01:00:22.890 --> 01:00:27.240
would probably be my short
answer on what to do.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:31.470
At a higher level, if I really
think it's going to be violent,

01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:33.652
I'm looking for an
improvised weapon.

01:00:33.652 --> 01:00:36.870
And we talk about this
in the book and the way

01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:40.370
the Israeli Defense
Forces teach people

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:43.060
how to improvise and
use the environment.

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:46.510
And it basically involves
categorising objects.

01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:49.572
So I look for objects that
are like a stick, objects that

01:00:49.572 --> 01:00:51.890
are like a knife, et
cetera, et cetera.

01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:54.090
So I can try and make distance.

01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:56.100
I can try and put
objects and barriers.

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:59.970
That could be simple as a
table if I'm in a restaurant

01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:02.920
or furniture if the assault
is in my house, something

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.710
to slow the person's
advance down

01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:08.700
and that gives me a
chance to either formulate

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:12.737
another strategy or
basically make my escape,

01:01:12.737 --> 01:01:14.695
and then looking for
objects in the environment

01:01:14.695 --> 01:01:16.750
that I can use to
protect myself with.

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:19.360
So that, again, would
be my short answer.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:22.710
But really, if in
that situation you

01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:26.010
came up with a solution--
somebody is behind me,

01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:28.170
would running work?

01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:28.880
There you go.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.560
That's your solution.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:34.300
You don't really need to
consider any of the others.

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.040
And the problem we
often have is our ego

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.511
gets in the way of
those solutions,

01:01:37.511 --> 01:01:39.510
because we don't want to
look like the guy who's

01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:42.220
running away from somebody.

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:43.450
But you know what?

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:47.900
There's only one of me,
and my survival is key.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.585
And if I look a bit
of an idiot, hey,

01:01:50.585 --> 01:01:52.460
I've lived my life
looking a bit of an idiot.

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.282
I can cope with that.

01:01:54.282 --> 01:01:56.250
Does that make sense?

01:01:56.250 --> 01:01:57.084
Any other questions?

01:01:57.084 --> 01:01:58.458
AUDIENCE: How
would the heuristic

01:01:58.458 --> 01:02:00.390
change if family
members are present?

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:02.370
That kind of takes away
the running option.

01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:03.020
GERSHON BEN KEREN: Absolutely.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.395
And again, this
is something when

01:02:04.395 --> 01:02:06.650
we start building
the decision trees.

01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:08.990
You might need several
decision trees,

01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:11.550
and that's why we have the
situational components,

01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:14.600
to start altering
the heuristics.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:15.520
Kids are a hard one.

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.860
A lot of it will
depend on how you've

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.290
educated your kid as
to personal safety

01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:26.620
and whether you've included
them in on your plan or not.

01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:28.930
And this can be a frightening
thing for an adult

01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:32.110
to do, to say to a kid, if
we're ever in a situation

01:02:32.110 --> 01:02:34.870
where somebody is aggressive
towards me or your dad,

01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:36.700
this is what we're going to do.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:40.240
So you might try and
work out a decision tree

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.960
with your kid in mind,
and a lot of that

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:45.040
might be based on your
kid's personality.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.990
And this could be one
where, in terms of fighting,

01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:51.430
you really don't want to be
the guy who's seen by your kid

01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:54.770
beating seven shades of
snot out of somebody.

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:57.100
That's a consideration as well.

01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:59.200
I think this macho idea
that your kid wants

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:04.090
to see your dad defend them,
I think that's a nice idea.

01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:06.720
I think when you look at what
the realities of violence are,

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.780
you might not want to present
that image to your kid.

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:12.840
So it could be that-- say
you're with your partner

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:17.970
and the kid, that your decision
tree is, first sign of threat,

01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:22.650
child gets behind me,
moves away with mom.

01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:25.010
So you make yourself
the guy on your own.

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:31.020
So you basically remove
those two third parties

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.840
away from the scene
so that you can

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:36.120
work through
heuristics on your own.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.730
It could be in worst
case scenarios--

01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:45.310
and again, this is really to
think about whether it's best--

01:03:45.310 --> 01:03:48.870
to tell your kid, you know what,
this is not a good situation

01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:50.396
for you to be with.

01:03:50.396 --> 01:03:52.020
You need to find
somebody else to alert

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:54.570
that there's danger going on.

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:56.400
And one of the things
with educating kids

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.441
is you have to see the
world through a kid's eyes

01:03:58.441 --> 01:03:59.970
when you do this.

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:06.029
So often, people will say,
go and get a policeman.

01:04:06.029 --> 01:04:07.570
Often, kids don't
know the difference

01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:11.270
between policemen
and security guards.

01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:14.320
They're just basically
in the same uniform.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:17.110
And also, under stress and
duress, which a kid will be,

01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:20.810
they'll be seeing the world in a
much more merged and blurry way

01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:22.290
than a distinct way.

01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:25.180
And if we look at
the professions which

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:27.470
have yielded some of the
worst child sexual predators,

01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:30.010
security guards are one of them.

01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:33.590
So I don't want to be saying
to my kid, go find a policeman.

01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:36.120
By and large, if you have
to develop a strategy

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.190
and you develop your
own heuristics--

01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:42.140
I would say these
are my heuristics--

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:46.910
tell your kid to go
and find another woman.

01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:51.675
The number of female child
sexual predators is minute.

01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:57.110
Most women have some
maternal instinct

01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:59.890
and are likely to
look after your kid.

01:04:59.890 --> 01:05:01.390
The other things I
would think about

01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:04.902
is actually having information
about your child on them.

01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:07.360
Because they might not be of
an age where they can remember

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.040
phone numbers, the
house where they live,

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.420
and all of those things.

01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:15.750
So again, your heuristics
have to work for you

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:18.310
according to your
base and skill set.

01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:20.740
And they might involve
telling your kid,

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:23.180
because of the situation
and your skill set,

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:26.650
that they need to go and find
somebody to deal with this.

01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:28.970
Because they're a liability
with you and likely to get

01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:34.760
harmed, and they're better
off in another location.

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:37.590
That's a hard thing to do.

01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:40.500
And again, I would always say
when you talk about safety

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.230
with your kids, they're often
a lot more mature about it

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:45.690
than we think.

01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:47.560
They often have a
better understanding

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:52.580
and are a lot more receptive
and a lot more sensible

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.450
surrounding solutions.

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.659
We as parents--
I'm a parent-- tend

01:05:56.659 --> 01:05:58.700
to think they're going to
get freaked out as soon

01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:01.070
as we start talking
about violence.

01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:03.270
That hasn't been my experience.

01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:06.960
But I think you have to do it
in a mature, non-sensational

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:11.030
fashion and present it more
with, if somebody starts

01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:14.490
to behave aggressively towards
me and I tell you to do this,

01:06:14.490 --> 01:06:17.222
this is what you do.

01:06:17.222 --> 01:06:18.680
And it could be as
simple as things

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.880
like putting your
kid in the car.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.430
The other thing
to always consider

01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:25.080
is it's the same as the thing
about when you're in a plane--

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:28.090
put your own oxygen
mask on first.

01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:30.851
If you're not able to
keep yourself safe,

01:06:30.851 --> 01:06:32.392
then there's not a
guarantee that you

01:06:32.392 --> 01:06:34.900
can keep your kids safe.

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.970
And that's always a
big concern as well--

01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:39.570
are you doing something in this
situation which is actually

01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:43.300
going to put you in more harm?

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.780
To be honest, I would work
off the same simple heuristic.

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.290
If somebody wants
money, et cetera,

01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:50.680
et cetera, off me, there you go.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:54.690
If you want me, if you want my
kid, if you want me and my kid,

01:06:54.690 --> 01:06:56.280
you know what?

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:59.260
Sorry, I'm going to have to deal
with you physically for that.

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:02.220
If it's a case of
bullying and intimidation,

01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:06.380
I think it's a much better
way of basically sucking it

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:10.440
up, putting your ego in
check, letting it happen.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:15.226
We fight for two
reasons-- ego or survival.

01:07:15.226 --> 01:07:18.840
It's a famous quote
from Dr. Gabriel Snyder.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.430
They're the two
reasons you basically

01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:22.580
fight-- ego or survival.

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:24.430
So if the situation
you're facing

01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:30.350
is one where it's a matter of
ego, be the bigger man on that.

01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:33.760
One of the things I always do
when I'm confronting violence

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:40.210
is I decide whether a
situation is premeditated--

01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:44.650
that is, somebody has come
to that situation basically

01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:47.790
wanting to harm me--
or if it's spontaneous.

01:07:47.790 --> 01:07:50.610
Has something I've done
or perceived to have done

01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:52.840
caused the person to become
aggressive-- so spill

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:56.140
a drink over them, cut them
off in a parking space.

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:57.680
And in those
situations, I can use

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.950
a lot of deescalation skills.

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:02.290
So when I build my really,
really top level decision

01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:06.820
tree, is it premeditated,
is it spontaneous?

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:09.650
If it's premeditated,
do they want me?

01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:12.000
Do they want my things?

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.070
And then I go into
that decision tree.

01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:17.420
If it's spontaneous, I
assess their emotional state.

01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:18.510
Can I deescalate?

01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:20.270
Can I disengage?

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:23.170
So again, we can build the
decision tree a little higher.

01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:26.129
With third parties involved,
I would include them

01:08:26.129 --> 01:08:26.920
in your heuristics.

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.578
Does that makes sense?

01:08:28.578 --> 01:08:29.534
Anything else?

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.630
OK, guys.

01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:36.210
Thank you very, very
much for listening.

01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:39.740
I hope you never have to use
the physical skills in the book

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:42.590
and that the personal safety
skills of threat recognition

01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:44.279
and the decision-making
skills are

01:08:44.279 --> 01:08:47.680
what allows you to identify,
avoid, and protect violence.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:48.820
Thank you very much.

01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:51.838
