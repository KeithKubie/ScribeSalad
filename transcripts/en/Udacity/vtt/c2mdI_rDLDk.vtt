00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.180
So to solve that problem we're going
to turn to unsupervised learning.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.920
Unsupervised learning means
training without any labels.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.390
It's easy to find texts, lots of texts,
take the web for example, or

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.160
even just Wikipedia.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.650
That's plenty of text to train on,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.120
if you can figure out
what to learn from it.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.590
Here's a very very simple but very
powerful idea that we're going to use.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.540
Similar words tend to
occur in similar contexts.
