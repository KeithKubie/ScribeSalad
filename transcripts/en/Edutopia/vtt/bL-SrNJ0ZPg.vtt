00:00:02.826 --> 00:00:06.016
&gt;&gt;Violet: I think school would be a
lot more engaging if we were asked

00:00:06.096 --> 00:00:07.466
to solve complex problems.

00:00:07.796 --> 00:00:10.326
Building a robot and seeing it run

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:13.216
and seeing it complete tasks
is definitely more satisfying

00:00:13.216 --> 00:00:15.076
than any schoolwork I've ever done.

00:00:15.076 --> 00:00:17.006
Getting an A on the
test, that's cool,

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:20.046
but seeing something I have built

00:00:20.046 --> 00:00:23.726
with my own hands move
is way more satisfying.

00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:38.216
&gt;&gt;So I'll try connecting
a one-ten-nine.

00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:40.036
I'll put a jumper underneath.

00:00:40.036 --> 00:00:41.776
&gt;&gt;Man: Yeah, just don't
overlap them, right?

00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:42.716
Start with three.

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:45.226
&gt;&gt;Woodie: I think a
reasonable way to think

00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:50.426
about robotics is birthing a
machine that can be over there

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:53.556
and do something that you
either taught it to do,

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:55.296
or that you're commanding
it to do now.

00:00:55.836 --> 00:00:58.836
But something that you
created that's apart

00:00:58.836 --> 00:01:00.646
from you that does your bidding.

00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:03.686
&gt;&gt;Violet: So do you guys know how
to test a motor with a battery?

00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:04.446
&gt;&gt;Girl: Not really.

00:01:04.896 --> 00:01:05.776
&gt;&gt;Violet: Okay, here.

00:01:06.296 --> 00:01:08.466
&gt;&gt;So I grew up in a
really geeky family.

00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:12.396
My dad is one of those super geeks.

00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:15.896
He always showed me sci-fi
movies and so he's the one

00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:18.626
who kinda showed me
into what robots are.

00:01:19.386 --> 00:01:24.066
&gt;&gt;Kjersti: You could do it like that,
or you could do it to the top here,

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.986
so that way the hub
would be on the outside.

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:27.576
&gt;&gt;It was something
completely new for me.

00:01:27.576 --> 00:01:30.306
It was something that I'd never
heard about before, especially heard

00:01:30.306 --> 00:01:32.186
about kids being able to do.

00:01:32.186 --> 00:01:36.106
And it was really hard,
which was something

00:01:36.106 --> 00:01:39.966
that was exciting for
me, a challenge.

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:42.606
&gt;&gt;Woodie: One of the things that
makes robotics an ideal thing

00:01:42.606 --> 00:01:51.006
for young people to do is that that
child obeying the parent's command is

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:51.736
a real thrill.

00:01:52.276 --> 00:01:55.306
When you first see someone build
something and they get it together

00:01:55.656 --> 00:01:57.026
and then they wiggle the joystick.

00:01:57.616 --> 00:02:00.116
"Wow, it works, it works!"

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:06.596
&gt;&gt;Violet: I think the fact that I'm
kind of a stubborn person contributed

00:02:06.596 --> 00:02:09.996
to me being a good robotics engineer.

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:14.446
When I see a problem, I wanna find
a solution, I wanna figure it out.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:19.166
And if I run into a few
failures on the way,

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:21.276
I'm not gonna let that
stand in my way.

00:02:21.276 --> 00:02:25.226
I'm gonna keep trying at it and keep
going until I've found a solution.

00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:29.136
&gt;&gt;Kjersti: Just feel over all of the
little cables back here to make sure

00:02:29.136 --> 00:02:31.976
that none of them are loose
or sticking out a little bit.

00:02:31.976 --> 00:02:33.966
Drive train, make sure that
none of the chains are off,

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:35.806
'cause that's a problem
that we've encountered.

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:38.996
&gt;&gt;Some of the ways that we've gotten
better at building robotics are just

00:02:38.996 --> 00:02:42.526
in very simple mechanical
ways, like being really good

00:02:42.526 --> 00:02:46.236
at constructing simple things
and knowing which screws to use

00:02:46.236 --> 00:02:49.606
in which situation, so that
things don't fall apart later

00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:51.336
on when you're using your robot.

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:55.146
And then other things
are very elegant designs.

00:02:55.346 --> 00:02:59.416
You have to see the problem in
front of you and go through a bunch

00:02:59.416 --> 00:03:02.086
of different designs
before you get to the one

00:03:02.086 --> 00:03:04.206
that looks the best
and functions the best.

00:03:08.156 --> 00:03:10.916
&gt;&gt;So one of the main parts
of the game for this year is,

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:13.666
you have to lift these
rings up to different pegs

00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:14.726
and put them on the pegs.

00:03:15.656 --> 00:03:18.096
We use pulleys that are
controlled by a winch.

00:03:18.446 --> 00:03:19.996
The lift comes up.

00:03:20.326 --> 00:03:22.396
&gt;&gt;We use rectangular tubing here,

00:03:22.396 --> 00:03:24.326
along with your average
drawer slides.

00:03:24.706 --> 00:03:28.386
&gt;&gt;The way this robot moves around
is the drive train right here,

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:31.176
&gt;&gt;There's a chain connecting
each of the motor to the wheels,

00:03:31.476 --> 00:03:33.406
&gt;&gt;We have two motors for each side,

00:03:33.686 --> 00:03:36.246
&gt;&gt;We have an IR, infrared seeker,

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.316
&gt;&gt;This is what we call the brick,

00:03:38.316 --> 00:03:40.586
&gt;&gt;The NXT brick is where
all our programming goes,

00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:42.806
and it has wires going
up to all the sensors.

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:46.856
&gt;&gt;The brick talks to the motors
and tells them to run essentially.

00:03:46.996 --> 00:03:48.976
&gt;&gt;I think that that's
pretty much our robot.

00:03:51.086 --> 00:03:53.096
&gt;&gt;Violet: I would like you guys
to do, in this extra meeting time

00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:57.526
that we have, is try to see how
many challenges you can complete.

00:03:57.526 --> 00:03:59.746
&gt;&gt;After last year, I
started just looking back,

00:04:00.816 --> 00:04:03.696
thinking back to all the
effort I had put into robotics

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:05.736
and all the time I spent doing it.

00:04:05.736 --> 00:04:07.926
And I realized how
much I had changed,

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:10.226
how much I had grown
more confident in myself.

00:04:16.846 --> 00:04:19.816
&gt;&gt;Okay, so for how about right
now, you start from over here?

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:23.266
And drive up and try to
balance on the bridge.

00:04:23.426 --> 00:04:25.236
&gt;&gt;I wanted to give
that to other people,

00:04:25.936 --> 00:04:28.796
so that's why I started
mentoring robotics students,

00:04:28.986 --> 00:04:33.496
trying to get people to understand
why this is such a great thing.

00:04:33.746 --> 00:04:36.186
&gt;&gt;Kjersti: The first
thing I said to myself

00:04:36.186 --> 00:04:38.176
when I decided I was
gonna be a teacher was

00:04:38.176 --> 00:04:39.916
that I wasn't gonna
give them any answers,

00:04:39.916 --> 00:04:42.776
and I wasn't gonna build
the robot for them.

00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:45.996
&gt;&gt;Girl: Because one to six
was not fast enough, right?

00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:46.416
&gt;&gt;Kjersti: Yes.

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:53.356
&gt;&gt;I try to be better at guiding them
towards an answer using their thought

00:04:53.356 --> 00:04:55.376
processes instead of
my thought processes.

00:04:55.616 --> 00:04:58.786
&gt;&gt;Check the sensor cables,
so just go over these guys.

00:04:58.786 --> 00:05:01.386
Just pretty much make sure
everything is plugged in and then--

00:05:01.386 --> 00:05:04.376
&gt;&gt;I'm teaching them
things, but more than that,

00:05:04.376 --> 00:05:06.646
I'm giving them a real
problem to solve and I feel

00:05:06.646 --> 00:05:08.136
like I'm really giving
them the skills

00:05:08.136 --> 00:05:09.946
to accomplish this certain problem.

00:05:09.946 --> 00:05:10.526
&gt;&gt;Man: All set?

00:05:10.596 --> 00:05:13.626
&gt;&gt;Announcer: Looks like we have the
checking now, all the teams are set

00:05:13.626 --> 00:05:16.446
for match number six,
here in Daly City.

00:05:16.646 --> 00:05:18.056
&gt;&gt;Woman: Controllers please.

00:05:18.616 --> 00:05:22.536
&gt;&gt;Woodie: There is a lot of
failure in robotics work,

00:05:23.196 --> 00:05:27.156
but it's not total failure and
you don't feel like a fool.

00:05:27.156 --> 00:05:30.816
When you're going through the
loops, designing something,

00:05:30.816 --> 00:05:34.586
the first time you try it, it
probably didn't work and what

00:05:34.586 --> 00:05:38.516
that teaches you is how to do the
next loop to get better and better.

00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:41.096
&gt;&gt;Announcer: You have
less than one minute left.

00:05:41.096 --> 00:05:43.216
Four-four-seven-five in
danger of tipping over.

00:05:43.706 --> 00:05:47.536
&gt;&gt;Kjersti: Learning the art of
failing is sort of a key aspect

00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:50.596
of robotics because if you don't
know how to recover from the failure,

00:05:51.026 --> 00:05:53.296
then you're not gonna
be able to build a robot

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:57.966
that encompasses all those failures
and turns it into something beautiful

00:05:57.966 --> 00:06:00.406
that works really well
at what it does.

00:06:00.486 --> 00:06:04.156
&gt;&gt;Announcer: Six-zero-zero-one is
moving very fast, flipping to block.

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:09.456
&gt;&gt;Woodie: If you follow textbooks
only, you think there's a set

00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:12.166
of problems at the end of the
chapter that have unique answers.

00:06:12.946 --> 00:06:15.046
That's very, very unlike real life.

00:06:15.566 --> 00:06:17.996
So learning about how to fail

00:06:17.996 --> 00:06:22.666
and bounce back is a fundamentally
important thing to know about life.

00:06:23.196 --> 00:06:26.956
And learning that the people that
come back and try again are the ones

00:06:26.956 --> 00:06:27.776
that are gonna get ahead.

00:06:27.776 --> 00:06:31.486
&gt;&gt;Announcer: And that's a
match, great match everybody.

00:06:32.186 --> 00:06:32.366
&gt;&gt;All: &lt;cheering&gt;

00:06:32.796 --> 00:06:37.286
&gt;&gt;Violet: I think that robotics
would be really good for those kids

00:06:37.476 --> 00:06:39.076
who just think school's
a waste of time.

00:06:39.576 --> 00:06:41.246
I know a lotta kids
who are really smart,

00:06:41.886 --> 00:06:43.886
but get bad grades 'cause
they just don't see the point,

00:06:44.326 --> 00:06:48.086
and with something like robots,
it's so captivating and exciting

00:06:48.086 --> 00:06:50.826
and addicting, obviously,

00:06:52.626 --> 00:06:56.676
that I think it would engage people a
lot more and make people more willing

00:06:56.676 --> 00:06:59.606
to put more effort
into their schoolwork.
