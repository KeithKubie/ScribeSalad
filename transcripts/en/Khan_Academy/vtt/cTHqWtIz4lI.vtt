00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.520
- [Woman] The era from 1945 to 1980

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.880
was action packed, to say the least.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.200
During this period, the
United States experienced

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.660
the baby boom, the Civil Rights Movement,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.440
the tumultuous 1960s, and
the quagmire of Vietnam.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.570
This era was also riddled
with contradictions.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.780
A sense of optimism in the
future and a conviction

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.940
that American economic
prosperity was endless

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.120
was tempered by fears
of nuclear annihilation

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.960
and a war on poverty.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.400
A foreign policy based on democracy

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.290
and anti-communism, abroad,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.740
was undermined by the
suppression of civil rights

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.440
and civil liberties, at home.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.050
Material comforts and
Leave It To Beaver visions

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.570
of suburbia clashed with growing calls

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.480
for young people to tune
in, turn on, and drop out.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.000
Would the generation
that fought World War II

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.700
even recognize the generation
that protested Vietnam?

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.470
That's the question I'd like
to explore, in this video,

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.420
taking a high-level look at the impact

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.350
the events of the postwar era

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.510
had on reshaping American
national identity.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.890
How much did American
national identity change,

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.110
and how much did it stay the
same, over this time period?

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.600
To answer this question,
first, we have to define

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.580
what we mean by American
national identity.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.190
In other videos, we've
looked at a few aspects

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.230
of American identity as
core ideological beliefs

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.130
about things like who
counts as an American,

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.560
whether the United States is exceptional,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.170
or whether it's possible
for anyone to succeed,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.110
so long as they work hard enough.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.230
So if we're trying to
track continuity and change

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.290
in American identity, over
the period from 1945 to 1980,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.520
what might be a few beliefs
we should trace, over time?

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.270
I encourage you to pause the video

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.000
and see if you can come up with a couple,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.230
based on your knowledge of the
events in this time period.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.290
Some big events that jump
out to me are the Cold War

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.610
and the Civil Rights Movement,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.150
as well as the protests of the 1960s.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.950
So with that in mind, the core beliefs

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.170
I'd like to look at are ideas
about the United States' role

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.310
in the world, who counts
as an American citizen,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.400
and the country's cultural values.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.460
You might have come up with

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.880
a totally different set of
beliefs, which is great.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.540
Try out this same process
I'm about to model,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.530
using the beliefs that you've chosen.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.240
Now that we've got a few
aspects of national identity

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.650
we wanna track, let's compare each of them

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.630
at the beginning of this period
to the end of this period.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.640
Remember, we're doing a super,
high-level overview, here.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.320
So I'm not gonna take a whole lot of time

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.210
to explain events in detail.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.420
But if something comes up
that you're unfamiliar with,

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.020
just make a note, and you can look it up

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.060
when you've got time.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.280
All right, let's see what
changed and what stayed the same,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.540
over this period, in beliefs about

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.030
the United States' role in the world.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.880
In 1945, the United States
emerged as a world superpower,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.370
having abandoned isolationism
as a foreign policy.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.920
Instead, the United States
became a leading member

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.100
of the United Nations and
the NATO defensive pact.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.750
The U.S. government was determined

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.460
to contain the spread of communism

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.530
and the influence of the Soviet Union

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.280
through providing military
and financial support

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.900
to nations fighting communism,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.670
which would lead to American
military engagements

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.420
in Korea and Vietnam.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.400
The United States also
had a lot of confidence

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.530
in its economic role in the world

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.100
as the only country whose industrial might

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.080
hadn't been compromised
by World War II bombings.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.170
Immediately after the
war, the United States

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.120
was the world's leading
exporter of steel, cars,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.340
consumer goods, and oil.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.050
How does that compare to beliefs

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.660
about America's proper
role in the world in 1980?

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.280
Well, the United States was
still a world superpower

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.450
at the end of this era.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.800
And it was still pursuing anti-communism

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.180
as a foreign policy.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.340
But in the 1970s, the Cold War
entered a period of detente,

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.720
a relaxation of tensions
and increase in cooperation

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.860
between the United States
and the Soviet Union.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.480
You could see this as the U.S. government

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.270
accepting peaceful coexistence
with the Soviet Union.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.380
This approach will
change when Ronald Reagan

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.440
comes into office in 1981.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.630
But the period of detente lasted
until the end of the 1970s.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.011
The Vietnam War shook American confidence

00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:10.790
in its interventionist foreign policy.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.870
After the war, there was more reluctance

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.910
to commit U.S. troops, abroad,

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.300
in what's been called Vietnam Syndrome.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.330
Likewise, the Nixon Doctrine
called for U.S. allies

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.640
to take primary responsibility
for their own defense.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.840
Lastly, U.S. economic world
dominance was threatened,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.860
in the late 1970s, as well,

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.370
as Japanese and German automobile makers

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.270
began competing internationally.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.190
And the energy-dependent United States

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.440
found that its energy needs
were increasingly tied

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.890
to the oil exporting
countries of the Middle East.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.000
So in terms of what changed
and what stayed the same,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.450
from the beginning to the
end of the postwar era,

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.520
I would say that although
the United States

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.560
remained a world superpower,
committed to supporting

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.650
its allies and opposing
the spread of communism,

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.170
by the end of the 1970s, the
country looked to establish

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.430
some limits to its
intervention in world affairs.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.290
Next, let's look at how
beliefs about citizenship

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.870
changed during this period.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.610
After the shared experience
of G.I.s in World War II,

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.790
European immigrants who
had been looked upon

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.350
as dangerous others,
in the 1920s and 1930s,

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.480
were accepted as U.S. citizens

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.100
and categorized as simply white,

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.720
not Polish or Irish or Russian.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.500
But African American soldiers,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.630
who had served in segregated
units during the war,

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.630
weren't afforded the same courtesy.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.030
Despite Truman's executive
order desegregating the military

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.670
in 1948, black veterans
encountered racial discrimination

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.670
after the war, along
with difficulty accessing

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.900
the government subsidies
for education and home loans

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.840
that white G.I.s took advantage of.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.790
The immigration restrictions that set

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.280
national origin quotas in the 1920s

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.350
were still largely intact,

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.210
although the Chinese Exclusion
Act had been repealed

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.740
during the war as China was a U.S. ally.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.720
Chinese Americans were then eligible

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.250
to become U.S. citizens.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.510
However, the new quota
for Chinese immigrants

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.740
was just 105 individuals per year.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.700
What were the beliefs around citizenship

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.910
at the end of the postwar era?

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.060
A lot changed during this time period,

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.070
thanks to the Civil Rights
Movement, Supreme Court decisions

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.080
like Brown versus Board of Education,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.540
and legislation like the
the Civil Rights Act of 1964

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.010
and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.560
At the end of the '60s,
African Americans were able

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.800
to access more citizenship rights

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.670
than they ever had, before.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.780
And, in 1965, Congress repealed the old

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.610
national origin quotas and
passed new immigration laws,

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.610
allowing Asians to enter the country

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.581
as well as prioritizing
family reunification

00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:45.830
and the entrance of skilled immigrants.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.360
But in the late 1960s and 1970s,

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.240
there was a backlash against
the civil rights policies

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.280
set by the Supreme Court, in
the Johnson administration.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.820
With many conservatives arguing

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.520
that the federal intervention
to advance civil rights

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.130
had gone too far, and with
some left-leaning organizations

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.500
arguing that it hadn't gone far enough,

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.770
to address issues like housing
and job discrimination,

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.060
looking at the changes and continuities

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.700
in beliefs about citizenship
over this period,

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.870
I'd say there was an enormous
expansion, over time,

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.070
in who was considered a citizen

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.150
or eligible to become a
citizen of the United States.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.640
But there was also a growing antagonism

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.500
toward the federal government intervening

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.240
on behalf of civil rights.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.490
Last, let's look at
American cultural values,

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.080
at the beginning and
end of the postwar era.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.870
In the years after the war,
there was an emphasis on

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.890
domesticity and family life.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.590
And women were expected to
give up their war time jobs

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.570
and seek fulfillment through
motherhood and consumption.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.440
The United States began
a postwar economic boom

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.540
that looked virtually unstoppable.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.000
In fact, the American
standard of living doubled

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.210
in the 25 years after World War II.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.640
There was also a lot of pressure

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.040
for Americans to conform to
a homogenous, mass culture,

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.070
idealizing the white,
suburban, nuclear family.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.280
Fear of communist infiltrators

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.940
led to witch hunts, like McCarthyism.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.160
But few people people
questioned the wisdom

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.550
of the U.S. government or
authority figures, in general.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.790
Compare that to the end of this period,

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.770
after the tumult of the 1960s

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.130
had turned American culture on its head.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:22.680
In the 1960s and 1970s,
the sexual revolution

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.740
and women's rights movement challenged

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.180
the idealized, nuclear family,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.360
allowing for a more
permissive sexual culture

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.370
and the advancement of
women in jobs and education.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.320
Starting as early as the 1950s,

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.440
the Beat Generation began
to question the emptiness

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.870
of the single-minded pursuit of wealth

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.510
that was the American Dream.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:45.630
In the 1960s, students
began to protest the draft

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.360
and the military industrial
complex, more generally,

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.550
wondering what the United States

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.380
was even doing in Vietnam.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.910
They vowed not to trust anyone over 30.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.080
By the 1970s, public confidence
in the U.S. government

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.230
was also at an all-time low,

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.830
after revelations about
presidential misdeeds

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.460
exposed by the Pentagon Papers
and the Watergate scandal.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.010
To add insult to injury,
the endless economic boom

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:13.260
finally seemed to be at
an end, by the 1970s,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.390
with deindustrialization and stagflation,

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.350
increasing prices and unemployment.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.650
So it seems like American cultural values

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:25.210
changed a great deal, from 1945 to 1980,

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.010
from a culture of suburban conformity

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.270
to one of greater personal freedom

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.360
but also greater cynicism.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.630
But it is important to note

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.880
that the people of the United States

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.490
didn't fully reject the
premise of the American Dream.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.010
Despite the counterculture of the 1960s,

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.240
by the 1970s, most
people were still looking

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.470
for a good job and hoping
to buy a nice home.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.410
If we return to our question, then,

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.380
how much did the events of the postwar era

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.220
reshape American identity?

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.970
I think we can respond that
they reshaped it quite a bit.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.440
The Civil Rights
Movement, the Vietnam War,

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.410
and the protest movements of the 1960s

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.460
led to a U.S. national identity

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.430
that was considerably more
inclusive and socially free,

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.680
but also a good deal less confident

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.440
about its government or
its role in the world.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.990
To see how these forces played out,

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.930
in the next stage of U.S. history,

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.753
we'll have to look to the 1980s.
