00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.620
Let's see if we might be able to
make some use of the divergence

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.440
theorem.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.460
So I have this region, this
simple solid right over here.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.700
x can go between
negative 1 and 1.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.309
z, this kind of arch
part right over here,

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:14.600
is going to be a function of x.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.766
That's the upper bound on z.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.880
The lower bound on z is just 0.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.655
And then y could go
anywhere between 0,

00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:22.920
and then it's bounded
here by this plane, where

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.860
we can express y as a
function of z. y is 2 minus z

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.390
along this plane
right over here.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.440
And we're given this
crazy vector field.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.950
It has natural logs
and tangents in it.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.340
And we're asked to evaluate
the surface integral,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.080
or actually, I should say
the flux of our vector field

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.880
across the boundary
of this region,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.390
across the surface of this
region right over here.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.740
And surface integrals are
messy as is, especially

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.952
when you have a crazy
vector field like this.

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:53.910
But you could imagine
that there might be a way

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.980
to simplify this, perhaps
using the divergence theorem.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.700
The divergence theorem
tells us that the flux

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.239
across the boundary of
this simple solid region

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.030
is going to be the same
thing as the triple integral

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.810
over the volume of
it, or I'll just

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:19.570
call it over the region, of
the divergence of F dv, where

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.760
dv is some combination
of dx, dy, dz.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.070
The divergence times
each little cubic volume,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.060
infinitesimal cubic
volume, so times dv.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.890
So let's see if this
simplifies things a bit.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.040
So let's calculate the
divergence of F first.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.120
So the divergence
of F is going to be

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.870
the partial of the x component,
or the partial of the-- you

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.110
could say the i component or the
x component with respect to x.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.990
Well, the derivative of this
with respect to x is just x.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.290
The derivative of this
with respect to x, luckily,

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.920
is just 0.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.812
This is a constant
in terms of x.

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:55.270
Now let's go over
here, the partial

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.880
of this with respect to y.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.170
The partial of this with
respect to y is just x.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.230
And then this is just a
constant in terms of y,

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.688
so it's just going
to be 0 when you

00:02:03.688 --> 00:02:05.566
take the derivative
with respect to y.

00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:07.940
And then, finally, the partial
of this with respect to z,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.320
well, this is just a
constant in terms of z.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.050
Doesn't change when z changes.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.760
So the partial with respect to
z is just going to be 0 here.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.950
And so taking the divergence
really, really, really

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.940
simplified things.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.700
The divergence of F
simplified down to 2x.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.610
And so now we can
restate the flux

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.950
across the surface as a
triple integral of 2x.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.990
So let me just write 2x here.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.190
And let's think
about the ordering.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.420
So y can go between 0 and this
plane that is a function of z.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.600
So let's write that down.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.377
So y is bounded below by 0 and
above by this plane 2 minus z.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.370
z is bounded below
by 0 and above

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.845
by-- you could call them these
parabolas of 1 minus x squared.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.350
And then x is bounded
below by negative 1

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.370
and bounded above by 1.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.110
So negative 1 is less than
or equal to x is less than

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.580
or equal to 1.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.010
And so this is probably a
good order of integration.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.710
We can integrate with
respect to y first,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.460
and then we'll get
a function of z.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.291
Then we can integrate
with respect to z,

00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:23.540
and we'll get a function of x.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.130
And then we can integrate
with respect to x.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.930
So let's do it in that order.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.523
So first we'll integrate with
respect to y, so we have dy.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.930
y is bounded below at 0 and
above by the plane 2 minus z.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.100
So this right over here is
a plane y is equal to 0.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.860
And this up over here is the
plane y is equal to 2 minus z.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.025
Then we can integrate
with respect to z.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.070
And z, once again,
is bounded below by 0

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.570
and bounded above by these
parabolas, 1 minus x squared.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.800
And then, finally, we can
integrate with respect to x.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.750
And x is bounded
below by negative 1

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.570
and bounded above by 1.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.880
So let's do some
integration here.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.440
So the first thing, when
we're integrating with respect

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.540
to x-- sorry, when we're
integrating with respect to y,

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.140
2x is just a constant.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.220
So this expression
right over here

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.770
is just going to be 2x
times y, and then we're

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.470
going to evaluate it
from 0 to 2 minus z.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.890
So it's going to be 2x times
2 minus z minus 2x times 0.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.050
Well, that second part's
just going to be 0.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.980
So this is going to
simplify as-- I'll

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.180
write it this way--
2x times 2 minus z.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.230
And actually, I'll just
leave it like that.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.680
And then we're going to
integrate this with respect

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.300
to z.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.170
And that's going to go from
0 to 1 minus x squared,

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.450
and then we have our dz there.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.866
And then after that, we're
going to integrate with respect

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:25.970
to x, negative 1 to 1 dx.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.887
So let's take the antiderivative
here with respect to z.

00:05:29.887 --> 00:05:31.720
This you really can
just view as a constant.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.580
We can actually even
bring it out front,

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.890
but I'll leave it there.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.410
So this piece right
over here-- I'll

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.310
do it in z's color--
this piece right

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.270
over here, see, we can
leave the 2x out front.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.120
Actually, I'll leave the 2x
out front of the whole thing.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.970
It's going to be 2x times--
so the antiderivative of this

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.650
with respect to z
is going to be 2z.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:00.740
Antiderivative of this is
negative z squared over 2,

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.850
and we are going to
evaluate this from 0

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.550
to 1 minus x squared.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.730
When we evaluate
them at 0, we're

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.502
just going to get
0 right over here.

00:06:13.502 --> 00:06:14.960
And so we really
just have to worry

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.737
about when z is equal
to 1 minus x squared.

00:06:17.737 --> 00:06:18.570
Did I do that right?

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.820
Yep.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.780
2z, and then minus
z squared over 2.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.980
You take the derivative,
you get negative z.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.850
Take the derivative
here, you just get 2.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:28.790
So that's right.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.680
So this is going
to be equal to 2x--

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:41.770
let me do that same color-- it's
going to be equal to 2x times--

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.830
let me get this right, let me go
into that pink color-- 2x times

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.332
2z.

00:06:47.332 --> 00:06:49.040
Well, z is going to
be 1 minus x squared,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.440
so it's going to be
2 minus 2x squared.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.010
That was just 2 times that.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:59.230
And then minus-- I'll just
write 1/2 times this quantity

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.060
squared.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.510
So this quantity squared is
going to be 1 minus 2x squared

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.450
plus x to the fourth.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.457
That's just some basic
algebra right over there.

00:07:09.457 --> 00:07:11.290
And then from that,
you're going to subtract

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.599
this thing evaluated at 0,
which is just going to be 0.

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.640
So [? y, you ?] just won't
even think about that.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.340
And now we need to
simplify this a little bit.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.700
And we are going to get,
if we simplify this,

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.980
we get 2 minus 2x
squared minus 1/2,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.780
and then plus-- so this is
negative 1/2 times negative 2x

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.280
squared.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.980
So it's going to be
positive x squared

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.380
minus 1/2 x to the fourth.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.670
Now, let's see, can
we simplify this part?

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.130
Let me just make sure we
know what we're doing here.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.140
So we have this 2x
right over there.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.890
I want to make sure I
got the signs right.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.260
Yep, looks like I did.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.490
And now let's look at this.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.240
So let's see, can I
simplify a little bit?

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.230
I have 2 minus
1/2, which is 3/2.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.170
So I have 3/2.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.120
That's that term and that
term take into account.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.220
And then I have negative
2x squared plus x squared.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.650
So that's just going to
result in negative x squared,

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.450
if I take that
term and that term.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:17.050
And then I have negative
1/2 x to the fourth,

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.845
and I'm multiplying
this whole thing by 2x.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:30.530
And so that's going to give us--
we have, let's see, 2x times

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.320
3/2.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:31.920
And I want to make sure.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.130
I'm doing this
slowly, so I don't

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:34.254
make any careless mistakes.

00:08:34.254 --> 00:08:35.558
The 2's cancel out.

00:08:35.558 --> 00:08:39.710
You get 3x, and then
2x times negative

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.250
x squared is negative
2x to the third.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.040
And then 2x times
this right over here.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.706
The 2 cancels out
with the negative 1/2,

00:08:46.706 --> 00:08:50.690
you have negative
x to the fifth.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.050
So all of this simplifies
to this right over here.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.330
So our whole thing simplifies
to an integral with respect

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.090
to x. x will go
from negative 1 to 1

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:05.760
of this business of 3x
minus 2x to the third minus

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.740
x to the fifth, and
then we have dx.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.300
And now we just take the
antiderivative with respect

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:21.670
to x, which is going to be 3/2
x squared minus-- let's see, x

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.100
to the fourth power--
minus 1/2, because it's

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.600
going to be 2/4,
x to the fourth.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.330
Is that right?

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.740
Because if you multiply
it, you're going to 2.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.630
Yep, x to the third, and then
minus x to the sixth over 6.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:40.940
And it's going to go from 1 to
negative 1 or negative 1 to 1.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.714
So when you evaluate
it at 1-- I'll

00:09:42.714 --> 00:09:43.880
just write it out real fast.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.380
So first, when you
evaluate it at 1,

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:50.800
you get 3/2 minus 1/2 minus 1/6.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:57.340
And then from that, we are
going to subtract 3/2 minus 1/2

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.386
plus 1/6.

00:09:59.386 --> 00:10:00.760
Or actually, no,
they're actually

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.430
all going to cancel out.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.570
Is that right?

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.510
Are they all going
to cancel out?

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.040
Yep, I think that's right.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.250
They all cancel out.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:14.680
So it's actually going to be
plus, or I should say minus 1/6

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.216
right over here.

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:17.590
And then all of
these cancel out.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:18.660
That cancels with that.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.730
That cancels with
that because we're

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.280
subtracting the negative 1/2.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.935
And that cancels with that.

00:10:23.935 --> 00:10:27.670
And so we are
actually left with 0.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.410
So after doing all of that
work, this whole thing

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.710
evaluates to 0,
which was actually

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.570
kind of a neat simplification.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.010
So this whole thing
right over here

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:43.806
evaluated, very conveniently,
evaluated to be equal to 0.
