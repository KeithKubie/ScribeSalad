The answer is it should be a Web Corpus and a keyword. We want to use the Web

00:00:04.944 --> 00:00:08.784
Corpus to encapsulate both the index and the ranking information, so we

00:00:08.784 --> 00:00:12.772
shouldn't need to pass both of those in. We still need a keyword. We don't want

00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:15.943
the keyword to be part of the Web Corpus object, since the Web Corpus is the

00:00:15.943 --> 00:00:19.153
result on the crawl, doesn't know about the keyword we're searching for.
