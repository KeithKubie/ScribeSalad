00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.360
If I were to walk up to you on
the street and say you, please

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.450
tell me what-- so I didn't want
to write that thick --please

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.710
tell me what sine
of pi over 4 is.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.950
And, obviously, we're assuming
we're dealing in radians.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.510
You either have that memorized
or you would draw the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.920
unit circle right there.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.360
That's not the best
looking unit circle,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.080
but you get the idea.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.960
You'd go to pi over 4
radians, which is the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.760
same thing as 45 degrees.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.840
You would draw that
unit radius out.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.130
And the sine is defined
as a y-coordinate

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.250
on the unit circle.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.910
So you would just want to
know this value right here.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.210
And you would
immediately say OK.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.630
This is a 45 degrees.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.530
Let me draw the triangle
a little bit larger.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.530
The triangle looks like this.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.210
This is 45.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.900
That's 45.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.790
This is 90.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.330
And you can solve a
45 45 90 triangle.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.040
The hypotenuse is 1.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.960
This is x.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.640
This is x.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.930
They're going to be
the same values.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.920
This is an isosceles
triangle, right?

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.960
Their base angles are the same.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.690
So you say, look. x squared
plus x squared is equal to 1

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.960
squared, which is just 1.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.200
2x squared is equal to 1.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.440
x squared is equal to 1/2.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.840
x is equal to the square root
of 1/2, which is one over

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.780
the square root of 2.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.960
I can put that in rational form
by multiplying that by the

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.330
square root of 2 over 2.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.950
And I get x is equal to the
square root of 2 over 2.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.770
So the height here is
square root of 2 over 2.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.400
And if you wanted to know
this distance too, it would

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.710
also be the same thing.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.090
But we just cared
about the height.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.600
Because the sine value,
the sine of this, is just

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.920
this height right here.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.180
The y-coordinate.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.960
And we got that as the
square root of 2 over 2.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.890
This is all review.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.210
We learned this in the
unit circle video.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.290
But what if someone else--
Let's say on another day, I

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.850
come up to you and I say you,
please tell me what the

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.820
arcsine of the square
root of 2 over 2 is.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.190
What is the arcsine?

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.970
And you're stumped.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.180
You're like I know what the
sine of an angle is, but this

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.480
is some new trigonometric
function that Sal has devised.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.770
And all you have to realize,
when they have this word arc in

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.455
front of it-- This is also
sometimes referred to

00:02:29.455 --> 00:02:30.810
as the inverse sine.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.960
This could have just as easily
been written as: what is

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.420
the inverse sine of the
square root of 2 over 2?

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.900
All this is asking is what
angle would I have to take the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.310
sine of in order to get the
value square root of 2 over 2.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.000
This is also asking what angle
would I have to take the sine

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.610
of in order to get square
root of 2 over 2.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.220
I could rewrite either of
these statements as saying

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.260
square-- Let me do it.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.890
I could rewrite either of these
statements as saying sine

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.200
of what is equal to the
square root of 2 over 2.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.910
And this, I think, is a
much easier question

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.820
for you to answer.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.400
Sine of what is square
root of 2 over 2?

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.950
Well I just figured out that
the sine of pi over 4 is

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.080
square root of 2 over 2.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.560
So, in this case, I know that
the sine of pi over 4 is equal

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.630
to square root of 2 over 2.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.760
So my question mark is
equal to pi over 4.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.400
Or, I could have rewritten
this as, the arcsine-- sorry

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:51.940
--arcsine of the square root of
2 over 2 is equal to pi over 4.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.120
Now you might say so, just as
review, I'm giving you a value

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.630
and I'm saying give me an angle
that gives me, when I take the

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.490
sine of that angle that
gives me that value.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.030
But you're like hey Sal.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.950
Look.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.120
Let me go over here.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.960
You're like, look
pi over 2 worked.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.540
45 degrees worked.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.560
But I could just keep adding
360 degrees or I could

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.130
keep just adding 2 pi.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.330
And all of those would work
because those would all get

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.870
me to that same point of
the unit circle, right?

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.960
And you'd be correct.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.350
And so all of those values, you
would think, would be valid

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.290
answers for this, right?

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.700
Because if you take the sine of
any of those angles-- You could

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.720
just keep adding 360 degrees.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.740
If you take the sine of any
of them, you would get

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.540
square root of 2 over 2.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.370
And that's a problem.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.070
You can't have a function where
if I take the function-- I

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.340
can't have a function, f
of x, where it maps to

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.230
multiple values, right?

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.490
Where it maps to pi over 4, or
it maps to pi over 4 plus 2

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.280
pi or pi over 4 plus 4 pi.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.320
So in order for this to be a
valid function-- In order for

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.450
the inverse sine function to
be valid, I have to

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.340
restrict its range.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.660
And the way that-- We'll
just restrict its range to

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.710
the most natural place.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.990
So let's restrict its range.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.910
Actually, just as a
side note, what's its

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.120
domain restricted to?

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.160
So if I'm taking the
arcsine of something.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.320
So if I'm taking the arcsine of
x, and I'm saying that that is

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.900
equal to theta, what's the
domain restricted to?

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.502
What are the valid values of x?

00:05:24.502 --> 00:05:27.310
x could be equal to what?

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.770
Well if I take the sine of
any angle, I can only get

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.840
values between 1 and
negative 1, right?

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.680
So x is going to be greater
than or equal to negative 1 and

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.310
then less than or equal to 1.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.570
That's the domain.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.930
Now, in order to make this
a valid function, I have

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.180
to restrict the range.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.360
The possible values.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.790
I have to restrict the range.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.700
Now for arcsine, the convention
is to restrict it to the

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.630
first and fourth quadrants.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.210
To restrict the possible angles
to this area right here

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.750
along the unit circle.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.840
So theta is restricted to being
less than or equal to pi over

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.180
2 and then greater than or
equal to minus pi over 2.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.150
So given that, we now
understand what arcsine is.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.110
Let's do another problem.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.280
Clear out some space here.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.430
Let me do another arcsine.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:30.450
So let's say I were to ask you
what the arcsine of minus the

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.390
square root of 3 over 2 is.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.690
Now you might have
that memorized.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.100
And say, I immediately know
that sine of x, or sine

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.420
of theta is square
root of 3 over 2.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.220
And you'd be done.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.730
But I don't have
that memorized.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.990
So let me just draw
my unit circle.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.480
And when I'm dealing with
arcsine, I just have to

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.550
draw the first and fourth
quadrants of my unit circle.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.810
That's the y-axis.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.890
That's my x-axis.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.690
x and y.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.300
And where am I?

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.360
If the sine of something is
minus square root of 3 over 2,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.760
that means the y-coordinate on
the unit circle is minus

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.320
square root of 3 over 2.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.020
So it means we're
right about there.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.800
So this is minus the
square root of 3 over 2.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.440
This is where we are.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.160
Now what angle gives me that?

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.090
Let's think about
it a little bit.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:31.600
My y-coordinate is minus
square root of 3 over 2.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.460
This is the angle.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.110
It's going to be a negative
angle because we're going

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.130
below the x-axis in the
clockwise direction.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:44.240
And to figure out-- Let me just
draw a little triangle here.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.520
Let me pick a better
color than that.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.040
That's a triangle.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.740
Let me do it in
this blue color.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.680
So let me zoom up
that triangle.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.230
Like that.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.950
This is theta.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:58.530
That's theta.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.660
And what's this
length right here?

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.120
Well that's the same as
the y-height, I guess

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.890
we could call it.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.020
Which is square
root of 3 over 2.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.560
It's a minus because
we're going down.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.850
But let's just figure
out this angle.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.960
And we know it's a
negative angle.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.540
So when you see a square root
of 3 over 2, hopefully you

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.870
recognize this is a
30 60 90 triangle.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:17.980
The square root of 3 over 2.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.950
This side is 1/2.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.250
And then, of course,
this side is 1.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.880
Because this is a unit circle.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.630
So its radius is 1.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.415
So in a 30 60 90 triangle, the
side opposite to the square

00:08:27.415 --> 00:08:30.500
root of 3 over 2 is 60 degrees.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.610
This side over here
is 30 degrees.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.140
So we know that our theta
is-- This is 60 degrees.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.100
That's its magnitude.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.325
But it's going downwards.

00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:39.970
So it's minus 60 degrees.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.180
So theta is equal to
minus 60 degrees.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.630
But if we're dealing
in radians, that's

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:45.210
not good enough.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:52.350
So we can multiply that times
100-- sorry --pi radians

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.540
for every 180 degrees.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.070
Degrees cancel out.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.500
And we're left with
theta is equal to minus

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:04.090
pi over 3 radians.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:10.630
And so we can say-- We can now
make the statements that the

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:16.780
arcsine of minus square root
of 3 over 2 is equal to

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.980
minus pi over 3 radians.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.680
Or we could say the inverse
sign of minus square root

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:30.840
of 3 over 2 is equal to
minus pi over 3 radians.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.290
And to confirm this, let's
just-- Let me get a

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.310
little calculator out.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.200
I put this in radian
mode already.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.370
You can just check that.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.060
Per second mode.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.040
I'm in radian mode.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.490
So I know I'm going to get,
hopefully, the right answer.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.840
And I want to figure
out the inverse sign.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.610
So the inverse sine-- the
second and the sine button

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:59.790
--of the minus square
root of 3 over 2.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:03.800
It equals minus 1.04.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:11.040
So it's telling me that this is
equal to minus 1.04 radians.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.970
So pi over 3 must
be equal to 1.04.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.030
Let's see if I can
confirm that.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:25.180
So if I were to write minus pi
divided by 3, what do I get?

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.670
I get the exact same value.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.710
So my calculator gave me the
exact same value, but it might

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.240
have not been that helpful
because my calculator doesn't

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.520
tell me that this is
minus pi over 3.
