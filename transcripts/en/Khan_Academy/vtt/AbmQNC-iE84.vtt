00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.730
Write in simplified
exponential form.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.810
And we have a product of
a bunch of things here.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.980
6 times 7 times 6 times 9 times
2 to the fourth times 2

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.140
times 6 squared times 9.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.390
So a good place to start is to
just group the things that are

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.360
of the same base.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.770
And then maybe we can combine
their exponents.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.720
And let's see if we can simplify
it from there.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.020
Let's just go in order
of the bases.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.220
Let's start with the 2's.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.210
So we have a 2 to
the fourth here.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.880
And then we have times 2.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.710
You could view that as times
2 to the first if you like.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.820
Let me write that there.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.860
So you have to 2 to the
fourth times 2.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.960
I'll just rewrite it as 2 to the
first. So we did our 2's.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.160
The next largest number,
or the next largest

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.450
base, are the 6's.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.290
We have a 6 right there.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.040
I'll write it as 6 to the first.
Times another 6 or

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.600
times another 6 to the
first right there.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.370
Then we have a 6 squared
over here.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.910
So times 6 squared.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.470
I'm really just rearranging
this product out here.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.360
Then the next number that we
have here, the next largest

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.190
one, we have a 7.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.390
We only have one 7 there.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.580
So I'll just write times 7.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.170
And then finally, we have
a couple of 9's.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.800
I'll write it as 9 to the one,
then we have another 9.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.040
Times 9 to the one, or
we could just write

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.080
that as 9 times 9.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.000
Now, let's merge the bases.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.400
Or let's merge the products
of these bases raised to

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.680
different exponents.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.550
You have 2 to the fourth power
times 2 to the first power.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.510
This is going to be the
same thing as 2 to

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.140
the 4 plus 1 power.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.790
Or 2 to the fifth power.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.460
Then you have your 6's.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.530
So 6 to the first times 6 to the
first times 6 squared is

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.960
the same thing as 6 to
that 1 plus 1 plus 2.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.370
Or 6 to the fourth power.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.590
Then we have that 7 there.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.840
Nothing really you can
do to simplify that.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.740
Times that 7.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.710
And then we have a 9 times
a 9, which is 9 squared.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.020
Or you can think about it as 9
to the first times 9 to the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.865
first, add the exponents,
9 squared.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.810
So depending on how you want to
do this problem, the people

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.780
who actually wrote this problem,
this is what they

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.610
wanted, they viewed this as
simplified exponential form.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.730
We've combined the same bases
raised to different powers.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.680
So you could stop here.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.180
But if you really want to get
it down to kind of the real

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.400
simplest form.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.500
What you could essentially do
is break everything down to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.840
their prime factors.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.840
And then have those raised
to exponents and then

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.550
merge them even more.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.260
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.020
So this 6 to the fourth here.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.950
Let me keep it the same color.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.150
So we have the 2 to the fifth,
let me just write that there.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.710
But the 6 to the fourth, I could
rewrite 6 as 2 times 3

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.920
to the fourth.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.710
6 to the fourth is the exact
same thing is that.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.570
Then we have the times 7.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.210
Then we have the 9 squared.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.420
But 9 we can rewrite
as 3 squared

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.070
and all of that squared.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.290
All did here is I rewrote the
6 as 2 times 3 and I rewrote

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.640
the 9 as 3 times 3
or as 3 squared.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.970
I want to keep the color
codes the same way.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.000
So we had the 2 to the fifth.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.220
Now, what's 2 times
3 to the fourth?

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.590
Well here's an exponent
property.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.430
If you take the product of two
things and it's to a power,

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.410
that's the same thing
as 2 to the fourth

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.890
times 3 to the fourth.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.990
And then you have this 7 here.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.480
So I essentially just
raised both of

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.550
these guys to the fourth.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.220
Because their product is being
raised to the fourth power.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.800
And then you have times 3
squared, but you have 3

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.620
squared and then that squared.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.670
So it's going to be 3 to
the 2 times 2 power.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.490
So times 3 to the fourth.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.570
So now we have more bases
we can merge.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.270
We have these 2's here.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.090
2 to the fifth times 2 to
the fourth, what's that?

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.620
Well that's 2 to the 5 plus 4.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.660
That's 2 to the ninth power.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.340
Then you have your
3's over here.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.990
Let me do that in green.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.180
You have 3 to the fourth and 3
to the fourth, what's that

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.050
going to be?

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.960
That's going to be times 3 to
the 4 plus fourth power, or 3

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.440
to the eighth power.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.010
And then finally, you have this
7 sitting over there.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.190
So if you really wanted to break
things down to their

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.270
prime factors and kind of have
the the least bases here, you

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.300
can view this is even a more
simplified exponential form

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.310
than what the question writers
originally wanted.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.170
So you could get down all the
way to 2 to the ninth times 3

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.350
to the eighth times 7, which
is the same thing is that,

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.270
which is the exact same
thing as that.
