definition of terrorism the word is only

definition of terrorism the word is only
ever applied when it comes to a brown

person or a person of the Muslim faith

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439
person or a person of the Muslim faith
 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.209
person or a person of the Muslim faith
and a person is only ever identified for

terrorist attack if they happen to be

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219
terrorist attack if they happen to be
 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.900
terrorist attack if they happen to be
Muslim and when we do that inevitably we

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910
Muslim and when we do that inevitably we
 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.150
Muslim and when we do that inevitably we
are linking terrorism with Islam and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160
are linking terrorism with Islam and
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.459
are linking terrorism with Islam and
Islam with terrorism and we make this

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469
Islam with terrorism and we make this
 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.619
Islam with terrorism and we make this
common assumption that all Muslims are

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629
common assumption that all Muslims are
 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.000
common assumption that all Muslims are
terrorists or the old terrorists are

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010
terrorists or the old terrorists are
 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.279
terrorists or the old terrorists are
Muslim and that of course is an

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289
Muslim and that of course is an
 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.830
Muslim and that of course is an
impossible generalization to make when

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
impossible generalization to make when
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.290
impossible generalization to make when
you put into perspective that there are

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300
you put into perspective that there are
 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.200
you put into perspective that there are
1.8 billion Muslims on the planet it is

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210
1.8 billion Muslims on the planet it is
 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.880
1.8 billion Muslims on the planet it is
impossible to say that they're all

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
impossible to say that they're all
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.160
impossible to say that they're all
terrorists and it's actually a very

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
terrorists and it's actually a very
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.920
terrorists and it's actually a very
dehumanizing thing to try to categorize

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
dehumanizing thing to try to categorize
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.020
dehumanizing thing to try to categorize
them in that way to put that into

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030
them in that way to put that into
 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.539
them in that way to put that into
context there are 2.2 billion Christians

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549
context there are 2.2 billion Christians
 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.490
context there are 2.2 billion Christians
in the world so you have 2.2 billion

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
in the world so you have 2.2 billion
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.010
in the world so you have 2.2 billion
Christians and 1.8 billion Muslims so

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020
Christians and 1.8 billion Muslims so
 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.410
Christians and 1.8 billion Muslims so
just as ridiculous it would be to make

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
just as ridiculous it would be to make
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.060
just as ridiculous it would be to make
one assumption or one generalization

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070
one assumption or one generalization
 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.010
one assumption or one generalization
about the entire Christian population

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020
about the entire Christian population
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.140
about the entire Christian population
that's just as ridiculous as it would be

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150
that's just as ridiculous as it would be
 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.670
that's just as ridiculous as it would be
to make that assumption about the entire

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680
to make that assumption about the entire
 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.730
to make that assumption about the entire
Muslim people and yet when you ask a

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740
Muslim people and yet when you ask a
 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.200
Muslim people and yet when you ask a
common American on the street what they

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
common American on the street what they
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.340
common American on the street what they
think of when they hear the word

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
think of when they hear the word
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.230

stereotypical person of Muslim faith and

and you know especially when you look at

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230
and you know especially when you look at
 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.610
and you know especially when you look at
the statistics that many times more

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620
the statistics that many times more
 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.340

terrorist attacks it really makes you
 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.150
terrorist attacks it really makes you
wonder where our attention is really

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160
wonder where our attention is really
 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.700
wonder where our attention is really
being placed right now and especially

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710
being placed right now and especially
 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.220
being placed right now and especially
because you know Donald Trump for

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230
because you know Donald Trump for
 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.800
because you know Donald Trump for
example had no problem saying that we

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810
example had no problem saying that we
 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.240
example had no problem saying that we
need to ban all Muslim immigration

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250
need to ban all Muslim immigration

because of terrorism because of like

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080
because of terrorism because of like
 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.560
because of terrorism because of like
this and that meanwhile if we use the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570
this and that meanwhile if we use the
 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.449
this and that meanwhile if we use the
same logic then we should be able to say

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459
same logic then we should be able to say
 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.650
same logic then we should be able to say
that we want to ban all white men from

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660
that we want to ban all white men from
 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.360
that we want to ban all white men from
the country because they make up the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370
the country because they make up the
 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.830
the country because they make up the
majority of mass shooters that are

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.150
of awareness of what that policy means
to us on a national level and I think

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160
to us on a national level and I think
 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.850
to us on a national level and I think
that that's kind of a reality that has

you know they have written on this
misunderstanding and this ignorant in

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890
misunderstanding and this ignorant in
 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.190
misunderstanding and this ignorant in
order to empower their own platforms and

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200
order to empower their own platforms and
 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.290
order to empower their own platforms and
those platforms have come on the backs

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300
those platforms have come on the backs
 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.970
those platforms have come on the backs
of people that are already marginalized

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980
of people that are already marginalized
 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.670
of people that are already marginalized
and that are already bearing the brunt

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680
and that are already bearing the brunt
 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.670
and that are already bearing the brunt
of all this hateful discrimination and

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680
of all this hateful discrimination and
 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.230
of all this hateful discrimination and
and stereotyping that's been taking

and stereotyping that's been taking
 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.470
and stereotyping that's been taking
place and I think that we have to put a

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480
place and I think that we have to put a
 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.420
place and I think that we have to put a
stop to it if we don't stand up and

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430
stop to it if we don't stand up and
 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.890
stop to it if we don't stand up and
recognize what's taking place right now

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900

then it's a slippery slope and it

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080
then it's a slippery slope and it
 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.440
then it's a slippery slope and it
honestly is very terrifying to imagine

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.450
honestly is very terrifying to imagine
 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.110

something that's being considered as a
 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.730
something that's being considered as a
real policy and that too means it's just

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740
real policy and that too means it's just
 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:56.240
