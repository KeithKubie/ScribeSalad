00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.930
We're on problem 154.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.250
They ask us, is x negative?

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.150
So the question is
x less than 0.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.840
Statement number 1 tells us--
let's see, they say x to the

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.630
third times 1 minus x squared
is less than 0.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.480
Now let's simplify it.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.030
Let's see, x to the third
minus x to the fifth

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.140
is less than 0.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.240
We could add x to the fifth to
both sides. x to the third is

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.820
less than x to the fifth.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.700
Let's divide both sides
by x squared.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.740
That won't change the inequality
since x squared is

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.980
definitely going
to be positive.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.860
Any integer squared, even if
it's negative, is a positive.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.390
So you divide both sides by x
squared, you get x is less

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.290
than x to the third.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.830
Now let's see, does this
answer that question?

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.185
Let's see what x's would
satisfy this condition.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.820
So we can already say that x
cannot be equal to 0, right?

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.760
Anything where this
would have been an

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.400
inequality doesn't work.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.160
So x can't be equal 0, it can't
be able to 1, because 1

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.010
is equal 1 to the third,
and it can't be

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.290
equal to negative 1.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.100
So we know that immediately.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.200
We know that for regular
positive numbers, for numbers

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.340
greater than 1, taking it to
the third power is always

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.000
going to be greater than
the number itself.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.170
If you took 2 to the third
power, that's greater than 2.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.520
3 to the third power
is greater than 3.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.620
1.5 to the third power
is greater than 1.5.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.200
So we know that this statement
right here implies that x is

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.070
greater than 1.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.490
Now let's see, is there
a situation

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.260
where x can be negative?

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.670
Well, let's see.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.202
First off, x is between
0 and 1.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.100
1/2 is not less than 1/8.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.480
So it doesn't work
between 0 and 1.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:04.000
But what if x were between
negative 1 and 0?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.400
Let's try an example.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.889
Negative 1/2 is less
than negative 1/8.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.940
It's more negative.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.700
Negative 1/2 is less than
negative 1/8, right?

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.060
You could try that with
any fraction.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.870
Because when you take it to the
third power, it becomes a

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.390
smaller fraction,
but it becomes a

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.220
smaller negative fraction.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.840
So x will be less than it,
because it's more negative.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.490
So this is true.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.780
If this is true, then x is
either greater than 1, or it's

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.400
between negative 1 and 0.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.760
Let's see, does it work if x
is less than negative 1.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.360
Negative 2, is negative 2
less than negative 8?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.550
Nope.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.850
Right.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.730
So these are the only ranges
where it works.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.830
This statement implies this.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.260
But this still isn't enough
information to tell us whether

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.870
x is less than 0.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.530
x could be greater than 1, which
is definitely greater

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.280
than 0, or x could
be less than 0.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.980
So we don't know yet just
from statement 1.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:12.440
Statement 2 tells us x squared
minus 1 is less than 0.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.660
So add 1 to both sides, that
tells us that x squared is

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.850
less than 1.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.020
So when could something squared
be less than 1?

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.150
Well, it's going to
have to be between

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.270
negative 1 and 1, right?

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.900
It's essentially going to have
be a positive or a negative

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.140
fraction less than 1.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.820
That's the only way that when
you square it, you get a

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.340
number less than 1.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.030
If it was greater than 1, you're
definitely going to get

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.600
a number greater than 1 and
it's going to be positive

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.390
either way.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.640
If it's 1, it's going to be 1,
and then 0 is in our range.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.570
So statement 2 tells us this,
but it includes both positive

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.700
and negative numbers.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.360
So it doesn't answer our
question whether x

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.530
is less than 0.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.120
But if we use both statements
combined, what is the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.970
intersection?

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.630
What is the overlap
of this and this?

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.550
Well, if x has to be between
negative 1 and 1 and it has to

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.620
be one of these, the only
one that it overlaps

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.800
with is this one.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.010
You cannot have x being greater
than 1 and x being in

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.050
this range.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.930
You can have x being in this
range and x being in this

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.460
range, since this is
a subset of this.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.470
So this is actually the
more restrictive.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.370
And so since we go to that, that
actually tells us that x

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.200
has to be negative.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.230
So both statements combined are
sufficient to answer this

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.690
question, but individually
they're not.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.330
The last question, 155.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.740
Marsha's bucket can hold
a maximum of how

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.970
many liters of water?

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.855
So we want to know the capacity
of her bucket.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.560
Statement number 1 says, the
bucket currently contains 9

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.660
liters of water.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.430
That's useless.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.750
We don't know how-- that
could be the bucket, 9

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.830
liters could be that.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.940
Or maybe 9 liters is
the full capacity.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.380
That tells us nothing about
what the capacity

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.660
of the bucket is.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.810
If I told you I had a bite of
the sandwich, that tells you

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.760
nothing as far as how large
of a sandwich I can eat.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.880
So statement 1 doesn't
seem that useful.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.090
Statement 2, if 3 liters of
water are added to the bucket

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.760
when it is 1/2 full of water.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.630
So 1/2 times the capacity,
right?

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.220
When it's 1/2 full of water,
you add 3 liters.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.910
So if 3 liters of water are
added to the bucket when it is

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:39.480
1/2 full of water, the amount
of water in the bucket will

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.730
increase by 1/3.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.210
To increase something by 1/3,
that is like multiplying it by

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.970
1 1/3 That's 1 1/3 times
the capacity.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.870
That's what they're saying.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.340
The amount of water in the
bucket will increase by 1.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.700
Sorry.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.270
You're going to have 1 1/3 times
what you started off

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.565
with, which was half
your capacity.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.770
That make sense?

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.110
We say we're starting with 1/2
of our capacity and we're

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.360
adding 3 liters.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.340
They're saying that that will
increase the amount

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.100
we have by 1 1/3.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.680
Let me write that.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:35.500
Let's say we start with x, and
we're adding 3 liters.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.150
They're saying that will equal
1 1/3 or 4/3 times x, right?

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.740
This shows that x is
increasing by 1/3.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.490
You could view this as
1 plus 1/3 times x.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.120
This is an increase of 1/3.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.210
They tell us that our starting
point is 1/2 of capacity.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.630
So that's where I get the 1/2
c-- that's our starting

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.270
point-- plus 3 is equal to 4/3
times the starting point, or

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.530
where we're adding water
to, 1/2 times c.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.550
We could easily solve
for c here.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.450
So you get a 2, this
cancels out.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:17.470
Then you get 1/2 c plus
3 is equal to 2/3 c.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.640
Let's see, we could subtract 1/2
c from both sides, and you

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.950
get 3 is equal to
2/3 minus 1/2 c.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.180
Then you can just do that
fraction, and you get c is

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.620
equal to 3 over-- well,
what is this?

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:41.230
1/2-- so if you do it over a 6,
4 minus 3, so this is 1/6.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.360
So this turns into 1/6.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.572
So c is equal to 18.

00:07:47.572 --> 00:07:48.190
Wait a minute.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.150
You didn't have to
do all that.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.970
You should have just realized
that as soon as you can write

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.540
this algebraic equation down,
it's a linear equation with

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.980
one unknown, and that one
unknown is what we're trying

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.060
to solve for, you have
enough information

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.220
to solve the problem.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.090
So statement 2, alone,
is sufficient

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.810
to solve this problem.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.580
We're all done with
data sufficiency.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.840
See you all in the
next section.
