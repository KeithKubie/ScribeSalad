TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:03.695 --> 00:00:06.180
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.070
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.130
Running TensorFlow across
hundreds of machines

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.310
can shorten the training
process for some models

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.960
from weeks to hours
and lets us experiment

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.700
with models of increasing
size and sophistication.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.100
This distributed
training support

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.100
has been one of the most
requested features ever

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.180
since we released TensorFlow
as an open source project.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.720
And now it's available
in the latest release.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.790
For more information and
to get started today,

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.720
head on over to the blog post.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.450
You're now able to configure
all Cloud Load Balancing flavors

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.830
through a unified interface.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.413
While the technologies [? and ?]
the power of the Google Cloud

00:00:37.413 --> 00:00:41.050
Platform are complex, the UI
for using the resources on GCP

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.870
should be simple and intuitive.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.660
This new UI aims to simplify
Cloud Load Balancing

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.850
configuration.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.310
For an overview of the new
UI, check out the post.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.580
Vulkan is a new 3D
rendering API which

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.720
we've helped to develop
as a member of Khronos.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.630
It's geared at providing
explicit low-overhead GPU

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.030
control to developers.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.210
Vulkan's reduction
of CPU overhead

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.050
allows some synthetic
benchmarks to see as much as 10

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.810
times the draw call
throughput on a single core

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.260
as compared to open GLES.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.960
Combine that with a
threading-friendly API design,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.440
which allows multiple cores
to be used in parallel

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.966
with high efficiency.

00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.340
And today we're pleased to
bring you a preview of Android

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.150
development tools for Vulkan.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.940
Jump to the post for
a list of features,

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.400
links to samples and guides, and
a video with a tornado of fish.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.530
If you've been wanting
easy-to-follow screencasts

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.550
on how to implement the mobile
ads SDK on Android and iOS,

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.400
you're in luck.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.400
There's a new video series
called the "Mobile Ads Garage."

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.340
Take a peek at the
first episode to learn

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.750
how to import the SDK
into your project.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.830
Today, the second
release in our series

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.960
of developer previews for
Android N is ready for you

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.450
to test against your apps.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.760
You've helped us find
and fix a bunch of bugs

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.410
in the first release, and we're
still on the hunt for more.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.010
Head over to the post for some
release notes and instructions

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.910
on how to get the update.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.870
OK, a fun thing at the end
here-- three graduate students

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.480
at San Francisco
State University

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.290
have created a new app for
Project Tango using the Unity

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.010
SDK.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.970
It's called Solar Simulator, and
it lets you take a virtual walk

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.950
through space to
understand the size

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.670
and scale of our solar system.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.569
Want to try it out?

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.110
Just head over to
the post for a link

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.860
to download the app on your
Project Tango developer kit,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.840
or follow the instructions
to create your own.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.090
Enjoy these updates.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.380
Maybe your friends will too.
