00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.010
So we've got the
equation x squared

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.975
plus y squared is equal to 1.

00:00:04.975 --> 00:00:07.120
I guess we could call
it a relationship.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.200
And if we were to graph
all of the points x and y

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.220
that satisfied
this relationship,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.884
we get a unit circle like this.

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:17.550
And what I'm curious
about in this video

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.170
is how we can figure out the
slope of the tangent line

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.260
at any point of
this unit circle.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.350
And what immediately might be
jumping out in your brain is,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.710
well a circle defined this
way, this isn't a function.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.890
It's not y explicitly
defined as a function of x.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.140
For any x value we actually
have two possible y's

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.800
that satisfy this
relationship right over here.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.480
So you might be tempted
to maybe split this up

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.450
into two separate
functions of x.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.530
You could say y is equal to
the positive square root of 1

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.970
minus x squared.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.550
And you could say y is equal to
the negative square root of 1

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.020
minus x squared.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.530
Take the derivatives of
each of these separately.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.317
And you would be able to find
the derivative for any x,

00:01:05.317 --> 00:01:07.400
or the derivative of the
slope of the tangent line

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.622
at any point.

00:01:08.622 --> 00:01:10.080
But what I want to
do in this video

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.970
is literally leverage
the chain rule

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.060
to take the
derivative implicitly.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.850
So that I don't have
to explicitly define y

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.434
is a function of x either way.

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:22.100
And the way we do
that is literally just

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.360
apply the derivative operator
to both sides of this equation.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.100
And then apply what we
know about the chain rule.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.970
Because we are not
explicitly defining y

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.790
as a function of x, and
explicitly getting y

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.130
is equal to f prime
of x, they call

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.450
this-- which is really just an
application of the chain rule--

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.185
we call it implicit
differentiation.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.440
And what I want you to keep
in the back of your mind

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.730
the entire time
is that it's just

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.440
an application of
the chain rule.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.710
So let's apply the derivative
operator to both sides of this.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.210
So it's the derivative
with respect

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:08.220
to x of x squared plus y
squared, on the left hand

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.270
side of our equation.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.020
And then that's going to
be equal to the derivative

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.790
with respect to x on
the right hand side.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.810
I'm just doing the
same exact thing

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.190
to both sides of this equation.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.660
Now if I take the derivative
of the sum of two terms,

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.090
that's the same thing as taking
the sum of the derivative.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.631
So this is going to
be the same thing

00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:33.860
as the derivative with
respect to x of x squared,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.180
plus the derivative with
respect to x of y squared.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.329
I'm writing all my
orange stuff first.

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:40.870
So let's see.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.914
This is going to be x squared,
this is going to be y squared.

00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:46.080
And then this is going to
be equal to the derivative

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.660
with respect to x of a constant.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.650
This isn't changing
with respect to x.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.530
So we just get 0.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.260
Now this first term
right over here,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.720
we have done many, many,
many, many, many, many times.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.674
The derivative with
respect to x of x squared

00:02:58.674 --> 00:02:59.840
is just the power rule here.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.030
It's going to be 2 times
x to the first power.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.930
We could just say 2x.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.690
Now what's interesting is what
we're doing right over here.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.900
The derivative with
respect to x of y squared.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.209
And the realization here is
to just apply the chain rule.

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.000
If we're taking the
derivative with respect

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.410
to x of this
something, we just have

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.930
to take the derivative--
let me make it clear--

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.690
we're just going to take the
derivative of our something.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.380
The derivative of y squared--
that's what we're taking,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.270
you can kind of view that as
a function-- with respect to y

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.760
and then multiply that
times the derivative of y

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.600
with respect to x.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.170
We're assuming that y does
change with respect to x. y

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.020
is not some type of
a constant that we're

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.260
writing just an abstract terms.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.530
So we're taking the
derivative of this whole thing

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.530
with respect to y.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.780
Once again, just the chain rule.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.210
And then we're taking
the derivative of y

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.479
with respect to x.

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:06.770
It might be a little bit
clearer if you kind of thought

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:13.560
of it as the derivative
with respect to x of y,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.590
as a function of x.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.647
This might be, or y is
a function of x squared,

00:04:21.647 --> 00:04:24.230
which is essentially another way
of writing what we have here.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.820
This might be a
little bit clearer

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.640
in terms of the chain rule.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.840
The derivative of
y is a function

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.000
of x squared with
respect to y of x.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.140
So the derivative of
something squared with respect

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.740
to that something, times the
derivative of that something,

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.030
with respect to x.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.580
This is just the chain rule.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.770
I want to say it
over and over again.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.860
This is just the chain rule.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.690
So let's do that.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.710
What do we get on the
right hand side over here?

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.420
And I'll write it
over here as well.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.860
This would be equal to the
derivative of y squared

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:03.030
with respect to y, is just
going to be 2 times y.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.690
2 times y, just an
application of the chain rule.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.550
And the derivative of
y with respect to x?

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.955
Well, we don't
know what that is.

00:05:08.955 --> 00:05:11.330
So we're just going to leave
that as times the derivative

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.974
of y with respect to x.

00:05:14.974 --> 00:05:16.640
So let's just write
this down over here.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:25.510
So we have is 2x plus the
derivative of something

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.230
squared, with respect to
that something, is 2 times

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.160
the something.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.310
In this case, the something
is y, so 2 times y.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.410
And then times the derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.030
And this is all going
to be equal to 0.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.720
Now that was interesting.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.490
Now we have an equation
that has the derivative

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.567
of a y with respect to x in it.

00:05:49.567 --> 00:05:51.650
And this is what we
essentially want to solve for.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.180
This is the slope of the
tangent line at any point.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.370
So all we have to do
at this point is solve

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.720
for the derivative of
y with respect to x.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.360
Solve this equation.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.310
So let's do that.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.900
And actually just so we
can do this whole thing

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.860
on the same page so we can see
where we started, let me copy

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.070
and paste this up here.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.730
This is where we left off.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.620
And let's continue there.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.540
So let's say let's subtract
2x from both sides.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.220
So we're left with 2y
times the derivative of y,

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.920
with respect to x, is equal
to-- we're subtracting 2x

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.021
from both sides-- so it's
equal to negative 2x.

00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:32.270
And if we really want to
solve for the derivative of y

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.050
with respect to x, we can
just divide both sides by 2y.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.840
And we're left with
the derivative of y

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.930
with respect to x.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.340
Let's scroll down a little bit.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.540
The derivative of
y with respect to x

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.930
is equal to, well
the 2s cancel out.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:59.070
We we're left with
negative x over y.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.410
So this is interesting.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.980
We didn't have to us
explicitly define y

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.550
as a function of x here.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.710
But we got our derivative
in terms of an x and a y.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.740
Not just only in terms of an x.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.190
But what does this mean?

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.660
Well, if we wanted
to find, let's

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.980
say we wanted to find the
derivative at this point

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.172
right over here.

00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:22.130
Which, if you're familiar
with the unit circle,

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.950
so if this was a
45 degree angle,

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.610
this would be the square
root of 2 over 2 comma

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.090
the square root of 2 over 2.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.830
What is the slope of
the tangent line there?

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.830
Well, we figured it out.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.480
It's going to be
negative x over y.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:46.985
So the slope of the
tangent line here

00:07:46.985 --> 00:07:49.050
is going to be
equal to negative x.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.930
So negative square root
of 2 over 2 over y.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.990
Over square root of 2 over 2,
which is equal to negative 1.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.580
And that looks just about right.
