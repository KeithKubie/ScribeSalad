00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay everybody. We are gonna talk about the final exam.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is basically building on everything you've learned in this class.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's just another cohesive project, and what I'm going to ask you to do is build a wiki.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
For those of you who don't know what a wiki is, I will give you a demo.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It should look something like this. Here's the front page of a wiki.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
A wiki is just a website where any page can be edited.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For example, if I were to click edit on this page,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you see the HTML of this page and I can add some text.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Let's add a blank line. So I just added some text in this text box and I click save.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Then we save the page and then it has this text in here.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, one of the things that's cool about a wiki or at least in this one that we want you to build is

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
you can go to any URL or in this case /newpage, which doesn't exist yet.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If the URL does not exist, it'll redirect you to another URL.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
In my case, I'm using /_edit and then the page name where you can edit some content in here.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And if you were to click save, it will take you to that URL.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In my case /newpage with the content and of course you can edit this content.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's add a link to the front page.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We just use the anchor tag with an href to slash, which is the front page.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And if we click save, we can see that it renders that HTML I typed as a link.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
If I were to click on this link, it'll take me to the front page, which is a slash.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
W'll go through the specific requirements in the instructor comments, but the important thing--

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
the first thing--is if you type in a URL that doesn't exist, you go to an edit page.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If you type in a URL that does exist, it renders the content of that page,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and you can edit the content of that page if you want.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Now, I've been logged in this whole time. You should have user accounts integrated in this.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
If I were to click logout here, it keeps me on the same page.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
What this did is that it did just like we did in Unit 4.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It cleared my user clear key and just redirected me to the page that I came from.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I can view any page logged out, I can view the front page as well,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
but I can't edit any pages. See, the edit link is gone.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Now, we can't grade how things look very well, so we're not going to bother doing that,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
but we will try to submit an edit form while being logged out and that should fail.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Now, I will log back in. Now notice it's the same signup form we've been using all along.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Actually, in the version I'll put online, I'll probably clean this up a little bit before I do that,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
because it's been bugging me in the code, but this is actually

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
the exact same code I've been using the whole time.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I'll log in as my user and you can see now I have a new edit link.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
That's the gist of the main wiki--of course, instead of clicking login,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I could also click signup to create a new user.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
This is the same form we've been using for this entire class with the errors and whatnot.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
If I were to try to create a user that already exists, I give out that error.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
That's why I'm going to sign a different user spez2, click submit, and I'm logged on as spez2.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
That is the main task that I'm going to ask you to do. Log in. Log out. You've already done that.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Editing a page. It's basically a simple form submission and some fancy redirecting in there.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Again, in the instructor comments we'll include more specifically how to do that.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
When you have that working, submit the URL here.
