00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
What's up guys! It's that time of year where I'm starting to get the itch to get back into metal working again.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.520
Now, I went on Amazon to order a new clay graphite crucible,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.400
but apparently I ordered the wrong one because this thing is absolutely massive and way to big for my mini metal foundry.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.240
So i thought today might be a good opportunity to try making a larger metal foundry with a large metal pail

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.280
and some proper refractory materials so it lasts a bit longer.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.160
Now you could get a big bag of refractory cement and mix it up and cast it the same way we did with our plaster and sand mix,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.260
but today i wanted to try using kaowool

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.740
This stuff is a very flexible, ceramic mat, and although it looks really flimsy, really fragile, and looks like it'll go up in flames

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.500
it is extremely temperature resistant.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.820
In fact, it is so well insulated that if i fire up one of my blowtorches and shoot it straight at it,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.460
I can hold the other side without feeling any of the heat penetrate into it.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.140
So here's the basic idea for today, we're going to take this metal bucket, we're going to line it with kale wool

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.060
drill a couple of holes so our propane torches can fit down inside it,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.120
and then line the top of the pale with insulation so it can sit on top as a cover

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.740
the goal of today's experiment is speed, convenience, and a brand new metal foundry that can handle

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.120
extreme temperatures and thermal shock. Let's get busy.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.540
Now i should be wearing a mask for this. But I'm going to cut very slowly and very carefully and take a risk.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:24.540
Now when dealing with Kaowool there are a couple of things you do need to know. This stuff is extremely fibrous. When you start cutting it'll put a kaowool dust in the air that is very very bad for your lungs.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.160
You can see i used a pair of scissors to cut the kaowool  in a circle about 2 inches in diameter wider than the lid itself

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.980
the thinking hear is that it will give us a little more room to cram it down into the lid so it holds in place a little bit better

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.980
will see if that is really the case

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.980
humm it actually looks like that is gonna to work

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.300
ha ha hu

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.180
just gunna pad that down a little bit more press it into place

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.520
and i think we may be in business

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.480
there we go got the lid all pressed in to place

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.800
so lits move on to lining the bucket next

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.460
so here's what we've managed to do so far

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.460
we have lined the lid with kaowool

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.160
we've lined the bottom and the sides of our steel bucket

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.180
and we've cut off some more refractory material and shoved it down the bottom to act as the base for our crusabull

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.420
at this point all that is left to do is drill some holes

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.680
so lits drill some holes

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.100
there we go

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.540
exciting new guys as our foundry is ready for operation

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.200
we've got two holes in the sides that our propane torches can fit into

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.220
you can see i've made the little blocks hear with a grove in the middle

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.120
that is designed to hold the propane torches off the ground and in position

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.780
if you look down in side  the foundry you can see the two torches are at opposite angles

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.000
and it is designed that way so when we lit this thing up it will create a swirling hurricane of fire that will git this thing roaring hot

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.680
at this point we are pretty much ready to start melting down some mettles

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.420
but theres one thing we need to two do first and that is to temper our clay graphite crucible

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.520
So lets recap some of the things that we learned here today.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.600
We found that you can take any steel container, line it with Kaowool

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.160
and instantly make a high temperature backyard foundry.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.120
We also discovered this stuff is easy to cut and extremely  lightweight.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.580
This entire contraption weighs less that 10 pounds.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.480
We also learned that Kale wool is toxic if you breathe it in

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.900
so you do want to be wearing a dust mask if you ever try cutting it.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.100
And its extremely itchy if it  makes contact with your skin, so its a good idea to wear long sleeves.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.100
That's pretty much it for this project guys and i'm very excited to see how well this thing preforms in future metal casting experiments.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.800
and i'm very excited to see how well this thing preforms in future metal casting experiments.
