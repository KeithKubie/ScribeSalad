34
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,720

35
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,171

36
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:16,800
We might have a special guest on this
podcast as special guests that I'm married

37
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:20,200
to, that I love to death. Who's the
best thing that ever happened? Me?

38
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:21,630
But she's still,
you know,

39
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,710
Piss me off today and I've been doing
such a good job not having arguments with

40
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,580
her. And I kind of shook it off and then
she said something else to me in the

41
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:33,950
kitchen. And, uh, I add
the, you know, you know,

42
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,030
there are moments where you just
have to be like, hey, you know,

43
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,970
you can't talk to me like
that. All right, I'm over here.

44
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,020
I'm being a swell guy and, and
you know, so you should be,

45
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:46,500
be in a sweetheart and I'm just
not, I'm not feeling that, you know,

46
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,010
feeling like I'm being like a swell
guy and someone else's not being a

47
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:56,760
sweetheart then, then I become a
jerk off. Oh look who just came in.

48
00:02:56,761 --> 00:03:00,910
The person I was talking about,
I'm doing the math here,

49
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,150
the lovely Nia, everybody, the greatest
thing that ever happened to me though.

50
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,980
Yeah. Although if you behave the
way you did this morning every time,

51
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:13,780
you'd be one of the worst things
that ever happened to me. Oh,

52
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:18,520
doesn't that sound sincere everybody?
I apologize.

53
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,760
All right. Are you going to sit
down on the couch? Yes. So anyways,

54
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,630
um, I'm sitting there, you know,

55
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,800
mine in my own business and,
uh,

56
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,500
am I plugged in? Here you go.
You sit down. You sat down. Um,

57
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,610
so nia, hi. How are you? This is
going to be a little therapy session.

58
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,030
No, no it isn't. It isn't, but
you know, you know what I mean?

59
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,670
I get I lovely daughter up. I
guess you said to me, to my face.

60
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,100
I got these things a little too
loud. Let me turn this down here. Um,

61
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,770
you said to my evidently fee,
she said that you go, you know,

62
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,820
I come upstairs, right? I
worked out. You had a wonderful,

63
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,470
I work out where I put all this shit. Hey,

64
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:18,340
quit breathing into the mic
there. Breathing. Um, yeah,

65
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,180
I put all somebody's gonna fucking put
that clip on a loop and jerk off to it.

66
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,260
That's how creepy the Internet is
and have fun. Have Fun with that.

67
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,730
Anyways, um, I put all this shit
from the kid Halloween party,

68
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,490
broke that all down,
put it in the back of my truck.

69
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,230
I noticed that it wasn't your, yeah, get
all of that. I went to the gym. Right.

70
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,070
Yeah. Being a hell of a
guy. I go upstairs. Right.

71
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,350
All adorable qd face doesn't
want to get up. Yup. Yup.

72
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:50,860
She likes to sleep like somebody.
I know. I think that's so adorable.

73
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,070
We got this thing now we come and
sometimes now when she doesn't,

74
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,480
when you take the blanket off her and
she has this little mischievous grin,

75
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,280
she pulls the blanket back
over. Yeah. She wasn't ready.

76
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:03,160
She just was staying lying down and she
wanted me to get the blanket on her.

77
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:06,550
I was like, come on, it's time to get up.
And she was just smiling at me like, nope,

78
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,920
not feeling it. Yeah, it was cute.

79
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,360
I just want to stay here for another
couple of 20 minutes. So anyway,

80
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,460
so you leave blanket.
It's a little chilly.

81
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,330
That was probably your vibe today. Oh. Um,

82
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,200
so right. I get her out of bed. You leave.

83
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,880
And evidently at some point you said to
me, hey bill, put her in this outfit.

84
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,780
Hey Bill, put her in this outfit.
And she said to me, here's her,

85
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,190
here's her outfit for the day.

86
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:36,820
How many times did you say is
once you told me in the kitchen,

87
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:38,080
you said you said it twice.

88
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,980
I sent it to you said I said to you
twice and you said it to my what? No,

89
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:46,150
I said it to your face. To my face. That's
way you said it. You were like that cop.

90
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,620
You like to copy reservoir dogs,
buddy.

91
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,450
I am going to shoot you in the face.
You don't put that outfit on our daughter.

92
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,540
So I didn't hear and I saw that
brewed sweatshirt. I put her in that,

93
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,160
you know via Kaitlin. Can you
make more noise? I'm sorry. Sorry.

94
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,660
Sorry.
What are you doing?

95
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,300
I was trying to take
the tag off this Blake.

96
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,260
Okay, I'm done. I'm done. I'm here.
I'm present and paying attention.

97
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:17,630
I don't understand why your
Mike is so frigging loud.

98
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,680
It's like literally you just moving your
hand. It's making it do all this stuff.

99
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,640
All right.
Anyways.

100
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,373
MMM,

101
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,300
yeah. So anyways, so then you're sitting
there, right? Shit, a poopy diaper.

102
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,200
Handled all of that crap, literally.
Right? And then you come in, you're like,

103
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,260
oh wait. Yeah, yeah.

104
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,630
[inaudible] you doing? I'm just
like, oh, I'm sorry. She goes, yeah,

105
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,980
why would you do that? I go, well,

106
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:48,090
she can go to wherever the whatever
event she's going to in this, right?

107
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:48,960
You're like,
yeah,

108
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:52,800
but you know it's not going to be
is breathable is what I put out.

109
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,710
So then you leave. So I was
like, all right. By the way,

110
00:06:55,711 --> 00:07:00,711
she's standing there adorable eating the
homemade pumpkin bread than I made last

111
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,623
night.

112
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,330
I'm a sweet guy. I'm a
made guy. I'm a swell guy.

113
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,360
Right. So then you leave. And
so what do I own? This points,

114
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,570
if you guys can recognize where that quote
is from, I'll come on. That's it. Easy.

115
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,240
Yeah.

116
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,110
I'm a guy.

117
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,770
Just pull it a little away from your
mouth. Yeah, maybe like right here.

118
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,020
Hap split the difference now. Little
more closer. How about this? Here you go.

119
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:30,370
Will you keep adjusting the level that
you're talking? That's fine. Anyways,

120
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,750
so then I change.

121
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,760
I change her into the outfit that you
said and you come walking in like nothing

122
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:40,930
happened. So I jokingly
say, Hey dad, thanks for Ra.

123
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,360
Putting her in the earth on the
other outfit. And then you just like,

124
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,700
why do I have to say thanks? I told you
to put her, put her in that outfit twice

125
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,660
face and then you walked out.
Yes.

126
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,730
Individually in defense.

127
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,870
Shout out to uh, um, what's,
what is it? Oh my God. Fat Cells.

128
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:05,330
Fat cells are transforming fat
Sal's and two Mcdowell's yeah.

129
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,870
From coming into him.
Sorry,

130
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:10,810
I just accidentally hit
that fricking button there.

131
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,200
Reach for reaching for my smoothie.
Where the hell were we? Oh, fat cells.

132
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,470
Fat Sal's turned it into what?
A Mcdowell's.

133
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,080
And then they also had like
on the side of the building,

134
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:22,690
they had a big printout and as
an employee of the month, uh,

135
00:08:22,691 --> 00:08:26,710
Keem and as a picture of, you know,
Eddie Murphy from the movie and,

136
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:32,440
and as Jerry Ferrara. That's right.
That's right. Um, our lovely Powell,

137
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:36,300
Jerry Ferrara. Why did you have
to throw that in Hollywood? Huh?

138
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,590
You can't just say it's owned by him.
Your,

139
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,510
you always got to do it anyways because
you want to say something like say I

140
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,880
have my nice about the person so then I
don't know. Yeah, so then you just like,

141
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:49,670
yeah, I told you that twice,
right? I never knew this.

142
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,350
I didn't say it like that to your face.

143
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,790
That's how you just sat in the kitchen
to your face. So I know yell anymore.

144
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,780
That's my thing. I kissed. Keep
saying that Baja. Ha Ha no,

145
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:05,340
until you're a fucking jerk. They
had something. I mean it is, it is.

146
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,270
There's a reason human beings are able
to yell because God knew that some of

147
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:10,680
them that he made were jerks.

148
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,230
So anyways, then I, I walk,

149
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,640
I'm the king of Mulder and now

150
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,620
I'll put the outfit on and you get a
bucket tanker area and I fucking go

151
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:25,620
downstairs and I'm making a smoothie.
All right.

152
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,180
And the lea and the thing is not supposed
to turn on the food processors not

153
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:33,660
supposed to turn on unless you have
the whole thing close and it turned on

154
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,020
anyways and stuff is going all over the
place and then you come over you like,

155
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,470
it's like all over my shirt.

156
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,990
So I give you the look you deserved. I
thought it was like leaking from the top.

157
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:48,690
I didn't think he realized that it
was coming. No, not from the top.

158
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:51,330
From the bottom side.
And I don't know.

159
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,640
I didn't think that you realize that
most of that look was because of your,

160
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,930
your thing upstairs in the face.
Right.

161
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,330
So then we're downstairs and
I was just like, hey, you
know, not for nothing. Yeah.

162
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,600
I didn't appreciate you could've
said thank you and you like,

163
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:11,370
why do I have to say thank you bill?
I told you two times to your face.

164
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:15,760
That's what you said. And I was just
like, yeah. And then that's when,

165
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,380
that's when I snapped.
I still was saying effin in GED,

166
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,210
not using the actual words. Right, right,
right. I was just like, you're not. Yeah.

167
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:25,320
You're not going to talk to me like that.

168
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,160
I'm not going to be a sweetheart and then
be taught to like a jerk because then

169
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,810
I become a jerk off.

170
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:35,310
I'd become a typical
Staten island jerk off.

171
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,640
I can't believe we're still quoting
that show. So many. I love that.

172
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,630
I love that for people never saw that
we watch some reality show and there was

173
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:46,800
this woman from Staten Island shoe
life. I'm a Staten island girl. Okay.

174
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,880
Like the MTV show. True Life.
I'm a blank. This is true life.

175
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,990
She went into New York,
the city into the city.

176
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:00,210
She went to a club, she was dancing with
a guy. She had a long island ice tea.

177
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,510
She's dancing with this guy
and as he's dancing with her,

178
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:07,770
he's like sorta grabbing his girl. Her
girlfriend too. Yeah. And she's like,

179
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,790
are you like, you like grabbing all my
girlfriend? Like why you dance with me?

180
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,860
And the guy's like,
what were the Dayton?

181
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,710
And then they just cut to her
outside of the club and she goes,

182
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:21,711
that was your typical
Staten island jerk off.

183
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,630
No, I thought, he says, well, we're
not married or something like that.

184
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,900
What do we married? Something like
that. Something to that effect.

185
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,720
[inaudible] anyways, he was going for
the threesome and he had just met her.

186
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,030
Got To respect that there's no
loyalty in the club. Oh Shit.

187
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,730
I think that, I think that's got to be,
I think that's got to be on a tee shirt.

188
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,950
But you gotta say you gotta Say
da in Duck Club? No, can't say t.

189
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,650
H. E. T. H. E. Then you think
maybe it's a white club.

190
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,120
Like what are you talking about? The
White House. I know, but like Senate,

191
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,090
so over Donald, when people write
down whatever on tee shirts,

192
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:08,890
it's just like coordinates the finger
on the pulse. Social media, Marnie.

193
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,820
Oh, it is. What are the top three emojis?

194
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,420
A,
the top of the emojis or the face?

195
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,590
The one where the eyes are
closed. The mouth. It's kind
of like, ah, like, oh my God,

196
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:27,490
I can't believe this is happening phase.
These are my top three. I love that one.

197
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,700
I also love the finger on the Chin One
m one and then I also liked the one

198
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,080
eyebrow raised. Awesome.
Those are my faves.

199
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,850
You want to hear mine
and the crying laughing.

200
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:43,600
Of course you want to hit my what are
you already have one? What? The thumbs up

201
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,660
that covers everything. Yes. Yes,

202
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:53,950
I heard you point. Yeah.
Noncommittal. That sounds good.

203
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:56,440
I feel you didn't one of the biggest
fucking assholes I've ever met.

204
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,630
She started like,
you know that thumbs up

205
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,740
speaking of which? Yes, I
got a text message. So wait,

206
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:07,270
do you forgive me for yeah.

207
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:10,210
And I'll tell you though and I'll
tell you why I do apologize. It was,

208
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:13,930
it was over the top and I'll tell you why.
Cause I'm done.

209
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,430
I'm done being the angry guy. I don't
give a shit anymore. I'm not too much in.

210
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:22,420
My life has gone by. I'm on, I'm
on like fucking the 13th hole here.

211
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,480
What am I doing right? 50 years
old. That's a golf reference,

212
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:29,080
but I don't know what that 13 is. Only
at towards the end there's only 18 holes.

213
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,920
Oh, so you only have five
more holes lives 50 okay.

214
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,050
You live to 80 that's a great
run. Although I am drinking. No,

215
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,930
we're going to live longer that
remember I, I'm calling it right now.

216
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,160
You are going to be like the Don Rickles
of your generation and we're going to

217
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:46,660
like live in Las Vegas.

218
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:50,260
You and I were going to live in
Las Vegas for like however long.

219
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:51,550
They want to book you for like,
Oh,

220
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:54,820
we want to give him a year or
a year residency at this place.

221
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,450
We're going to live in Vegas. We're going
to live in one of those like obnoxious,

222
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:02,440
like Penthouse, five rooms suites
in Vegas. It sounds horrible.

223
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,090
Horrible. You're going to go
downstairs and be like, hey

224
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,320
[inaudible] her old just be
pulled out and the jokes.

225
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:15,430
Old people tell I'm going to be like
shopping at Caesar's and having lunch at

226
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:17,820
the same place every day. They're
going to know it's going to be great.

227
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:22,120
You kidding me? It's going to be so much
fun. You're going to shop at Caesars? Yep.

228
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,250
Yep. Cause I have all the stores you're
acting like there's just one store and

229
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,290
Caesar's.
It's like all the stores that you know,

230
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,800
every time we go to Vegas with there
for about 36 hours, you're like,

231
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:34,660
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
That's true.

232
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:38,110
But I feel like as like you're going to
live on the Strip in Las Vegas and this,

233
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,310
this is how you're going to go
out and your golden years. Well,

234
00:14:41,311 --> 00:14:45,040
I mean I'm 10 years younger than you,
so I'm not going anywhere for a while.

235
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,840
But God,
God willing,

236
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,860
knock on what I'm just saying that
that would just be fun. Like if you're,

237
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,730
and I'm 70 yeah.
Why wouldn't we just like live in Vegas?

238
00:14:55,731 --> 00:15:00,290
Why not? Yeah. I'm not going
out like that. New Ad. No
one saying you're going out,

239
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:04,460
but like the, there's a very
high can live in fucking Vegas.

240
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,030
Did he do Vegas? Yeah, he did Vegas
and then you get the fuck out of there.

241
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,864
You get another gig.

242
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,100
You think you're going to be on the
road like that when you're 80 years old?

243
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,470
Yeah. First of all, I ever retire. At some
point and just do like a nice local gig.

244
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:23,170
Yeah. It doesn't have to be in Las
Vegas. I'm a fucking redhead knee.

245
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,750
I'm not going to be with global warming
by the time I'm 80 is going to be 140

246
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:27,620
degrees out in the winter.

247
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,650
You'd are you doing stand up
out in the desert like no.

248
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,570
You're inside all those old
people that live in Vegas.

249
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:36,470
They stay inside the whole time and
Erica and one heat wave like five of them

250
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:40,520
die. Yeah, because I can't make it over
to their fucking air conditioner. I know,

251
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:43,970
but those are probably the ones who
aren't doing so well financially,

252
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:47,690
so they can't afford, they don't
matter. Oh Wow. They don't matter.

253
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:49,910
I'm going to out of that that like,
you know,

254
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:52,220
chances are they're in
places that don't have good

255
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,750
close with because I wear a silly
grin the moment you come into view.

256
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,470
There's a lot of older people
who live in Las Vegas, Bill,

257
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,120
so I'm just saying you're
going to be an going again.

258
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,990
You're going to be an air
conditioning and you'll be fine.

259
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,280
I'm not going to be there.
I have a plan. Okay.

260
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:15,140
And is your plan, Huh? I should
probably know what this plant is. Yeah.

261
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,440
Well it doesn't evolve.
Fucking living in a shop at it's Caesar's.

262
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,840
God live in Las Vegas.
Obnoxious fucking penthouse.

263
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,350
Yeah. Look at him hall.
Look at them all down there.

264
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,040
How'd he get away from the
window? Yes. Skin cancer.

265
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,270
Oh your ass.
That point.

266
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,050
We'll be sleeping in different suites.
Jesus Christ.

267
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,580
What was the topic you were
about to talk about? Oh,

268
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,900
getting back those arms up. I favorite
emojis. Oh the thumbs up. All right.

269
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:54,630
So this is thing going on
on the Internet right now.

270
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,170
Cause all Yankee fans are pissed at,
not all young for it,

271
00:16:58,171 --> 00:17:00,090
but a lot of Yankee fans
are pissed at Boston,

272
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,810
at the Boston Red Sox fans that
are talking shit. Right, right.

273
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,920
There's different kinds of sports fans.
This is sports fan that goes, hey man,

274
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:12,270
great series you sons of bitches, you beat
us, whatever. And you leave it at that.

275
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:12,650
Okay.

276
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,580
Then there's the middle guys who just
won't be friends with anybody who's a fan

277
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:20,160
of another team.
And then there's the worst of the worst,

278
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:25,260
which are just the shit talk and assholes
who talked fucking shit all the time.

279
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,410
And then when their team loses,
if you can find them,

280
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,310
cause they go into hiding to give
him the shit back that they deserve,

281
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,450
they then act as though
they don't understand where
this is coming from and have

282
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:41,310
the audacity to be like, oh,
class act plus act. Right. So,

283
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,720
um, I don't engage in any of
that. Okay. Right. Like, uh,

284
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:50,370
there's some hilarious stuff on the
Internet right now with um, you know,

285
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:54,110
shit talking red sox fans had shit-talking
Yankee fence. One of them is like,

286
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,170
one of them were cut,

287
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:59,640
few Yankee fans had the audacity to say
the Red Sox bought the uh, world series.

288
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,350
Oh, they're mad, Huh? Well it's just like,
well where did we learn how to do that?

289
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:05,680
You assholes.
They,

290
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:10,040
they're spending 20 million a year for
like 20 years and this is the first like

291
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,180
couple last couple of years they've
gone with their farm system,

292
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:13,020
which is brilliant.

293
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,870
And they're going to get another one and
they're going to get another one soon.

294
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,980
[inaudible] is what I think.

295
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,770
As much as I don't want that
to happen as a red sox fan,

296
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:21,930
I'm also a fan of baseball.
I love what they're doing.

297
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,120
So it's just like all you guys,

298
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:28,110
all they're doing is stockpiling their
cash and they're going to go out and

299
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:30,520
they're going to spend a ton of fucking
money and they're going to come out with

300
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,600
whatever the hell you need
to spend now to 228 million.

301
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,940
Is that what it is that what we spent?
Um,

302
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,950
and then also go on real
classy real class. He talking
shit, Bah, blah blah, blah,

303
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:44,160
blah. If the Yankees won, we wouldn't
have said shit about red sox fans.

304
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:47,190
It's like the fuck you
wouldn't the fuck you wasn't,

305
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,220
I remember when you want them
and what you said, I was there.

306
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,840
I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

307
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,380
You guys through beer in the face
of one of our relievers this year.

308
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:00,150
It's stop acting like you're class and
now I'm at face and the face. So anyways,

309
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,400
this was the day after,
I'm not gonna say who this person is,

310
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:09,330
but he's a very emotional
person and I love him.

311
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,280
And I've done his podcast and he's done
my podcast and he's one of the funniest

312
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:18,720
people I know. I love this guy, but
he's out of his fucking mind. Um,

313
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,280
he sends me a text at 12:34 PM he writes,
you know,

314
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:26,580
Pedro Martinez Sucks.
Big Fat Elephant Cox still,

315
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,890
he's still suck in elephant dicks.
So I write back, thanks so-and-so.

316
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,360
Exclamation point. God bless, exclamation
point, right? And he just keeps going.

317
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:40,320
He goes, he doesn't care. He doesn't
clean them either. He just sucks.

318
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:44,490
Elephant Cock only person
still rock and a Jheri curl.

319
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,530
So then I write back the number 11,
and he's still in the middle of his rent.

320
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:53,340
He goes, I'm a bad guy now, cause
he's, cause he's still sucks cock.

321
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,530
And then he takes the bait and he
goes, 11 what? And I go, championships,

322
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,180
five Superbowls, four world series,
one NBA, title one Stanley Cup,

323
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,880
1417 years. You'll tell your grandchildren
about it. And then he just writes back,

324
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,260
you've changed man.

325
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,420
And then he continues, whatever, man,

326
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,350
you didn't bring back that animal
Schilling in his fake bloody socks.

327
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,800
And I just never responded. So
I don't under, I don't, I'm,

328
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:28,830
I'm done near you don't understand it.
Like I'm going to have relapses.

329
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,810
Like when you bait me two times in the
face, right? That might send me back,

330
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:37,290
but I am done with this shit.
You just rolled your eyes.

331
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,080
You know what is this nith you know,
you know in your heart of hearts,

332
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:43,980

333
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,070
I work hard and make a
great living mean not

334
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,650

338
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,140

office waiting room.

00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,010
nobody.

That's the sound to your voice,

345
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,510
right as I'm walking out the
door to go do something fun.

346
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,160
I just hear you from upstairs.

347
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,280
Swing by is always the opposite direction.
20 fucking miles.

348
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,300
I was going to ask you to bring home some
bananas on the way back from the gym,

349
00:21:55,301 --> 00:21:59,770
but I thought better of it. Oh, you
did? I still would've done it, you know,

350
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,720
but I was like, no,
he's always saying that.

351
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:05,110
I always ask him to give you something
the other day cause I'm, I'm,

352
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,030
I'm just like, yeah, fuck this.

353
00:22:07,031 --> 00:22:11,140
I asked you all my buddies were coming
up for the world series. I just went, oh,

354
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,960
you skipped a few steps there. What did
I skip? You asked me to go get some beer.

355
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,020
Yeah. And you said, okay.
Oh Geez. And then yeah.

356
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:23,200
And then a half hour later you're
still laying there and I'm like, Mija,

357
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:25,510
you gotta go get that beer. And
you're like, oh, you were serious.

358
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,470
It's like, yeah, we're serious in my
row when you told me, so I was like,

359
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,850
you know you had a half hour to get
out of the room. Not to mention, yeah,

360
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,700
it was one in the afternoon. Fucking
laying around like Cruella Deville.

361
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,260
All right, let me, was this
Sunday? No, it wasn't. Yeah,

362
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,410
it wasn't, wasn't a Saturday.
It was Saturday. Can you
please put that back please?

363
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,470
Put that back.
Why can't I look at it?

364
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:58,960
Put that down because I can look
at stuff that's in here now.

of the packaging. All right.

370
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,680

be there for Madison Square Garden.

524
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:09,700
I know it's going to be amazing because
the form was literally the best show

525
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:14,380
I've ever seen. You do. And I've known
you really isn't. I had lights count.

528
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:25,960
But that farm one was like,
even when I talk to people about it now,

529
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,970
they'll just say it just from the
moment we walked in the door, like the,

530
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:34,150
just the whole energy was electric and
I think the crowd was really excited.

531
00:33:34,151 --> 00:33:37,360
You had a great crowd that night. Like it
was just, yeah, the crowd was, was really,

532
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:42,100
really, yeah. It was just
great energy. And like Joe
and dean were bulges on their,

533
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:43,750
a game.
Like it was just,

534
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,160
it was Joe and dean walked out there
like they were doing a spot at the store,

535
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,280
which is like how you have
to be, right? Yeah, no,

536
00:33:50,281 --> 00:33:53,820
they just went out there and they were
just like, Hey, what's up? And just, yeah,

537
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,030
went on. I was like, all right, well not
are intimidated by the venue I guess.

538
00:33:57,031 --> 00:34:01,410
If they're not nervous, why
should I be non very uh, yeah. No,

539
00:34:01,411 --> 00:34:04,050
it's a humbling experience in
go out there and just like,

540
00:34:04,051 --> 00:34:07,070
I don't know if I ever get to do
this again. So I'm playing drums

541
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,840
during the day. Yes. That's,

542
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,690
that's like your new thing now is that
you play the drums and and do then jam

543
00:34:13,691 --> 00:34:16,180
and then you,
then you're like,

544
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:19,430
I feel like you shake all the
nerves out of you by doing,

545
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,490
yeah. You just go, why don't you
just make a ton of noise? Yeah.

546
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,760
I did that at the garden and Boston.
I'm going to do it in Msg again.

547
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:29,600
And the farm too. Yup. Oh,

548
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:33,440
I played for like almost three hours.
My shoulder was killing me.

549
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:36,220
That's so great that they let
you do that though. Yeah. Yeah.

550
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,240
At first I thought that they
would think that, yeah, why?

551
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:39,350
What does this asshole doing that?

552
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:42,830
But then it's like this bands in there
all the time too and it up. Yeah.

553
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,280
And I think that they get a
kick out of the fact that, uh,

554
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,090
that we're acting like we won a
radio contest rather than coming in.

555
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,840
They're like, oh, another arena,
right? Yeah. We come here like,

556
00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:00,010
so you can't believe
I'm here. Sure. I mean,

557
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:04,030
that's all we do. I saw Queens
of the stone age here that just,

558
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,210
I just freak out the whole time.
I'm there. Wait, are we now?

559
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,730
Talk about the party yesterday.

560
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,440
Oh, how much you crushed that
frigging party? We had a,

561
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,500
the second annual kid, Halloween,
maybe Halloween. Baby Halloween,

562
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,790
maybe Halloween party.
You know how nightclubs are 21 and over.

563
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,680
This is,
this was two years and under.

564
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,610
Bless. It was adorable, first of all,
but no, it was, it was really, yeah.

565
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,600
The one little kid dressed
like a hedgehog. Oh my God.

566
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:37,050
The two little kids dress like hedgehogs.
There's two hedgehogs at the party. Oh,

567
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:40,830
I know. I thought it was going
to be friction. Um, snoopy,

568
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:42,150
the no one family,

569
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,110
one family came dressed
as Charlie Brown and Lucy.

570
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:50,580
That was the parents and then snoopy
was the baby. Oh man, that's so cute.

571
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:55,200
Then we had the tires, the
tires, the tires. The parents
showed up and just their,

572
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:59,460
their bathrobes and pajamas and
the kid. Oh, someone's pajamas.

573
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:04,470
A very clever idea. You went out
and got us all skeleton costume.

574
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,540
Oh my God. Wait, can we
talk about your skeleton?

575
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,990
Cuss my skeleton slash pimp
outfit that you got me.

576
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:13,680
It was a giant onesy with feet and hands.

577
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:17,250
I didn't realize that there was like
gloves and feeding. It wasn't clubs.

578
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:21,930
It was all sewed into it. There
was no option. There was no option.

579
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:25,980
Then we found out later on that night
that there was actually like this ski mass

580
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:29,340
thing that you were supposed to put
over your head. Like are you serious?

581
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,480
It was. It was definitely freaky. Yes,

582
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,480
and then you had the
most craziest joke ever.

583
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,060
Yes. Last night. I go, Jesus Christ, I go,

584
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:45,750
there was a fucking ski mask
thing with that and then you left,

585
00:36:45,751 --> 00:36:47,550
you said put that on and fuck me.

586
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:54,150
And I was even a even that
made me uncomfortable.

587
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,070
And I know you were fucking
joking obviously, but I
was like, Jesus Christ Nia.

588
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,300
Because it literally look like again,

589
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,160
you put it over your head and it was like

590
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:10,920
skeleton. Only thing that was missing
was the zipper mouth. So awful.

591
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,360
Yeah. That was a one and
done or put that on. Fuck me.

592
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,590
Unbelievable.
Oh my God.

593
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,250
Horrible. But no, that was,
um, that was a fun time.

594
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:29,140
Thank you so much for your
help with that. Great. Okay.

595
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,750
I, I'm gonna, I'm going to take
you to a Mike class at some point.

596
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,840
You literally have it laying
horizontal across your chest. I know.

597
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:39,380
Could I be like any lazier
right now my energy.

598
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,650
I'm comfortable now. I'm finally in a
comfortable spot. I got the blanket.

599
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,203
I feel good.

600
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,150
Yeah,
you were supposed to be working right now.

601
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:52,610
He's supposed to be just hating people
and you're sitting there looking look

602
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:55,890
like, uh, they took vacations together.

603
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,450
MMM.

604
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:02,590
All right. No, but the, uh, the caterers
were amazing. All the food was amazing.

605
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:07,150
And uh, thank you Twitter for
your ear playlist suggestions,

606
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,410
I think to people on Twitter.

607
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,650
But I want to thank you guys again that
you crushed it. It's a lot of good ideas.

608
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,650
You had all this great music and then all
of a sudden it would just go into like

609
00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:18,220
thriller Michael Jackson and
everybody get all psyched with that.

610
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:22,950
And then it'd be similar to,
it'd be like baby Shakhti dut dut babies.

611
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,600
I was trying to do with that. Does
that song go once that's in your head,

612
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:27,730
you'd done? It's done. It's done.

613
00:38:27,731 --> 00:38:31,290
And I had three different versions of
[inaudible]. Are you serious? Yeah.

614
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,660
I don't remember baby Shakhti
Ddd to do baby it did.

615
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:38,350
[inaudible]

616
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,930
baby check.
Mommy shucked it today.

617
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,640
It doesn't go dude. Dude, dude, dude.

618
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,340
No it doesn't. How does it go? It
doesn't do that. You didn't even hit,

619
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,010
you didn't even know what this
song was until I played it.

620
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,890
So how do you know how it goes? How
does it go then? I don't remember,

621
00:38:52,891 --> 00:38:56,190
but it doesn't go like that. Dot.
Well, there's a few different versions.

622
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,160
There's a slower one that goes baby

623
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:04,250
shuck, Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo
Doo baby shark due to do to do,

624
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:07,700
that's the one baby shower.
Maybe Shark Dude. Dude, dude,

625
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,680
the fuck is up.
There's many different versions of your

626
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:18,730
face. Doo, Doo, Doo Doo
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.

627
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,370
Got your face

628
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,310
fast one though.
That was the first one I heard.

629
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:27,970
Maybe they did the, that was
the first one I heard. Oh me,

630
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:32,280
maybe it works with that voice and
then I heard BB and then there's an RMB

631
00:39:32,281 --> 00:39:35,130
version one that I played
at the party as well.

632
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:39,890
I just firing on all cylinder.
Oh, there is spicy Margaritas.

633
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,640
Two of those bad boys.
All kinds of delicious food.

634
00:39:44,641 --> 00:39:49,140
We had like the toys and the games out
for the kids. Yeah, it was a good time.

635
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,970
It was a good time. Yeah, and
now it's over. Now it's over.

636
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,290
Now I have to go return all
those tables and chairs.

637
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:57,600
How few with a little kid shares.
Oh.

638
00:39:57,601 --> 00:40:01,170
And they actually sat in them Colorado
and they were coloring and putting

639
00:40:01,171 --> 00:40:03,600
stickers on construction paper.
It was so cute.

640
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,220
I liked the little kids at that age.
Like they just like,

641
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:09,070
there'll be two little kids just look at
each other and another kid just runs up

642
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,930
super fast and then just stops.

643
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,570
And then he'd just stare at each other
and then they all just run to go to

644
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,813
something.

645
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,130
You know, our, um,

646
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,450
our neighbor texted me and she
was asking how the party was,

647
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,370
she has older kids and she was like,

648
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:28,990
you probably had a much more controlled
situation because her kids are older and

649
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:31,810
she's like, when they get older, once
it's like foreign up, she's like,

650
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:34,550
every party is completely
insane because it's,

651
00:40:34,551 --> 00:40:37,630
their energy is all over the place anyway.
And then they have candy.

652
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,880
And she was like,
please and joy,

653
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:44,170
like the kind of controlled atmosphere
that you have with this age group.

654
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:48,070
But I was like, no, I know. That's
why I wanted to keep it to one under,

655
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:51,430
cause there's just insane,
right? Like don't you think?

656
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,570
Uh, no, I wasn't aware of
any of this storm front.

657
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,000
Well, apparently, well,
whatever, I'm going to comment.

658
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,050
Well, what are you going to do?
Yeah, I mean, whatever happens,

659
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,970
I know that me and my siblings did
tenfold to my mother, so I have a common,

660
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,700
um, all right, that's
the podcast. Um, now,

661
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:13,080
now you're going to be listening
to a clip of a uninformed,

662
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,970
I'm the first one and I don't
know how many years. 10 years. Uh,

663
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,720
that's gotta be on the Patrion page.

664
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:23,310
That is going to be debuting November 5th,
November 5th.

665
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,770
Excuse me,
I just burped November 5th.

666
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,960
Yeah. Talk to me about microphone, a kit.

667
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,920
You know what? You're right. See
that guys, that's how it works.

668
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,880
You to get along with your wife. She's
learned that phrase. You know what?

669
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:39,920
You're right. All right. That's
it. Uh, have a wonderful weekend.

670
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:41,200
You can set up job,

671
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,040
Deon one.

672
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,160
[inaudible]

673
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,440
I never one of those ones do it.
If I could go back in time.

674
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,150
I've worked in so many kitchens.
I've never seen so many jailbird.

675
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,990
I've never seen you get over and
fucking wash some. I've never,

676
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,880
we're going to get you. I've never seen
so many fat men do so much cooking.

677
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:45,960
It's like, Dude, oh, this doesn't make any
fucking, I know I've told you this story.

678
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,990
I got a classic one, a manager, right?

679
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,220
The manager where I
worked, uh, I was a busboy,

680
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,530
so I used to have to mop up around the
oyster bar and they had like the black

681
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,510
and white towels like the old
improv's used to have. Right.

682
00:42:57,511 --> 00:43:00,150
So I'm mopping that up and will
always be a fucking mess. Yeah.

683
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,360
And then I would have to mop up and
clean the men's room and the women's room

684
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,250
and a women's room always look like,
you know,

685
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:08,790
like the Yankees just won the world
series. It was just like toilet paper,

686
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,030
a ticker tape all over the whatever.
It was just,

687
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:13,920
it was a fucking mess in there guys.
It was just a pissed all over the place.

688
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,550
So I go in there to clean the
bathroom and my manager is in there.

689
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:22,100
He's got the water on full blast and
he's brushing his teeth while puking.

690
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,040
Swear to God, he's prejudiced.
He's got that. Maybe go like,

691
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,970
oh,
hello.

692
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,540
And he had the water keep going.

693
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,870
Then he just kept brushing his
teeth and I was sitting there,

694
00:43:31,871 --> 00:43:32,704
I didn't know what to do.

695
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:34,240
Aw.
They just

696
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,890
kept brushing his fucking teeth and then
he just saw and then he played it off

697
00:43:38,891 --> 00:43:41,380
going like, ah, you know,

698
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:45,040
it goes brushing the teeth
sometimes it makes me gag.

699
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,730
And I'm thinking about doe fucking Jim,
the toothbrush down your throat,

700
00:43:48,731 --> 00:43:52,600
your fucking whore.
And it wasn't till I was only 19 right.

701
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:57,640
So what is it until years later that I
was like, oh, he was fucking hung over.

702
00:43:57,641 --> 00:43:59,890
He just was fucking puking up alcohol

703
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,450
and he was probably standing
there puking than I came in.

704
00:44:04,451 --> 00:44:06,520
And then he was just trying to act
like he was brushing his teeth.

705
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:08,620
Like I wasn't going to notice
that he was fucking puking,

706
00:44:08,621 --> 00:44:13,300
but I was standing there, go over
the brush. Gee, that guy was stuck.

707
00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:15,580
I was so funny. I remember he
go funny, believe it or not,

708
00:44:15,581 --> 00:44:19,000
he ends up getting fired,
right? He goes, yeah,

709
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:22,720
he gets fired and then he
gets a job managing another
restaurant as they all do.

710
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:26,680
Yeah. You walked out onto the floor and
an eight ball fell out of your pockets.

711
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,500
You fired. And then like they
won't even go across town.

712
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:32,160
They'd be across the fucking,
like the, the Strip mall.

713
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,800
So this guy ends up getting another job,

714
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:36,510
making way more money and I swear to God,

715
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:39,510
he showed up like a week
later with his new job,

716
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:43,890
he had bought a brand new car and he came
over to peacock, like we gave a fuck.

717
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:47,130
And he pulled up with some
white Subaru sports cars.

718
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,600
I can't remember what the fuck
he had and he just kicked can,

719
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:52,890
he just was sitting there at
the fucking bar with this cat,

720
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:56,400
ate the canary smile on his face. And I
said, hey man, how are you doing? I said,

721
00:44:56,401 --> 00:44:58,860
hey, is that your car out day is
like, yeah, I want to drive it.

722
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:02,490
And he slid the keys across the barge.
Jesus Christ. Yeah. I swear to God,

723
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,890
it was like I was in
roadhouse. The, uh, dude,

724
00:45:04,891 --> 00:45:08,850
restaurant workers are like
dirty cops. They just get
shuffled off. Oh yeah. Dirty.

725
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:12,960
The 42nd precinct. Oh yeah. They're
there. Once you're in, you're in, dude.

726
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:13,920
It doesn't matter.

727
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,533
What do you got?

728
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:40,183
[inaudible] [inaudible]

729
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:12,330
[inaudible]

730
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,100

731
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,760
Oh,

00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,550
Yes.

733
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:20,880
Hey, it's Becca, right?

734
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:24,430
Oh,

735
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:28,810
you can't, you can't. You
can't. You can't. You cons.

736
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:33,980
What's going on? It's Bill Burger.
It's the Monday morning podcast.

737
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:39,050
That was the worst fucking mix ever done.
I don't give a fuck. I'm in my pajamas.

738
00:46:39,051 --> 00:46:43,040
What do you want for me?
The Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

739
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:47,480
November 1st. Oh my God.
It's almost thanksgiving.

740
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,900
This motherfucker is back on iTunes,

741
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:55,880
so everybody relax.
Your fucking smart phones.

742
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,550
Relax. You can download it. It is
back. I don't know why it's back.

743
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,750
I don't know why it went away.
It went away.

744
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,280
Like somebody drunk mother a
couple of months, you know,

745
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:14,980
couple of months back, she started
drinking. The Shiv is Rico. Yeah.

746
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,080
Got a little tipsy.

747
00:47:16,081 --> 00:47:19,950
She went out to the bar and she never
came back and then all of a sudden she

748
00:47:19,951 --> 00:47:24,480
just comes walking back into our
lives. No apology. No nothing.

749
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:30,470
Ma. Where the fuck you Ben? Yeah,
Jerry. Just it alone. All right.

750
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:35,620
She's sober. Um, yeah, I dunno. I Dunno
what happened with fucking iTunes.

751
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:39,460
I don't know what I said. I don't know
what I did. There was no explanation.

752
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:44,800
Actually there was an explanation, but
it's too fucking boring to get into. Um,

753
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,050
I used the wrong punctuation,

754
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:51,460
some sort of quotes when I put the
money more. No, I use an Asterick,

755
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:56,890
you know, little Barry bonds, little
Sammy Sosa, little Mark McGuire,

756
00:47:56,891 --> 00:48:01,840
little Roger Maris action. When I
went to go post it and then they just,

757
00:48:01,841 --> 00:48:05,980
they just took me off, you know, and
like some mean little seventh grade girl,

758
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:07,450
they just refused to talk to me.

759
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,740
We were BFFs and it was fucking
over and there was no reason,

760
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:14,380
complete overreaction.

761
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:19,050
So for the last fucking 35
days or so, we were like, to,

762
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:23,200
what the fuck are, you know, I thought
we were friends. So anyways, we're back.

763
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:25,180
We're back on iTunes and if you guys have,
you know,

764
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,270
your smart phones or whatever the
hell it is, you can download it.

765
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:32,020
You can download it to your iPod, you
can go right back to fucking off at work.

766
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:35,920
Isn't that great? Isn't that phenomenal?
Doesn't that make you feel good?

767
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:41,650
Uh, as you can see, uh, um,
I kind of sounded excited.
This is like one of these,

768
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:44,590
these episodes where I'm going to be
a little manic because not only am I

769
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:47,710
excited that the, I uh, the
podcast is back on iTunes.

770
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:53,280
I'm also a freaking out cause I have
a ton of shit that I have to do today.

771
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:57,370
So to be honest with you guys,
after this wonderful Intro,

772
00:48:57,371 --> 00:49:00,220
I'm just here to tell you I really don't
have time for you fuckers this week.

773
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:05,250
What are you think about
that? Ah, um, all right.

774
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,440
What are we going to talk about this
week? Let's, let's, let's open the page.

775
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,340
Open the page. Nia, closing the
door cause I'm being too loud.

776
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:14,710
What's it matter in the
he afraid of the funny,

777
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:20,590
she's in a mood, but are they always, ah,

778
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:24,630
I got a smile and it really annoyed
me this weekend. I was sick,

779
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,030
I was in Saint Louis,
meet me in St Louis.

780
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:32,040
Louis meet me at the fair though.

781
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:35,980
Tell me the lights are
shining and he plays,

782
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,290
but there we will dance though.

783
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:43,291
Who Ci Coochie you will be something else
that is a sexual innuendo but it's the

784
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:47,530
19 fucking forties.
So we can't talk about banging.

785
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,810
I'm sorry. Mitch Miller Baby.
What was my first album?

786
00:49:52,811 --> 00:49:56,500
Sing along with Mitch in the gang and
I just found out that motherfucker just

787
00:49:56,501 --> 00:50:01,030
died. That son of a bitch was
like 90 something years old.

788
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:05,830
Still put in Grecian formula in
his beard. God bless them. Um,

789
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,400
AH, Jesus. Why did I sing
that stupid fucking song?

790
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:11,740
I forget what the Hell I was going
to talk about. Let's go back.

791
00:50:11,741 --> 00:50:13,300
Let's try to go back into the memory bank.

792
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:17,080
I was in Saint Louis this week and uh,

793
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:22,060
I did a benefit for the children,
John Carney, sa carnies kids.

794
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:25,390
I did that a Friday night, Saturday
night. I did the funny bone,

795
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:30,080
two shows at the funny bone and want to
thank who showed up at a wonderful time

796
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:32,290
out there. And, uh,

797
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:35,870
if you guys want to go back in time
and reach back into a little bit of

798
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:40,871
Americana that you feel was lost during
the last 20 years of horrific moves.

799
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,110
You know, I've got an idea.
Let's come up with Nafta.

800
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,990
Let's stand all the manufacturing
out of this fucking country.

801
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:55,130
And then Sunday we want a fac we
gotta compete with sweatshop Labor.

802
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,800
Does that sound like good idea?
I think that's a good fucking idea.

803
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:01,070
I have an idea. Let's have a war. Fuck.

804
00:51:01,071 --> 00:51:04,460
Let's have two wars at
the same fucking Tam.

805
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,480
How are we going to pay for it? Yeah,
we'll borrow money from chatter.

806
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:11,990
That sounds good to me.
Why am I blaming it on southerners?

807
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,680
I Dunno why? I Dunno. Why?

808
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:20,750
Cause the last two guys were from Arkansas
and then the other guy was from Texas,

809
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:25,220
you know. Ah. You realize before Obama,

810
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:27,680
the last two presidents should
have been on the food network.

811
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:31,220
I one of those barbecue offs.
You know, I'm trying to compete.

812
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:35,760
Who has the best fucking sauce?
Mas Vinegar based in his,

813
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:38,720
he's in [inaudible]. Okay.
That's that sweet stuff.

814
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,880
You put that sweet stuff phone
cause you don't know how to cook.

815
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:45,320
Good please mate. You know, not a good,
you know how to cook good pace. Me,

816
00:51:45,321 --> 00:51:48,130
you don't need go desk sweet stuff.
You can put a little bit leaner growling.

817
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:52,220
I come from the foot hills North
Carolina, we use, we use vinegar start,

818
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:57,270
he started using that. Then that sweet
stuff he talking about Kansas City. Um,

819
00:51:59,410 --> 00:51:59,990
anyway,
so if you want,

820
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:03,290
if you want to reach back into America
a little bit and just a, if you want,

821
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:03,580
you get,

822
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:08,150
if you have children and you want them
to see what this country used to be like

823
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:12,770
back in the day when you
could eat cheeseburgers and
French fries and a fucking

824
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,280
drink it goddamn chocolate
malt and somehow not end
up being a fat fuck because

825
00:52:20,421 --> 00:52:24,230
there wasn't all these goddamn
preservatives in it. Right?

826
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,550
Isn't that what makes you fat?

827
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:28,730
How come it people used to eat like no
one knew shit about nutrition in the

828
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:32,150
1950s. Yet everybody kind of
seemed like they weren't in shape.

829
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,370
You know, granted they were
fucking openly racist and uh,

830
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:40,250
grabbing their secretaries
asked every five seconds,

831
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:43,490
but they were in much better shape.
If you want to go back into time,

832
00:52:43,491 --> 00:52:48,491
go to Saint Louis because St Louis is
one of the few places I have been to and

833
00:52:49,071 --> 00:52:53,390
the last eight years that you can still
smoke in comedy clubs and you could

834
00:52:53,391 --> 00:52:57,440
smoke in bars and people just light
up. And I, and I was amazed by it,

835
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,590
you know,
even though I kind of remembered that you,

836
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:05,560
I hadn't been there in five years, but,
uh, there's just certain states they just,

837
00:53:05,561 --> 00:53:08,030
they just, um, they don't give a shit.

838
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:10,970
Like when they see the surgeon
general come on TV, they just like,

839
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:15,590
I don't recognize that uniform. He
ain't no fucking Americans. So, uh,

840
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:20,000
they completely ignore it. So if you
want to go back in time with your child,

841
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:20,511
you know,

842
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:25,511
if you're tired of reminiscing with your
adolescent son or daughter about how I

843
00:53:25,861 --> 00:53:29,540
used to be able to go in a bar
and have a drink and a smoke, um,

844
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:32,400
why not live it?
Why not go to Saint Louis?

845
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,270
I think that they should add that to
their tourist attractions right up there

846
00:53:36,271 --> 00:53:38,520
with the, uh, with the arch,

847
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:42,990
the gateway to the West so to speak.

848
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:46,230
I actually hung around for an extra
day yesterday and I went to the, uh,

849
00:53:46,231 --> 00:53:51,000
the Saint Louis Rams game
first. The, uh, the, uh,

850
00:53:51,001 --> 00:53:55,440
the Carolina Panthers and is
boring as part of the game was,

851
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,630
it was kind of exciting to watch a team
that you could tell was going to be

852
00:54:00,631 --> 00:54:03,660
fucking good in about a year or two.
The ramps,

853
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:09,240
remember you heard it
first, November 1st, 2010.

854
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:14,250
Right here. Sam Bradford I think
is the real fucking deal. Guys.

855
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,400
Cool as a cucumber.
He's driving the damn team down the field.

856
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,210
Even though his top three receivers
are all out for the season.

857
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:24,990
He was throwing it to
white guys all day long.

858
00:54:24,991 --> 00:54:27,960
That's how many injuries
they have on the team.

859
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:31,440
They're all the way down to
the white receivers people.

860
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,380
And I know what you're going to say.
What about Wes Welker. All right.

861
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,950
Wes Welker, that white dude who played
for Denver, there's not a lot, you know,

862
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:45,240
but slowly but surely, I don't know if
you've noticed the white guy is, is,

863
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:49,560
is making a little bit of
inroads back into, into some, uh,

864
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:54,690
what do they call those
positions? Performance are
a speed positions. You know,

865
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,450
there's a couple of white running backs.

866
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,480
Did you ever think you're going to see
that again? I mean, I couldn't believe it.

867
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:01,530
I'm in Saint Louis.

868
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:06,360
People are smoking within structures and
there's a white quarterback thrown into

869
00:55:06,361 --> 00:55:10,100
a white wide receiver.
It was unbelievable.

870
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:13,560
I was waiting for Larry Zonker to come
walking out on the field with that little

871
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:18,540
fucking, you know, the two
bars across his face. And then
that one, the, the, the, the,

872
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:20,310
the horseshoe we had on top.

873
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:25,710
That's why I don't fucking
respect the goddamn 72 dolphins.

874
00:55:25,711 --> 00:55:29,720
They had two white running
backs. Okay. And you go, oh,
we went undefeated. Did Ya?

875
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:34,710
Who'd you play in the third week? Some
group of people from the fucking why MCA?

876
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:40,020
You fucking pricks? What'd your 14 you
40? I'll use when 14 fucking games.

877
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:44,730
14 game season.
You cheap bastards.

878
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,720
Oh God. That fucking lost
to the giant still hurts.

879
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:53,721
But you know what feels good watching
the Goddamn jets lose nine to nothing.

880
00:55:55,531 --> 00:55:56,700
I love it.
I love it.

881
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:59,850
And here are the Patriots are
right in a rebuilding fucking year.

882
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,320
We've got a bunch of Goddamn kids
play in defense. We Trade Randy Moss,

883
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:09,590
all these asshole jet fans of fucking go
hoe and do patriots fucking quit with a

884
00:56:10,171 --> 00:56:13,230
nervous they could be to
judge you to gay p two p.

885
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:17,310
That's what a great coach Bill Belichick
is. All right, you fucking assholes.

886
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:22,700
How do you like that six and one with
a bunch of children play a defense

887
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,030
six and won best record in the NFL.
I don't know how the fuck we did it.

888
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:32,770
I gotta I gotta admit I'm not gonna.

889
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:37,550
I'm not going to believe
that we're actually going to
do something and unless we,

890
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:40,720
we beat the Steelers and uh,

891
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:44,110
we played the Steelers in the jets and a,
even if we go one and one,

892
00:56:44,111 --> 00:56:49,000
if we're competitive, then
I'm going to get excited. But,
uh, you know, I don't know.

893
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:53,440
Our defense at this point is
halfway to be in good, I feel.

894
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:57,790
But I'm, I'm telling you don't
sleep on the fucking rams.

895
00:56:57,791 --> 00:57:00,950
I should have bet those sons of bitches.
I should,

896
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:05,490
I had no idea what was going on down
there in Saint Louis and they got that

897
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:09,520
maniac. Uh, the fuck
is his name, number 55.

898
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:14,140
That kid from Ohio state, God
dammit, what the hell was his name?

899
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,330
Something itis.
Dad's like a professional wrestler.

900
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,810
He went in and he got a sack and he
did the fucking Hulk Hogan, you know,

901
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:26,650
putting his company's air. And then he
did the flex then and then I was great.

902
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:31,180
It was fucking great.
I don't know what the jets lost.

903
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:34,150
I'm so fucking excited. Cause all those
assholes and you know, it's funny,

904
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:39,240
I didn't get one goddamn fucking email
from any of those goddamn jet fans who've

905
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:44,650
been given me shit all these
weeks. You know, fucking idiots.

906
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:47,740
They're not idiots. You know what they
are? They're hopeful. Sons of bitches,

907
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:49,030
they haven't won in 40 years.

908
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:54,180
They get excited about little things
like drafting fucking Mark Sanchez

909
00:57:55,720 --> 00:58:00,460
San Shies. You know what's going to be
the end of the jet season if one of your

910
00:58:00,461 --> 00:58:05,461
unbelievably awesome offensive lineman
goes down with an injury that fucking

911
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:10,450
goddamn mediocre overrated jackass.
Overrated this week,

912
00:58:10,451 --> 00:58:12,220
mark fucking Sanchez,

913
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,700
that gay managing jackass.

914
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:21,040
Good Lord fucking sit behind
the goddamned Berlin Wall.

915
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:25,810
You could have fucking rex Grossman in
there and he could throw for 180 yards.

916
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:30,610
No picks. You're not impressing
me. Speaking of that man,

917
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:33,070
I had the fucking reds.
I got my ass handed to me yesterday.

918
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:34,930
Thank God I picked the dolphins.

919
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:39,820
I had the dolphins getting
one and Cincinnati and uh,

920
00:58:39,821 --> 00:58:41,530
I love the dolphins.
I loved them.

921
00:58:41,531 --> 00:58:45,390
They got that fucking defense and the
Bengals when sputter and all fucking years

922
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:48,700
. So I said, fuck it. I'll take
that. So I won that one. Then I had

923
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:53,230
the Redskins, Donovan McNabb going
into play the lines, but typical me,

924
00:58:53,231 --> 00:58:54,490
I don't read up on sports.

925
00:58:54,491 --> 00:58:56,920
I didn't know that their quarterback
was coming back for the lions.

926
00:58:56,921 --> 00:59:01,510
I don't even know what his fucking
name is. Stafford, something like that.

927
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:05,470
I had no fucking idea. And then when,
when the whole game's on the line,

928
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:06,940
including my fucking money,

929
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:10,690
you'd take Donovan McNabb out
and you put in Rex Grossman,

930
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:12,371
the guy,

931
00:59:12,371 --> 00:59:16,930
the cult secretly fucking paid
off the bears to be quarterback.

932
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:21,050
So Peyton manning could finally get his
fucking ring after they went into the

933
00:59:21,051 --> 00:59:25,160
Goddamn rule book and change the rules
so Peyton could fucking actually beat the

934
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:29,600
patriots in the fucking playoffs.
Playoffs.

935
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:33,470
Um, whatever. I'm just talking shit.
Um, I actually took the colts tonight.

936
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:34,580
As much as I hate it,

937
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:37,790
I'm going to have to fucking root for
the colts cause I could go up to games on

938
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:42,320
Paul versa, who almost went all in
for last week missed. I know sports.

939
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:46,940
Paul Versey are you listening?
He went one in three yesterday and I uh,

940
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:50,330
I've gotten one or two, but I have, I
have the colts tonight. Loving them,

941
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,460
loving them to avenge their
loss to the Houston Texans.

942
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:58,970
I don't even know what the fucking
spread is cause I don't give a shit.

943
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,840
I really don't give a shit. I just
like pissing people off. Let's get,

944
01:00:02,841 --> 01:00:07,090
let's get on with the podcast.
Um, it is November 1st everybody.

945
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:11,660
And uh, did you guys all have a nice
Halloween? Did you have a nice Halloween?

946
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,190
Did Brett Farve die yesterday? Did
you guys see that shit? Jesus Christ,

947
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:21,620
he looked like somebody kicked
him in the balls from behind

948
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:29,470
the way he was laying there with
his fucking knees up to his dealer.

949
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:33,210
He was going to get an enema. It's
like, what are you doing dude?

950
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:37,100
You own every fucking record out there.
Good and bad.

951
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:41,690
What are you going for? The mediocre
ones now I don't understand this guy.

952
01:00:41,691 --> 01:00:44,120
It's just, just, just walk away.

953
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:49,350
I don't like how he's patting himself on
the back too. You know, I got hit in a,

954
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:52,100
that's a hit that you know, I don't think
a lot of people would've got up from,

955
01:00:52,101 --> 01:00:57,080
but you know, I had on some
wrangler underwear and I just said,

956
01:00:57,081 --> 01:01:01,400
fuck it. He is a tough son
of a bitch. But you know,

957
01:01:01,401 --> 01:01:06,230
I don't know what he's trying this. His
wife hate him at this point. Um, yeah,

958
01:01:06,231 --> 01:01:10,160
keep playing. I don't give a shit show
when your dick to everybody. Fuck you.

959
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:15,290
Um, oh, here's something that I actually,

960
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:19,580
I never even addressed.
All right. Brett said that,

961
01:01:19,581 --> 01:01:23,270
that annoyed me and Kobe Bryant a couple
months ago when Lebron was doing his

962
01:01:23,271 --> 01:01:26,990
big decision thing,
when he finally decided to go to Miami,

963
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:29,450
Coby made this statement,
I forget if I brought this up.

964
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:33,380
They ask Coby if he would've done the
same thing. And he goes, no, I wouldn't.

965
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:38,510
I would've stayed. And a, I thought
that was kind of cunty. It's like,

966
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:42,380
well, that's easy for you to say
when you fucking play for the Lakers.

967
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:46,310
And they bring all the free agents to you.
You know,

968
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,060
there's been no reason
for you to fucking leave

969
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:55,040
your whole fucking career.
They've been bringing you guys,

970
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,820
you were playing in Cleveland.
You would've left Colby.

971
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:03,950
You almost left because you didn't like
Shaq. Either he goes or I go, I'm sick.

972
01:02:03,951 --> 01:02:08,600
Or when a championships,
um, it's all fucking career.

973
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:12,980
They brought your shack.
Dennis Rodman, Phil Jackson,

974
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:18,440
Karl Malone, Gary Payton,
Robert Henri, Pau Gasol,

975
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:22,210
fucking that dude who
choked the people at I. Off.

976
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:25,220
I don't watch fucking basketball.
Who's that guy there?

977
01:02:25,221 --> 01:02:30,060
A Jesus Christ. So he's still a bit of
bottom. I say his name every Goddamn night

978
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:36,570
she was Jermaine O'Neal slid across the
floor, punch that guy in the face. Ah,

979
01:02:36,571 --> 01:02:40,560
whatever the fuck his name is,
the trails. Fucking third cousin.

980
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,580
They brought you a list.
Fucking free agencies.

981
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:48,140
Your entire Goddamn Korea. I thought that
was a real conti move for someone who,

982
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:52,670
who is allegedly Lebron's friend.
But how funny is it watching, uh,

983
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,080
Lebron's people sitting there trying to
do damage control with these stupid ass

984
01:02:58,081 --> 01:03:01,200
fucking commercials?
Trying to get people to a,

985
01:03:01,201 --> 01:03:03,300
I don't know what changed their
opinion about them. I mean,

986
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:06,690
I could really give a shit. It's just
like, just fucking go play basketball.

987
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:11,670
I don't give a fuck. What
would I do that? Well,

988
01:03:11,671 --> 01:03:13,050
what would I, what would I do? I would,

989
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,980
I would not even be able to make it on
my eighth grade basketball team if I

990
01:03:16,981 --> 01:03:20,160
remember correctly. So I, I don't
know what I would do. Lebron.

991
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:24,600
I haven't had to make decisions
like anywhere near that level.

992
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:26,731
I don't care.

993
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:30,690
I don't care about you and yet talcum
powder and your little fucking ritual.

994
01:03:30,691 --> 01:03:33,510
I could give a shit.
Just fucking go out and entertain me.

995
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:38,640
I don't need you to try to Redo your
fucking image, you know? I don't know.

996
01:03:38,641 --> 01:03:41,640
So what?
You can make $100 billion.

997
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,960
Don't you have enough? Isn't it
enough? You get free sneakers?

998
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,750
I don't even know what
I'm talking about people.

999
01:03:48,751 --> 01:03:52,140
I'm just fucking thinking about all the
shit I have to do for the rest of the

1000
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,880
day. That's what I'm doing
in this podcast right now.

1001
01:03:53,881 --> 01:03:57,720
I'm cleaning the dirt out
of my keyboard and uh,

1002
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:00,990
speaking of what,
you know what I'm dying to do,

1003
01:04:00,991 --> 01:04:05,991
I'm dying to fucking replace
some of the tile in my bathroom.

1004
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:10,110
You know, this is the latest
thing I'm obsessed with.

1005
01:04:10,111 --> 01:04:14,730
I'm obsessed with learning how to fix
shit around the house because I'm going to

1006
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:19,731
buy a house and I'll be fucked if I'm
going to pay some fucking mouth breathe

1007
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,390
and jackass with Dickies hanging off
his goddamn ass to come in there and

1008
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:27,750
overcharged me for parts cause he wants
to have a fucking kegger that weekend.

1009
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:31,950
You know, so if you want to
learn how to do shit right,

1010
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,570
I hear you do it. You do it in the
apartment that you live in. It.

1011
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:40,670
See like my dog clot up some of the,
uh,

1012
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:45,540
some of the trim around
the door and a man,

1013
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:49,350
it's a fucking joke. I'm looking
at it going, this is this.

1014
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:53,220
This can't be this fucking difficult.
I'd go down to, hey, home depot,

1015
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,230
they got precut shit down there,

1016
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,490
so all I gotta do is get the shit
that's the same fucking size.

1017
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:03,120
I trim it off the bottom.
Make sure it fits.

1018
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:09,030
Slap it on there. Right?
Who cares if I fuck up?

1019
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,900
It's not my place.
It's all a little bit of pain over it.

1020
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:17,680
Nobody's going to notice my landlord
doesn't listen to this podcast, does he?

1021
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:22,600
No. Seriously. I want to, I want to learn
how to fucking do that. Some of that shit.

1022
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:26,620
I already know how to take a toilet out.
Can take the whole fucking thing apart.

1023
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:31,810
I know how to take a fucking sink out now.
I don't know how to do that shit.

1024
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:34,600
I just watched a couple youtube videos,
but it gave me confidence.

1025
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,260
I'm confident with the sink that you,
you fucking set down into the counter.

1026
01:05:38,261 --> 01:05:40,210
That one that you got
to go underneath with.

1027
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:42,790
I don't know how that's when
you're dealing with gravity.

1028
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:44,560
I like the one that sits down in it.

1029
01:05:44,561 --> 01:05:48,190
You can just unhook everything and then
figure out how to hook it back up later.

1030
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:49,450
You know,

1031
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:52,360
you go to turn on the hot water and all
of a sudden the garbage disposal goes on

1032
01:05:52,361 --> 01:05:56,890
in the fucking kitchen. I want to
learn how to do that shit, but, uh,

1033
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:00,700
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about. All right, let's, let's, let's,

1034
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,390
let's get to some youtube videos
of the week people, shall we, um,

1035
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,950
first one and these are all gonna
be on the, uh, the Mlm, podcast.com,

1036
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:14,130
the official website of the Monday morning
podcast that is back on iTunes as you

1037
01:06:16,211 --> 01:06:20,770
heard earlier with my horrible
singing. Um, all right, here,

1038
01:06:20,771 --> 01:06:22,960
they all are in, these aren't,
these aren't even youtube videos.

1039
01:06:22,961 --> 01:06:25,850
These are videos that I got everywhere,
but youtube because a,

1040
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:26,980
everybody's on Youtube,

1041
01:06:26,981 --> 01:06:29,470
so I'm trying to go a little bit outside
the box with some of the shit that

1042
01:06:29,471 --> 01:06:34,000
people send me. Um, this is one.

1043
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,200
Um, ah, shit, I didn't know
what the fuck to call it.

1044
01:06:38,201 --> 01:06:42,160
Just go to the [inaudible] podcast.com
and check this one out. Um,

1045
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,350
a buddy of mine stand up, comedian,
Rob Cantrell. Fucking hilarious.

1046
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:51,430
Really original guy. Um,
comedian and I think, um,

1047
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:55,150
I think it was the first season of
last comic standing. He was on it.

1048
01:06:55,151 --> 01:06:56,680
That's the first time I
saw him and I was like,

1049
01:06:56,681 --> 01:07:01,660
I like this dude because he doesn't seem
like he's trying to win the competition

1050
01:07:01,661 --> 01:07:04,600
as much as he's trying to give
these people some quality stand up.

1051
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:09,210
And then you had the other guy fucking
going around with the Goddamn Ginsu sorts,

1052
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:13,540
fucking spinning it around. So of
course America votes for him. Right?

1053
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:18,550
That's how they do it. Give me some
shiny shit. That's what I'm voting for.

1054
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:23,100
Um, he did a thing about why pot
should be legalized in this country.

1055
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,680
He made a great fucking
video that's supposed to, uh,

1056
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:29,110
it's supposed to be like the
beginning of that movie patent. Um,

1057
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:34,340
check that one out. Uh, there's
another one, a dude with Nub, k Kaos,

1058
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:39,010
another guy, a to guy with a, yeah,

1059
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:43,240
he has only one arm and then he has
part of another arm and he fucking,

1060
01:07:43,241 --> 01:07:44,820
he's in a,
I dunno what they're doing,

1061
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:49,830
movie tie and he movie knocks the other
guy's fucking ass at down under the camp

1062
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:53,350
canvas.
Um,

1063
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:58,380
next one is a touch my body karaoke fail,

1064
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:03,580
uh, with some English subtitles even
though the guy's singing in English.

1065
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:08,150
And the last one actually comes from the
dude who runs the MM podcasts who, uh,

1066
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,840
if you want to really,
if you want some advice on gambling,

1067
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:12,790
this is the guy he's on
a fucking hot streak,

1068
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:16,640
a crazy in coffee shop.

1069
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:20,570
Starts yelling at Mexican dude.
So there you go.

1070
01:08:20,571 --> 01:08:25,130
There's your videos that you can watch
while you're at work or working out or

1071
01:08:25,131 --> 01:08:27,760
whatever. Um, I got a lot of, um,

1072
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:33,080
emails last week from me imitating
those dudes on the corner,

1073
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:36,920
so called white man. That shit.
Remember that last week, um,

1074
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:41,780
somebody set out that impression of the
street preacher with the bad pa was spot

1075
01:08:41,781 --> 01:08:43,010
on and fucking hilarious.

1076
01:08:43,011 --> 01:08:48,011
There's a guy shouting in Spanish into
a blown out PA on the weekends in my

1077
01:08:48,231 --> 01:08:51,090
neighborhood, there's two churches. Uh,

1078
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:56,930
there's two churches on every block
and even the immigrants, immigrants,

1079
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:01,820
residents, even the immigrant residents,
these, this is all a misspelled here.

1080
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,480
Immigrant residents grimace
and give him dirty looks.

1081
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:10,010
How do you say quit shouting
and fix your levels in Spanish?

1082
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:17,160
That is a reoccurring thing that I
have found straight across the board.

1083
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:20,780
And when people go out, I don't give
a fuck black, white, Latino, Asian,

1084
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:25,550
I don't give a shit. They never
have the levels correct in their PA.

1085
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:30,770
I think there's so passionate about their
politics that they never really, uh,

1086
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:34,860
I don't know.
And it's such a grass roots

1087
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:37,700
actually,
when you think about it,

1088
01:09:37,701 --> 01:09:41,540
do you really think Obama knows
how to use a mixer? How old is he?

1089
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:46,130
Yeah, he probably doesn't.
He's like fucking, I don't
even know how old the guys,

1090
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,370
I have not paid attention to politics in.

1091
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,290
I don't even know when, I have no
fucking idea when I just, I wanted,

1092
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:57,320
whenever I stopped talking
about conspiracy theory
theory cause I just got so

1093
01:09:57,321 --> 01:10:02,000
depressed about all of
this shit. Um, you know,

1094
01:10:02,001 --> 01:10:05,810
started reading up on banking.
Like here's a,

1095
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:08,180
here's something interesting here.
I,

1096
01:10:08,181 --> 01:10:11,480
this is one way I kind of see both sides
of this. This guy sent me this letter.

1097
01:10:11,481 --> 01:10:12,890
He said that bill,
listen to this shit.

1098
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:17,060
So my wife and I are looking at
buying a house. Uh, like you,

1099
01:10:17,061 --> 01:10:18,570
I am not the biggest fan of bank.

1100
01:10:18,571 --> 01:10:21,020
So instead of putting all my
money in a savings account,

1101
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:25,460
I had been saving some cash on the
side and keeping it in my dresser.

1102
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:31,010
And there's a smart place to put it.
Why don't you stick it in the mattress?

1103
01:10:31,011 --> 01:10:34,950
There's another place, you know, dude,

1104
01:10:34,951 --> 01:10:38,570
if you ever had that money stolen by
somebody breaking into your house,

1105
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:42,110
that burglar should have been dressed
up in the black and white stripe shirt

1106
01:10:42,111 --> 01:10:44,720
with the uh, uh, lone ranger.

1107
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:49,700
I'm a fucking a bank robber mask.
Maybe.

1108
01:10:49,701 --> 01:10:51,500
Maybe you're just saying,
you put it in your dresser,

1109
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:53,580
your actually put it somewhere else,
you know you got you gotta,

1110
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,960
you gotta be a little more creative
than that. Anyways, he says, well,

1111
01:10:56,990 --> 01:11:01,190
when my wife talked to the bank about
getting a loan, they asked us our incomes,

1112
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:05,000
how much money we saved and how we
would be paying our down payment.

1113
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:09,140
My wife told them about our
savings and everything was fine.

1114
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:12,080
She then told them that I had
cash saved up on the side.

1115
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:16,230
They immediately stopped her and said
that the cash could not be used unless

1116
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:20,880
there was an explanation for how I got
it and a paper trail to back it up.

1117
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:25,230
The banks look at your financial history
bank statements and your spending

1118
01:11:25,231 --> 01:11:30,060
habits to determine if you really could
save however much cash you actually

1119
01:11:30,061 --> 01:11:33,060
have. A, since some of my money is cash,

1120
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:38,250
I've won from poker games and old
stuff. I sold on craigslist, craigslist.

1121
01:11:38,251 --> 01:11:39,720
I have no paper trail for it.

1122
01:11:39,721 --> 01:11:44,580
The only way that I can now use it for
our house is to get my parents to lie and

1123
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:48,060
write a note explaining to the bank that
they gave me the money as a gift and

1124
01:11:48,061 --> 01:11:50,640
I'm not sure if that will work because
I don't know if they will check my

1125
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:54,210
parents bank rescue records to confirm
that the whole policy is bullshit.

1126
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:59,370
I understand that the bank's fucked up
and had to foreclose on a lot of people

1127
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:02,160
and they want to make sure that I'm
not paying for a house with drug money,

1128
01:12:02,161 --> 01:12:02,910
but come on.

1129
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:06,540
This essentially means that if I'm walking
down the street and find $20,000 in

1130
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:09,930
cash in an alley, take it and
try to use it as a down payment.

1131
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,260
The banks won't let me because
there's no record of how I got it.

1132
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:17,460
This whole ordeal really pisses me off
and I'm pretty sure it goes back to what

1133
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:22,380
you trying to say about how the government
is trying to phase out cash money. Uh,

1134
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:24,060
no, that doesn't, that's,

1135
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:29,370
that's one of those double standard
things that they do where you have to

1136
01:12:29,371 --> 01:12:34,260
produce all this paper trail stuff just
to show that you're not a piece of shit.

1137
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,000
But they, on the other hand, the
Federal Reserve I'm talking about, um,

1138
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:44,540
they've never been audited and we gave
them $1 trillion bail out money and it

1139
01:12:45,271 --> 01:12:46,830
just disappeared into thin air.

1140
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:50,610
They can't say who got it or where it
went and they're not being audited.

1141
01:12:50,611 --> 01:12:52,680
But you on the other hand,
you know,

1142
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:56,700
you sell an old skateboard and your
original fucking place station,

1143
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:00,660
you win some money down the street and
in poker, you know, a poker tournament,

1144
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:04,590
none of that Shit. You know, you're
supposed to pay taxes on all of that shit.

1145
01:13:04,591 --> 01:13:08,550
And if you found 20 grand coming down
the street, what you're supposed to do,

1146
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:12,600
you're supposed to report it, bring
it down to the police station. Okay.

1147
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:14,790
And hope that those fucking
guys don't dip into it.

1148
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:19,170
And I guess after a certain amount of
days, uh, it legally becomes yours,

1149
01:13:19,171 --> 01:13:23,190
but then you have to pay taxes on
it and all that bit. All that shit.

1150
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:24,480
And all after the fees,

1151
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,760
you're probably left with
anywhere from eight to 10 grand.

1152
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,790
That's how your legally supposed to do it.

1153
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:34,850
And what's annoying to me
is that you and I are up.

1154
01:13:35,230 --> 01:13:40,140
We're held to those legal fucking
standards, but banks are not.

1155
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:45,960
Banks are supposed to be watching
our money, keeping it safe. And they,

1156
01:13:45,961 --> 01:13:46,651
for basically,

1157
01:13:46,651 --> 01:13:49,980
I don't know how many goddamn years
we're loaning it out to fucking homeless

1158
01:13:49,981 --> 01:13:53,790
people, given six figure loans
to them. And Lo and behold,

1159
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:57,900
when these fucking people defaulted on
their goddamn loans and the whole thing

1160
01:13:57,901 --> 01:14:02,400
went into the shitter, the government
fucking bails them out. They're like,

1161
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:04,860
we're too big to fail.
They fucking bail them out.

1162
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:08,880
They keep the bail out money and now
they added all these cunty surcharges to

1163
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:11,010
urine your account in my account.

1164
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:17,270
So yeah, that's, I dunno, this is what
you, this is what you do with your case.

1165
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:19,860
If you have cash on the side,
uh,

1166
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:23,440
use it for shit that you can
actually pay for in cash, I guess.

1167
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:27,640
I mean or save it in case
your bank ever goes, uh,

1168
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:30,640
goes belly up and there's
a run on your bank.

1169
01:14:30,641 --> 01:14:33,340
You won't be sitting there with your
pockets turned inside out going,

1170
01:14:33,341 --> 01:14:38,050
can I at least have some yogurt?
But yeah, it is practically.

1171
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:41,140
Um,
the more you read about banking,

1172
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:46,090
you'll start to understand
why corporations and,

1173
01:14:46,091 --> 01:14:49,360
and, and, or super rich like
you know, the entrepreneurs,

1174
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:52,840
why these guys have offshore accounts
and all that type of shit because he's

1175
01:14:52,841 --> 01:14:57,160
guys basically I think read up on banking,
which you would have,

1176
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:01,390
do you read up on the tax laws and
you see how the whole game is played.

1177
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:06,160
You see who gets penalized and who
doesn't and you start thinking Jesus is

1178
01:15:06,161 --> 01:15:08,710
fucking ridiculous.
So let me get this straight.

1179
01:15:08,711 --> 01:15:12,600
When I get to this level of
wealth, all of a sudden, um,

1180
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:16,810
rules don't apply to me.
Okay,

1181
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,690
well let me work my ass off
to get to that level. Oh wait,

1182
01:15:19,691 --> 01:15:23,980
I can't cause they keep taxing the shit
out of me. Oh, I get it. I got to do some,

1183
01:15:23,981 --> 01:15:26,860
there will be blood shit. I
mean, I'm really overly simple.

1184
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:31,510
Simplifying the whole fucking thing.
But that's basically how it goes down.

1185
01:15:31,511 --> 01:15:35,830
I mean, that bank is not going to
take that risk on you. You know,

1186
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:38,620
I got some cash on the side
that's actually good banking.

1187
01:15:38,621 --> 01:15:41,800
You can't have somebody just come
in and be like, uh, a listen,

1188
01:15:41,801 --> 01:15:44,140
I got to be really stereotypical.
Now I'm going to be Italian.

1189
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:48,400
I'd already shit on fucking southerners.
Why not do an Italian stereotype?

1190
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:49,980
A I got,
I got a,

1191
01:15:49,981 --> 01:15:53,740
I got good credit and I got did say
I got this 50 grand in this side.

1192
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,990
Where did I get it? A why don't you let
me worry about that. All right. You know,

1193
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:01,320
I, I, you know,

1194
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:05,710
somebody else actually sent me something,
uh,

1195
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:10,180
about banks here.
Hang on one second.

1196
01:16:10,181 --> 01:16:15,181
Let me read this and annoying more
people actually majored in economics or

1197
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:20,200
economics. However the fuck
you say it. Uh, here we go.

1198
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:22,150
Here we go.
Let me read up on this shit here.

1199
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:25,630
You guys get on board with this shit.
Well, I don't give a fuck. All right.

1200
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:29,230
I do give a fuck, but I didn't
care. I wouldn't be asking,

1201
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:30,940
but I'm going to continue.
Hey Bill,

1202
01:16:30,941 --> 01:16:35,050
I've been thinking some about something
you said about taxes on your podcast.

1203
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,030
It was about you trying to build,

1204
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:41,020
build up a pile of cash and how the
government governments hitting you up for

1205
01:16:41,021 --> 01:16:43,270
tax money at every opportunity.
Yeah, that's my thing.

1206
01:16:43,271 --> 01:16:46,000
I'm trying not to put
money in the stock market.

1207
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:49,480
I'm just trying to stick it in the bank
or whatever and they just tax the living

1208
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:53,860
shit out of me. But if I stick
it on the crap table, right,

1209
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:58,300
which the fucking stock market is,
if I throw it in there,

1210
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:02,590
then they have no problem with it, then
all of a sudden they give me a tax break.

1211
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:06,400
Hey, get over here and
play the fucking game. Oh.

1212
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:11,630
Um, so anyways, uh, that's
anyway, let me get back to this.

1213
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:16,910
Uh, they hit you up for tax
money for every opportunity,

1214
01:17:16,911 --> 01:17:20,810
but that there are rich folks out
there who've already got there,

1215
01:17:20,811 --> 01:17:24,980
so they don't want to get, they don't
want anyone to get rich after them.

1216
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:28,160
There really is something to
that. Yeah, they got, they got,

1217
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:30,320
they have to keep you did,

1218
01:17:30,321 --> 01:17:34,340
they can't have people making fucking
money and actually being able to keep it

1219
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:38,030
because if they do,
then nobody would work.

1220
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,560
We would just fucking kick back and relax
and maybe you have a chance to enjoy

1221
01:17:42,561 --> 01:17:43,394
ourselves.

1222
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:47,870
Maybe sit by his stream in the Lotus
position or whatever the fuck it is you

1223
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:52,670
want to do. They want you to run on the
wheel until you're fucking drooling.

1224
01:17:52,671 --> 01:17:57,140
And then they want whoever you created
to then take care of you in a nursing

1225
01:17:57,141 --> 01:18:01,340
home. And then if you can't,
they just want you to die. Um,

1226
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:06,740
I tweet somebody. Okay, I tweaked, I
twigged I didn't know what that means.

1227
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:07,790
I twigged onto this.

1228
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:11,630
About a year ago when I was having a
discussion with a friend about progressive

1229
01:18:11,631 --> 01:18:12,500
income tax,

1230
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:17,030
he seemed to think that it takes from
the rich to give to the poor and the

1231
01:18:17,031 --> 01:18:20,270
progressive income taxes.
Anticapitalist it's not though,

1232
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:23,060
because I don't even know what
the fuck any of this means here.

1233
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:28,270
Because earned income tax are always
higher than rates on dividends and capital

1234
01:18:28,281 --> 01:18:30,400
gains income. Let me, I get it.

1235
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:34,610
I could read that much slower because
earned income tax rates are higher than

1236
01:18:34,611 --> 01:18:37,670
rates on dividends and
capital gains income. Okay.

1237
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:41,390
So basically money that you
already have that's being invested,

1238
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:45,590
the tax rate is lower than someone who
out there earning the nonworking air or

1239
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:50,030
era's who survives on dividends and
capital gains from a family fortune like a

1240
01:18:50,031 --> 01:18:51,950
Paris Hilton.
Uh,

1241
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:56,720
their income tax is at a much lower
percentage than a working person with an

1242
01:18:56,721 --> 01:19:00,470
equivalent income. So basically if
you're sitting around in your ass,

1243
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:04,820
you're some fucking luck. Lucky
rich kid, the money that you're,

1244
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:09,030
that you basically inherited
that you are earning off of,

1245
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:12,650
there will be blood great
grandfather that you had.

1246
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:17,740
The tax rate will be lesser for the Paris
Hilton Kid than someone like me if I

1247
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:23,120
could earn, if I was earning that same
amount of money. Does that make sense?

1248
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:27,380
Make sense to me? Um, I hope I explained
that in a way you understand it.

1249
01:19:27,381 --> 01:19:30,890
All right. The system punishes,
uh, work and reward rewards,

1250
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:35,090
ownership with tax rates that provide
incentives for one kind of economic

1251
01:19:35,091 --> 01:19:36,620
activity over another.

1252
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:40,760
I based this on my
experience with my Canadian.

1253
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,870
This guy broke up with my, the Canadian
system. And before I emailed you,

1254
01:19:44,871 --> 01:19:49,871
I had to use Wikipedia confirmed to
confirm that the u s system works pretty

1255
01:19:50,061 --> 01:19:54,560
much the same way. And right there, this
entire email gets thrown out the window.

1256
01:19:54,561 --> 01:19:58,160
Wikipedia, sir, what are you fucking me?

1257
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:01,190
Maybe it does make sense on the podcast.

1258
01:20:01,191 --> 01:20:03,260
Let's go with this Wikipedia information.

1259
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:09,660
The worst part of it is that by
work is less valuable than capitol.

1260
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:14,010
The woman making $8 an hour at Walmart
is paying the same percentage of income

1261
01:20:14,011 --> 01:20:17,490
tax as the Walmart airs pay
on their dividends. Dividends.

1262
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:21,480
A medical doctor, however,
pays more than twice as much,

1263
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,480
and the doctor is patching
up the sick and wounded.

1264
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,150
The incentives in the
systems are all wrong.

1265
01:20:27,151 --> 01:20:30,340
So you basically say
saying the borderline, uh,

1266
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,690
poverty person and the rich people are
paying the same amount of taxes in the

1267
01:20:33,691 --> 01:20:37,800
guys in the middle. Me Or getting
the shit text out of them. Yes,

1268
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:42,270
exactly.
Exactly.

1269
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:48,480
That is my fucking life. God dammit.
I have to hit pause here. People, I,

1270
01:20:48,481 --> 01:20:51,420
I gotta I gotta blow my nose.
Hang on a second.

1271
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:56,850
All right, I'm back. Sorry about
that. You don't what happened to me?

1272
01:20:56,851 --> 01:21:01,851
I was eating a bowl of wheat
checks too fast and uh,

1273
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:07,410
I didn't chew up the wheat checks enough.
So they went down,

1274
01:21:07,411 --> 01:21:10,380
it was like swallowing,
chewing tobacco and it got sorta like,

1275
01:21:10,381 --> 01:21:14,010
there was just like a bunch of like, you
know, it was in the back of my throat.

1276
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:18,840
So I was like, what did that? And it,
it, some of it went up into my nose,

1277
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:23,500
so it was actually rechecks
one,

1278
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:27,260
I'm having a rough Monday. You never
started your weed off your wheat,

1279
01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:29,910
your week off with some
wheat checks in your nose.

1280
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:34,770
We checks a healthy part of the
checks family. Let me tell you guys,

1281
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:39,330
I'm a big fan of the, uh, check cereals.
I like, we checks, I like corn checks.

1282
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:43,110
I don't like rice checks.
You know what I mean?

1283
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,050
It's like a fucking bad movie.
It's just weak.

1284
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:52,650
It's just a week cereal. You know, I
don't like those cereals that are like,

1285
01:21:52,651 --> 01:21:56,370
oh my God, milk. That's what,
that's what rice checks does.

1286
01:21:56,371 --> 01:22:00,630
It just fucking shit quits. It's
acquitting cereal. You know,

1287
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:06,120
corn checks has some fighting them.
Quick checks it like the jets.

1288
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:09,450
We checks. I like the Patriots. We
checks their course the strongest.

1289
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:15,240
Ah, you green mother fuckers you
lost this week. I don't like debt.

1290
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,580
Nine to nothing.

1291
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,620
I love the overpaid for your fucking
tickets and you're brand new.

1292
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:23,270
Fucking sublet an apartment
with the that the giants own.

1293
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:27,330
You know what?
They roll out a little bit of jet signage.

1294
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:29,880
Do you really think that
you own 50% of that?

1295
01:22:29,881 --> 01:22:31,740
Do you really think that
you sons of bitches.

1296
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,500
What was it like to go to
that boring ass fucking game?

1297
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:39,570
Kick three nothing.
J E t s.

1298
01:22:39,571 --> 01:22:40,860
What the fuck?

1299
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:46,500
Now the couple of fucking hours of
boring football kick six nothing.

1300
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:50,700
J e t is what a fuck.
All right,

1301
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:54,960
kick nine nothing.
Go home.

1302
01:22:55,740 --> 01:23:00,150
Did the fireman cry this
week? Oh, I love it.

1303
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:04,860
Overrated talking shit before
the season even starts.

1304
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:08,870
Like you just won three super
bowls in a row. [inaudible]

1305
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:11,950
underrated,
having your stomach stapled.

1306
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:15,010
Rex Ryan is getting better
looking every fucking week.

1307
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:20,650
Son of a bitch kind of has a
jaw line now, doesn't he? Um,

1308
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:25,870
all right. Just to be fair, um, I've
got to make fun of Celtics fans. Uh,

1309
01:23:25,871 --> 01:23:28,900
overrated.
Channing overrated.

1310
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:32,830
When you're up by 11 with eight
minutes left against the Miami Heat.

1311
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:34,030
Did you guys watch that game?

1312
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:40,000
Then all of a sudden they all stay started
roaring back and all the felt Celtics

1313
01:23:40,001 --> 01:23:44,470
fans just shut the fuck up.
And then once the game was,

1314
01:23:44,471 --> 01:23:48,340
was decided with 12 seconds left,
they started chanting overrated again.

1315
01:23:48,341 --> 01:23:52,990
That was a real fucking bitchy mood. That
was real bitchy. Yeah. That I, I didn't,

1316
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:56,350
I didn't, I was embarrassed to be
associated with that franchise. All right.

1317
01:23:57,340 --> 01:24:02,320
Who's the moron? Who's to
started that chat? Um, all right.

1318
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:07,420
That was, if that was, it was just a quick
little riff of underrated, overrated,

1319
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:10,991
underrated.

1320
01:24:10,991 --> 01:24:15,430
Having your own fucking jet airplane
with a big bed in the back in a giant

1321
01:24:15,431 --> 01:24:17,380
seatbelt,
you know?

1322
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:23,710
Beautiful woman to sit on your Dick
in a fucking ivy to put you to sleep.

1323
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:28,240
You just wake up in New York. That's
all I want. That's all I want. You know,

1324
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:30,790
that's all I want out of this business.
I don't eat, I don't need much.

1325
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,960
I got to fly to New York people.
I'm going to New York on a Tuesday night,

1326
01:24:34,961 --> 01:24:38,080
take the red eye back to that motherfucker
and I'm doing a benefit for the

1327
01:24:38,081 --> 01:24:42,800
troops play in the beacon theater with a,

1328
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:43,920
believe it or not,
this is,

1329
01:24:43,921 --> 01:24:48,160
this is the lineup on this show and
it's going to be been to three different

1330
01:24:48,161 --> 01:24:51,430
bases in Iraq in three
different bases in Afghanistan.

1331
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:53,733
Jon Stewart is hosting.

1332
01:24:56,350 --> 01:25:00,740
Tony Bennett is a, I'm
assuming he's singing. I don't
think he's doing stand up.

1333
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:06,220
Uh, Jerry Seinfeld, Bruce Springsteen,

1334
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:12,100
Joe, Mikael, myself,

1335
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:16,810
and I think a couple of other people.
All I'm doing is eight minutes,

1336
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:22,090
but uh, I can't wait man. It's going
to be a, well, I don't want to,

1337
01:25:22,091 --> 01:25:24,130
I don't want to do the flight,
but it's going to be fucking awesome.

1338
01:25:24,131 --> 01:25:25,420
That's Wednesday.
I'm flying out.

1339
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:28,780
That's why I'm telling you I've got all
this shit to do today because I got to,

1340
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:33,160
uh, you know, I just
landed here last night.

1341
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:35,830
I got to do the fucking podcast.
I have an audition today.

1342
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:40,750
I'm pitching a fucking show today.
I got to, uh, pay my fucking bills.

1343
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:43,660
It's the first of the month.
I got to do all that fucking horse shit.

1344
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:47,200
And then I got to jump right back
on a plane tomorrow. You know,

1345
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:50,440
it's one of those fucking weeks.
Speaking of that dude,

1346
01:25:50,441 --> 01:25:53,710
I flew out to Saint Louis last week and
there was some woman who was clearing

1347
01:25:53,711 --> 01:25:54,544
her throat

1348
01:25:55,870 --> 01:26:00,870
like twice a minute from like I would
guess about Utah to Jess into Kansas.

1349
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:06,653
[inaudible]

1350
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:15,800
you had this exact same way of doing it.
I swear to God,

1351
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,330
I have never prayed for my
own plane to crash before.

1352
01:26:20,331 --> 01:26:23,510
But that was one of those moments.
I didn't want it to crash. You know,

1353
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:28,511
I was just fantasizing that like there
was a crack in the fuselage and no,

1354
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:34,610
and she, that woman just got sucked
out. So as I was fantasizing about,

1355
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:36,150
this is how fucking crazy I took it.

1356
01:26:36,151 --> 01:26:41,151
I actually reached down and I tightened
my seatbelt and I mentally went over how

1357
01:26:42,111 --> 01:26:47,111
to put that fucking mask on my face
before I help the infant or child next to

1358
01:26:48,261 --> 01:26:53,030
me. I saw it, you know,

1359
01:26:53,031 --> 01:26:56,660
it was really disgusting the
way she was clearing it, throat.

1360
01:26:56,810 --> 01:26:59,990
She was talking really
loud on her cell phone.

1361
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:04,490
Just everything about it was annoying.
And whenever I see a person like that,

1362
01:27:04,491 --> 01:27:08,750
the first thing I do is I look
for a wedding ring. You know, I,

1363
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:12,260
when I don't see one, I th I
think thank God. And when I,

1364
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,420
when I do see [inaudible],

1365
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:18,950
I actually feel bad for the man or
woman that is married to that, you know,

1366
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:21,170
how could it just like,

1367
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,580
and actually I came up with
like a philosophical question.

1368
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:27,860
You know that those
dull Sechi commercials,

1369
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:31,430
the most interesting man in
the world, what do you think
would happen? Here's the,

1370
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:34,250
here's, here's one for the, uh, the
pot smokers out there. All right.

1371
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:39,050
What do you think would happen if the
most interesting man in the world met the

1372
01:27:39,051 --> 01:27:43,550
most annoying woman on the planet?
All right. I want you to know,

1373
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,300
I want you to tell me what you think
would happen because I couldn't come up

1374
01:27:47,301 --> 01:27:49,820
with an answer to that question.
You know,

1375
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:53,180
he is the most interesting
man in the world. Well,

1376
01:27:53,181 --> 01:27:57,140
I would like you to meet this contour
is sitting diagonally fucking behind me.

1377
01:27:58,730 --> 01:27:58,731
I'll,

1378
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:03,731
speaking of that underrated fucking
movie macgruber does anybody rented that?

1379
01:28:04,431 --> 01:28:06,890
I don't know if you'd be happy if
you paid to go see it at a theater,

1380
01:28:06,891 --> 01:28:11,390
but fucking, you know, unless you
have a silly sense of humor like me,

1381
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:13,400
because I would enjoy that
if I saw it in the theater.

1382
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:15,950
Look at me even when I try to compliment
something I say in a dick way.

1383
01:28:15,951 --> 01:28:19,520
I think this is a funny fucking movie,
uh,

1384
01:28:19,521 --> 01:28:22,130
with a couple of really
insane monologues in it.

1385
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:28,010
And uh, not to ruin anything.
Spoiler alert, spoiler alert.

1386
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:31,550
I had to bring this up.
The last name of the,

1387
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:34,790
the bad guy in the movie is cunt.

1388
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:44,390
And I'm assuming it's spelt with a k, k u
n t, Z or something. But it's, you know,

1389
01:28:44,391 --> 01:28:49,160
we got, we have to get current. I Dunno.
It's soft mark. It's fucking hilarious.

1390
01:28:49,161 --> 01:28:51,710
It's one of those movies you want to
watch with the female in the room cause

1391
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:56,690
she'd just be killing. This is stupid. You
know, you think this is funny. Oh my God,

1392
01:28:56,691 --> 01:28:59,450
that's grouse. Which will just
make it so much more funnier.

1393
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:04,560
Macgruber two thumbs up from me baby.
All right,

1394
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:07,430
this podcast is all over the place.
Let's move onto the next one.

1395
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:12,330
I the advice section, why you would
ask me for advice. I don't know. Okay,

1396
01:29:12,331 --> 01:29:12,841
here we go.

1397
01:29:12,841 --> 01:29:17,430
I started listening to your podcasts about
three months ago and I really like it.

1398
01:29:17,431 --> 01:29:21,090
Thank you. I was inspired by a couple
of your albums on iTunes. Thank you.

1399
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:25,260
Now if you ever hear me bitching
about people fucking download shit,

1400
01:29:25,261 --> 01:29:30,240
I'm not talking about you or be in
cheap cons. It's not you, uh, bup,

1401
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:35,220
bup, bup, bup. I love
your comedy my whole life.

1402
01:29:35,221 --> 01:29:39,990
And recently I sacked up in one on
stage for a five minute spot for an open

1403
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:43,920
night open mic night at a local comedy
club here in Portland, Portland.

1404
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:47,250
I was really impressed by
the people that showed up.

1405
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:50,100
Many of them were talentless Dick Holes,

1406
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:54,510
but at least they have the guts to get
on stage and for that they deserve some

1407
01:29:54,511 --> 01:29:56,340
credit. Well, thank you sir.

1408
01:29:57,060 --> 01:30:01,440
Thank you for fucking extending
that olive branch to them.

1409
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:06,360
Um, so I got up there in
front of a whopping 15 people,

1410
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:08,940
one of which who was my girlfriend
and talk some shit. It was,

1411
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:12,780
I was pretty nervous, but my voice
was steady and I was energetic.

1412
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:17,070
But most importantly I got
people laughing. There you
go. That's all you gotta do.

1413
01:30:17,071 --> 01:30:20,640
It might not seem like much,
but a I had a high like no other,

1414
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:24,660
I might stick with it.
Basically I write down a few prompts.

1415
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:28,980
Now this isn't me people. I swear
to God, I know I suck at reading,

1416
01:30:28,981 --> 01:30:31,920
but just the way these, some of this
shit is written, I'm going to read this.

1417
01:30:31,921 --> 01:30:35,520
Basically the way this guy wrote it,
or actually exactly the way he wrote it.

1418
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:36,540
I might stick with it.

1419
01:30:36,541 --> 01:30:41,541
Basically I write down a few prompts out
for stories and quips and go to town.

1420
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:45,660
I feel like open Mike Nights might
be the only way to get some chops.

1421
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:50,900
Doing my bits for friends or two into a
mirror doesn't have the same effect as a

1422
01:30:53,311 --> 01:30:56,700
bunch of strangers. I'm gearing up
to put some hard work into my act.

1423
01:30:56,970 --> 01:31:00,450
I would like any tips on how you get
you got your chops and how you practice

1424
01:31:00,451 --> 01:31:03,270
your wrecked all right.
Couple of things. Yeah. Yeah.

1425
01:31:03,271 --> 01:31:05,910
You can't run it by your friends
to do it in the mirror. Um,

1426
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:09,690
he could maybe say it a few times in the
way of the club just so you can kind of

1427
01:31:09,691 --> 01:31:14,100
get the flow of it. Uh, but yeah, the
only way to do it is to do open mics. So,

1428
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:19,230
uh, you know, I would
do that, just do that.

1429
01:31:19,231 --> 01:31:22,470
And I would also drop the attitude
that people who are starting out are

1430
01:31:22,471 --> 01:31:26,430
talentless Dickholtz than not.
They're fucking, you know,

1431
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,140
if you saw me when I started out,

1432
01:31:28,141 --> 01:31:32,610
you would have thought that this guy
sucks because I did suck because I was

1433
01:31:32,611 --> 01:31:36,060
brand new at it. So you don't want
to do that. And for all you know,

1434
01:31:36,061 --> 01:31:40,380
the those air quote talent was Dick Holes
will some day be in a position in this

1435
01:31:40,381 --> 01:31:43,500
fucking business where they could
actually hook you up with something.

1436
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:48,650
So I cannot stress how important it is
to have good relationships with fellow

1437
01:31:50,341 --> 01:31:54,330
comedians and everybody in this
fucking business that you can.

1438
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:57,170
I'm not saying that you take it
to the point that you will acts,

1439
01:31:57,370 --> 01:32:00,610
you actually allow somebody to walk
all over you and treat you like shit.

1440
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:03,280
I'm not saying that,
but don't walk around judging people.

1441
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:08,480
That a fucking thing cut out on me again.
God dammit. I'm sorry. I've been to,

1442
01:32:08,490 --> 01:32:11,800
I'm putting together a new hour comedy
and I have a bunch of standup sets on my

1443
01:32:11,801 --> 01:32:15,430
fucking recorder that I
never ended up listening to.

1444
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:17,230
Something else,
sir,

1445
01:32:17,231 --> 01:32:20,230
that you might want to do if you're
doing stand up is to record yourself and

1446
01:32:20,231 --> 01:32:22,660
listen to yourself.
So you can become better as a comedian,

1447
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:25,810
but the key is you gotta listen to them.

1448
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:31,120
Anybody can record them and then just
leave them on their fucking tape player or

1449
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:34,360
they're fucking digital recorder, whatever
the hell you call this God damn thing.

1450
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:39,160
Um, yeah, that's what I would, I
would tell you that man, seriously,

1451
01:32:39,161 --> 01:32:42,040
like you will be absolutely
fucking amazed with,

1452
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:45,490
with the people that you think are
going to do something and don't,

1453
01:32:45,491 --> 01:32:47,860
and the people who you're like,
ah, that person, I don't know.

1454
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:49,120
I don't think they're going to do shit.

1455
01:32:49,121 --> 01:32:51,550
And all of a sudden
they're directing a movie.

1456
01:32:52,210 --> 01:32:56,650
They're the head writer on
something. They create a show. Uh,

1457
01:32:56,710 --> 01:33:01,480
who knows what, you don't know
what anybody's going to do. So,

1458
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:05,530
uh, yeah. You know, so I
wouldn't walk around. I mean,

1459
01:33:05,531 --> 01:33:07,780
I'm sure you're just right in that,
maybe to make me laugh or something,

1460
01:33:07,781 --> 01:33:11,030
but I'm just putting that out there.
All right.

1461
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:16,140
Because I've seen people act like cunts
and then get treated accordingly by

1462
01:33:17,561 --> 01:33:22,180
these people that they thought
were beneath them or whatever.

1463
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:25,240
It's just the worst fucking
thing that you can do in any,

1464
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:30,880
any in life in general, treating someone
else like a like shit or whatever.

1465
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:33,310
I don't know.
I don't understand why people,

1466
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:37,080
it really makes your life a
lot more difficult. And uh,

1467
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:40,840
some day when you die,
you know,

1468
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:45,100
like there's going to be the only people,

1469
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:50,020
only people at your funeral is going to
be a, you know, the, the fucking two guy,

1470
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:52,450
the guy who drives the truck
and the guy who digs the hole

1471
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:58,720
or the hearse I should say.
Um, yeah. So that's, that's
the advice I would give you.

1472
01:33:58,721 --> 01:34:02,140
Keep doing the open mics.
Um, it keep writing stuff,

1473
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:06,250
tape record yourself and
uh, you know, and then,

1474
01:34:06,251 --> 01:34:09,010
and then be a good guy, be a
good guy, but then, you know,

1475
01:34:09,011 --> 01:34:13,710
be a good guy within reason. I
mean, like I said, don't, don't it,

1476
01:34:13,711 --> 01:34:17,980
don't take shit from people and then
also try to try to be hanging with the

1477
01:34:17,981 --> 01:34:20,830
people who seem the most motivated,
most positive,

1478
01:34:20,831 --> 01:34:25,090
that type of shit because you'll get
caught up in it and a, and Yada, Yada,

1479
01:34:25,091 --> 01:34:27,910
fucking Yada. That's basically
it. So we're coming to the close,

1480
01:34:27,911 --> 01:34:31,690
here are the podcasts and other kind of
short one this week just because, uh,

1481
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:35,290
I do have so much shit to do here.
Um,

1482
01:34:35,310 --> 01:34:40,310
congratulations to the rangers in the
giants for your first world series.

1483
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:42,670
A giants are up three games to one.

1484
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:46,910
And I was getting nervous for
giant fans. I actually, uh,

1485
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:49,750
I don't mind ranger or the giants.
I have no problem with either one of them,

1486
01:34:49,751 --> 01:34:53,500
but I was getting nervous for the giant
fans when they were up two games to none.

1487
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:57,230
And then the rangers came back and won
one game and I was like, yeah, God.

1488
01:34:57,910 --> 01:35:01,670
And a lot of ways the giants are
kind of like how the red sox were,

1489
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:03,800
except they're in the national league.

1490
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:06,320
You know how the Red Sox were
back in the day where it was,

1491
01:35:06,321 --> 01:35:10,160
not only do they not win, they have
to rip your fucking heart out too.

1492
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:13,910
And uh,
I don't know.

1493
01:35:13,911 --> 01:35:16,100
At the risk of pissing off ranger fans.

1494
01:35:16,101 --> 01:35:19,040
I think the giant fans
that I think they've had,

1495
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:20,840
I think they've had about enough.

1496
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:24,170
I think it's time for the sports
gods to let him up off the mat.

1497
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:29,260
Give him a God damn world series and
range of fans. Who are you kidding?

1498
01:35:30,430 --> 01:35:34,880
Who are you? Honestly fucking kidding.
You know, you're all cowboy fans.

1499
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:35,691
You know,

1500
01:35:35,691 --> 01:35:40,610
if the cowboys record was flipped right
now and Tony Romo was living up to the

1501
01:35:40,611 --> 01:35:43,330
potential, you know, you know,

1502
01:35:43,331 --> 01:35:46,470
you wouldn't be selling out
those world series games. Yeah.

1503
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:50,660
Now I'm going to fuck you. I'd like
to arrange your sense fucking, uh,

1504
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:55,470
who was that? Who is that fucking,
yeah. Who was that Guy Buddy?

1505
01:35:55,471 --> 01:36:00,080
Something or buddy bell that come here.
Jackass who played third base.

1506
01:36:00,810 --> 01:36:04,210
Yeah. Um, he's not a jackass.
It just sounded funny.

1507
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,220
I'm trying to think of guys who played
for the Rangers when I was growing up.

1508
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:12,463
What the fuck was it?

1509
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:18,100
Somebody wrote something funny on the
Internet about how 10 years ago when the

1510
01:36:18,101 --> 01:36:22,190
Rangers signed a Rod, two,
a $200 million contract,

1511
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:28,000
he vowed to one day lead them to the world
series and when he struck out looking

1512
01:36:28,690 --> 01:36:33,670
on the New York Yankees, he finally
delivered on that promise. Oh,

1513
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:38,740
Bill, you're such a content. I know.
I am. Yeah, I am a content. Um,

1514
01:36:38,890 --> 01:36:43,470
I actually watched the Patriots game
and this, uh, the sports bar, uh,

1515
01:36:44,210 --> 01:36:49,210
in Saint Louis and there was his fucking
old guy in there who was basically,

1516
01:36:49,591 --> 01:36:53,010
he had like,
like nine sports buttons on his shirt.

1517
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:58,100
He had this little glow stick with
them and he's one of those guys when he

1518
01:36:58,110 --> 01:37:00,090
yelled,
but it still wasn't loud.

1519
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:05,750
It just kept going. Whoa. The Patriots,
uh, where the Cheetahs, but we always word

1520
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:07,730
whoa.

1521
01:37:07,730 --> 01:37:11,820
And everybody was ignoring them and
anything the Patriots did was awesome.

1522
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:14,820
Like this guy fucking
shanks, this punk, right,

1523
01:37:15,230 --> 01:37:17,360
right up the side of his
foot for the patriot. The,

1524
01:37:17,361 --> 01:37:20,300
as the ball is dropping to his foot,
the guys go on.

1525
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:22,370
Oh,
what a kick.

1526
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:26,980
Whoa. He's pissing off
everybody in the sports bar,

1527
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:29,470
but he's too fucking old
to punch in the face.

1528
01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:34,700
But this is what killed me about
this guy was the people around me.

1529
01:37:34,701 --> 01:37:38,510
Golly, he fucking comes here every
week. He's unbelievably annoying.

1530
01:37:38,511 --> 01:37:42,770
And the worst thing is, is he has, he's
fans of like six different football teams.

1531
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:46,800
Like he's a fan of the Patriots,
the bills and the dolphins.

1532
01:37:46,801 --> 01:37:51,240
They're all in the same fucking division.
And he's a fan of the Kansas City, uh,

1533
01:37:51,850 --> 01:37:55,560
chiefs. So the bills played
the chiefs, so no, what?

1534
01:37:55,561 --> 01:37:59,670
He cannot lose any, just sits
there the whole game. Oh,

1535
01:37:59,671 --> 01:38:02,610
what a throw. Oh, what an interception.

1536
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:06,120
Like he just wants to win the entire
fucking time. Long story short,

1537
01:38:06,121 --> 01:38:10,200
I had to take a picture with the
guy because he started off cute.

1538
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:14,550
You know what a cute old man. And
then at one point, um, if I was,

1539
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:15,751
if I was drinking,

1540
01:38:15,751 --> 01:38:19,530
I would have engaged with this dude at
during the second quarter and been like,

1541
01:38:19,531 --> 01:38:23,190
hey, how the fuck can you be fans
of every fucking team? You old cunt.

1542
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:25,170
I would've done that.
But fortunately I'm not drinking.

1543
01:38:25,171 --> 01:38:29,280
So it took me until the fourth quarter
where I started to give him shit.

1544
01:38:29,281 --> 01:38:30,960
But then in the back of my
head I was like, really, Bill,

1545
01:38:30,961 --> 01:38:34,230
are you really going to get
into it with this old guy? Um,

1546
01:38:35,370 --> 01:38:37,420
but by the end of it, he was
just kind of hilarious. Swag.

1547
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,640
She took a picture with the guy and I'm
going to have that uploaded onto the Mlm

1548
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:43,800
, podcast.com. And uh, what else do I got?

1549
01:38:43,950 --> 01:38:48,140
I got a hype a few gigs here before I,
before I sign off from this pod,

1550
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:52,170
this podcast was an absolute clusterfuck.
I apologize. I had high hopes for it,

1551
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:57,510
but uh, you know, like a lot of things
in life, it just doesn't work out. Um,

1552
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:01,560
all right, what do we got here? All right.

1553
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:03,270
I'm going to be at the
funny bone in Columbus.

1554
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:07,200
This is really one of these podcasts
that I would've stopped and restarted 10

1555
01:39:07,201 --> 01:39:10,350
minutes into it, but I just don't have
the fucking time. All Right, Bill,

1556
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:14,370
we've heard your excuses. You have to mop
your kitchen floor. Nobody gives a fuck.

1557
01:39:14,710 --> 01:39:18,960
All right. I'm going to be at the, uh,
the funny bone in Columbus, Ohio. Friday,

1558
01:39:18,961 --> 01:39:22,170
Saturday, Sunday, November
12th, 13th, and 14th,

1559
01:39:22,171 --> 01:39:25,980
and I'm going to try to go to that Ohio
state, Penn state game. That's my big, uh,

1560
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:29,340
I don't want to be bored shitless
at the mall and Columbus move.

1561
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:30,990
Then I'm going to be making,
uh,

1562
01:39:30,991 --> 01:39:35,550
the following week I will be in
Washington DC at the listener auditorium.

1563
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:40,140
And that's on a Friday,
November 19th. On November 20th,

1564
01:39:40,141 --> 01:39:42,810
I'll be at comics at Fox
woods in Connecticut.

1565
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:46,350
I get a lot of emails from people
from Connecticut being like,

1566
01:39:46,351 --> 01:39:47,910
do when he come into fucking Connecticut.

1567
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:52,560
I'm going to be there to
beautiful new room. Uh,
everybody's been raving about it.

1568
01:39:52,561 --> 01:39:54,030
All the comedians who
have performed there.

1569
01:39:54,031 --> 01:39:57,390
So come on down and check out my new hour.
And then finally,

1570
01:39:58,650 --> 01:40:03,530
this is the one I need you to help on.
Look into your hearts.

1571
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:07,800
I am playing the Moore Theater in Seattle,
Washington.

1572
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:11,490
All right. For those of you
unfamiliar with the Moore Theater,

1573
01:40:11,850 --> 01:40:16,500
it is a legendary theater
in, uh, Seattle, Washington.

1574
01:40:17,070 --> 01:40:20,700
Um, I guess what a rock fans, grunge fans.

1575
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:24,150
Remember that Pearl Jam Video,
I think it was even flow.

1576
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:30,060
We burn pro when a Eddie vetter is
climbing out into the crowd and fucking

1577
01:40:31,621 --> 01:40:34,680
jumping off the balcony and
stepping on people's heads and shit.

1578
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:39,600
That's where they filmed that. And I
have to sell a lot of fucking tickets.

1579
01:40:39,601 --> 01:40:42,000
I'm a third of the way there.
So if you,

1580
01:40:42,001 --> 01:40:45,000
and some of you are drunk buddies
want to come down for the love of God,

1581
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:50,310
please come down to the show because a,
I got a ton of tickets to sell and,

1582
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:54,050
and clear channel. I don't know what
they've done radio, but they've,

1583
01:40:54,051 --> 01:40:58,420
they've taken off, you know, my
guy up there was Marty Reemer,

1584
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:01,600
which I heard he has a podcast now,
if you live in Seattle,

1585
01:41:01,601 --> 01:41:03,700
fuck those radio stations
that took them off.

1586
01:41:03,701 --> 01:41:06,850
Listen to his podcast because hopefully
I'm going to be doing that to hype my

1587
01:41:06,851 --> 01:41:08,250
show.
Uh,

1588
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:11,230
I'm kind of running out of ways to hype
shows now with what they're doing to

1589
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:13,990
radio. For those of you
out of the loop, uh,

1590
01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:18,970
I think clear channel basically wants
to have for Djs for the entire country.

1591
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:22,450
And, uh, you walk into
these radio stations now,

1592
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:23,920
they don't even have a receptionist.

1593
01:41:23,921 --> 01:41:28,921
They have an automated system
for you to figure out how to uh,

1594
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:32,080
get to where you're going. I don't
know. It's you know, yet another thing,

1595
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,160
and I'm sure you people who are all for
these kinds of technologies like I love

1596
01:41:36,161 --> 01:41:38,770
when people like trying to support
those automated checkout lines.

1597
01:41:38,770 --> 01:41:40,510
Like they always say the same thing,
you know,

1598
01:41:40,690 --> 01:41:44,460
and you're standing there looking at this
poor bastard behind the fucking Reggie.

1599
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:48,100
You mean that person with the fucking
job you really want to see and be a poor

1600
01:41:48,101 --> 01:41:49,600
bastard.
What would you rather be?

1601
01:41:49,690 --> 01:41:54,370
A poor bastard behind a fucking a cash
register or a poor bastard you fucking

1602
01:41:54,371 --> 01:41:56,110
homeless and don't have a Goddamn job.

1603
01:41:56,920 --> 01:42:00,400
I hate when people do like dumb shit
like that just to try to enhance their

1604
01:42:00,401 --> 01:42:04,240
fucking point.
If you fucking believe in that technology,

1605
01:42:04,241 --> 01:42:06,310
support the technology,
don't start,

1606
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:09,970
start saying what the person behind the
fucking registers thicket even though

1607
01:42:09,971 --> 01:42:11,770
I'm doing the same goddamn thing.

1608
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:16,000
But I think I can go out on a limb and
say that most people would rather have a

1609
01:42:16,001 --> 01:42:19,640
fucking job than be homeless.
All right.

1610
01:42:20,170 --> 01:42:24,220
Lot of yelling this week, Bill, as
opposed to what every other quiet week.

1611
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:25,961
Um,

1612
01:42:25,961 --> 01:42:30,280
and then the final two gigs of this year
before I take my month off and I begin

1613
01:42:30,281 --> 01:42:33,730
my martial arts classes, joking. Um,

1614
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:38,380
I'm going to be at COBB's comedy club in
San Francisco. Uh, December 2nd, third,

1615
01:42:38,381 --> 01:42:39,550
fourth and fifth,

1616
01:42:40,390 --> 01:42:45,340
and I'm going to be at the Improv
in Bray, California, the 16th,

1617
01:42:45,341 --> 01:42:49,810
17th, 18th and 19th of
December. Uh, come on down.

1618
01:42:49,811 --> 01:42:54,710
This new hour is starting to take shape.
Actually had some guy come up to me, uh,

1619
01:42:54,711 --> 01:42:57,820
this weekend in St Louis and was like,
that was absolutely hilarious.

1620
01:42:57,821 --> 01:43:02,080
I didn't think it was as funny
as let it go, but I, I liked it.

1621
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:06,280
It's like, thank you sir. Well,
it's not done yet, you know.

1622
01:43:06,310 --> 01:43:09,760
Thank you for starting to compliment
me and then giving me a little Dick.

1623
01:43:11,230 --> 01:43:15,820
Hey, you look great. You're not
as fat as you used to be. Um,

1624
01:43:15,850 --> 01:43:20,350
all right. And this guy, hey, he really
had a pudgy face. They really did.

1625
01:43:20,351 --> 01:43:22,780
He had one of those. He was a
white dude, but he was like so fat.

1626
01:43:22,810 --> 01:43:25,420
He was starting to look Asian. You
know what I mean? When he gets so fat,

1627
01:43:25,570 --> 01:43:28,810
your eyes like that, uh,
that precious girl, you know,

1628
01:43:28,811 --> 01:43:31,990
you know when the fat just starts building
up on your cheeks, all of a sudden,

1629
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:35,890
you know,
that's how you start to look,

1630
01:43:37,810 --> 01:43:40,540
whether that be in an incredible way
to sell some fat burning products.

1631
01:43:41,410 --> 01:43:45,040
Are you so fat that you're starting
to look Asian in your eyes even though

1632
01:43:45,041 --> 01:43:47,230
you're not? Well, listen,

1633
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:54,710
that is offensive. Well, line up by
the Italians in the southern dish.

1634
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:57,110
That's what this podcast was this week.

1635
01:43:57,420 --> 01:44:00,290
I'm trying to get fired from
my own podcast. I'm trying to,

1636
01:44:00,291 --> 01:44:04,320
I want a lot of complaints and have
people say that I need to apologize.

1637
01:44:05,350 --> 01:44:05,550
Um,

1638
01:44:05,550 --> 01:44:09,000
two different groups of people so that
I could be fired from my podcast because

1639
01:44:09,001 --> 01:44:13,290
I think I need a fucking vacation
from the shit I really do. No,

1640
01:44:13,291 --> 01:44:16,230
I don't actually love doing this shit.
I just got too much shit to do this week.

1641
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:19,680
So that's it. That's the end of this
fucking podcast. I'm uploading it.

1642
01:44:19,710 --> 01:44:23,750
I apologize for my singing.
I apologize for the scatter brained,

1643
01:44:25,130 --> 01:44:28,080
uh, podcast at this was, but I think,

1644
01:44:28,081 --> 01:44:32,220
I think I like to think that there was
some moments. It was a good rental.

1645
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:37,770
Anyways, that's it. Uh, and thanks
to everybody who's been buying the a,

1646
01:44:37,771 --> 01:44:41,200
the old g his ringtone on the MLM podcast.

1647
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:46,110
If you want to donate to the podcast
99 cents, look into your heart,

1648
01:44:46,750 --> 01:44:50,870
go to the [inaudible] podcast dot
[inaudible] dot com and download the, oh,

1649
01:44:50,871 --> 01:44:53,960
Jesus ringtone. I'm actually
getting a new cell phone this week.

1650
01:44:53,961 --> 01:44:56,660
I was going to try to hold out
for the new iPhone when it's, uh,

1651
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:59,450
not the new iPhone, the iPhone
when it switches over to Verizon.

1652
01:44:59,451 --> 01:45:03,380
But my blackberry is shitting the
bed. I can't get emails on it. And,

1653
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:04,620
uh,

1654
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:08,790
the letter n doesn't work anymore unless
I fucking sprained my thumb pushing it

1655
01:45:08,791 --> 01:45:13,740
down. And, uh, I think I'm
going to get that droid phone.

1656
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:17,340
What do you guys think about that one?
Is that a good one? I want Verizon.

1657
01:45:17,341 --> 01:45:20,520
I want to stay with, with Verizon
because as far as where I travel,

1658
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,050
I'm going to get the droid.

1659
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:25,810
I should have just gone out and gotten
the fucking thing and it just had you

1660
01:45:25,811 --> 01:45:29,800
guys shit all over me that it's a bad
goddamn phone as opposed to now where I'm

1661
01:45:29,801 --> 01:45:33,430
going to get like 50 different
opinions. Like do, do not get the droid.

1662
01:45:33,580 --> 01:45:38,460
It fucking sucks. Get this phone.
Okay. Um, yeah, I have Verizon.
