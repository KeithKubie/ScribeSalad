00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:08.000
EMILY PRICE: Hi everybody.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.290
I'm Emily Price.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.200
And I'm a product
manager for Google VR.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.970
I'm here today to talk with you
about interactive storytelling

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.769
using two of the
products that I work on.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.560
So you just heard from
my colleague Michael

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.620
about VR and AR at
Google, which we

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.640
believe is the fourth wave
of computing that is here,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.759
it's coming, and it's really
important for developers.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.000
So just as a quick
poll, how many of you

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.920
have tried Daydream?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.480
Oh man, that's a lot of you.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.040
How many of you have
experience with VR?

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.480
That's even more, yes.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.220
So for those of you
who haven't, I'm

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.650
going to assign you
some homework right now.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.150
So by the end of
the week, you need

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.040
to drop by the Google booth and
try some of the Daydream demos

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.170
we have there.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.780
There are some things that
I really want all of you

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.070
to understand about VR
before you leave GDC.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.660
Why do we think and why do I
believe VR is so important?

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.140
VR is going to change the
way that we tell stories.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.590
VR gives you the ability to
break out of the single frame

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.480
and tell a story that unfolds
everywhere around you.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.250
And there are three things
that, for me, really

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.300
make VR storytelling different.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.610
The first one is immersion.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.670
So when you're taking control
of people's optical cortex

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.920
and all of their senses,
you're putting them inside

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.620
of a story in a
completely new way.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.930
The second one is agency.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.700
So when you start giving
people the ability to interact

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.400
and they're fully immersed
and present in the space,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.490
you have a whole new type
of superhero narrative.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.150
You are the hero in a
completely different way

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.410
than you are on a flat screen.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.800
And the third thing is that VR
is really about sharing worlds.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.680
We have the ability to
take you and transport you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.200
to another planet, or somewhere
amazing on this planet.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.400
Or we have the ability to share
the places in the world that

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.010
are really important
to us and tell stories

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.930
about those places
that are really

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.800
beautiful and meaningful.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.980
And so when it comes to the
idea of sharing the world,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.410
that's really where I come in.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.510
So I work on Google Jump,
which is a VR camera

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.710
system from Google.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.600
I've got one here on the stage
if people want to check it out.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.790
And what we're really
about is we're all

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.660
about giving people the tools to
capture the world and share it.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.830
So when I say camera system,
I can mean two things.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.530
The first one is
the camera itself.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.410
We partnered with GoPro
to make the GoPro Odyssey.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.970
And so what the
GoPro Odyssey is,

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.420
it's 16 standard
off-the-rack GoPro cameras,

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.550
arranged in a ring
with custom firmware

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.170
so that they are synchronized.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.800
And they run off
of a shared battery

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.740
so you don't have to
charge all 16 of them

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.170
and lose one in the
middle of filming.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.449
And here's a quick photo of
me going out and capturing

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:55.740
a place that's important to me.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.660
I really love
post-apocalyptic stories,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.660
and so I went out and filmed
some good post-apocalyptic

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.010
scenery.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.080
So the first part
really is the camera

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.750
that allows you to
go out and capture.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.750
And the second thing that we do
is we do automated stitching.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.210
So we designed this camera
to capture the world

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.100
in omnidirectional stereo.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.640
So the 20 second introduction
to omnidirectional stereo

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.990
is if you think about all of
the light in front of you,

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.190
capturing all of that light
and turning around in a circle

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.960
and capturing all
of that light too,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.450
we designed the camera to
capture the world in that way.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.530
And we take the 16 different
videos off of the GoPro

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.010
Odyssey, and we stitch
them together in the cloud.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.720
We blow apart all the
pixels and put them

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.890
back together to create a
perfect 360 3D stereo video.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.230
It's pretty awesome.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.080
I think I have some
demos on my phone

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.410
if you really want to see it.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.930
So OK.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.050
So what am I doing here?

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.720
Why am I here at GDC
talking about VR video?

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.110
It's because my favorite games--

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.240
I love games, I
believe in games.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.970
My favorite games are the ones
that are all about the stories.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.890
I love narrative game design.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.930
I love narrative-based games.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.040
And I think that when it comes
to telling stories in VR,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.350
bringing together,
capturing the world

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.890
with narrative-based games and
narrative-based game design

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.350
is going to unlock some of
the killer apps and killer

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.270
stories of the medium.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.616
So I'm really here
looking for people

00:04:28.616 --> 00:04:30.740
who are interested in
telling those sort of stories

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.448
that are planning
projects around telling

00:04:32.448 --> 00:04:34.160
those types of stories.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.570
And I would love to talk to you.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.070
So if this sounds
like your project,

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.880
if you're looking at blending VR
video and interactivity to tell

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.550
a story, I want to talk to you.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.900
I want to help you.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.777
So if this sounds like
you, please get in touch,

00:04:47.777 --> 00:04:48.610
please come find me.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.870
I'll be here all week, I have
pink hair, I work for Google.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.610
And I would love to talk with
you further about VR video

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.920
interactivity and storytelling.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.700
Thank you so much.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.500
