00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:08.206
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yeah, yeah.

00:00:08.206 --> 00:00:11.566
&gt;&gt;Gregory: This first step
is to change that self talk.

00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.166
I think should go to college.

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:14.926
I could go to college.

00:00:14.926 --> 00:00:16.786
I'm going to go to college.

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.206
I'm going to graduate college.

00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:20.116
The only person that
could stop you is you.

00:00:20.116 --> 00:00:24.396
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We have a hundred
percent college acceptance rate.

00:00:24.396 --> 00:00:28.836
We believe that if you put the right
support mechanisms around our young men,

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:32.686
they have an opportunity to rise above
the challenges that they often deal

00:00:32.686 --> 00:00:33.926
with and become successful.

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.746
&gt;&gt;Dion: Back in two thousand six
when we first started operating,

00:00:42.906 --> 00:00:45.376
we'd hear the statistics
being about two percent

00:00:45.446 --> 00:00:49.276
of African American males were
actually graduating from college.

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:52.706
The goal is to make them
want to go to college,

00:00:52.816 --> 00:00:58.186
as well as give them a very clear
insight as to what to expect in college.

00:00:58.186 --> 00:00:59.996
&gt;&gt;Desmond: Soon as you come in the door,

00:00:59.996 --> 00:01:02.336
it's just you getting ready
for the real work, buddy.

00:01:02.336 --> 00:01:03.336
Like it's a wake up call.

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:04.226
It's in the atmosphere.

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:06.486
Like you can't say Urban
Prep without thinking, man,

00:01:06.486 --> 00:01:07.766
these guys are going to college.

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.476
&gt;&gt;Gregory: Good morning, good
morning, good morning, good morning.

00:01:09.476 --> 00:01:12.026
&gt;&gt;I actually grew up two
blocks from the school.

00:01:12.146 --> 00:01:16.196
So when I'm talking about college in
my classes, I'm constantly stressing

00:01:16.196 --> 00:01:18.916
to them, I know exactly
your frustrations.

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:26.196
&gt;&gt;Begin to plan, begin to set up
how you will solve your problem.

00:01:26.896 --> 00:01:31.166
If you don't change that talk, you
will continue to get the same results.

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:34.466
&gt;&gt;Lionel: People can't believe
they can be what they don't see.

00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.326
So they never met a graduate
college graduate,

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:37.786
they don't think that
that's a possibility.

00:01:38.026 --> 00:01:40.446
So we start to plant
those seeds very early on.

00:01:40.446 --> 00:01:42.846
&gt;&gt;Tim: The first field trip they go

00:01:42.846 --> 00:01:45.406
on when they are freshmen
is to a college campus.

00:01:45.406 --> 00:01:48.146
We want them to understand
that in four years,

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:50.506
you're going to be at a place like this.

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:53.726
&gt;&gt;Donte: Every teacher has their college
pennant where they graduated from.

00:01:53.806 --> 00:01:56.916
Students can look up and see, "Oh, can
you tell me more about this school?"

00:01:56.916 --> 00:02:00.086
&gt;&gt;Christopher: And when you all apply to
DePaul University, I know you're going

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:02.736
to want to do early admissions, because
you've already made up your mind

00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:04.616
and you really want to go there.

00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:07.676
Let's figure out what it
takes to get into this school.

00:02:07.676 --> 00:02:12.246
&gt;&gt;Lionel: Unfortunately, the majority of
our students enter Urban Prep unprepared

00:02:12.336 --> 00:02:13.516
for the rigors of high school.

00:02:13.826 --> 00:02:15.186
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Students were coming to us

00:02:15.186 --> 00:02:16.946
and they were reading at
the fifth grade level.

00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:19.986
&gt;&gt;Lionel: And none of them
were able to perform math

00:02:19.986 --> 00:02:21.346
above the seventh grade level.

00:02:21.346 --> 00:02:25.776
So we've had to design an academic
model that allows us to remediate

00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:27.686
and accelerate almost simultaneously.

00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:30.876
It's a double period of
English for four years.

00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:34.356
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So let's go ahead and start
off with one of our strong opinions.

00:02:34.356 --> 00:02:35.096
Who's ready to go?

00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:37.446
&gt;&gt;Student: She inherited that name,
she wanted to escape that name,

00:02:37.446 --> 00:02:39.566
which means she wanted to also
escape the Mexican heritage.

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:43.186
&gt;&gt;Student: I strongly disagree,
because I can change my last name,

00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:47.306
but that may be because I want to escape
my American culture that's been forced

00:02:47.346 --> 00:02:47.956
onto me.

00:02:48.306 --> 00:02:51.776
&gt;&gt;Lionel: They take a double period
of math freshman and sophomore year,

00:02:51.776 --> 00:02:54.746
where we really want to build that
foundation at algebra and geometry.

00:02:55.016 --> 00:02:58.526
What the research supports is
that if students are algebra ready

00:02:58.626 --> 00:03:00.516
by the time they complete
their freshman year,

00:03:00.516 --> 00:03:02.476
they are more likely
to succeed in college.

00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:10.726
&gt;&gt;Success in college is dependent
upon the student's academic ability,

00:03:10.726 --> 00:03:12.736
but also their social
and emotional skills.

00:03:12.996 --> 00:03:14.726
&gt;&gt;Christopher: What are some
of the issues that you feel men

00:03:14.726 --> 00:03:17.406
of color might face in
their first year of college?

00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:21.036
&gt;&gt;Student: Racism, of course,
because if you look on the news,

00:03:21.036 --> 00:03:22.706
there's a lot of fraternities.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.956
&gt;&gt;Christopher: Are you talking about
some of the black face incidents?

00:03:26.386 --> 00:03:26.506
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:26.886
&gt;&gt;Christopher: Yeah.

00:03:26.886 --> 00:03:29.036
Can you get up and go
punch somebody in the face

00:03:29.036 --> 00:03:30.556
because they're making
fun of your culture?

00:03:30.556 --> 00:03:31.116
&gt;&gt;Students: No.

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:36.336
&gt;&gt;Christopher: No, but how do you
advocate for yourself and educate them

00:03:36.336 --> 00:03:37.976
to know like, yo, that's not cool?

00:03:43.426 --> 00:03:46.986
&gt;&gt;Lionel: Once they become seniors,
we have a college process class.

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:49.416
&gt;&gt;Student: Actually type it up.

00:03:49.616 --> 00:03:51.496
&gt;&gt;DaShawn: Before Urban
Prep, college was more of,

00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:53.386
if I go, I go, if I don't, I don't.

00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:59.286
But once getting here, college
is a must, like I have to go.

00:03:59.466 --> 00:04:02.346
Recently I have been having
to look up colleges to find

00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:03.676
out information about them.

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.426
We fill out certain applications.

00:04:05.426 --> 00:04:07.586
We work on our personal statement.

00:04:07.886 --> 00:04:09.276
&gt;&gt;Student: I said I am
a very quick learner.

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:12.636
This skill will be very useful in
college because I have aspirations

00:04:12.636 --> 00:04:14.896
to become a teacher and it takes
a lot of patience and learning

00:04:14.896 --> 00:04:16.736
to be successful in a
teaching environment.

00:04:16.826 --> 00:04:18.466
&gt;&gt;Donte: We talk to them about,
you know, what to include

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:19.846
in your essay, what not to include.

00:04:19.846 --> 00:04:21.206
We talk about financial aid.

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:25.846
&gt;&gt;Jessica: They're encouraged to apply
to eleven schools, two probable schools,

00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:28.526
a reach school, two safety schools.

00:04:28.846 --> 00:04:31.186
We want them to have
a variety of options.

00:04:31.186 --> 00:04:34.636
&gt;&gt;DaShawn: I was like, I don't
believe I can get into these schools,

00:04:34.636 --> 00:04:36.766
but she was just like, "You most
definitely have the scores."

00:04:37.216 --> 00:04:41.036
She pushed me to sit there and say,
"I'm not going to let a school deny me."

00:04:41.136 --> 00:04:43.336
&gt;&gt;Student: It teaches
us about responsibility.

00:04:43.336 --> 00:04:47.216
It's our job to get the essays done and
finish all our applications on our own

00:04:47.216 --> 00:04:47.976
and then have them check off on it.

00:04:48.136 --> 00:04:50.376
&gt;&gt;DaShawn: I think about
college every day.

00:04:50.376 --> 00:04:52.266
I'm so amped up for it right now,

00:04:52.266 --> 00:04:53.976
it's just a burden burning
in me to get there.

00:04:59.046 --> 00:05:00.286
&gt;&gt;Lionel: The best ritual in the world

00:05:00.286 --> 00:05:02.496
to me is what we call
"On to the Next One."

00:05:02.496 --> 00:05:05.056
It's when we present our seniors
with their red and gold tie

00:05:05.056 --> 00:05:07.866
for being accepted to their
first college or university.

00:05:17.086 --> 00:05:18.766
&gt;&gt;Ke'Avery: I had trouble sleeping
last night because of the excitement.

00:05:18.766 --> 00:05:20.256
&gt;&gt;Darius: I've been accepted
into Anthem University,

00:05:20.256 --> 00:05:22.886
Tuskegee University,
St. John's University.

00:05:23.166 --> 00:05:23.916
&gt;&gt;Jeramee: I feel good.

00:05:23.916 --> 00:05:26.766
I've been waiting four long
years for this red and gold tie.

00:05:27.796 --> 00:05:31.066
&gt;&gt;Lionel: This is a generational
shift, so now all of his cousins

00:05:31.066 --> 00:05:33.176
and siblings are looking
to him and saying, "Hey,

00:05:33.176 --> 00:05:35.186
if he did it, then I can do it too."

00:05:35.976 --> 00:05:38.716
&gt;&gt;Tim: We're changing this
narrative around what is possible

00:05:38.716 --> 00:05:41.236
for young black men, what is possible
for this possible for this population,

00:05:41.236 --> 00:05:43.396
what is possible for these communities.
