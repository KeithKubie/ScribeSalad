00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.630
 there I am only navy grandchild developed 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.400
 android team routine 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.070
 I'm here today to talk a little 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.300
 about a new android 4.4 feature that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.390
 are the new good sms apis in a 24.4 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.869
 kitkat has a new concept in relation to 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:31.199
 the use of the default sms application or 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.980
 now from version 1.4 only 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.290
 to this pattern you can send write 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.270
 directly in the sms content provider 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.550
 of the android system any other 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.559
 time you try to do this will fail to 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.570
 silent form or the user does not 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.989
 will be limited warned but it is not 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.850
 it will be able to send the sms it's good 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.199
 other areas can continue reading the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.539
 semesters normally 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.840
 okay since of course they are using the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.480
 right permissions on the good system 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.579
 because it has a standard ep which is the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.840
 advantage because it had this change in the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.640
 good paradigm 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.549
 first because the standard ep is going to have 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.580
 guarantee to receive all messages 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.189
 that arrive at the device is another 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.070
 that can not interfere with or abort this 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.900
 process then increases the reliability 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.030
 good cms delivery 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.810
 another thing is that no other ep can 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.729
 delete or change messages behind the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.000
 ep and then decrease the complexity 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.860
 because we will have the behavior 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.590
 centralized in an application and clear 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.079
 allows third-party cement apps 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.240
 or yours is for example supported from 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.189
 way to appear and main system 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.689
 is to ask for first category let's go 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.090
 call it is not because the user has 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.369
 direct interaction with her is very 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.030
 cool to know that your ep can be 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.100
 main engineering sms good and for 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.140
 implementing this is good because an epe 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.719
 to be eligible is because it can be a 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.969
 The standard sms team is obviously got 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.310
 that having some prerequisite has to 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.909
 have some specific skills 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.979
 good 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.280
 the first thing is of course have a blog that 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.099
 is accessible to handle messages 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.700
 received tatá and on the screen are there 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.890
 So are you doing the kessy blog? 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.489
 performances and also a great 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.860
 complaint if you deploy the mms received 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.930
 well you gotta have it so to say 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.599
 declared in your manifest and make the 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.030
 Also good implementation also 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:32.209
 Of course I had was that the user 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.980
 can send new ms ms is after all how 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.630
 What if you want, sir? 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.310
 be active default has to give to the 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.349
 user a way to send this 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.459
 message is good there is also a 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.590
 quartermaster filter and how do you 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.920
 I would configure the one I had in order to 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.959
 send good message and beyond 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.760
 also has a service that delivers 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.970
 the phone's message of quick way 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.799
 response is also has the service with the 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.930
 intendant son that you can use 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.569
 and so remembering what I said now 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.430
 are these requirements are basic 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.860
 your ep may be the system default 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.660
 because only then will the system 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.940
 continue to ensure that the user has 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.519
 all the available SMS 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.319
 Your phone is good and there. 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.390
 in case he will get a warning like this 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.900
 where will you ask to reach a standard 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.639
 is and if you want to use this as 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.350
 a standard the user will respond that 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.120
 yes or no of course you do not have 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.590
 to interfere with the user's choice is 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.660
 then the user will have this option 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.269
 choose and choose from the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.269
 be the wonder pattern ball forward 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.549
 will seize this opportunity there 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.019
 Good thing we do to receive the 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.470
 sms messages 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:42.109
 good has new action specific kitkat 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.829
 to receive is the delivery of messages in the 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.090
 case is the live action sms and oak bush 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.510
 live action 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.670
 and the actions of the messages received are not 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.700
 that he when he receives the message is 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.859
 when you have a sms received action and oak 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.450
 push and civil action 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.639
 then you have to map these 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.220
 according to your ability to receive 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:07.069
 and also to treat when the 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.690
 receiving the message is good good 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.660
 some best practice in terms of 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.669
 have a personal sms application to 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.680
 they do not look for standard cieps then 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.959
 I did an ep that at the time was to send 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.180
 sms template something you 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.640
 but it does not have goals and it is 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.409
 continue using the 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.030
 rehipment actions reef 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.350
 it does not change anything you've been doing 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.900
 but if you already have a time 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.400
 That way, do not worry, without it. 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.180
 worry if you want to be an epe 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.820
 pattern 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.510
 good if you want to be one is tactical standard 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.280
 to pec - already 1.7 component and neither will 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.200
 settings because you can not 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.870
 disabling components with receivables 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.760
 from merced even messi received or is 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.560
 prevent anyone from attempting to intercept 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.410
 message because it's you who will receive 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.570
 all messages and also one thing 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.760
 very important use resources in 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.880
 files from 6 boolean years to 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.930
 enable or disable automatically 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.850
 receivables 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.500
 according to the version of the platform that 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.140
 I see quickly how you are going to use it. 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.750
 that you can have the compatible type 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.540
 both with kitkat and with versions 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.010
 earlier is good 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.170
 this for example is how you create a 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.600
 I'm afraid, so here's a reservation. 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.210
 the variable name né and the value can be 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.240
 trump faustão in case leaving as 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.960
 default that has false and false khat 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.480
 pre kitkat tron ​​and already provel luiz dash 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.940
 see 19 or the platform in the version of the 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.970
 pm it takes 19 I'm talking about having kit 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.650
 kat tron ​​is that the qat building is fake 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.990
 It's so showing there in that way. 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.480
 search in iff in code 11 reservations and 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:45.290
 which according to the version is configured 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.850
 indicating good trio or fauci values ​​and 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.860
 There in my manifesto when I go 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.110
 declare the reef is good staff 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.060
 so in the case of the kat kit receipt I 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.520
 I'll put boolean recipe 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.680
 indicating that it has a kit and in the case of 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.650
 building that's aunt I'm going to use then the other 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.450
 variable by black cats is there 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.490
 address with qr code you can 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.970
 give a read and take any further questions 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.160
 here it has been good and for 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.990
 verify that the application is the default 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.850
 perhaps offer an ease of making 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.590
 the standard apps first thing by 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.410
 example there is a method where the examination was 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.810
 sms is where I'm checking if it can 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.370
 be the sign the default is not verified 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.440
 first is in the kitkat version for 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.540
 to be able to know if I can you ask 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.900
 by a system and if it is then I do the 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:32.510
 that I give a return nec is a Goian 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:35.030
 comparing I get with 3.7 pec-g name 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.940
 which is the name of your current context and 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:41.220
 compare with the phone tips ms.gov.br 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.020
 phone sms today and the context 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.720
 so if the goal is standard 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.390
 return a snag will get false and then 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.060
 in an abstract about captive for example you 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:54.780
 Can you turn it on or off, right? 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.940
 an option on wai offering to make your 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.400
 standard sms application or not 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.020
 not only goals you application it is not the 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.150
 you can display an icon there 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.730
 that he can click and make the 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.500
 application and how you apply 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.330
 that the same client user there you have 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.150
 What do you do that is terminating? 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.740
 default was the code is also very simple 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.930
 just create an understanding with 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.330
 correct settings and there will appear 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.290
 there is the request for the eyes are 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.610
 watching on the screen 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.970
 if he wants to make that application 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:26.400
 standard for sms or not good 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.560
 some notes we finish this 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.150
 notice there message we go 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.600
 continue to ship with any 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:37.260
 team using send sms permission 

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.690
 using sms - go to other apps besides 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:42.080
 default the system writes the 

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.290
 sms approved system but does not write 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.890
 ms 

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:49.500
 Okay, so it's just this observation there and then 

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:51.870
 dss standard he who is responsible for 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.550
 write the messages in the content 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.350
 likely to exit itself 

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:57.900
 so when you send for that price 

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.640
 application but it is he who makes the 

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.010
 because you have to have the 

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:04.500
 receivables in the correct form you 

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:06.120
 can handle interaction with others 

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.160
 applications 

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.090
 if you have done a backup ep of 

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.860
 sms 

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.210
 then you will save yourself from disaster to 

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.940
