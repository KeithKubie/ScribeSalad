00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:23.300
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.600
&gt;&gt; Lynn B. Brostoff:
I'm very happy

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.350
to introduce Dr. Rachel
Obbard today as our speaker.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.730
Rachel is an Assistant Research
Professor at the Thayer School

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.390
of Engineering at
Dartmouth College.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.420
She holds degrees in Material
Science and Engineering

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.460
from the Colorado School
of Mines, the University

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.760
of New Hampshire, and
Dartmouth College.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.430
Rachel is most interested
in porous materials

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.300
and her fascinating work
on sea ice takes her

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.840
to both the Arctic
and Antarctica.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.930
We did not have our
Skype meetings

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.160
when she was in Antarctica.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.700
She has been interested
in the study of materials

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.570
and cultural heritage for many
years and she first reached

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.770
out in 2013 to the Metropolitan
Museum of Art with an interest

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.320
in doing a project of this sort.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.380
And then they reached out to
the Library of Congress in 2015,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.270
and it took a few
years to get funded.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.140
But the work she will
present today is the result

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.690
of a collaboration that resulted
between PRTD, Dr. Sylvia Centeno

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.420
at the Met, and Rachel, of
course, as well as scientists,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.210
students, and interns at
our institutions in Cornell

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.640
and Argonne National Labs.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.390
And I just like to add
that as you likely know,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.740
some of the early work on
this subject of tidelines,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.050
which is very important to paper
conservators, was conducted

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.920
by our very own Elmer Eusman.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.670
And we are really pleased to
build on that work as well

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.470
as the work of Ann
Laurence [phonetic] Dupont,

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.640
which many of you know, and
her colleagues in France.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.930
&gt;&gt; Rachel Obbard: Thank you
Lynn for that introduction.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.230
Hello everyone.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.240
Thank you so much for having
me here and for attending.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.500
I'm sure this is a bit
out of your busy day,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.580
and I'm excited to
present this work.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.010
This is something we've
been working on for a couple

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.100
of years now and we've got
an enormous amount of data

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.200
and some really pretty pictures
so I hope you'll enjoy this.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.250
So the order of my
talk will be first

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.870
to give you a very small
amount of background.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.200
There is certainly huge
body of work on this topic

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.940
but I'll give you the background
that I think is necessary

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.910
for what I'm going
to talk about.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.730
Talk about our objectives for
this talk and for the study,

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.870
our analytical approach or
techniques, the results we got,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.120
and a little bit of a
summary and some next steps.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.680
So tidelines, as you very
well know, are residual damage

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.300
on paper at a former
wet/dry boundary.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.720
We know that visible
tidelines can be created even

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.210
with ultrapure water
on purified cellulose.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.680
We also know that repeated
wettings with increasing amounts

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.530
of fluid will produce
successive tidelines.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.180
This study builds on the
previous work as Lynn mentioned,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.570
particularly that of
Elmer Eusman, which showed

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.570
that these tidelines
can be produced even

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.910
with purified substrate
and water,

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.880
and this is a very
important result.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.070
The example shown here is
perhaps not a good example

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.630
of that because here you can
also see bleeding of the inks.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.170
But this was one of the
deaccessioned objects

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.880
from the Metropolitan Museum of
Art that we began by looking at.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.100
In this study, we examine
some historical samples

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.880
but have also tried to avoid

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.280
such possibly confounding
factors such as this

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.380
by concentrating our work
on tidelines produced

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.980
in the laboratory
on 100% cotton rag

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.220
or cotton linen papers
using melaque water.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.390
So paper fascinates
me personally

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.710
as a material scientist because
it's what we call a hierarchical

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.610
composite or a hierarchical
structure.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.150
It starts with cellulose, of
course, long chain polymer,

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.960
which is organized into
elementary fibrils,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.770
microfibrils, and then
microfibrils or bands.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.230
And these form what we call
fibers and what we'll see

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.900
in images in the
following slides.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.090
This structure is very
complex and it's fundamental

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.020
to paper's mechanical
and transport properties.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.630
So as you know, paper
is hygroscopic.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.250
It absorbs water.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.790
And wetting and drying both
produce macroscopic changes

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.390
as well as microscopic ones.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.850
We'd like to do some future
work on the structural changes

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.950
at the fiber level, but for now
the important thing to take away

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.260
from this slide is to remember
that wetting promotes transport.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.450
As Dr. Eusman pointed out,

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.440
it was previously assumed
the brown lines formed

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.470
at the wet drive boundary
were caused by the migration

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.920
of soluble material there.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.780
But research has shown that it's
actually much more complicated.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.790
Cellulose degradation

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.540
at the wet/dry boundary is
still not completely understood.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.980
Recent research has shown
the importance though

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:06.200
of hydro peroxide production
in oxidative degradation,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.830
but hydrolytic degradation
is still important.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.510
Chemical changes at the wet/dry
boundary lead to degradation

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:19.750
of cellulose a seen by the
formation of carboxylic acids,

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.270
formic acid, and acetic acid, as
well as is seen through evidence

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.140
of depolymerization
and of reduction

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.970
in mean length of
the polymer chain.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.630
And this reduction in chain
length is primarily the result

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.930
of chain scission

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:45.360
which essentially halves the
mean length of polymer chains.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.150
So our objective is to
further the understanding

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.160
of tideline formation in
the historical examples

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.500
that we selected, in the sized
model papers that we produced,

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.300
and in some undersized model
papers that we produced.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.790
And you'll see that
the two types

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.190
of model papers gave
very different results.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.690
We are trying to, or have been
trying to, record the migration

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.550
and deposition of
inorganic material associated

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.840
with the tidelines
through complementary

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.030
in situ techniques.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.560
And to further investigate
the effect of artificial aging

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.150
on the tidelines on both the
sized and unsurpassed papers.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.220
As I mentioned, we began

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.970
by selecting a few historical
objects that we could sample.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.650
But because we wanted
to constrain some

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.900
of the variables inherent
in that sort of sample,

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:49.220
we also identified some
modern 100% cotton rag papers

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.570
and actually cotton linen papers
and produced tidelines on these

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.910
under very controlled
conditions.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.430
So what I'll present
today is just a subset

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.930
of all the paper samples
that we looked at so

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.710
as not to confuse matters.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.690
We used a wide variety
of techniques,

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.220
primarily qualitative
x-ray fluorescence

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.530
at several different
resolutions,

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.510
scanning electron microscopy

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.260
with energy dispersive
spectroscopy

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:24.270
for element identification, and
x-ray micro-computed tomography.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:29.260
So first I'll talk about
micro XRF techniques.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:35.150
So XRF, as you probably know,
x-ray fluorescence mapping

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.730
or imaging, was developed
at the University of Antwerp

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.820
and at the Delft
University of Technology

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.080
which I had the pleasure
of visiting last summer.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.110
It's an awesome place.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.730
My colleagues at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.420
and the Library of
Congress both conducted XRF

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.520
with their respective machines

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.360
with the specifications
shown here.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.410
The Brucker [phonetic] M6 system

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:03.750
at the Metropolitan Museum
has a 30 wide rhodium target

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.640
microfocus x-ray tube
which is operated

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.210
at 50 kVA and 600 microns.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.400
It has a silicon drift detector
and poly capillary optics

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.640
and measuring had moved
across the object surface.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.380
The Artax [phonetic] system has
similar components and spot size

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.740
and resolution but
is less sophisticated

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.180
in terms of mapping.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:30.400
So it was operated in the study
in the line scan mode as well

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.450
as for individual spot analysis.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.190
We show here again that
the print that we called

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:43.820
for shorthand "Flowers," both
sides of it, and two areas

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:49.910
that were analyzed which are
labeled, despite it being turned

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.230
on its side, upper
right and bottom right.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.950
These are the elemental maps

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.350
from the upper right-hand
tideline area shown along

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.040
with a photograph
of that region.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.810
Note how the sulfur

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.820
and potassium are the most
concentrated in the edges

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.430
of the tideline while the
chlorine is more diffuse.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.650
Here's the sulfur and the
potassium is quite concentrated

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.180
right in the edge there.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.410
You see here the
chlorine is quite diffuse

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.190
in the tideline region.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:30.260
Now here are the elemental
maps from the other area,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.850
the bottom right area, and
here again the tide line seems

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.920
to have swept up and
concentrated the chlorine sulfur

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:44.090
and potassium although the
concentration of the sulfur

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.590
at the edges is the
most pronounced here.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.790
These are both a
little bit more diffuse.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.960
We also looked at
several printed books

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.800
from the well-known William
H. Barrow book collection

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.150
that you have here

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.790
in the preservation research
and testing division.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:08.340
Shown here is a page from
Barrow book number 1077,

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.390
the title which is "the
Modern Practice of Physic"

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.630
which was printed
in London in 1768.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.230
So this is the very latest
in medical literature,

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.730
I want you to know, and
this is definitely the go-to

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.170
for your doctor,
should he or she ask.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:31.070
Shown here is the page from the
book in UV light on the right.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:36.660
And you notice that in the UV
light you can see the tideline

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.960
here is actually rather thick.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.960
When you look at it
here, your eye is drawn

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.140
to the darkest part, the very
leading edge, but you can see

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:52.520
that the tideline itself, it's
not a thin or narrow line.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.430
And we're to be looking
at the accumulation

00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:01.820
of elements throughout this
tideline zone, if you will.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:08.720
So this is a typical appearance
in normal and UV light.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.800
This is actually a gelatin sized
paper with fairly creamy color

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.240
and the sizing felt
pretty significant.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.550
The next few slides
show our analysis

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:24.850
of the paper from this book.

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:29.640
So here we see both the
elemental scanning maps here

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.940
and the line scan.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.720
So we're using both XRF's here
at the Library of Congress

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.700
and at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.700
And the two types of analyses
show the same information

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.740
but in a different way.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.900
And while we can get
great visualizations

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.200
of the distribution of
elements in the map,

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.400
we get somewhat more
detail in the line scans.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.690
So the maps on the left
beautifully highlight the

00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:01.830
concentration of sulfur and
potassium at the tideline.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:06.300
The iron is concentrated
there but not as dramatically

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.400
and the calcium and chlorine
really don't show up.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:16.560
The line scan here is very
busy and that's in part

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:24.090
because of the normalization of
each of the individual curves.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.390
But it includes all of
these elements as well

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.910
as aluminum phosphorus.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:38.550
The other ones, manganese,
iron, copper, zinc, and lead.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:44.300
So without trying to tease the
individual lines here apart,

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.670
it's apparent that all of the
elements actually show a pattern

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.910
of increased concentration here

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.770
at the visible tideline
indicated

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.630
with the blue dots here.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.370
So all of the elements are
increased in concentration

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.000
in the region at just
below the tidelines.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.300
And there's even,
if you look closely,

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.320
sort of a hint of
a double tideline.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.370
You see this peak here
and then there appears

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.700
to be another peak
closer to the tideline.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:18.550
In a minute, we'll look at
and XRF of this same paper

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.280
with the lab produced tidelines.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.370
So remember, this is an old
tideline, we don't know how old.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:28.480
In a minute, I'll show you a lab
produced tideline on that paper.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.560
So here's how we
produce the model systems

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.620
and the laboratory tidelines.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.490
So we selected a variety of
modern papers, as I said,

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:43.480
which were either 100% cotton
or a cotton linen cellulose,

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.620
and they were either
sized or undersized.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:52.190
And we're trying to represent
the historical papers and also

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:57.460
to experiment on some different
preparation conditions.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.090
We also made fresh
tidelines, as I mentioned,

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.430
on the bearable papers
from the same book.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:10.170
It's the pages that we showed
you the historical tidelines on.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:13.680
So the tideline formation was
done by vertically dipping

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.840
in melaque altra-pure
deionized water the papers here.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.890
So they're held on a rack and
they're set down into this pan

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:27.210
of water for 15 hours in
a controlled environment.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.050
And this work was all done here.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:33.030
In our testing, we noticed

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:37.670
that no new gelatin sized
papers formed visible tidelines,

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.110
although UV did show a faint
fluorescence at the water line

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:42.530
in all of these samples.

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.040
So in other words, the
sizing was very effective

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.950
at stopping any water transport
in the new sized papers.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:53.860
We will even pre-aged some

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.900
of these papers before
tideline formation

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.600
and we still didn't see any
transport in the sized ones.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.800
The samples were also
artificially aged

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.100
at the Library of Congress.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.300
You see here Leah, the intern,

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.530
standing in front
of the aging oven.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.590
And then samples were mailed
to the Metropolitan Museum

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:20.830
of Art and to Dartmouth.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:25.670
So here is a paper from
that same Barrow book,

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:29.340
now with the laboratory
made tideline.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.030
The aged paper produces
a much sharper

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.450
and more pronounced tideline.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.430
Take a look at the maps over
here, particularly the sulfur,

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:46.460
the potassium, and the overlay
with the sulfur and chlorine.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.470
Presumably, the sizing in this
paper is degraded over time

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:54.170
which allowed that
transport, but the aging

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.480
of the cellulose itself could
have had an effect as well.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:03.530
So this shows similar movement
in sulfur and potassium to that

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.850
which we saw in the
old tideline, but iron

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:10.170
and calcium are now
also apparent.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.650
The line scan shows
some additional detail,

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.150
and again these different
curves are normalized.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.910
The timeline is very
complex and, in particular,

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.710
notice the offset of
the elements here.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:29.000
So the x-axis is vertical
distance across the tideline.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.780
And here's the top
of the dark tideline

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.440
and then the tideline
fades, and the bottom

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.810
of the dark tideline is here

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:43.060
and then this area is
below the tideline.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:48.980
So this paper where you see
the separation of the peaks

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.700
like this, the paper
is essentially acting

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.300
as a thin layer chromatography
substrate.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:02.440
And in this case, the magnesium
and the zinc appear at the front

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:07.190
of the tideline and the
calcium and sulfur the back

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.430
with the potassium
in the middle.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:14.350
So the takeaway here is that
the massive concentration

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.700
of what were trace
elements in the paper,

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:21.650
including the transition
metals, and both sets

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:25.350
of results are qualitative.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:27.360
I should remind you
not quantitative,

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.840
but they do show very
good signal-to-noise ratio

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.040
and also good correspondence
to one another.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.710
So now, I'm going to
show you some XRF mapping

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.670
of model samples.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.730
And what we did was, Sylvia

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:49.940
at the Metropolitan
Museum took the strips

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.970
and set them all next
to each other here.

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.360
So this photograph shows
you all of the samples.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.440
I realize that the writing here
is to too small for you to read,

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.890
but I'm going to refer to
some of the different strips

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.520
so that you'll know
what they are.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.510
And then here on the
left are the line scans

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:09.170
of the different elements for
those papers, so you can sort

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:15.800
of get a correspondence between
the strips and the line scans.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.110
So all of the unsized
papers form tidelines

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:23.490
with strong concentrations of
sulfur, chlorine, and potassium.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:27.320
And we were initially surprised
to see such a high concentration

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.330
of these elements in these
tidelines because, again,

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:37.170
this was melaque water and we
believed very clean cellulose,

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.760
and we thought it might've been
because the polypropylene trays

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.630
that we were using hadn't been
cleaned thoroughly enough.

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.820
So we went back and
super cleaned them

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:49.540
and also super cleaned
and used some glass trays,

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:54.790
and the test do showed that
these elements at the tideline.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:20:00.840
So they're not coming from
the trays or the water.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:07.360
So one of the things to note
in this set is that none

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:12.380
of the gelatin sized papers form
tidelines although the UV did

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.570
show some fluorescence
there at the water line.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.710
And I don't have
the UV image here,

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:24.450
but the one circled here
are the sized papers.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.570
This is the UICB 2000.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:39.390
And the other two are Alana and
another sample of the UICB 2000.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:43.790
So you can see that we're
not getting any action here

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:48.670
in the line scans.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.610
If I look now at
these three papers,

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:56.570
the second through
the fourth samples,

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:57.980
the second through the fifth,

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.650
these are Whatman [phonetic]
number one at different stages

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.520
of aging post tideline.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.360
And you notice here that
the tideline appears

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.920
to become more diffuse
with aging.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:15.730
And so, this is from zero
days to 3.5 days of age

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:22.400
in an 80 degree C oven.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:29.230
Okay, these ones circled are
the undersized UICB samples,

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:33.620
again with aging of over
a period of several days.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.370
In contrast to the
Whatman [phonetic] ones,

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:41.490
the UICB papers, you
don't see any widening

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.970
of the tideline with aging.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:49.090
So there doesn't seem to be
any diffusion going on there.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:54.570
So that was what
we call micro XRF.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:58.770
In March 2016, three
student undergraduates

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:01.840
and I took some samples
to Argonne National Lab,

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.620
the advanced photon
source there,

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.220
where a very high power source
produces very high resolution

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.980
analytical techniques
of many types.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:17.260
And we were able to do
essentially nano XRF there.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.220
This is, to my knowledge
at least,

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.070
the first time Synchrotron
XRF has been used

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:26.380
in a systematic study of
tidelines such as this.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.300
So at Argonne, we
used beam line 26 ID,

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:32.120
which is I think
somewhere up here.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.990
Each of those little
triangles sticking off

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:41.570
from the essential circle at
Argonne is a separate beam line.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:48.080
And at the time that we
applied for beam time

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:52.850
to beam line 26 ID, it
offered both x-ray fluorescence

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.220
and x-ray tomography.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.620
And we were hoping to use
both techniques simultaneously

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.440
in order to get both structural

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.870
and chemical information
on the samples.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.130
Unfortunately, by the
time we got there,

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:09.330
the tomographic capability had
been moved to another beam line,

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:13.400
so we did the only x-ray
fluorescence there.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:22.080
Before we went there, I'll also
talk about micro CT which we did

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.850
on machine at Cornell.

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:27.740
And our goal was to try
to do both structural

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.170
and chemical analyses
at the same spot

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.840
on a sample using the
two different instruments

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.140
in two different locations.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.360
So what we did was we
designed a small sample holder

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.470
that would fit both systems.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:44.150
And my undergraduate
student actually came

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:48.450
up with a solid works model
of a tiny sample holder.

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:52.430
It's 4 millimeters across
the top here and it has

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:56.630
in it a tiny 2 millimeter
square window.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:02.940
And we glued the sample to that
with a tiny bit of rubber cement

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.920
so it was something
that was fairly viscous

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.430
and wouldn't be absorbed
by the paper.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:11.090
And here is an image
of the sample mounted

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.890
in the beam line at Argonne.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:16.050
That's one of my students.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.980
So the idea was to be able

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.380
to identify the tideline
on this sample.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.380
You can't see on
this particular one.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.830
This may have been an
early [inaudible] test

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.310
of the sample holder.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:29.850
But typically you can see
the tideline on these,

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.930
and then the idea was to
be able to know what areas

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:39.340
of the sample you were
sampling when it was

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.560
in different [inaudible].

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.250
Okay, so result.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:48.840
So these are the element maps
from the Synchrotron XRF.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.170
This is, again, Whatman
[phonetic] one.

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:57.170
Note here that it
picks up more elements

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:03.050
than the micro XRF's do,

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.590
and also that it shows their
distribution on the fiber level

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.410
which I think is just so cool.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:12.500
So particularly if you look
here and here, you can tell

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.870
from the distribution
of the elements

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:17.130
that the fibers are there.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.830
And I'm sorry I don't
have an optical image

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.810
to show you to compare to those.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:28.330
Note that these elements are
in order of atomic number,

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:31.760
and unfortunately
sodium cannot be seen

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.800
because we were using
a 9 KV source

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:43.740
and sodium was below the
florescent below the cut off.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.830
It's interesting to note
looking at these are some

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.190
of the elements, such as
the sulfur and chlorine,

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:50.710
are very much associated
with the fibers,

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.250
whereas others are not.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:55.560
For instance, if you
look at the calcium,

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.350
this is clearly just
some kind of a particle.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:02.790
And the fact that it's also
associated with aluminum

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:09.460
and silicon phosphorus suggest
to me that it may be some kind

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.210
of a mineral particle,
basically a piece of dirt.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:19.420
And incidentally, the
line scanning micro XRF

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:26.020
and in the SEM also showed
the presence of particles,

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:30.800
particularly calcium
particles in these tidelines.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.730
Some other observations, we
wondered of course what form

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:39.210
of sulfur and chlorine
are co-located here,

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:42.210
just because we have the two
elements doesn't tell us what

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:46.350
the compound actually is,
which is a problem of all

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:49.560
of the techniques I'm talking
about today unfortunately.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.310
It's probably not calcium
sulfate or calcium chloride

00:26:53.310 --> 00:27:00.630
but perhaps it is potassium
chloride or potassium sulfate.

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:01.930
We really don't know

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:04.890
and we don't know how those
compounds might affect the

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:06.720
paper degradation.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.120
It's also really interesting
to see that the metals,

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:17.620
such as the silicon here
and the copper down here

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:23.650
and the manganese are
themselves associated

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:25.350
with the fiber structure.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:28.970
And this suggests that
they are associated

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:34.050
with the paper itself, and
beyond that we don't know.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.270
There's clearly a lot of
chemistry going on here

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:41.900
that we haven't figured out yet.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.280
Okay, now I'm going
to talk a little

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.870
about the scanning
electron microscopy result.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:50.380
So we have an SEM at
Dartmouth which we use

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:55.630
and we also use the one here
at the Library of Congress.

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.750
So at Dartmouth, what
we did was, of course,

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:00.320
with the skinning
electron microscope,

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:05.050
once you put the sample in the
SEM, you can't see the surface

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:07.710
of it so you can't tell
what the tideline is.

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:11.960
So we marked the tideline
using a tungsten needle.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.660
We just made little
punctures along the tideline.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.460
So on this sample here, here's
the tideline, and you notice

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.970
that you can also see
it due to the presence

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.250
of these bright particles.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.660
And on the sample, this
is about the tideline

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.180
and that's below the tideline.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:32.040
We did not code the
samples we were using

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.390
in an environmental SEM.

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:35.240
We actually started coding them.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.870
In the beginning we coded them.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.320
We got, of course, an enormous
gold peak that we said, "Oh,

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.890
heck, we don't need this."

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:45.140
So we started using it
in environmental mode.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:49.610
We collected energy
dispersive spectra

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:55.640
from our associated EDS system
and we found sodium calcium

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:59.830
and sulfur prevalent in the
areas with the particulates.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:04.310
So this is a spectra
of somewhere here.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.030
We took three spectra
in each location,

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:09.000
so I don't know whether it
was here or here or here.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.550
I could go back to the
date and tell you that,

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.380
but they were all very similar.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:18.280
So on the tideline we saw
sodium, sulfur, calcium,

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.270
a smaller chlorine peak, and
of course, I shouldn't fail

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:24.180
to mention the enormous
carbon and oxygen peaks

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.460
that would naturally be
associated with paper.

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:34.160
Then these are really cool.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:39.150
These false color SEM
EDS images were produced

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:42.650
by Tana [phonetic] here at
the Library of Congress.

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:46.020
So this false color
map helps you see

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.280
where the different
elements are associated

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.280
on the structure of the paper.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.300
So here you see sulfur
is red, sodium is green,

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.870
calcium is blue, and of
course when you put the red

00:29:56.870 --> 00:30:01.010
and blue together you get
shades of purple here.

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:04.470
So you can see here that the
sulfur is strongly associated

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:07.910
with both the sodium
and the calcium,

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:12.040
so you've got the red bits
here and the red adding

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.110
to the purple there, even
the particulate matter

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:22.450
that you can see here in
the backscattered image.

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:26.340
And here's a close-up of
a particulate on a fiber,

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.050
and here the element
maps suggest

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:31.860
that there may actually be
two types of sulfates present,

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:36.240
sodium sulfate and the
calcium sulfate maybe.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.170
And you notice that this
technique is a nice complement

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:43.620
to the Synchrotron XRF because
there we couldn't detect the

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.280
sodium, whereas here we can.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:52.930
And both, of course, give
us fiber resolution images.

00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:01.610
Tana [phonetic] also examined
the Barrow book samples

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:06.140
in the SEM, and here
was an example

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:11.140
from the same Barrow book
that I mentioned earlier.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.840
And here we see a strong
association of calcium

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.290
and sulfur, possibly
calcium sulfate,

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:26.500
but of course we
can't know for sure.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:31.160
As you know, UV light is a great
tool for illuminating tidelines,

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.680
and we thought these samples
were very interesting.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.140
The top is the Whatman
number one

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:38.900
with the artificial
tideline prepared in the lab

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.050
after 21 days of aging.

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.440
And you notice here that
you've got a lot going

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.910
on underneath it here.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:46.950
You've got essentially
a double tideline,

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.670
but then I don't
see it well there

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:55.270
but there is also all these
streaks running down from it.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:59.680
So you could say double,
maybe multiple tideline.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.190
It's a very complex thing.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:05.240
And we can see similar
phenomenon here

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.740
in the UICB paper.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:14.950
It looks different, and this is
the unsized UICB Ptolemy paper.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:18.350
But again, you can tell
that it is quite complex.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:22.950
There's gradation going on here,
possibly again I don't know

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:24.250
if you can see it here.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.620
When I look at it on my laptop,

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.660
you can actually
see the presence

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.980
of double tideline here, much
closer to the primary one

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.000
than in the Whatman above.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.320
So these lines can spectra
show just the key elements

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.890
in the Whatman number
one tideline before

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:45.920
and after 21 days of aging.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.090
So here's to the day zero,
so you've got the chlorine,

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:56.880
potassium, sulfur, and calcium
peaks all fairly co-located

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.880
around the tideline.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.490
And then afterward,
now remember each

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:03.390
of these lines is normalized,

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:06.980
so essentially what's happened
here is that the chlorine

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:12.200
and the potassium, this
is really just noise.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:18.420
Those have really been lost
from this tideline area.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:23.820
All you see now are the strong
sulfur and calcium peaks.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:27.860
We wonder, you know, what is
happening to the chlorine?

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.130
Where is it going?

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:34.010
Here's, again now,
Dartmouth SEM images

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:38.200
of the Whatman number one
tideline after 21 days of aging.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.460
Again, you see the
tungsten needle marks.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.700
Here's the tideline here.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:48.310
We cut little notches
in the edge of the paper

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:52.630
to help us orient them
on the sample holders.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:54.840
So here, 21 days of aging.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.210
If you remember back
to the earlier spectra

00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:00.010
of Whatman number one, where
we had these decent size peaks

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:03.530
of sulfur and sodium
and calcium.

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:10.810
Now they're much, much smaller
with respect to the carbon

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:12.380
and [inaudible] peaks.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:18.600
And here's a comparison on the
UICB, the unsized UICB paper

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:24.450
after only 1.5 days of
aging above in the tideline

00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:26.140
and below the tideline.

00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:29.150
So again here's the tideline
marked with the holes.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:33.770
And here, you can actually see
the double tideline in the SEM

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:36.270
and you can see that
in the tideline --

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:39.290
sorry the font size
is so small --

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:42.090
but essentially you
can see the sodium

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:50.450
and calcium peaks here
and the magnesium.

00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:55.110
The peaks in order
are carbon, oxygen,

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:58.280
magnesium, sulfur, and calcium.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.300
And above the tideline
and below the tideline,

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:05.090
all you can basically
see is the calcium peak.

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:08.880
So all of those elements

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.930
in the paper are getting
brought to the tideline.

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:21.170
Here's more really nice false
color maps of that paper,

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:25.990
the UICB unsized
paper at age 21 days.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:29.380
You can see here the zones

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.830
with the different
elements are concentrated.

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:40.810
And this analysis also detected
sulfur and magnesium and calcium

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:44.420
but didn't detect any
chlorine or potassium.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:48.220
The bottom right image here,
which looks like a rainbow,

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:49.880
combines the assigned colors

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:54.420
and shows how the different
elements are deposited

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:59.700
as particles or bands and
they co-locate, for example,

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.100
in the case of the
magnesium and the sulfur.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:06.590
You see the red and the green
co-located here in the middle.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:11.210
And it's hard to say here
whether carbonates are present

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:13.550
but sulfates certainly are.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:18.160
So a big part of my work

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:21.100
on other materials is
a nondestructive method

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:22.400
called micro-CT.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.670
And if you don't
know micro-CT is,

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:28.920
I tell people it's essentially
like a CAT scan except

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.820
that people always are always
amused when I tell them this.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.270
The CAT scan in the hospital
it looks like a big doughnut

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:37.680
and it's got a source
and a detector in it,

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.490
and they rotate around
the patient.

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:41.570
And that's because if
you're sick particularly,

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:45.600
you don't want to
be spun in place.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:50.000
Well, l fortunately our
nonhuman samples don't have any

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.300
such concerns.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:57.060
So micro-CT's work by having
a fixed source and detector

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:59.840
and spinning the
sample in between them.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:04.990
So the sample is rotated
in a fixed number of steps,

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:09.620
and in each step an x-ray
attenuation image is captured.

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:13.280
And the projected
images actually impinge

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.580
on the scintillator

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.620
which converts the
x-rays to visible light.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.330
And then these images
are reconstructed

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:23.640
to produce 3-D images of
the internal structure

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.020
of the object, again,
nondestructively.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.550
So it's a fantastic technique

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:31.360
and the post processing can
produce not only beautiful

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.120
visualizations of the 3-D
structure, which we'll see

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:39.510
in a second, but an awful lot
of quantitative data about it

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.410
on a very detailed level.

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:42.710
For this project,

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.970
so at Dartmouth I have
a sky scan micro-CT

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:50.250
that has a theoretical
5 micron resolution.

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:52.220
I can push it down
to 3 sometimes

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.230
but for this project we wanted
a much higher resolution,

00:37:55.230 --> 00:38:01.980
so we used an [inaudible]
of 550 micro-CT at Cornell

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.160
at their School of Biotechnology

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:08.280
and it has a .77
micron resolution.

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:15.870
So these, again, we
used the sample holders

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:17.740
that we designed for this.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:22.270
So when you look at these images
here you can see the presence

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:23.570
of the sample holder.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:28.390
So in this image, here you're
looking face on at the sample.

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:32.500
You can see the frame
here holding the sample.

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:37.040
And these other images
are orthogonal slices

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.340
through the sample.

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.870
So here you're looking
essentially sideways at it.

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:43.970
You can see the edges of the
frame at the top and the bottom.

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:45.410
And here you're looking
down on it.

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:47.790
You can see the edges of
the frame there and there.

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:52.620
And so the area that we
were actually focusing

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:53.930
on was in the center here.

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:55.360
It was right on the tideline.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.710
And again with these samples,
we marked the tideline

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:01.760
with the tungsten needle
so that our colleague

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.010
at Cornell would know
exactly where to focus.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:06.350
And you will see in some
of the images that follow,

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:09.870
you can actually see
the little needle hole.

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:16.530
So the orthogonal
reconstructions on that page,

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:21.300
these orthogonal projections
are actually created

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:28.030
by the [inaudible]
software itself.

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:32.150
This beautiful projection was
actually made using Ocyrix

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:36.220
[phonetic] software, and while
it makes great visuals it's not

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:40.380
too useful for quantitative
analysis.

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:45.500
So what my student and I have
been doing is looking at a lot

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.390
of different packages for
quantitative analysis.

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:53.050
In retrospect, we could
probably travel to Cornell

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:55.940
and spend some time there using
their software but we're trying

00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:00.310
to find something that we
could use at home at Dartmouth.

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.670
And we've tried a bunch
of different things,

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:07.350
including [inaudible],
which is an FVI software,

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:11.810
an image J flavor called Fiji.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.500
So let's see.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:26.340
The Fiji image is this one here.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:30.900
And then most recently we
have started using Matlab

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:35.700
to create construct 3-D
volume from the TIF images,

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:38.750
actually the images that
the [inaudible] produces are

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:40.140
in a format called DICOM.

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.540
So first you have to
convert that to TIF,

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:46.750
and then you can use Matlab
to reconstruct the 3-D images

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:50.230
from that and to
segment the data.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:52.550
And the segmentation is
a really important part,

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:56.520
so I'll talk about that next.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.620
So being a structural person,

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:03.110
being a material scientist
type structural person,

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:07.190
I'm really interested in
what's going on structurally,

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.990
I mean chemically, yes, as well.

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:13.680
But I'm really a structural
kind scientist at heart.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:17.260
So I'm really interested in
how are those fibers changing

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.950
at the microscopic
level as a result

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:22.000
of the damage they're
undergoing?

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.830
We know there's
depolymerization.

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:30.490
But are the fibers or the
microfiber rolls being changed?

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:32.500
And they probably are.

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.010
We'd like to be able
to see that.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:36.540
So in order to see that, we have

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:42.260
to actually isolate individual
fibers in these reconstructions

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.920
so that we can look at
them individually rather

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.530
than as a clump if you will.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:50.340
So this is known as a
segmentation problem.

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:54.720
And to give you an example of
how much of a problem it is,

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:59.380
I show you a contrast here
between sea ice on the left

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.510
and paper on the right.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:04.710
And I know that's a weird
combination to make.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:06.410
It just happens to
be the other material

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:08.440
that I do a lot of micro-CT of.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:12.500
So what you see on the left
here, you see ice, of course,

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.920
is a three phase
system, so you've got ice

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.320
which is fairly fresh.

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.360
You've got super
salty brine channels,

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.570
and then you got
some air bubbles.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.330
And what you can do with the
micro-CT reconstruction is

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:25.400
to separate these
phases out and look

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.090
at them independently
of one another.

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:29.740
So here we've made
the ice invisible

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:33.680
and the air invisible
which is minuscule.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.950
Most of the sample
is ice or brine.

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:38.500
And all that's left here
are the brine pockets.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.760
These are vertical brine
channels that formed

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.730
when the sea ice formed.

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:48.250
And we've actually sorted them
based on their throat size.

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:51.410
When you have distinct
objects like this,

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:53.510
so whenever you analyze
micro-CT data,

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:54.920
you're working with objects.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.890
You have to say, "What's the
object I'm interested in?"

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:00.880
In paper, the object
would be a fiber.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.710
You know here the brine channels
as objects are quite distinct

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:06.560
from one another,
really easy to analyze

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.840
in isolation, if you will.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.390
Not so with paper.

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:13.580
So the segmentation problem
refers to the fact that we have

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.010
to figure out how to digitally
peel those fibers apart

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:19.910
from one another so we
can analyze the changes

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:25.070
in each separately and yet
within its native environment,

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:33.210
and we're still working on that.

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:36.880
So in summary overall,
in our model papers,

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:41.790
visible timelines do not form
on the gelatin sized papers.

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:46.240
Also in summary, we found
that the complementary methods

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.710
that we used were a very
effective way of looking

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.470
at the tideline system.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:54.440
Micro-XRF line scanning

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.510
and mapping were two
complementary methods.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:03.210
The Synchrotron or Bernano
[phonetic] XRF and the SEM

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:06.210
with the elemental mapping
were nice compliments

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:07.530
with one another.

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:10.270
And they all indicated
significant concentration

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:12.530
of metals in the tideline.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:14.740
And in particular, the elements

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:21.840
that were the most concentrated
were sulfur, potassium,

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:28.500
chlorine, along with sodium,
magnesium, iron, and calcium.

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.920
And we also found that
the localized deposition

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.870
and diffusion of elements
within tidelines after formation

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:39.030
and during aging is going on.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:42.410
And we don't really understand
yet what their significance is

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:45.900
in relation to the
known degradation,

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:49.810
the depolymerization
at the tidelines,

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:52.710
but that's an area
for future research.

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:58.220
So for future work, we plan
to look for more evidence

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:02.390
of the metal compounds or
complexes at the tidelines

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:06.830
and try to look at their
association with the effects

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:10.920
of degradation, possibly using
size exclusion chromatography.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:17.000
We hope to further investigate
this idea of the multiple zones

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.830
within the tidelines that
form with aging and we hope

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:24.380
to solve the segmentation
problem in the micro-CT images

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:27.490
so that we can collect
statistically significant data

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:31.450
on the changes going on
structurally at the fiber level.

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:37.360
So I would like to thank
my collaborators hugely

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.790
and their wonderful
colleagues, especially here

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:42.670
at the Library of Congress.

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:44.820
I'd also like to thank
the National Center

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:48.270
for Preservation Technology and
Training for funding my work

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:51.560
and the work of my students on
this project, and the Library

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.810
of Congress and Metropolitan
Museum of Art

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:55.800
for supporting my colleagues.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.250
And I like to think the beam
line scientists at Argonne

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:02.620
and Dartmouth Newcomb Institute
for Computational Sciences

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:05.410
for supporting our work on
the segmentation problem.

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:07.210
Thank you.

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:18.390
[ Applause ]

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:20.510
Questions?

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:31.270
[ Inaudible ]

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:35.740
&gt;&gt; Our feeling is that the metal
is coming from the paper itself

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.120
because the water
was melaque water.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.420
Yeah?

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:43.820
&gt;&gt; From your fluorescent images,

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:51.630
you have an idea what the
fluorescent material is?

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:52.930
[ Inaudible ]

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:54.230
.

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:57.000
&gt;&gt; Do you mean in the UV images?

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.250
&gt;&gt; Lynn B. Brostoff: It
wasn't the focus of our work,

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:03.340
but the work that Elmer
[Inaudible] Dupont has been

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:07.050
doing has focused a lot on
production of hydro peroxides,

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:11.060
and the organic compounds
that are forming peroxide

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.270
and that are soluble
or not soluble.

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:16.760
And Elmer and I would say
that there is an assumption

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.430
that the fluorescence
is associated

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:22.540
with those organic components.

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:24.020
&gt;&gt; Rachel Obbard: Yeah, and
so what's interesting is

00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:28.870
that in some cases we
don't see much fluorescence

00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:33.550
but we do see --
or I should say,

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:36.350
we see independently
sometimes fluorescence

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:40.080
and sometimes concentration
of elements at the tideline.

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:43.270
And those two things do not
necessarily go together.

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:45.970
As Lynn pointed out, the
fluorescence we think is coming

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:47.420
from the organic components.

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:52.390
&gt;&gt; When you've noted
diffusion of elements

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:59.920
after aging [inaudible], is
at the moisture in the air

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:04.100
that is enabling them to move

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:08.280
through the paper
during aging process&gt;

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.580
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:10.880
Have you thought about?

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.180
&gt;&gt; Lynn B. Brostoff:
Yeah, presumably.

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:15.630
But there's a lot of
moisture in paper.

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:21.710
We know that a lot of transport
goes on in normal atmospheres.

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:27.680
You know, the paper is
not immune even in the lab

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.980
to having things move around.

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:31.280
&gt;&gt; It's very interesting

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.050
to contrast these
results with a dry oven.

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:35.350
&gt;&gt; Rachel Obbard:
Yeah, it would be.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:36.650
I'm making a note of that.

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:38.950
&gt;&gt; Lynn B. Brostoff: And
in Elmer's early work,

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:44.170
he did that actually,
both dry and light aging,

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:49.600
and with slightly
different results the way the

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:50.900
changes were.

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.650
But he was looking
mostly with fluorescence.

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:56.350
I don't want to like,
[inaudible] sitting right there

00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:57.740
so if you want to comment.

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.540
&gt;&gt; I would just say that--

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:20.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.570
&gt;&gt; Lynn B. Brostoff: In my
experience the sulfa moves

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:24.040
like gang busters more
than anything else.

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.150
So we really see that
in the tidelines.

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:28.610
We've seen it with iron going.

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:31.560
Of course, there
are artificial aging

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.600
and they're meant to accelerate.

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:40.640
I think human oven aging does
make sense because we don't want

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:47.190
to [inaudible] aging often
changes the mechanisms.

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:50.170
It's artificial aging.

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:53.010
You hope it's giving you an
indication of what might happen

00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:55.720
in the future but you see
that's why we look so much

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:58.620
at the historical samples,
because we really thought a lot

00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:04.260
of the same kinds of
suggestions and phenomena.

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.330
&gt;&gt; Rachel Obbard: It's
worth doing a dry oven run

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:09.840
if we do another batch.

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.120
Other questions?

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:17.630
&gt;&gt; Are there any plans
to possibly washout any

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:20.260
of these tidelines
and see what remains

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:25.860
or do a secondary tideline
to see how that compares?

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:29.910
Taking one of these that have
already been established and...

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:32.340
&gt;&gt; Rachel Obbard: And produce
another tideline on it?

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:36.740
&gt;&gt;To see like where the movement
of the elements have gone?

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:38.040
&gt;&gt; Rachel Obbard: Yeah.

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.340
Another thing that would be
really interesting to do.

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:42.330
No, we don't have specific plans
to do so but we are planning

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:45.230
to work on this going forward.

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:48.570
And I'll add that to my list.

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:50.980
&gt;&gt; Lynn B. Brostoff: I think
as had been pointed out before,

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:55.220
that one of the reasons we
want to look at timelines is

00:50:55.220 --> 00:51:02.010
to understand better what might
occur with local treatment.

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:04.360
So [crosstalk] about that.

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:08.820
So yeah, I think if you are
doing an overall washing,

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.870
you know you're doing
something different.

00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:15.050
But the work that's been done
shows that even with washing,

00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:18.440
there's some lingering
damage that can occur.

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.100
So that's what the concern is.

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:22.380
It doesn't seem reversible,
all of it.

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:28.840
&gt;&gt; I was just curious in
the steps too when you try

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:32.280
to eliminate these tidelines,

00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:45.170
would you consider including
a conservator with your team.

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:49.610
Because the methods that
we use might not be known.

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:50.910
&gt;&gt; Lynn B. Brostoff:

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:53.040
We did actually have
someone at the Met.

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.340
What was her name?

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:55.640
&gt;&gt; Rachel Obbard:
Put me on the spot.

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:56.940
I'm bad with names.

00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:58.240
&gt;&gt; Lynn B. Brostoff:
You know her.

00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.540
&gt;&gt; Rachel Obbard: Lorena?

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:00.840
&gt;&gt; Lynn B. Brostoff: Yes.

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:02.140
She was working with us.

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.440
But of course, of right now --

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.330
&gt;&gt; Rachel Obbard: I
was depending on her

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:07.840
to convey the expertise
of the conservators,

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:12.420
but I realize she can't
speak for all of you.

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:15.340
&gt;&gt; Lynn B. Brostoff: The grant
funding is over for that grant.

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:16.920
&gt;&gt; Rachel Obbard: But we'll
be applying for some more.

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:18.270
So that's a great idea.

00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:21.950
Yeah, we should have a
conservator on our team.

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:27.340
Any other questions?

00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:34.510
&gt;&gt; All right, then thank
you very much for coming.
