00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.400
We have 11 ounces plus 29 ounces
plus 5 pounds is equal

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.780
to how many pounds,
or blank pounds?

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.350
So we need to add these three
quantities right here, and

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.130
they want us to give the
answer in pounds.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.880
And we can only add quantities
that have the same units.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.040
So let's just add these ounces
first, just to get

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.910
them out of the way.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.990
And then we could see, maybe we
can convert them to pounds,

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.420
or convert the pounds
to ounces.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.330
We'll probably convert them to
pounds, so that our final

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.520
answer is in pounds.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.300
So if we just add 11
ounces plus 29

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.560
ounces, what do we get?

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.150
Well, 11 plus 29 is 40.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.110
Let me write it like this.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.520
This right here is 40 ounces.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.380
So we need to add 40 ounces to
5 pounds to get a certain

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.450
number of pounds.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.690
So let's convert this right here
to pounds, and then, once

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.515
we have that in pounds, we can
just add it to that, and then

00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:56.510
we'll have our final answer.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.290
So 40 ounces, we want to
convert it to pounds.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.520
So we need to multiply it by
something where, in the units,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.780
we have ounces in the
denominator, and we have

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.170
pounds in the numerator.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.960
And we need that so that these
ounces cancel out with these

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.980
ounces, and we're just
left with pounds.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.430
And we know already that there
are 16 ounces per pound.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.650
So there are 16 ounces
per 1 pound.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.290
Or you could say there's 1 pound
per every 16 ounces.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.640
Or you could say there's 1/16
of a pound per ounce.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.900
Either way, if you multiply
these two quantities, the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.340
ounces cancel out.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.540
And this whole quantity becomes,
when you multiply it

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.720
out, you're left with
40 divided by 16.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.980
40/16.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.610
It's really 40 times 1
over 16, but the 1

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.840
doesn't change anything.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.990
And then 40/16 pounds.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.505
And let's see if we can write
this as a mixed number, or if

00:01:59.505 --> 00:02:01.100
we can simplify this
a little bit.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.160
Both of these numbers
are divisible by 8.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.449
So let's divide them
both by 8.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.220
If you divide 40 by
8, you get 5.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.620
You divide 16 by 8, you get 2.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.690
So it's 5/2.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.800
If we want to write this as a
mixed number-- or even better,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.880
let's write it as a decimal.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.040
This is 5 divided by 2.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.850
2 goes into 5 2 times.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.200
2 times 2 is 4.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.210
Subtract.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.630
You have a remainder, 1.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.110
We want a decimal, so let's put
the decimal right there

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.780
and keep bringing down 0's.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.340
So let's bring down
a 0 right there.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.950
2 goes into 10 5 times.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.690
5 times 2 is 10.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.760
And we have no remainder.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.120
So this is exactly 2.5,
which makes sense.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.440
5 over 2 is the same thing as
2 and 1/2 as a mixed number,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.770
which is the exact same
thing as 2.5.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.970
This first part right here
simplified down to 5/2 pounds,

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.430
or 2.5 pounds.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.285
So the problem becomes 2.5
pounds plus 5 pounds.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.980
And 2.5 plus 5, fairly
straightforward, it's 7.5.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.640
So this is equal
to 7.5 pounds.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.260
7.5 pounds is our answer,
and we're done.
