1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,980
The Joe Rogan experience
in working on music,

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:08,940
I was off fucking around competing and
paint ball tournaments that could get

3
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:10,740
into painful. Oh Man. Uh, yeah.

4
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:15,690
I had a team called stone to assassins
and it was competitive paintball at the

5
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:20,430
time. I was, you know,
training, uh, martial arts as
I've done throughout my life.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,293
And,
uh,

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,730
I was also playing competitive paypal
and a martial arts we're doing showed a

8
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:30,140
con. I started off with taekwondo
and I got sort of, I mean it's,

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:35,550
it's like, it was, uh, it was,
the Dojo was cool, you know,

10
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:38,160
and I was progressing quickly,

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,210
but I sort of fell out with the master
there with the sea floor or whatever.

12
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,750
I can't remember what Nim, yeah. And, uh,

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,710
one of my partners who I grew up with who
is one of my partners in our Dr. Green

14
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:54,240
thumb, um, Brandon,
whatever his father, um,

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,460
was, uh, was, uh, you know,

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,610
Sensei and his sensei
and became my sensei.

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,720
I went from taekwondo to show con and
I started training with him. I mean,

18
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:07,920
he had been in the Dojo since he was
five years old training with this father.

19
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:10,230
So, you know, I came into that, it took,

20
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,260
it took a little bit of a convincing
for me to go from one thing to another

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,880
because it's such a different
style. Um, but you know,

22
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:25,740
I adapted to it and I liked it and it
was, um, very different, less flash.

23
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,720
But, uh, it's very disciplined in,
in his father. You know, he was,

24
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,940
you know, born in Japan, raised out
there and he, he, you know, their,

25
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:38,550
their shit is kind of different.
They go to, to, to, um,

26
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,580
martial arts universities and they get
degrees in different martial arts so they

27
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:46,410
can go and take like,
okay,

28
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,760
hop Quito in Jujitsu and showed
O'Connell and all this and,

29
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,310
you know, get their, their
degrees, you know, they work,

30
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:56,340
they were up in the belt
system and all that stuff,

31
00:01:56,341 --> 00:02:00,240
but they become teachers through,
through that university,

32
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:03,060
I guess as fascinating.
And, uh, yeah, his,

33
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:06,660
his father was one of the guys in
one of the federations that, uh,

34
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,490
he's one of the three or four senses that
have to come in and give you the black

35
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:15,120
belt when you actually get
it. Ah, yeah. It, what was it,

36
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:20,121
a s k FFA or something like I
got this done karate federations.

37
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,030
Yeah, something like that. Yeah.

38
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,210
So you could imagine when Leo Machida
came on the scene, you know, we were like,

39
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:30,070
yeah, someone representing
the style that, you know,

40
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,610
we were training under anything yet a
lot of people got excited when he came

41
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,210
about.

42
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,260
He was really the first guy to legitimize
karate in the modern era of mixed

43
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:40,320
martial arts. You show like if you
could do all those other things,

44
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:42,060
if you could stuff take downs and you,

45
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,420
you knew submissions and all those things
on top of that, you could live. Yeah,

46
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:45,900
you could.

47
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,600
And you could do it in a weird way that
people didn't really understand his

48
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:52,800
timing. Yeah. Wonderboy Thompson similar
to that too. It's got a weird timing.

49
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:56,160
Weird timing. It's, it's, you know,
and then the faints with the hips.

50
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,280
He was good with that shit.
Like, you know, he, he would
throw people off with that.

51
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,650
And you know, we, I just happened to
go see his fight against Rashad Evans.

52
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,420
Oh Shit. And a man. I mean,
it surprised all of us. I
mean, we thought he would win,

53
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:13,490
but we didn't know he would win
in that fashion. I mean, yeah,

54
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,390
he was something special, you
know what I mean? And he's doing,

55
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,850
he's over at Bellator now,
right. With his brother.

56
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:22,100
His brother Chins has been over
there for awhile. His brother,

57
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,710
I think his brother's at Bantam weight
or featherweight, one of those. But, um,

58
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,790
yeah, that, that,

59
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,260
I think it's good to go from taekwondo
to other styles because taekwondo gives

60
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:35,230
you a lot of dexterity. You want, I'm
going to move your legs easily. Yes,

61
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:38,680
absolutely. It's a good foundation.
Yeah. It's a good way to start off.

62
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:41,560
It's good for little kids to the
guest that doesn't, you know,

63
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,950
there's not a lot of head contact
or not as a nation to, yeah. Yeah.

64
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:47,950
And then when you learn, if you weren't,
if you really actually want to fight,

65
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:51,610
you want to learn more. Tying all those
other things you have way quicker. Legs.

66
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,610
Yeah. They just move better.
Yeah. For me, you know,

67
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,600
I was never good with all those flashy
kicked kicks like that. So, you know,

68
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,310
big dude. Yeah. It was harder for me.

69
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:03,040
Tae Kwan doe like the show
Khan was definitely hard,

70
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,410
but it was more suited for
someone my size and style.

71
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,540
The of hardstyle it is style. And He,
you know, he, when he was training as,

72
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:15,340
he would not let up because he'd go be
reels here, let me go light on him now.
