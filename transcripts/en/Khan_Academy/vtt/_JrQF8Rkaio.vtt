00:00:00.224 --> 00:00:02.348
- [Voiceover] We have an
ellipse graphed right over here.

00:00:02.348 --> 00:00:03.486
What we're going to try to do is find

00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:05.378
the equation for this ellipse.

00:00:05.378 --> 00:00:07.062
Like always, pause this video and see

00:00:07.062 --> 00:00:09.601
if you can figure it out on your own.

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:10.345
All right,

00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:12.143
let's just remind ourselves

00:00:12.143 --> 00:00:14.199
the form of an equation of an ellipse.

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.321
Let's say our ellipse is centered

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:18.679
at the point ...

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.363
I'm going to speak in generalities first

00:00:20.363 --> 00:00:21.976
and then we'll think
about the specific numbers

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:23.660
for this particular ellipse.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.538
Say the center is at the point H,K

00:00:27.538 --> 00:00:31.902
and let's say that you
have a horizontal radius.

00:00:31.902 --> 00:00:33.957
So the radius in the X direction,

00:00:33.957 --> 00:00:36.895
horizontal radius,

00:00:38.055 --> 00:00:41.817
radius is equal to A.

00:00:41.817 --> 00:00:45.587
Let's say your vertical radius,

00:00:45.937 --> 00:00:48.692
let's say your vertical radius,

00:00:49.732 --> 00:00:54.516
radius is equal to B.

00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:56.525
Then the equation of this ellipse

00:00:56.525 --> 00:00:58.221
is going to be,

00:00:58.221 --> 00:01:03.221
is going to be X - H,

00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:09.082
X - H squared

00:01:09.237 --> 00:01:12.116
over your horizontal radius squared,

00:01:12.116 --> 00:01:14.600
so your radius in the X direction squared,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.909
plus,

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.361
plus, now we'll think
about what we're doing

00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:20.103
in the vertical direction.

00:01:20.103 --> 00:01:22.192
Y - ,

00:01:22.192 --> 00:01:26.476
Y - the Y coordinate of our center,

00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:31.116
so Y - K squared,

00:01:31.736 --> 00:01:33.592
over the vertical radius squared,

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:34.777
B squared

00:01:34.777 --> 00:01:36.692
is equal to 1.

00:01:36.692 --> 00:01:39.014
Is equal to 1.

00:01:39.014 --> 00:01:42.335
What are H and K and A
and B in this situation?

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:44.656
Well, H and K are pretty
easy to figure out.

00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:48.394
The center of this ellipse
is at the point ...

00:01:48.394 --> 00:01:51.163
See the X coordinate is -4

00:01:51.853 --> 00:01:55.069
and the Y coordinate is 3.

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.971
So this right over here is -4

00:01:57.971 --> 00:02:01.617
and this right over here is positive 3.

00:02:01.617 --> 00:02:04.008
What is A going to be?

00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:05.552
A is your horizontal radius,

00:02:05.552 --> 00:02:07.096
your radius in the horizontal direction,

00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:10.648
so it's the length of
this line right over here.

00:02:10.648 --> 00:02:14.851
We can see it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 units long.

00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:17.672
A in this case is equal to 5.

00:02:17.672 --> 00:02:20.795
This is going to be 5 squared.

00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:23.708
And B is our radius in
the vertical direction.

00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:26.552
We can see it's 1, 2, 3, 4 units.

00:02:26.552 --> 00:02:29.327
So B is equal to 4.

00:02:29.327 --> 00:02:31.069
So that is 4.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.635
We can rewrite this as,

00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:37.616
we can rewrite this as X - -4,

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:40.332
and we can simplify that in a second.

00:02:40.332 --> 00:02:45.047
X - -4 squared over 5 squared

00:02:45.047 --> 00:02:47.588
over our horizontal radius squared,

00:02:47.588 --> 00:02:49.794
so it's going to be 25

00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:54.794
plus Y - 3 squared.

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:59.592
Y minus the Y coordinate of our center.

00:02:59.592 --> 00:03:03.565
Y - 3 squared

00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:07.346
over our vertical radius squared,

00:03:07.346 --> 00:03:09.773
so B squared is going to be 16,

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:13.593
and that is going to be equal to 1.

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:15.902
Of course we could
simplify this a little bit.

00:03:15.902 --> 00:03:17.272
If I subtract a negative,

00:03:17.272 --> 00:03:20.105
that's the same thing
as adding a positive,

00:03:20.105 --> 00:03:22.705
so I can get rid of ...

00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:25.201
Instead of saying X - -4,

00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:28.150
I could just say X + 4.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.951
There you have it.

00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:32.480
We have the equation for this ellipse.
