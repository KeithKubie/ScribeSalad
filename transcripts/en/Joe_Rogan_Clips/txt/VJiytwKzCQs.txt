Speaker 1:          00:00          Using tools, so islands to go.

Speaker 2:          00:05          Apparently they use tools like to get, um, like they'll stick sticks into a ant hills to Cannes, but they're also use rocks to break things open or do you want to be, I would imagine Abe's would follow suit. I think they've, what they're saying is they're saying officially that they've entered into the stone age. Oh boy. So like if we are watching, if you saw a human evolve from being a, a person that you know what we, whatever the fuck we used to look like when they first figured out fish hooks teaching to today, you know, there's many, many generations of change and all, all sorts of different shit that we learned that we are watching literally the birth of that separation between like the regular chimps that are just chilling in the forest to the chimps that are starting to figure out tools and weapons. Like the first day we see a chimp make a fucking spear like a sphere, sharpen it up and stab another chimp

Speaker 1:          00:58          death. Yeah. Yeah. Same chimps are becoming woke. Is that what's happening? Like they're becoming an enlightened and smarter. I don't think just chimps. There was one with an orangutan. It was amazing. I'm around town was spearfishing. Oh No, dude, you gotta see it. It's crazy. It's really crazy. It's a beautiful photo of me walking down the highway with like a briefcase soon. I don't think it's going to be, they're freaky man. That freaks me out. But it is a, so we're witnessing evolution.

Speaker 2:          01:25          They're learning things. And this one, I think the issue was that this, uh, orangutan had watched fishermen do this, so he had apparently watched some fishermen like standing on a ledge and stab fish. So he decided to try to figure it out himself.

Speaker 1:          01:39          That makes sense. I mean, that's how all creatures essentially, I mean, puppies, kittens, they all learn. It's just to be, it's to a limit. They don't get past that sort of being able to use tools to get the picture. That's a wild, it was bringing a video too, so I thought there might've had video of it, but, um, my dog opened his dog, his dog food container when I was gone. Damn. A twist. A twist. Yes, we did it. I got to get a camera, but I came home and that top was twisted off in his belly was like the rang Tang spear phishing. I mean, that's crazy. If you saw that in a movie, you would say, that is fake. That is so easy. That looks like a still from jungle book. It's amazing. It's an amazing photo photo framed. Jimmy, get a copy of that photo and let's do that. That's really cool. That fucker framed. I talk about this picture all the time. It's so wild. So fascinating. It really looks like the jungle book.
