00:00:01.435 --> 00:00:04.431
- [Narrator] Akira receives
a prize at a science fair

00:00:04.431 --> 00:00:06.936
for having the most informative project.

00:00:06.936 --> 00:00:10.387
Her trophy is in the shape
of a square pyramid and is

00:00:10.387 --> 00:00:13.361
covered in shiny gold foil.

00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:15.513
So this is what her trophy looks like.

00:00:15.513 --> 00:00:18.769
How much gold foil did it
take to cover the trophy,

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.334
including the bottom?

00:00:21.334 --> 00:00:23.436
And so they give us some
dimensions and we want how

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:25.660
much gold foil and it's
in inches squared so it's

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.568
really going to be an area.

00:00:27.568 --> 00:00:29.223
So pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:29.223 --> 00:00:33.737
How much gold foil did it
take to cover the trophy?

00:00:33.737 --> 00:00:36.392
Alright now let's work
through this together.

00:00:36.392 --> 00:00:38.435
And so essentially what
they're asking is what is

00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:42.135
the surface area of this square pyramid.

00:00:42.135 --> 00:00:44.540
And we're doing to include
the base 'cause the surface

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.898
area is how much, it's
the area of the gold foil

00:00:48.898 --> 00:00:50.221
that is needed.

00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:52.422
Now, sometimes, some of
you might be able to think

00:00:52.422 --> 00:00:54.726
about this just by looking at this figure,

00:00:54.726 --> 00:00:57.062
but just to make sure
we don't miss any area,

00:00:57.062 --> 00:00:59.751
I'm gonna open up this
square pyramid and think

00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:01.637
about it in two dimensions.

00:01:01.637 --> 00:01:04.397
So what we're gonna do is
imagine if I were to unleash

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:08.334
or if I were to cut the top
and, let me do this in red,

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.584
if I were to cut this edge,

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:13.675
if I were to cut this edge,

00:01:14.585 --> 00:01:17.663
if I were to cut that edge, and that edge.

00:01:17.663 --> 00:01:22.051
So the edges that connect
the triangular sides

00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:24.498
and if I were to just open it all up,

00:01:24.498 --> 00:01:26.334
what would this look like?

00:01:26.334 --> 00:01:27.897
So if I were to open it all up?

00:01:27.897 --> 00:01:30.367
Well at the bottom you
would have your square base.

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:31.737
Let me color that in.

00:01:31.737 --> 00:01:34.154
So you have your square base.

00:01:35.263 --> 00:01:36.930
So let me draw that.

00:01:37.886 --> 00:01:41.521
You have your square base,
this is gonna be a rough

00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:42.354
drawing.

00:01:43.404 --> 00:01:45.007
And what are the dimensions there?

00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:47.277
It's three by three.

00:01:47.277 --> 00:01:49.286
We know this is a square
pyramid so the base,

00:01:49.286 --> 00:01:50.878
all the sides are the same.

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:52.914
They give us one side, but
then this is three inches

00:01:52.914 --> 00:01:55.165
then this is gonna be
three inches, as well.

00:01:55.165 --> 00:01:57.197
Let me color that same
color just so we recognize

00:01:57.197 --> 00:02:00.438
that we're talking about this same base.

00:02:00.438 --> 00:02:03.464
And now if we open up
the triangular faces,

00:02:03.464 --> 00:02:05.242
what's it going to look like?

00:02:05.242 --> 00:02:08.309
Well this is going to look like this.

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:11.407
This is a rough hand drawing,
hopefully it makes sense.

00:02:11.407 --> 00:02:13.899
This is going to look like this.

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:16.615
Each of these triangular
faces, they all have the exact

00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:17.448
same area.

00:02:19.963 --> 00:02:21.489
And the reason why I know
that, they all have the same

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.787
base, three, and they
all have the same height,

00:02:23.787 --> 00:02:25.213
six inches.

00:02:25.213 --> 00:02:27.372
I'll draw that in a second.

00:02:27.372 --> 00:02:30.163
So they all look something like this.

00:02:30.163 --> 00:02:31.753
Just hand drawing it.

00:02:31.753 --> 00:02:35.200
And all of their heights,
all of their height

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.178
are six inches.

00:02:36.178 --> 00:02:38.370
So this right over here is six inches.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.384
This over here is six inches.

00:02:41.384 --> 00:02:44.512
This over here is six
inches, and this over here

00:02:44.512 --> 00:02:46.383
is six inches.

00:02:46.383 --> 00:02:48.970
So to figure out how
much gold foil we need

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.410
we're trying to figure
out this surface area,

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.181
which is really just
gonna be the combined area

00:02:52.181 --> 00:02:53.888
of these figures.

00:02:53.888 --> 00:02:56.593
Well the area of this
central square is pretty easy

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:57.894
to figure out.

00:02:57.894 --> 00:02:59.989
It's three inches by three
inches so it would be

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.656
nine inches squared.

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:07.376
Now what are the area of the triangles?

00:03:07.376 --> 00:03:09.224
Well we could figure out
the area of one of the

00:03:09.224 --> 00:03:11.101
triangles and then multiply by four,

00:03:11.101 --> 00:03:12.653
since there are four triangles.

00:03:12.653 --> 00:03:15.835
So the area of this
triangle right over here,

00:03:15.835 --> 00:03:19.153
it's going to be 1/2 times our base,

00:03:19.153 --> 00:03:22.237
which is three, times three,

00:03:22.237 --> 00:03:24.820
times our height, which is six.

00:03:25.822 --> 00:03:27.803
Let's see, one half times three times six,

00:03:27.803 --> 00:03:31.999
that's one half times 18
which is equal to nine.

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:36.272
Nine square inches, or
nine inches squared.

00:03:36.272 --> 00:03:38.367
So what's gonna be our total area?

00:03:38.367 --> 00:03:42.603
Well you have the area
of your square base plus

00:03:42.603 --> 00:03:47.264
you have the four sides, which
each have an area of nine.

00:03:47.264 --> 00:03:49.637
So I could write it out, I
could write four times nine

00:03:49.637 --> 00:03:51.499
or I could write nine--

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:52.813
Do that black color.

00:03:52.813 --> 00:03:56.980
Or I would write nine plus
nine plus nine plus nine.

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:01.061
And just to remind ourselves,
that right over there

00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:03.978
is the area of one triangular face.

00:04:08.274 --> 00:04:10.607
Triangular, triangular face.

00:04:13.096 --> 00:04:16.090
So this is all of the triangular faces.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.507
Triangular faces.

00:04:19.803 --> 00:04:21.481
And of course we have
to add that to the area

00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:22.765
of our square base.

00:04:22.765 --> 00:04:25.088
So this is nine plus nine times four,

00:04:25.088 --> 00:04:27.019
you could do this as nine times five,

00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:30.093
which is going to be 45 square inches.

00:04:30.093 --> 00:04:33.843
Nine plus nine plus nine
plus nine plus nine.
