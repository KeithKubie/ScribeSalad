ALEX KOMOROSKE: Hi.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.780
Welcome.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.529
So we're going to get
started before we're

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:10.530
all full in this room
just for the live stream.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.440
I'm Alex Komoroske.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.169
I'm lead product manager on
Chrome's web platform team.

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:15.210
ELISABETH MORANT: And hi.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.880
My name is Elisabeth Morant
and I am the product manager

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.714
for Chrome security.

00:00:18.714 --> 00:00:20.254
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So
today, we're going

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:23.030
to tell you about four forces,
some of them old, some of them

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.420
new, that together
combine to create

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.580
the next generation mobile web.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.010
Now, a lot of times
at I/O, we tell you

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.920
about all kinds of
amazing features

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.730
that are going to come six
months, maybe a year from now,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.390
but today, we're going to cover
only things that are already

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.370
shipped in Chrome
that you can use.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.960
So we don't have that much
time, so we'll cover things

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.510
at a pretty high
level, but there's

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.670
lots of great
DevBytes and Box Talks

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.585
here at I/O that go into
more depth on all of these.

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:50.429
So let's get started.

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.220
So the reason that
Elisabeth and I are here

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.801
is because we love Chrome.

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:55.300
ELISABETH MORANT:
And we love Chrome

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.147
because, like many of
you, we love the web.

00:00:57.147 --> 00:00:58.980
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I mean,
it's kind of amazing

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.020
that you can connect with any
topic or community you want

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.099
without asking
anyone permission,

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.110
which allows all kinds
of wacky stuff to happen.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.930
So my personal
favorite is this site

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.560
called Real Ultimate Power.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.984
Anybody know what that is?

00:01:12.984 --> 00:01:14.400
So there's a few
of you out there.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.020
So this is this
amazing satire site.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.870
This guy has a
page about ninjas.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.147
He's super crazy into
ninjas and he hates pirates.

00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:23.480
ELISABETH MORANT: Oh, of course.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.030
ALEX KOMOROSKE:
That's important.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.540
But he just put
this site up there.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.170
People thought it was hilarious.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.620
They shared it.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.210
People found it and loved it.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.630
My crew team, we
actually found it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.344
and loved it so much
that we actually posed

00:01:35.344 --> 00:01:37.510
for a picture as ninjas and
uploaded it to the site.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.710
ELISABETH MORANT: OK.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.350
You have to show
everyone this photo.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.740
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.365
I'm trying to psych
myself up for that,

00:01:41.365 --> 00:01:43.620
but here's the picture
that I am extremely

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.612
proud of from a
number of years ago.

00:01:45.612 --> 00:01:47.070
ELISABETH MORANT:
Which one is you?

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.100
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So I'm
actually not entirely sure,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.550
but based on the
farmer's tan, I'm

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.800
pretty sure that that one's me.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.220
Anyway, I embarrassed myself,
you embarrass yourself.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.485
ELISABETH MORANT: OK.

00:01:56.485 --> 00:01:56.985
All right.

00:01:56.985 --> 00:01:58.800
I guess it's only fair.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.980
So when I was 12, I was really
into video games, especially

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.540
adventure games, so I
took to the internet

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.090
to make my first website.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.300
And clearly, this was my first
introduction to programming

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.710
and I owned up to it with
the giant space in the bottom

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.504
that I didn't know
how to get rid of.

00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:17.670
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Very subtle.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.520
ELISABETH MORANT:
But the point is

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.300
that this let me connect with
this huge community of people

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.197
out there who had the
same passions as I did.

00:02:23.197 --> 00:02:24.780
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah,
all 400 of them,

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.110
if I see that counter right.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.210
ELISABETH MORANT: Half of them
were me refreshing the page.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.530
Anyway, so these are just
a few weird examples,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.730
but the web is a really
powerful technology

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.180
that's enabled a number of very
thriving businesses to form.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.715
E-commerce alone in 2014 was
worth more than $1.5 trillion.

00:02:44.715 --> 00:02:45.590
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Jeez.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.700
ELISABETH MORANT: That's huge.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.600
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's
trillion with a T.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.530
ELISABETH MORANT: Yes.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.363
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Wow.

00:02:49.363 --> 00:02:51.800
So the point of this is
we've shared some examples

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.220
from our past, but
we're not alone.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.490
In fact, I bet that almost
everyone in this room

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.480
and on the live stream has
a connection to the web.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.880
It's this amazing, vibrant,
weird, global community

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.090
that we're all a part of.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.645
It's awesome.

00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:05.520
ELISABETH MORANT: OK.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.370
So the title of the talk is the
next generation mobile web, so

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.790
what are we doing on mobile?

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.456
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's
a great question.

00:03:12.456 --> 00:03:14.050
So mobile was a
fundamental shift.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.820
It changed the
assumptions from desktop.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.610
So performance became
incredibly important,

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.820
making sure that you could
hit 60 frames per second

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.170
on devices that were
running battery power.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.660
And there's other
capabilities that

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.900
just became totally critical.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.920
Push notifications,
for example, are

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.340
just crucial to how you
interact with your mobile device

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.170
and the web couldn't do it.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.950
To be honest, native
apps really just

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.860
were well suited to
this environment.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.330
ELISABETH MORANT: All right.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.860
So I guess we should all
just make native apps, then?

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.830
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I'm
not saying that.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.370
Now, native apps are great,
but the web is also amazing.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.080
In fact, a number
of its strengths

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.060
that made it so strong on
desktop are as strong as ever.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.100
So just the other
day I looked, and I

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.590
checked to see how many people
used DevTools in the past week.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.020
So as a point of
comparison, Android

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.260
is an amazingly
successful platform.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.280
I've seen public stats
somewhere around four million

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.230
or so for an estimate
for developers.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.580
So how many people do you
think loaded Chrome DevTools

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.340
in the past week?

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.460
ELISABETH MORANT: A week?

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.700
Maybe a million.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.200
ALEX KOMOROSKE:
Turns out the answer

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.390
is 25 million people
have used Chrome

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.149
DevTools in the last week.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.959
That's really cool because
that's not a stagnant number.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.240
That's actually
growing over time.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.510
So the point is not
all these people

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.950
are building huge,
complicated websites.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.145
Some of them are tinkering.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:33.600
But this community that we're
all a part of, it's huge, it's

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.600
strong, and it's growing.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.850
So this talk today
is for those people

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.210
in this community, those
25 million people who

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.050
love the web.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.261
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:48.760
ELISABETH MORANT:
So to start, we're

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.477
going to talk about reach,
the superpower of the web.

00:04:51.477 --> 00:04:54.060
ALEX KOMOROSKE: We're also then
talk about performance and how

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.710
we made big strides there.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.290
ELISABETH MORANT:
And finally, we're

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.040
going to talk about
engagement, how we're

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.130
helping you build
immersive experience that

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.000
keep users coming back.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.430
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So the three
of these separately, whatever.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.520
But together, combined
with that global community,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.890
that's something special.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.450
ELISABETH MORANT: So the
web is extremely successful,

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.180
largely because of
its reach, and we

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.450
don't give it enough credit.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.770
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I mean, we
give it a fair bit of credit.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.870
We understand that browsers
are on every device

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.420
and every operating system.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.670
ELISABETH MORANT: That's true.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.590
Even now cars have browsers and
we have over one billion Chrome

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.120
users, and that
doesn't even count

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.255
other browsers and other
people browsing the web.

00:05:31.255 --> 00:05:33.680
But what I'm talking
about is another aspect

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.470
of reach, that is, not
the reach of browsers

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.220
but the reach of content.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.360
So the way I think
about it is the web

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.860
is a series of trees
with nodes, right,

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.570
where every website is
a tree and the root is

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.376
like Pinterest.com,
and then you dig deep,

00:05:48.376 --> 00:05:50.250
and then you're on a
board and that's a leaf.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.630
And then if you jump
from URL to URL,

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.730
then you're jumping from
leaf node to leaf node

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.190
and so on and so
forth, and that's

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.982
why it's so easy jump
between link to link.

00:05:56.982 --> 00:05:58.648
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I
have literally no idea

00:05:58.648 --> 00:05:59.780
what you're talking about.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.140
ELISABETH MORANT: OK.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.410
Fair.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.450
Let me show you an example.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.366
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Great.

00:06:02.366 --> 00:06:05.930
ELISABETH MORANT: So if I
could jump to the demo laptop?

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.430
Great.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.451
So let's start on a video of the
latest Imagine Dragons single,

00:06:10.451 --> 00:06:10.950
"Shots."

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.680
So I know that every single
one of you in the audience

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.000
loves Imagine Dragons
probably not as much as I do.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.060
It's basically the best
band that's ever existed.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.430
It's better than
the Beatles, really.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.020
I could go on about it.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.373
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Wow.

00:06:20.373 --> 00:06:20.726
OK.

00:06:20.726 --> 00:06:21.226
Sure.

00:06:21.226 --> 00:06:24.710
ELISABETH MORANT: So the point
is the web, reach, trees,

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.210
right.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.850
So YouTube is a tree and
this particular piece

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.240
of video content is a node.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.390
And so I could just
share a URL with you

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.680
and then you can watch
this piece of content.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.340
And likewise, I can learn
more about Imagine Dragons,

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.640
navigate through YouTube,
maybe jump to Wikipedia.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.810
At this point, I've
jumped from one node

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.210
to the node of another
tree, the Wikipedia tree,

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.910
and I so easily reached a piece
of content deep in Wikipedia

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.870
just by clicking a link.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:02.090
And so from here, I
can read some articles,

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.580
jump around, learn
about Alt-J, jump back.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.970
I'm not going to bring
you through the entirety

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:08.840
of the web.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.740
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That
would take a long time.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.031
ELISABETH MORANT: And I can
jump to their band website.

00:07:13.031 --> 00:07:15.890
In this case, I
wouldn't necessarily

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.610
want an app for every
band that I love,

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.010
but I do want to be able
to go to their website

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.380
and learn about things like
when they're going on tour

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.480
and find out-- hey, Alex?

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.460
ALEX KOMOROSKE: What?

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.940
ELISABETH MORANT: Can you
take over for a second?

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.580
I just-- they're
on tour and I know

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.580
the tickets are
going to sell out

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.220
and I just really need to
buy a ticket right now.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:35.810
ALEX KOMOROSKE:
Are you kidding me?

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:36.330
ELISABETH MORANT: Please?

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.360
You know the slides.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:37.820
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.940
ELISABETH MORANT: Actually,
can we jump to WolfVision

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.870
so everyone can share in this
experience of buying tickets

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:42.400
with me?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:42.590
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Wow.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.230
You really love Imagine Dragons.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.959
ELISABETH MORANT: I
love Imagine Dragons.

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:45.750
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.458
While she's doing
that, it's kind of cool

00:07:47.458 --> 00:07:48.502
what she was doing.

00:07:48.502 --> 00:07:49.960
In the course of
a few seconds, she

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.250
visited what, like seven
different services,

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:53.920
all without installing anything.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.100
That's kind of cool.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.100
It's something that just
happens that we totally

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.977
take for granted on the web.

00:07:58.977 --> 00:08:00.310
ELISABETH MORANT: Anyway, sorry.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:00.810
I'm back.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:01.310
I'm back.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.312
I'm back, guys.

00:08:02.312 --> 00:08:04.270
So it turns out the
tickets aren't on sale yet,

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.300
so I just went to
their website and opted

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.090
to get a notification when
they come back on sale.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:09.960
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.956
ELISABETH MORANT:
Anyway, so where were we?

00:08:11.956 --> 00:08:14.107
Can we go back to the slides?

00:08:14.107 --> 00:08:16.065
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Something
about reach, I think.

00:08:16.065 --> 00:08:17.190
ELISABETH MORANT: Oh right.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.740
Friction.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.650
Friction sucks, friction
being the amount of overhead

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.340
from a user wanting to get
somewhere to actually being

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.910
able to get to that piece
of content, and on the web,

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.749
it's as easy as
just tapping a link.

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:30.540
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.669
So I think I see
what's going on here

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.154
but this seems all
really abstract.

00:08:34.154 --> 00:08:36.320
Is this something that
actually matters in practice?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.278
ELISABETH MORANT: Yeah.

00:08:37.278 --> 00:08:39.240
So here's something.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:45.550
On average, the average person
uses around 12 to 20 apps

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.500
per month on their phone.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.120
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Depending
on which stat you use.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.190
ELISABETH MORANT: Yeah,
depending on what source

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.270
you look at.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.760
So keeping that in mind,
guess how many sites

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.829
the average Chrome for Android
user visits in every month.

00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:56.620
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.170
So are we including third party
content and iframes and stuff?

00:08:59.170 --> 00:08:59.270
ELISABETH MORANT: No.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.160
I'm talking about
direct link navigation,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.550
going through the Omnibox.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.980
This is all unique domains.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:04.771
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:05.960
So 12 to 20 for apps.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.860
Maybe double that,
like 40 or so.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.117
ELISABETH MORANT: Over
100 websites a month.

00:09:12.117 --> 00:09:12.950
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Wow.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.040
That's actually
really impressive.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.090
I didn't realize it was
going to be that big.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:15.430
ELISABETH MORANT: See?

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.930
That right there
is reach in action.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.850
It's so easy for people
to just tap a link

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:23.090
and visit tons of new
sites with no friction.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.070
And in fact, it turns out
that 85% of US retailers'

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.110
mobile traffic is on the
web, and that accounts

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.307
for 90% of their revenue.

00:09:29.307 --> 00:09:30.140
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Wow.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.264
ELISABETH MORANT: And now
this is just one example,

00:09:32.264 --> 00:09:35.880
and this is why I consider
reach the superpower of the web.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.960
So the way I think of it is--
bear with me-- you want people

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.410
to form a meaningful
relationship with your stuff,

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.570
but first people
have to find it.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.100
So it's kind of like the web
is one big speed dating venue

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.890
where you can jump from person
to person and get to know them

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.420
a little bit, just like you can
jump from website to website

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.461
and get to know it a little
bit before committing

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:58.310
and developing a relationship
with that content.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.730
And you're never afraid
to necessarily click

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.860
a link because what's the
worst that can happen?

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.610
After five minutes,
the bell rings and you

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.406
move onto the next place.

00:10:06.406 --> 00:10:09.030
And the point is that then, when
you decide you want to commit,

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.450
you can build that
relationship over time.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.490
And so we take reach for
granted but it's really

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:14.962
as important as ever.

00:10:14.962 --> 00:10:16.920
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So that's
reach, but of course,

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.660
just as important on
mobile is performance.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.160
But what does good
performance mean?

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.710
How do you know when you're done
and when you're good enough?

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.210
ELISABETH MORANT:
Well, that's easy.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.030
It's just the amount of time
it takes a page to load.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.010
ALEX KOMOROSKE:
So page load time

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.301
is something that we've all
known about as a community.

00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:31.680
We call it PLT or whatever.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.100
We have good understanding,
got good tools.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.047
There's whole conferences on it.

00:10:36.047 --> 00:10:37.880
That's not to say we're
perfect, by the way.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.588
There's a lot of us
who don't necessarily

00:10:39.588 --> 00:10:41.240
practice what we preach here.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.990
But on mobile, other
metrics matter, too,

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.115
like scrolling performance.

00:10:45.115 --> 00:10:47.700
To have the illusion that
the content is sticking

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.310
to your finger as
you scroll, you've

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.660
got to hit 60 frames
per second consistently.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.160
But which of these
metrics should we

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.020
look at and which one
should we be optimizing?

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.472
So the answer to that is this
concept that we call RAIL.

00:10:58.472 --> 00:11:00.180
ELISABETH MORANT:
Great, another acronym.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:00.890
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Of course.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:01.990
What did you expect?

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.810
So it's basically a
conceptual framework

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.380
for knowing when you have
good enough performance.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.080
So the key insight is when
is performance good enough?

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.162
Well, when the user
can't perceive it.

00:11:11.162 --> 00:11:12.370
That's when it's good enough.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:13.770
ELISABETH MORANT: I'm pretty
sure Don Draper didn't actually

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.365
say that.

00:11:14.365 --> 00:11:15.490
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Good catch.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.031
He didn't say that,
as far as I know,

00:11:17.031 --> 00:11:18.733
but he might have
said it if only

00:11:18.733 --> 00:11:20.490
he had cared about
this kind of stuff.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.865
But the point is
there's actually

00:11:21.865 --> 00:11:23.280
a lot of research on this.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.050
So if you're trying to get
that illusion of smooth motion,

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.300
of course you want to
hit 60 frames per second,

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.850
which means 16.67 milliseconds
to put each frame on screen.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:34.970
Now, if you want to
have the user feel

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.040
that the thing happened
instantaneously,

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.060
research tells us you've
got about 100 milliseconds.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.930
And if you do something
within one second, well then,

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.769
someone's train of
thought can stay on it,

00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:47.310
and if you take more
than 10 seconds,

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.690
well then they're off playing
solitaire or something.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.080
ELISABETH MORANT: Definitely
took more than 10 seconds.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.121
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Thank you
for that great example.

00:11:53.121 --> 00:11:56.690
So anyway, these are the
golden standard for you to hit,

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.320
and RAIL is basically
just hitting

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.890
these goals in the context
of your web performance.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.150
So the first one is
R for reaction time.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.740
So basically, this
is exactly when

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.880
the user puts their
finger down on the glass

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:10.890
and starts interacting.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.474
You have 100 milliseconds to do
something, to show you got it.

00:12:13.474 --> 00:12:14.681
ELISABETH MORANT: Yeah, sure.

00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:16.781
Otherwise, the app
feels broken or slow.

00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:17.780
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Exactly.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.560
So that's 100 milliseconds
to change the button color

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.120
or to show a loading
indicator or show, I got it.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.620
I'm not frozen.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.660
Next one is Animation time.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.470
You've got, of course,
60 frames per second

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.380
is the gold standard, which
means 16.67 milliseconds.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.470
Now, that's not a lot of
time, so if you do anything,

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:39.300
you might miss that, so you
have to really, really careful.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.049
So the next one is Idle.

00:12:42.049 --> 00:12:43.840
ELISABETH MORANT: Why
is Idle part of RAIL?

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.470
ALEX KOMOROSKE:
So you have to do

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.280
some work that's going to take
some time, like image decodes

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.060
or whatever, and you can't do
it when the user is interacting,

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.046
so a good time is when
the user doesn't have

00:12:54.046 --> 00:12:55.170
their finger on the screen.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.050
ELISABETH MORANT: Right.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.591
ALEX KOMOROSKE: However, what
if the user's finger comes back

00:12:58.591 --> 00:13:00.170
in while you're doing that work?

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:00.650
ELISABETH MORANT: I see.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:01.920
You don't want to be
the middle of idle time

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.570
because otherwise, you're not
going to be able to react.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.300
The user might think
the app is broken.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:05.520
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Right.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.710
So you want to make sure
you chunk up your work you

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.840
that you even in idle
so if at any point

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.400
the user starts interacting
with you, you're good to go

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.170
and can hit that 100
milliseconds, the R of RAIL.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.100
And the last one, of course,
is our friend Load time.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.197
Of course, it still matters,
if not more, on mobile.

00:13:22.197 --> 00:13:24.030
And the gold standard
here to keep the train

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.782
of thought solid is one second.

00:13:25.782 --> 00:13:27.990
ELISABETH MORANT: I wish
everything loaded that fast.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.865
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah.

00:13:28.865 --> 00:13:29.920
It's pretty low, right?

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.530
Remember, this is for
perfect performance,

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.450
and things like Quick
and Service Worker

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.590
actually make this feasible
for the first time.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.070
And of course, if you can't
get your entire site loaded up

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.910
on screen, well,
the next best thing

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.200
is putting reasonable pixels
on screen to show I've loaded,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.559
I'm working, I'm not just stuck.

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:48.350
ELISABETH MORANT: Sure,
some loading image.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.890
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Right.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.270
ELISABETH MORANT: So this
is all great in theory,

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:52.010
but what does it actually
mean in practice?

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.301
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So RAIL is
a great conceptual framework

00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:55.470
for us across the community.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.980
So for browser
vendors in particular,

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.080
it means giving
you as developers

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.690
more headroom, more
space for your own code

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:06.990
to do this work so that you
don't cross those boundaries.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.120
So the Chrome Web
Platform team is

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.450
way over-- I think 200
engineers last time I checked.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.100
A lot of people,
the vast majority,

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.630
work on some aspect
of performance.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.520
We've been doing tons of
work, vast re-architectures,

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.570
to optimize for
mobile performance.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.730
Now, we don't have time to dive
into any of these in any depth,

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.170
but let me just pick one.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.220
So a couple months ago,
we launched this feature

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.470
called the Scheduler.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.180
And the basic idea
is that when you

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.890
start interacting with a
page, that's when, of course,

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.390
you want to prioritize scrolling
and frames over everything

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:39.260
else.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.324
And it turns out that this
can have a really big impact,

00:14:42.324 --> 00:14:43.990
especially during
page load when there's

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.780
lots of work being done.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.740
So here we've got a video,
and if you can roll the video,

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.580
we have on the left with
the scheduler, on the right

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.390
without.

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:55.300
We refresh the page so
we're doing tons of work,

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.980
and you can see the one
on the left scrolls way

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.740
more smoothly than
the one on the right.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.140
So this is a great example of
RAIL motivating work for us

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.570
as browser vendors to
make your site just

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:07.820
get faster automatically.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.276
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:09.276 --> 00:15:09.776
Thanks.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.640
So if we can move on
to the next slide.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.630
So it's not just on us.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:21.770
It's also on developers
that work with us.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.570
And so part of it
is better tooling

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.880
so that you can understand your
own performance really well.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.720
So of course, DevTools
is incredibly powerful.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.250
A new feature that you can try
out in Canary behind the flag

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:35.400
today is a feature
called Filmstrip.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.530
So what it does, it shows
you-- you can see it up there

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.310
in that row of
images-- it shows what

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.380
pixels were on screen
at different parts

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.830
as you loaded the page.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.430
And so you can see here
this random cwilso guy,

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:51.870
his blog is hitting about
eight seconds for the pixels

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.640
to be on screen, which
is way past the one

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.410
second that you want with RAIL.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:58.460
And so now, of course,
you dig in with DevTools

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.620
and figure out what's going on.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.619
ELISABETH MORANT: So
DevTools is really powerful

00:16:01.619 --> 00:16:03.930
but you basically need a
PhD to understand all of it.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:04.804
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah.

00:16:04.804 --> 00:16:06.870
It's so overwhelmingly
powerful sometimes.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.460
So we're also
working on tools that

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.660
will make it so that
you can open up DevTools

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.930
and it will say, hey,
you're consistently

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.640
missing the A in RAIL.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.520
Turns out that this third party
script, this analytic script,

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.740
is doing way too
much work on scroll.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.060
Consider removing it.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.020
And so making it much
easier for you to dive in

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.112
without having to get a PhD.

00:16:26.112 --> 00:16:27.570
And of course, the
last one is just

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.400
holding ourselves
as web developers

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.920
to a higher standard.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.660
So the I/O web app
is an amazing example

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.070
of a highly responsive, 60
frames per second web app.

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:41.300
Now, it wasn't easy to build but
it is getting easier and easier

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.550
every day.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.520
And all of us,
every single time we

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.930
include a third party
script or resource

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.361
or we fetch out to another
third party domain,

00:16:49.361 --> 00:16:51.110
we should ask ourselves,
is this worth it?

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:55.900
Is this going to make me go
past those goals in RAIL?

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.060
So there's only so much
time to cover performance.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.190
The point is that we've
made a lot of big strides

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.150
and I think this is a
great framework for us

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.960
as a community.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.650
ELISABETH MORANT: So the web
has a superpower of reach,

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.270
and now it's possible to have
60 frames per second, even

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.420
for the most
complex mobile apps,

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.390
but what the web is
missing is the ability

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.319
for users to build meaningful
relationships with the stuff

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.653
that they find to really engage.

00:17:17.653 --> 00:17:18.527
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah.

00:17:18.527 --> 00:17:19.902
So I mean, speed
dating is great.

00:17:19.902 --> 00:17:22.568
You meet a whole bunch of people
in a very short amount of time,

00:17:22.568 --> 00:17:24.260
but what if you meet
that person and you

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.020
got a little bit of a spark?

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.039
You want to get to
know them a little bit.

00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:29.580
ELISABETH MORANT: Exactly, and
native apps are great at this.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:29.830
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:30.690
I've got an idea.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.231
Why don't we just
list all the things

00:17:32.231 --> 00:17:34.439
native apps can do and
just copy that for the web?

00:17:34.439 --> 00:17:36.480
ELISABETH MORANT: Well,
I wish it were that easy.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.640
The problem is that
with every new API also

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.260
comes a whole new
set of risks, and we

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.980
want to maintain the
security guarantees

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.390
of the web, the ability
for users to jump to a link

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.820
and not worry that something's
going to happen to them.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.560
So let's take, for example,
background sync, background

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:56.050
sync being the ability for an
app to fetch and send content

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:58.300
when the app is closed.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.759
So if you're visiting
over 100 sites a month,

00:18:01.759 --> 00:18:04.300
then you don't necessarily want
them all to arbitrarily start

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.840
syncing the background.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.700
Just like let's say you
browse some embarrassing sites

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.630
at home, like some
celebrity gossip site.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.577
I'm not going to call
what celebrity Alex is

00:18:12.577 --> 00:18:13.160
obsessed with.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:13.760
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Guilty.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.150
ELISABETH MORANT: And
then you go to work,

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:16.900
and in the meantime,
your phone lost battery.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.520
You turn it on when you get
to work, and all of a sudden,

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.686
you start fetching embarrassing
content while you're

00:18:20.686 --> 00:18:22.009
on your corporate network.

00:18:22.009 --> 00:18:23.800
Well, we're trying to
save people like Alex

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.099
from an embarrassing visit
to the sys admin's office.

00:18:26.099 --> 00:18:26.890
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:27.900
I get that.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:28.890
I see.

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.056
ELISABETH MORANT: And so
basically, if we bring back

00:18:31.056 --> 00:18:33.020
the speed dating
metaphor, let's say

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.380
that you meet someone
for the first time

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.660
and you really feel that
spark and you think,

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.030
this could be the one.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.902
Do you give them the
keys to your apartment,

00:18:40.902 --> 00:18:43.110
introduce them to your
parents, bend down on one knee

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.790
and vow to spend the rest
of your life together?

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:45.230
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yes.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.105
ELISABETH MORANT: No.

00:18:46.105 --> 00:18:47.670
Of course not.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.750
Jeez, that could
be a serial killer.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:54.580
So the idea is that you want
to build a relationship slowly.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.110
The problem is that we can't
necessarily emulate or copy

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:59.780
the powerful model
of native apps

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.840
because native apps have a
store, they have ops teams,

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.360
and the web is open.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.720
And so what we want
to do is enable

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.130
websites to progressively
ask permission

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.270
for powerful and
engaging features.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.810
And the idea is
that users should

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.710
be able to indicate
when they want

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:18.390
to trust this site enough to
give them certain permissions.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.240
Basically, if everyone got
access to your bank account

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.030
as soon as you met
them, you probably

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.480
wouldn't want to
leave your house.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.520
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So it's
more important for the reach

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.480
of the web than to have
all these capabilities

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.860
for every random site you go to.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:30.250
ELISABETH MORANT: Exactly.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.420
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Got it.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.795
ELISABETH MORANT:
And so the idea

00:19:32.795 --> 00:19:35.230
is that with all these new
APIs come a set of risks,

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:37.380
and Chrome has
this responsibility

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:41.089
to make sure that people can
still browse the web securely.

00:19:41.089 --> 00:19:42.630
Now, with this in
mind, we've already

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.600
brought a few exciting
APIs to the web

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.530
and we're going to talk
about two of them right now.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:49.800
The first is Add to Homescreen.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.440
So typing, especially
on a mobile,

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.482
is really hard, but mobile is
where people go to kill time.

00:19:55.482 --> 00:19:57.690
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So, I mean,
you go to the coffee shop

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:58.523
to meet your friend.

00:19:58.523 --> 00:19:59.564
They aren't there yet.

00:19:59.564 --> 00:20:01.480
You want to read something
interesting but not

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.830
too interesting because at
any point they might show up

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:04.850
and you have to put
your phone away.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:05.933
ELISABETH MORANT: Exactly.

00:20:05.933 --> 00:20:08.190
So you open up your
phone, you tap an icon,

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.700
and you fall into
some experience

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.690
that you're OK jumping
back out of again.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.210
And so we already have
the ability for people

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:18.890
to add sites to
their home screen.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.800
It's buried deep
in the settings,

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.634
but we found it had
surprisingly high usage.

00:20:22.634 --> 00:20:25.258
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So why don't we
just make that way more obvious

00:20:25.258 --> 00:20:26.592
and make it really hard to miss?

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:27.966
ELISABETH MORANT:
Well, if people

00:20:27.966 --> 00:20:29.550
are visiting 100
websites every month,

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:33.300
then probably every new
help form you go to,

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.860
you don't want to necessarily
add it to your home screen.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.700
And so what we've done is we've
incorporated some really smart

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.490
heuristics and said
developers can use this API

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.520
and request to be added
to the home screen

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.190
as long as people have in
each with the app enough

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.410
that we've detected
that they actually want

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.890
that app on their home screen.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.170
So take this as an example.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:55.920
I really enjoy
reading Vice News,

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.050
and I read an article
earlier this week.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.060
And this morning I
opened it up again,

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.990
And I found that I got this
prompt from Vice to add

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.749
the website to my home screen.

00:21:05.749 --> 00:21:06.540
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.539
That's awesome, but what
happens if you tap that

00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:09.950
and you don't have connectivity?

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:10.680
ELISABETH MORANT:
Well, what you don't

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.210
want to see is the
dreaded offline dinosaur,

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:16.020
and so native apps actually
handle this case very well.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.790
Even if an app depends
on connectivity to work,

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.230
they usually have some sort
of splash screen saying,

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.420
sorry, you can't use
this, but come back later,

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.826
something custom to the app.

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:26.450
And for that reason,
we've only enabled

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:28.040
Add to Homescreen
for those sites that

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.840
have a meaningful
offline experience.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.760
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Which
is a great point

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.830
that offline is an
incredibly important thing

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.910
for building engaging
experiences on mobile web.

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.240
So obviously, on
your mobile devices,

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.100
you're way more likely to
have a flaky connectivity

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.190
or no connectivity, like being
at a tech conference where

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.700
the Wi-Fi doesn't work
exactly as it should.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.740
The problem is that
historically, we've only

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.150
had App Cache to handle this.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:53.630
ELISABETH MORANT: So what's
the problem with App Cache?

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.900
ALEX KOMOROSKE: App Cache
wasn't exactly very popular.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.070
So it was easy to get
started, which is great,

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.480
and it's declarative,
which is also great,

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.190
but it's kind of complex.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.822
If you do anything
rather slightly complex,

00:22:06.822 --> 00:22:08.405
you can't do the
things you want to do

00:22:08.405 --> 00:22:09.712
and it quickly falls down.

00:22:09.712 --> 00:22:10.920
It is unworkable in practice.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.670
So what you need, of
course, is more control,

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.180
and Service Worker
brings you that control.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:18.620
So let me tell you how it works.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.320
The basic idea is
when you visit a site,

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.941
you can install
a Service Worker,

00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:24.440
and that Service
Worker is basically

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.670
a script off to the side.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.700
And now, when the
browser is going

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.260
to fetch a resource
from your domain,

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.200
instead of going
to the network, it

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.740
asks the Service Worker,
hey, what do you want to do?

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.454
And the Service Worker
can say, just do

00:22:38.454 --> 00:22:40.620
what you would have done,
go to the network, please,

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.260
or it can say, please hand
back this thing from the cache,

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.900
or it can even say, create
a resource on the fly

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:48.500
and pass that.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.000
ELISABETH MORANT:
So basically, it's

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.001
a client side proxy
written in JavaScript.

00:22:52.001 --> 00:22:53.000
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Exactly.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.890
So this allows you
to build arbitrarily

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.970
complex offline experiences.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:00.000
And when I say "arbitrarily,"
what I mean is you

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.780
can build something extremely
complex or extremely simple.

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.920
So the I/O web app
is a great example

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.730
of a complex offline web app.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.727
It does very careful caching
so that even if you load it

00:23:10.727 --> 00:23:13.060
when you're fully offline,
you get something meaningful,

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.700
but then when you're connected,
it will show you UI about, hey,

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:16.616
there's fresh content.

00:23:16.616 --> 00:23:18.530
Tap here to see it.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.090
Of course, a more likely
scenario or easier scenario

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.580
is just to aggressively
cache everything

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.340
you use so that your
thing works offline.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.520
There's a great Gulp
plug-in called sw-precache

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.950
that makes it incredibly easy to
integrate into your workflows.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.460
And of course, the simplest
possible thing you can do

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.400
is get rid of that darn
offline dinosaur for your thing

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.720
and basically say,
hey Service Worker,

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.520
if the user tries to fetch my
site and we're fully offline,

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.250
instead of showing
the offline dinosaur,

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.010
just show my own
little splash screen

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.200
that says, please connect to
the internet and try again.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.630
That takes only a few
lines of JavaScript.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.900
So Service Worker
is cool for offline,

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.690
but it has another
trick up its sleeve.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:03.780
So a Service Worker, a single
one, can talk to multiple tabs

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.540
or it can talk to no tabs.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.800
So it's the first place that
we as developers have a place

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.240
to write and run script even
when no tabs for my site

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:13.970
are open.

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.178
ELISABETH MORANT: That's bad.

00:24:15.178 --> 00:24:17.127
People don't want any
random site executing

00:24:17.127 --> 00:24:18.210
scripts in the background.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.160
ALEX KOMOROSKE:
Exactly, and that's

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.190
why Service Workers
are event driven.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.841
So what happens is a networking
event happens, the browser goes

00:24:23.841 --> 00:24:25.340
to the Service
Worker and says, hey,

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.830
I've got this network event.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:28.706
Service worker handles
it and then it's done.

00:24:28.706 --> 00:24:30.913
It's just sitting there not
doing anything because it

00:24:30.913 --> 00:24:31.525
can't.

00:24:31.525 --> 00:24:33.650
And so at that point, we
can freeze dry that thing,

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:34.880
put it off in storage.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.370
ELISABETH MORANT: Right, until
the browser sends a new event

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.140
to wake it up.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:37.600
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Exactly.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.330
So when a new event
comes in, we bring it

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.205
back into memory really
quickly, which takes,

00:24:41.205 --> 00:24:44.580
I think, around 50 milliseconds
or so in practice in the wild,

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:47.070
and then it can go on its way.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.630
So the cool thing is that
this isn't just related

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:52.180
to network events.

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.620
You can also imagine
other types of events

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.110
that would potentially
wake it up to do work.

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.340
ELISABETH MORANT: I see.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.975
So the browser can
choose what type of event

00:24:58.975 --> 00:25:01.450
it wants to send based on what
it thinks the user actually

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:01.950
wants.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:02.950
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Exactly.

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.340
So this is really powerful.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.960
It enables an entirely
new class of functionality

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.590
that before wasn't even
possible to bring to the web.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.840
ELISABETH MORANT: So one of
the new features only made

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.430
possible because of Service
Worker is push notifications.

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.465
Until now, only native
apps were able to send

00:25:18.465 --> 00:25:19.840
push notifications,
but there are

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.850
cases where you would want push
without everything else that

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.285
comes with being an app.

00:25:24.285 --> 00:25:25.910
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So
are these important?

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:26.140
ELISABETH MORANT: Yeah.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.900
This is extremely important.

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:31.240
Basically, notifications are
game changing for engagement.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.550
More and more, people are
interacting with their phone,

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.090
opening up new apps
and experiences largely

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:37.970
because they got a
notification first,

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.780
and it's much less common that
people will open up their phone

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.242
and dumbly look
at their app grid

00:25:42.242 --> 00:25:44.380
and decide what
they want to use.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.440
Here's an example.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.930
So the Guardian has
a native app and they

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:52.890
found that in the hours after a
breaking news event, up to 40%

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:55.930
of their article views came
from push notifications alone.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.005
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Wow.

00:25:57.005 --> 00:25:58.330
ELISABETH MORANT: It's huge.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.360
And so to demonstrate
how important this is,

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.560
I'm going to jump into a demo.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.674
So nine months ago, Oscars
season, I was at home

00:26:07.674 --> 00:26:09.090
but I had to do a
lot of work so I

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.470
wasn't able to watch
the Academy Awards live.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.170
This was a huge bummer for me,
so what I ended up doing was

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.100
I would jump between
my computer and then I

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.720
kept refreshing the Guardian
live blog to see who had won.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.350
And what I would
do is I'd refresh

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.990
and I'd see what Reese
Witherspoon is wearing,

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:26.640
and then I'd click
on that and look

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.830
at some of her past filmography,
and then just get distracted

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:30.180
and jump back to my computer.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.380
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Basically,
getting nothing done.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:32.338
ELISABETH MORANT: Yeah.

00:26:32.338 --> 00:26:34.828
Basically, I was not getting
anything done, or at least

00:26:34.828 --> 00:26:37.360
I wasn't getting a
lot of work done.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.090
But what if the Guardian
had push notifications?

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.600
What if I didn't have
to jump in and engage

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.070
and instead the Guardian told
me when there was information

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.080
that I actually wanted to know.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:53.520
So suppose I open up the
live blog and I scroll down

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.130
and I see the ability
to follow the story.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.152
So the Guardian
explains why I'd want

00:26:58.152 --> 00:26:59.690
to opt in to
notifications, I want

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:01.930
to engage with this
particular piece of content,

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:05.064
so I hit Enable
Browser Notifications.

00:27:05.064 --> 00:27:06.980
And at this point, Chrome
sends me the prompt,

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:11.020
and yes, I want
notifications, so I say Allow.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:11.710
Great.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:14.050
So, now confident that I'm
going to get notifications

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.549
about the content
I'm interested in,

00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:22.110
I can just close Chrome
and get back to work.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:29.420
So I'm working and I
see a notification.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.760
I don't know if you can see it.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.740
I haven't tested this out.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.670
So I see a notification
on my watch

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:37.780
that says that sound
editing won some award.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:41.170
Now, this is one of those lame
awards so I just swipe it away.

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:42.160
I don't care.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.150
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So you
got that on your watch?

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:44.108
ELISABETH MORANT: Yeah.

00:27:44.108 --> 00:27:46.990
I got it on my watch because
Chrome sends notifications

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:49.719
just like any other Android app
would, and in that same way,

00:27:49.719 --> 00:27:51.510
I get notifications on
my phone just like I

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.840
do from my messaging apps.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.090
So I wasn't interested in that
content, so I go back to work,

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:03.375
drinking coffee, eating donuts,
writing very important briefs.

00:28:06.391 --> 00:28:06.890
Oh.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.470
I see another notification.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:13.190
And this one, of course,
"Birdman" won best picture.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.689
I mean, clearly we all know
that the movie that should have

00:28:15.689 --> 00:28:16.980
won the award was "The Grand--"

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.520
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Wait, wait.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.040
ELISABETH MORANT: "The
Grand Budapest Hotel,"

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.690
which I'm sure everyone else in
the room agrees with me about.

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:27.430
So in order to
express my opinion,

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:31.690
maybe I'll dive into the live
blog, open up the website,

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.830
maybe leave a few very
tastefully written comments

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.490
about why this movie
should have won.

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:40.090
Anyway, but I won't
bore you with that now.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.490
So the point is
push notifications

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.283
let you know information
when you want it.

00:28:49.231 --> 00:28:49.730
Alex?

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:50.730
ALEX KOMOROSKE: What?

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.267
ELISABETH MORANT: I'm so sorry.

00:28:52.267 --> 00:28:54.100
Can you just-- you know
how to wrap this up.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.250
I just-- Imagine Dragons
tickets just went on sale.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:56.890
ALEX KOMOROSKE:
Are you kidding me?

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:57.945
We're in an I/O talk.

00:28:57.945 --> 00:28:59.020
ELISABETH MORANT: I
know, but I told you

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.730
they're going to sell out
and I really love this band,

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:02.850
and I just-- it'll take
me, like, two seconds.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:03.820
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:04.430
Great.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.532
I guess why don't we
go back to the slides?

00:29:07.532 --> 00:29:09.740
So I think the point that
Elisabeth was going to make

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.660
is that push
notifications are great.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.190
In some cases, the
notification is the content.

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.040
You get all you need
just by seeing it.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.016
In some cases, you
want to dive in.

00:29:18.016 --> 00:29:20.410
And in other cases,
it's information

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:23.100
that is so important to you that
you want it to interrupt you

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.070
at any time or place, including
when you're presenting in front

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:27.470
of hundreds of people at I/O.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:28.970
ELISABETH MORANT:
I got the tickets.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:29.380
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Great.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.088
So happy for you.

00:29:30.088 --> 00:29:31.200
Hope it was worth it.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.658
ELISABETH MORANT:
Anyway, the point

00:29:32.658 --> 00:29:36.150
is that push notifications are
this new primary interaction

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:36.650
paradigm.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.730
It's how people engage
with their apps.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:40.940
And bringing push
notifications to the web

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.050
allows you get information
about what you care about

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.850
before you've decided
to necessarily commit

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:48.720
to everything else
that comes with an app.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.030
So for example, I visit
Ticketmaster once every couple

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.326
of months, but I really
wanted notifications

00:29:54.326 --> 00:29:55.950
about this particular
piece of content.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:56.160
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.826
So the obvious question
that we all have

00:29:57.826 --> 00:29:58.900
is when can we use this?

00:29:58.900 --> 00:29:59.770
Six months from now?

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:00.610
A year from now?

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:03.068
ELISABETH MORANT: Well, this
is shipped to all Chrome users

00:30:03.068 --> 00:30:05.249
today, so anyone who visits
a site with this enabled

00:30:05.249 --> 00:30:07.290
will be able to get push
notifications or the Add

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:08.748
to Homescreen prompt
and developers

00:30:08.748 --> 00:30:11.560
can start adding this to
their site at any time.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.700
And so the Guard--

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.204
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:15.204 --> 00:30:17.120
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I think
it's pretty cool, too.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.661
ELISABETH MORANT:
Pretty cool, right?

00:30:18.661 --> 00:30:20.037
So the Guardian
and Ticketmaster,

00:30:20.037 --> 00:30:22.202
both of these engineering
teams built the prototypes

00:30:22.202 --> 00:30:23.880
that you saw today,
and they're planning

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.360
on bringing push
notifications to their sites

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.960
live in the coming months.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.490
And they're not the only ones.

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:31.950
We have a number
of early adopters

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.283
who are rolling out push
notifications within the coming

00:30:34.283 --> 00:30:34.987
weeks.

00:30:34.987 --> 00:30:37.070
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So the
cool thing about this, too,

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:39.710
is this isn't just some
Chrome only feature.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:43.020
We designed this very
collaboratively with Mozilla,

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.210
working in standards bodies.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:46.700
And in fact, this is a
screenshot from Firefox

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.766
that I took a couple days
ago, Nightly Build with a flag

00:30:49.766 --> 00:30:51.640
flipped that shows them
asking for permission

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.810
for push notifications.

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:54.810
So that will be coming
there at some point, too.

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:55.770
It's pretty exciting.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:59.760
So Service Workers allows us to
bring all kinds of capabilities

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.620
to the web that before
really didn't make sense

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:03.772
or couldn't make sense.

00:31:03.772 --> 00:31:06.230
And because we're designing
them with other browser vendors

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:07.830
and standards bodies,
it's something

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.090
that you can come to rely on.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:11.380
It's kind of like the dawn of
a new era for the mobile web.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:11.570
ELISABETH MORANT: OK.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.861
We promised we were only
going to talk about today, not

00:31:13.861 --> 00:31:14.430
the future.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.640
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.056
Well, the cool
thing about this is

00:31:16.056 --> 00:31:18.580
you can start today
because these features are

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.341
great at progressive
enhancement.

00:31:20.341 --> 00:31:22.840
So if you go to one of these
sites in a browser that doesn't

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.485
support push notifications,
well, you see the same site

00:31:25.485 --> 00:31:27.510
that you would have
seen before, but if you

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:29.950
go to that site in a browser
that does support push

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:32.810
notifications, maybe they
add another button that says,

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.870
hey, I want to be notified
when this thing changes.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:37.890
And then if I as
a user opt in, I

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:40.080
can have a really
high value thing

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.465
that's really important
to me even before it's

00:31:42.465 --> 00:31:44.120
shipped in every
browser out there,

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.581
so I think that's
pretty exciting.

00:31:45.581 --> 00:31:47.330
ELISABETH MORANT: So
we talked about a lot

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:49.890
of topics at a high
level today, but there

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:51.660
are a number of
DevBytes and box talks

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.400
that you can visit that will
go into a lot of these topics

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.710
more in depth.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:59.400
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So today, we
talked about three things.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.872
ELISABETH MORANT: The
superpower of the web, reach.

00:32:01.872 --> 00:32:04.080
ALEX KOMOROSKE: How performance
has made huge strides

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.730
on mobile web.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.180
ELISABETH MORANT: And how
we're baking powerful new ways

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.770
for you to build relationships
with your users, many available

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:13.929
now and a lot more coming soon.

00:32:13.929 --> 00:32:15.470
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So
the three of these

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:16.553
alone aren't that special.

00:32:16.553 --> 00:32:18.661
It's the confluence
of these three things

00:32:18.661 --> 00:32:19.660
that's really important.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.080
ELISABETH MORANT: Well, you're
forgetting the most important

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:21.480
one.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.813
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's a good
point because these things

00:32:23.813 --> 00:32:27.460
by themselves, they just make
it possible to do cool things,

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.240
but what happens
when you combine

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.960
that with this global community
of tinkerers and builders

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.920
and makers, well, that's when
something really awe inspiring

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.820
happens.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.800
ELISABETH MORANT: We can't
wait to see what you build.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.130
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Thanks.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:43.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:50.340
So I think if there
are any live questions,

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.370
we can take them here.

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:56.430
AUDIENCE: First of
all, fantastic talk.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:57.640
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Thank you.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.010
AUDIENCE: The question is
about the Service Workers

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:01.870
which respond to events.

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:05.030
Does it involve events
like Ajax requests

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.870
or it's only when you don't have
a network which [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:09.620
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So
basically, what happens

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.730
is you get a fetch event.

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.940
So in your Service
Worker you say,

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:17.030
Chrome, please notify me when
any content from my domain

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.850
is fetched, and then
you'll catch that event,

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:22.890
you'll pass in what the
request URL was, and you

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:24.112
can respond to it that way.

00:33:24.112 --> 00:33:25.570
That happens even
when you're fully

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.560
connected because of course, you
might be on flaky connectivity,

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.360
and so you want to make sure
you can design your experience

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.980
with total control
over what happens

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.830
over networking to your site.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.630
AUDIENCE: So you meant
content, like HTML,

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:38.065
or it includes Ajax requests?

00:33:38.065 --> 00:33:40.190
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Basically
almost every request that

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.030
goes to your site.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:43.560
There's a few exceptions
for specific things.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.310
AUDIENCE: So if
you're using things

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:48.650
like OAuth, which
automatically authenticates,

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:51.520
what's the design
pattern to get data?

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:55.660
Like, for example, if you
used Google+ authentication,

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.302
which directly logs
onto your page--

00:33:57.302 --> 00:33:59.260
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I think
that's a great question

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.134
to go into in more depth
in the office hours,

00:34:01.134 --> 00:34:03.485
but you have total
control over this.

00:34:03.485 --> 00:34:04.360
It's pretty powerful.

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.240
AUDIENCE: I've got an
easy one for you, I hope.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.389
The home screen.

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:11.739
You mentioned that you find
it interesting how many people

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:13.550
use the home screen.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:14.719
I'm shocked at that.

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:17.219
Where can I see the numbers for
it, how many people actually

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:18.670
add stuff to the home screen?

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:19.310
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So
I don't know if we

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:21.170
have those numbers
to share today,

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:22.880
but it's one of those
things that even

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.320
despite being a buried
feature, I think

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.460
people find a lot of value in.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.834
That's one of the
reasons that we

00:34:26.834 --> 00:34:30.389
decided to bring this
feature to other websites

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:32.136
in a more proactive
way when we feel

00:34:32.136 --> 00:34:34.719
pretty confident that the user
will be interested in that one.

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:35.960
AUDIENCE: Where can
I find those numbers?

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.500
Where do you find them from?

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:37.790
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I'm sorry.

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.100
Those are numbers that
we have internally.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.308
AUDIENCE: Oh, secret numbers.

00:34:40.308 --> 00:34:43.110
ALEX KOMOROSKE:
Yeah, secret numbers.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:46.790
AUDIENCE: What's the
advantage of using a Service

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.130
Worker over something
like what we had at Angry

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:51.760
Birds two or three years ago.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.010
At Google I/O two
or three years ago,

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:57.086
they were using offline
storage for Angry Birds.

00:34:57.086 --> 00:34:58.960
What's the advantage of
using Service Worker?

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.335
ALEX KOMOROSKE:
So Service Worker

00:35:00.335 --> 00:35:03.094
allows you to have very
fine grained control

00:35:03.094 --> 00:35:05.260
over all aspects of what's
happening on the network,

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:10.020
so then you can use technologies
like Index DB and Explicit

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.690
Cache API to do stuff,
whereas before, you

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:15.450
were limited to a very high
level declarative approach.

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:17.842
If it worked for you, it
was great, but more likely

00:35:17.842 --> 00:35:18.800
it didn't work for you.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.520
It couldn't do exactly
what you wanted

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.330
to handle in this
particular case

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:23.790
and so it was basically useless.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:25.680
So Service Worker,
the way to think of it

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.260
is-- are you familiar with
the Extensible Web Manifesto?

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.740
So that's a notion
that we should

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.640
be defining the lower
level primitives that

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.657
explain how the
web platform works,

00:35:34.657 --> 00:35:36.240
so getting rid of
the high level magic

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.470
and giving developers access to
the low level primitives that

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:41.030
make that magic work.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:42.830
So Service Worker
is like digging

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:46.190
down deep below App Cache
to figure out what was there

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:48.190
and how it worked and
expose that to developers.

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:49.380
Does that make sense?

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.068
Probably not, but OK.

00:35:51.068 --> 00:35:51.726
Sorry.

00:35:51.726 --> 00:35:53.350
AUDIENCE: I have a
question on the user

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:56.610
experience on the offline
sites that you showed me.

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:59.930
So let's say the user is
traveling inside a tunnel

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:01.840
and then there is
a network break.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:05.480
So how do we notify the user
at this moment, you are online,

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.180
and then you go offline.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.594
This experience that you're
having is the offline period,

00:36:10.594 --> 00:36:12.260
and then the network
can come back again

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.560
and you can come online again.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.160
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's great.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.743
So the cool thing
about Service Worker

00:36:15.743 --> 00:36:18.150
is you have full control to
do what's right for your app.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.640
So in particular--
for example, I

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.326
think the I/O app does this--
if you're on flaky connectivity,

00:36:23.326 --> 00:36:25.700
it can say, I'm just going to
default and show everything

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:29.670
directly from the cache and
then fetch fresh resources.

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:32.330
And so what might happen is the
user is already looking at it.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.630
Fresh content has come back.

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:34.575
You don't want to
go [MAKES NOISE]

00:36:34.575 --> 00:36:35.910
and put the content
there because they'll

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:37.400
lose their train of thought.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:41.510
But with Service Worker in some
of these demos, what people do

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.650
is they'll have a small
bit of UI that says,

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:46.100
"Fresh content is available
if you scroll up."

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.440
And that way, you don't
lose your way in the app.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.040
But the point is,
of course, that you

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.240
have control to do what's
right for your app, which

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.300
is pretty exciting.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:54.400
AUDIENCE: That's cool.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.350
Thank you.

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:56.980
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.360
My question is in the
demo that you showed.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.349
I get a notification
from the Guardian app

00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:03.640
and you go to the home screen
of the Guardian app icon,

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.422
and then you click, and then
you open, and then you read.

00:37:06.422 --> 00:37:08.880
Is it possible that from the
notification directly, I can--

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.838
ELISABETH MORANT: Yeah.

00:37:09.838 --> 00:37:11.710
That was just a bug in the demo.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:12.420
ALEX KOMOROSKE:
So what happens is

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.960
when you tap on
the notification,

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.860
your Service Worker
receives an event

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.290
that says the
notification was clicked.

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:20.660
At that point, you can
say, OK, do nothing,

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:24.020
or you can say, focus a
tab that existed before

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:25.250
or open a new tab.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.550
ELISABETH MORANT: Yeah.

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:27.530
So I was supposed to
click on the notification

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:30.984
and jump directly to the content
that it was notifying me about.

00:37:30.984 --> 00:37:31.525
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:31.525 --> 00:37:33.305
Thank you.

00:37:33.305 --> 00:37:34.200
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.829
Very similar
question, but rather

00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:37.620
than tapping on a
notification, what if you

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.455
get an email with a link?

00:37:39.455 --> 00:37:41.580
Is there any kind of
association that would open up

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.827
that installed web app?

00:37:44.827 --> 00:37:47.410
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I don't know the
particulars of exactly how it

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:48.993
works, but if you
are an installed web

00:37:48.993 --> 00:37:51.980
app with a manifest, there
will be some cases that

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.550
don't necessarily fit exactly
perfectly into the intent

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:57.290
system of Android, but
we're working on those.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:58.770
I don't have all the information
for you in depth on that,

00:37:58.770 --> 00:37:59.270
though.

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:00.995
You should take it
to office hours.

00:38:00.995 --> 00:38:01.620
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:06.651
ALEX KOMOROSKE: One question.

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:08.400
AUDIENCE: Are the
notification preferences

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.754
synced across a user's
account or is it per device?

00:38:11.754 --> 00:38:13.170
ELISABETH MORANT:
It's per device.

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:14.795
ALEX KOMOROSKE: And
the reason for that

00:38:14.795 --> 00:38:18.120
is the context that you opt
in is very device specific.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.520
So I might be interested
in seeing celebrity gossip

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.610
on my personal-- because
I have a thing for that,

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:25.380
apparently-- on my
personal machine,

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:27.900
but I don't care
about it enough to be

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:29.750
notified when I'm on the go.

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:32.960
And so exactly where
the right user context

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.380
depends on the device you're
in, and so it's not synced.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.213
AUDIENCE: And is the
notification preference

00:38:37.213 --> 00:38:40.819
per domain or per
specific website?

00:38:40.819 --> 00:38:42.610
ALEX KOMOROSKE: It's
per domain, basically.

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.340
And so the idea is you want
to make sure as a site author

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.122
that you use it
very respectfully.

00:38:48.122 --> 00:38:49.580
So one thing we
didn't show in this

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.440
is the notifications
that show up

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.750
have a very obvious
Site Settings button

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:56.530
and if a user taps on that,
they're taken directly

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.620
into Chrome Settings
for that domain, where

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:01.910
it's a couple more taps
to revoke permissions

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:02.800
for that domain.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.580
And so as a site
author, you want

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.419
to make sure that you explain
to users what you're going to do

00:39:07.419 --> 00:39:09.460
and that you respect their
attention because it's

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.260
very, very easy for
them-- of course,

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.940
they're in control-- to
revoke permission very easily

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:15.437
if you abuse it.

00:39:15.437 --> 00:39:16.270
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:17.260
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Sure.

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.010
Thank you so much.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:18.610
Appreciate it.

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.660
[APPLAUSE]
