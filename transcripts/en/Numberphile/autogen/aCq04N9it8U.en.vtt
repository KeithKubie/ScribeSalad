sports moment and and in fact the number

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759
sports moment and and in fact the number
 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.929

a ceremony on the fuel the game the star

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140
a ceremony on the fuel the game the star
 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.550
a ceremony on the fuel the game the star
for the ceremony and it's a wonderful

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560
for the ceremony and it's a wonderful
 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.770
for the ceremony and it's a wonderful
moment and then I'm thinking okay these

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780
moment and then I'm thinking okay these
 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.750

are numbers I'm a number theorist what

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760
are numbers I'm a number theorist what
 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.180
are numbers I'm a number theorist what
can I tell you about the numbers 714 and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190
can I tell you about the numbers 714 and
 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.330
can I tell you about the numbers 714 and
715 so the first thing I try is I try to

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340
715 so the first thing I try is I try to
 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.630
715 so the first thing I try is I try to
factor them they're not hard to factor

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640
factor them they're not hard to factor
 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.050
