Hi, I'm Staci Greenbaum.

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:04.637
I'm the costume designer
for Broad City.

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:06.639
I have a couple
of favorite moments.

00:00:06.672 --> 00:00:08.441
One really,
really amazing moment

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:10.610
this season so far
is Ilana in the Matrix.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:13.046
I want a look that says,
"I am the internet.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.148
I am the Matrix.
I am the future

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.517
and the future is female,
as well as paperless."

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.453
I've been waiting for this
since 1999.

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:22.055
Rather than covering Ilana up,

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:25.758
we created this really
hilarious trench-back cape,

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:27.627
so that it gave her
a lot of movement.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.263
We made her this really
fantastic choker

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:33.499
that is a myriad of different
computer cords,

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:37.370
which was just a riot, along
with her really micro glasses.

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:38.504
That's right.

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:41.174
This is my favorite sweatshirt.
It's this sweatshirt.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:44.310
This is Abbi's real,
original sweatshirt from MICA.

00:00:44.343 --> 00:00:46.345
It's been washed
a hundred thousand times.

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:47.713
It's actually a vintage
sweatshirt

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:50.116
with like the perfect amount
of wear, so.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.520
MICA? I don't want this shit.
I went to RISD.

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:56.722
This actually is
my assistant designer, Val's,

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:58.324
Mom's stress from the 80s,

00:00:58.357 --> 00:01:01.194
which looked unbelievable
on Ilana.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.663
I farted and it went up my dress
and up my nose,

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:04.731
and then it dissipated.

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:07.433
Paired beautifully
with these earrings that we made

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.869
so that she could just be
more of who she is.

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:12.105
I saw them and I thought of you.

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:14.540
Why? Just kidding.

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:16.676
These costumes
are best shown together.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.611
For Abbi,
we have this really colorful,

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:23.282
playful shirt and jeans.
If you recall back to the pilot,

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:25.685
Ilana ends that episode
wearing a shirt that says,

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:26.719
"I love you, Weezy,"

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:30.256
or not exactly those words,
but pretty close.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:31.557
We decided we would
bring it back

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.493
with some electrical tape
on this costume.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.161
It's just a really fun moment.

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:36.829
I love how colorful
and playful they are.

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:38.798
Old are y'all, anyway?

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:40.233
I can't tell
because those outfits

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.502
aren't matching the faces.
Next.
