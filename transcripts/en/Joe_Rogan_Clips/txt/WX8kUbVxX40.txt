Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. 10th Planet is downtown. Right near where you places, yeah. Yeah. So your studio, you, Oh, you're set up. That's, that's real close to 10 planets. Jujitsu. Yeah man. Just let me know. I'll set, I will man. Avoid any flat earth conversations that come up. Oh, I, you know, like ears and keep moving. I get those from, I get those from time to time. You know, I get the flat or stay the fuck off of Youtube, man. Man. Yeah, they get confused. Yeah, that's it. That's the craziest shit. Cause I always argue like this about the flat earth, right? So, hey listen, if we got a flatter, there's the edge. Right? And there's always thrill seekers looking to do something thrilling. And there's always a thrill seeker that fucks up and falls right off of that edge. Right. So how many motherfuckers would be fallen off the edge of the earth if we really had one?

Speaker 1:          00:50          For sure. You know, there'll be climbers, there'd be a bunch of dudes who would try to hang off the edge to take selfies. Think about it. Right? 12 people this year have died at the Grand Canyon, the Grand Canyon. It was that really that many, that many so far in this year. And some people die of a heart attack there because you know it's too much for them to be on that little bridge that they have there, that that extends past the edge of a canyon. They, they put in a little Bridgeway so that you can go and look down. People have heart attacks, two people that have had heart attacks from that, but the other guys are the ones trying to do selfies of fallen off fucking bridge in plummeting. Right. So you gotta think, man, if we had, if we had a flat earth, how many people would be visiting the edge off taking a selfie?

Speaker 1:          01:42          Man, there's no, you know, come on. No doubt. There'd be teams of people, teams, they would travel the flat earth and they would, they would like rope. We apparent like, like Alex Honnold would probably try to climb off the side. We'd hear it on the news. Another person who has died from falling off the edge of the earth. Yeah, it would be 100% that'd be our hundredth, the flat out people will tell you though that the government guards that yeah. Not and are right. Yeah. You can't go near it pro. Yeah. Battleships. Well there wouldn't be just one edge though. Right? That's true there. They didn't think that through. Yeah. No, there'd be several ledges if we're flat. Yeah. But see you gotta have that Youtube mentality. You gotta put your head in a little box, leave it in there. Fucking turn the oven box on and stick your head in the government's plucking vee edge, man.

Speaker 1:          02:28          You can't get near it. Yeah, we're, it's like we're living in a dome, you know, that's, that's the one. Yeah. The Dome, the Dome theory. There's no space. Space is fake. Man. Pizza spoke too much. People want to believe in some crazy shit. You know, I want to, how much of them were stoners? Like most of them. Right? How many of them are microdosing? Okay. Yeah, probably cause you know, cause cause that's a thing now everybody's like fucking microdosing right now. And it's not bad for you. They say it's actually, you know, kind of good for you, but Ron White's doing it, but runaway microdose is a silicide man every day. He has never felt better in my life and they like to talk when they're micro dosing. Yeah. Especially sole assignment. You just have these ideas. That's the thing. You have ideas in your mind becomes open to shit that normally, you know, you're closed off to obviously, you know.

Speaker 1:          03:20          Yeah, but I think they think that the earth is a disk. I think that's what I've heard recently. They think it's a disc [inaudible] I'm sort of a floating disc in and then we live in the firmament or something like that and it's like some sort of a cover over the top of the disc and that's what the, here it is. What does this Jamie, just the cruise, the cruise next year. The flatter the roost. Yeah. Oh my God. Is that real? Eventually they're going to get to the fucking glaciers and they told you the wall, the flat earth. I hope they jump out and get eaten by a polar bear. That's the funniest shit has to use like gps to get around. So, ah, I mean, good luck with that. You know, how many scientists do they have on their side? Oh, all of them. That's the funniest shit. It's fucking ridiculous. There's, there's, there's gigantic satellites that take huge high resolution photos of the earth every 10 seconds from orbit, from thousands of miles out. Those are doctored. Yeah. It's just the whole thing is so fucking stupid of all this shit to believe in, like to invest any energy in that. Like why would someone lie about the shape of the earth? That's the dumbest part about [inaudible] know what I think is, is, um, before, um, the internet and all these different platforms where you can get information.
