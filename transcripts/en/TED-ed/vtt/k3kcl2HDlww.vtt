00:00:14.795 --> 00:00:16.297
The Oval Office,

00:00:16.297 --> 00:00:17.679
Inauguration Day,

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.186
Rose Garden signings,

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:20.430
and secret service agents

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.977
with dark sunglasses and cool wrist radios.

00:00:23.977 --> 00:00:25.567
For a moment, forget all of it.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:27.729
Toss out everything you know about the President.

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:29.606
Now, start over.

00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:33.305
What would you do if you had to invent the President?

00:00:33.305 --> 00:00:36.082
That was the question facing the 55 men

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:37.728
who got together in secret

00:00:37.728 --> 00:00:40.625
to draw up the plans for a new American government

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:44.372
in the summer of 1787 in Philadelphia,

00:00:44.372 --> 00:00:47.083
in the same place where the Declaration of Independence

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:50.300
had been written eleven years earlier.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.797
Declaring independence had been risky business,

00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:54.407
demanding ferocious courage

00:00:54.407 --> 00:00:57.474
that put lives and fortunes in jeopardy.

00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:01.514
But, inventing a new government was no field day either,

00:01:01.514 --> 00:01:03.182
especially when it's summer

00:01:03.182 --> 00:01:04.412
and you're in scratchy suits,

00:01:04.412 --> 00:01:05.518
and the windows are closed

00:01:05.518 --> 00:01:06.830
because you don't want anybody

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.699
to hear what you are saying,

00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:10.106
and the air conditioning doesn't work

00:01:10.106 --> 00:01:13.359
because it won't be invented for nearly 200 years.

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:15.329
And, when you don't agree on things,

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.780
it gets even hotter.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.207
For the framers, the question they argued over most

00:01:21.207 --> 00:01:22.869
while writing the Constitution

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.204
and creating three branches of government

00:01:25.204 --> 00:01:29.164
had to do with the executive department.

00:01:29.164 --> 00:01:31.419
One man or three to do the job?

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:32.969
How long should he serve?

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:34.130
What would he really do?

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.263
Who would pick him?

00:01:35.263 --> 00:01:36.676
How to get rid of him

00:01:36.676 --> 00:01:39.595
if he's doing a bad job or he's a crook?

00:01:39.595 --> 00:01:42.407
And, of course, they all meant him,

00:01:42.407 --> 00:01:45.332
and he would be a white man.

00:01:45.332 --> 00:01:46.577
The idea of a woman

00:01:46.577 --> 00:01:48.936
or an African American, for instance,

00:01:48.936 --> 00:01:50.521
holding this high office

00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:53.242
was not a glimmer in their eyes.

00:01:53.242 --> 00:01:54.889
But the framers knew they needed

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:56.888
someone who could take charge,

00:01:56.888 --> 00:02:00.658
especially in a crisis, like an invasion or a rebellion,

00:02:00.658 --> 00:02:03.537
or negotiating treaties.

00:02:03.537 --> 00:02:05.024
Congress was not very good

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:07.301
at making such important decisions

00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:10.208
without debates and delays.

00:02:10.208 --> 00:02:12.685
But the framers thought America needed a man

00:02:12.685 --> 00:02:15.169
who was decisive and could act quickly.

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.801
They called it energy and dispatch.

00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:21.351
One thing they were dead-set against:

00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:23.274
there would be no king.

00:02:23.274 --> 00:02:26.115
They had fought a war against a country with a monarch

00:02:26.115 --> 00:02:27.510
and were afraid that one man

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.377
with unchecked powers, in charge of an army,

00:02:30.377 --> 00:02:32.398
could take over the country.

00:02:32.398 --> 00:02:35.024
Instead, they settled on a president

00:02:35.024 --> 00:02:40.030
and laid out his powers in Article 2 of the Constitution.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.782
But who would choose him?

00:02:41.782 --> 00:02:45.878
Not the people, they were too liable to be misled

00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:47.293
as one framer worried.

00:02:47.293 --> 00:02:52.902
Not the legislature, that would lead to cabal and factions.

00:02:52.902 --> 00:02:56.044
Got it: electors, wise, informed men

00:02:56.044 --> 00:02:58.862
who have time to make a good decision.

00:02:58.862 --> 00:03:00.424
And if they didn't produce a winner,

00:03:00.424 --> 00:03:02.586
then the decision would go to one

00:03:02.586 --> 00:03:05.123
of the other branches of government, the Congress.

00:03:05.123 --> 00:03:07.642
The House of Representatives would step in

00:03:07.642 --> 00:03:09.011
and make the choice,

00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:13.100
which they did in 1801 and 1825.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.963
In the long, hot summer of 1787,

00:03:15.963 --> 00:03:19.773
compromises were made to invent the presidency,

00:03:19.773 --> 00:03:23.130
like counting slaves as 3/5 of a person,

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.639
giving the President command of the army

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.294
but Congress the power to declare war,

00:03:28.294 --> 00:03:31.493
and unlimited four-year terms.

00:03:31.493 --> 00:03:35.497
Since then, some of those compromises have been amended

00:03:35.497 --> 00:03:40.291
and the men in office have sometimes been too strong or too weak.

00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:42.799
But, if you could start from scratch,

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.385
how would you redesign the Oval Office?
