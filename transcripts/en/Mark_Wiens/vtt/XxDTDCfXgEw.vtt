00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.810
- Hey everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.130
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Bangkok,

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.980
and tonight we are going on an ultimate

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.760
Bangkok night street food tour.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.900
I'm gonna meet up with my
friends, P'Tan and P'Tape,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.610
who are some of the ultimate
Bangkok food experts.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.580
I don't even know where
they're gonna take me,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.500
but we are, yeah, it is guaranteed

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.227
to be an amazing Thai street food tour.

00:00:21.227 --> 00:00:23.810
(lively music)

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.100
Okay, met up with P'Tape and P'Tan.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.933
- Hello, hi.

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.010
- P'Tape, he's an actor.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.820
He is a designer.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.100
And then P'Tan is a consultant, a host,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.130
but most of all we just all love to eat.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.680
So how many places are
we gonna go tonight?

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.670
- Maybe seven or eight.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.200
- Whoa, we are on our
way to the first place.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.695
Oh yeah, we got the party tuk tuk.

00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:52.278
(lively music)

00:00:55.234 --> 00:00:57.630
(everyone laughing)

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.839
All right we made it to the first place.

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.339
- Sawang.
- Sawang.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.070
This place is really well
known for bami kam pu,

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.875
which is egg noodles with crab claws.

00:01:08.875 --> 00:01:12.792
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:13.746 --> 00:01:14.579
- Yes.

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:15.610
- [P'Tan] It's crispy pork.

00:01:16.854 --> 00:01:17.687
- This is crab.

00:01:17.687 --> 00:01:18.520
- We got two different versions.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.430
One is with the barbecue pork,

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.310
and then their most well-known version

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.690
is the bami kam pu,
which is the crab claw.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.380
Like literally, the crab claw

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.710
just dominates the entire bowl.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.520
That takes up like a quarter of a bowl.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.540
There are some egg
noodles hidden below here.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.980
There's chunks, nuggets of crab,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.730
and then this is what
they call the crispy pork,

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.490
which is, it looks kinda
like a barbecued pork almost.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.560
And then there's some dumplings, is there.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.820
Well, before going big with the crab,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.710
I'll try the egg noodles.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.970
And you can see the egg
noodles look awesome.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.190
They're so like individual.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.989
You can see the garlic on them as well.

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:53.656
(rhythmic percussion music)

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.400
Oh, the noodles are amazing.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.100
You taste the fried garlic and
the salt and pepper on them.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.883
They're slightly chewy,
such an amazing texture.

00:02:04.884 --> 00:02:06.613
- You have to try the barbecue pork.

00:02:06.613 --> 00:02:08.000
It's very juicy.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.667
(rhythmic percussion music)

00:02:13.943 --> 00:02:15.374
And he had a dumpling.

00:02:15.374 --> 00:02:16.540
- Whoa!

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.109
(everyone laughing)

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.276
- This is like Mark Wien's expression.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.813
- Good job, man.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.850
That was like, that was perfect.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.310
Right on.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.830
But you will see also tonight

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.960
that P'Tape has his signature,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.290
his signature, delicious
expression as well.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.700
Get a little bit of
seasonings, some prik pon,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.960
which is the chili flakes.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.860
I don't want to overdo
the spice on this though

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.630
because I don't wanna cover up the flavor

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.800
of those extremely good
noodles and the crab.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.680
So one spoon.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.513
That should be good.

00:02:47.513 --> 00:02:48.600
And maybe a little bit of vinegar,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.250
a little bit of vinegar on there.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.810
Okay, that is perfect.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.910
Roll this around.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.613
Okay, try one of the dumplings next.

00:02:56.613 --> 00:03:00.023
(lively music)

00:03:00.023 --> 00:03:00.856
Mmm.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.870
Oh, the texture of the shrimp.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.260
The shrimp are so spongy, so bouncy.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.713
I'm gonna have that crab next.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.350
That is, it's so sweet.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.210
It's so stringy.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.450
Unbelievably good paired
with those noodles,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.550
paired with that pork.

00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:22.633
Wow, that's just stunning.

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:24.180
That is stunning.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.540
And there is just no more convenient way

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.363
to eat a claw than when
it's pre-peeled for you.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.043
Oh, yeah.

00:03:34.043 --> 00:03:35.470
It almost has a little
bit of a thickness to it,

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.128
may be that bone broth.

00:03:37.128 --> 00:03:37.961
You taste that pepper in there.

00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:39.600
You taste the green onions and the garlic.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.133
The fried garlic in
there is just pronounced.

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:46.480
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.120
That was stunning.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.720
So, if we weren't gonna go
to six more restaurants,

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.893
I would eat six bowls of that right now.

00:03:52.893 --> 00:03:54.047
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:54.047 --> 00:03:55.648
Oh, man.

00:03:55.648 --> 00:03:57.250
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.113
So good.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.840
Not totally sure where we're heading next,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.898
but we are heading towards
Yaowarat, towards China Town.

00:04:04.898 --> 00:04:06.649
- Go, go, go, go.

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:08.498
(engine revving)

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:11.081
(lively music)

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.375
- Now we're at the China Town.

00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:16.042
- [P'Tape] Yaowarat.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.020
- We are in the back streets of Yaowarat.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.853
What are we eating here?

00:04:23.853 --> 00:04:26.503
- [P'Tan] So the second stop
would be the fish ball noodle.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.220
- This place is called Lim Lao Ngow.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.830
This place is legendary for
their fish ball noodles.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.620
And if you get in there
close to the fish ball,

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.530
where that boiling pot is,
it is actually a steam room.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.700
I can just feel the humidity

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.230
and the steam just forming on my face.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.065
Oh, it smells so good.

00:04:46.065 --> 00:04:47.250
Oh, yes.
(P'Tan laughing)

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.143
That is my man, Mr. Tan, P'Tan, yes.

00:04:51.211 --> 00:04:55.211
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.890
He is just flying on those
noodles, the egg noodles.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.800
I have never seen anybody
make noodles that fast,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.940
blanching the noodles
in and out of the water.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.790
The steam is just like, we're open air,

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.270
but it's a steam room in this alley.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.420
And then they blanch.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.830
The fish balls are just swimming around

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.180
and he fishes them out.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.860
We got a table full of food.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.810
Oh, wow.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.180
See they already added in some chilies.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.920
They added in some, maybe some vinegar,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.170
but also the green chilies.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.020
Mix that around and then
you got to eat this first.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.892
So this is the fish won-ton, first.

00:05:34.892 --> 00:05:35.725
- Yes.

00:05:35.725 --> 00:05:36.558
- Which they say is the best.

00:05:36.558 --> 00:05:37.391
- It's the best, yeah.

00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:38.891
- Best item in the bowl, okay.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.080
Mmm.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.010
Oh, oh, oh.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.800
The flavor just keeps on coming.

00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:51.843
It's like at first, you
don't taste anything.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.903
And then you keep chewing,

00:05:53.903 --> 00:05:57.130
it like explodes with fish
and pepper and garlic.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.933
I'm still chewing and more
and more flavor is coming out.

00:06:01.076 --> 00:06:04.993
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.093
- Yes.

00:06:10.093 --> 00:06:11.903
- That's their, their signature move.

00:06:13.737 --> 00:06:17.570
Oh man, that steam, steam
to the face in Bangkok.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.223
My face is shining right now.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.560
The humidity, I love it.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.040
This is just, a place like this

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.850
is how you know you are in Bangkok

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.728
and what you love so much about Bangkok.

00:06:29.728 --> 00:06:32.510
The steamy humidity, the hot noodles,

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.570
sitting in the alleyway,
this place is a gem.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:36.570
Try the egg noodles.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.520
Okay, mix these around.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.730
Again, these are totally
different noodles.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.460
These are like, they're not thicker,

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.463
but they're wider noodles
and more kinda crinkly.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.969
And blanched in just seconds.

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:55.460
Mmm, mmm.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.490
Mm-hmm, those are awesome, too.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.073
A little more gummy, not quite as chewy.

00:07:04.283 --> 00:07:05.750
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.260
Oh man, that's a texture thing.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.430
When they're pure fish, that's fresh,

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.470
nothing added, no flour,

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.630
just the pure sponginess of the fish,

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.300
they're unbelievably good.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.490
And these are, yeah, amazing.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.322
That texture is so good.

00:07:23.322 --> 00:07:25.905
(lively music)

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.460
Mmm, just a very clean, very pure,

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.140
I think very light fish stock

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.973
with a little bit of garlic

00:07:35.973 --> 00:07:37.730
and some swimming green onions in there.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.393
Okay, one final bite.

00:07:40.475 --> 00:07:44.392
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.030
I don't even know how to explain that.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.010
It's just like glutinous.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.855
I think that's what it is.

00:07:50.855 --> 00:07:53.070
It's kinda like a glutinous wrapper

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.660
with chunks of fish,
with pepper and garlic.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.197
It is unbelievably delicious.

00:07:59.489 --> 00:08:00.322
Okay.

00:08:07.203 --> 00:08:08.870
Okay, I think we're moving
on to the next place.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.000
- Next, yes.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.281
- [Mark] Where are we going next?

00:08:11.281 --> 00:08:13.756
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:13.756 --> 00:08:15.190
- [P'Tan] Want some more dumpling?

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.890
- Okay, and VIP.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.490
- Yeah, no. (laughs)

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.323
- [Mark] VIP.

00:08:20.323 --> 00:08:21.156
- VIP, yeah.

00:08:21.156 --> 00:08:21.989
- [Mark] VIP.

00:08:23.847 --> 00:08:28.054
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:28.054 --> 00:08:28.887
Hi.

00:08:28.887 --> 00:08:29.810
- Want tuk tuk?
- Yeah.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.600
- Now we're going by boat.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.220
- Just catching the ferry
across the Chao Phraya River

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.722
over to (speaking in foreign language)

00:08:34.722 --> 00:08:37.305
(lively music)

00:08:38.615 --> 00:08:41.760
So we jump onto another tuk tuk.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.850
The next place that we're going to,

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.910
I haven't been there in a long time,

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.100
but it is one of the greatest places.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.996
It's a legendary place in Bangkok.

00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:51.230
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.074
This place is called Somsak.

00:08:52.074 --> 00:08:55.991
(speaking in foreign language)

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.540
- Okay, good.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.420
It's a big deal for you.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.253
(Mark chuckles)

00:09:04.253 --> 00:09:05.976
- The place in Bangkok for a dish called

00:09:05.976 --> 00:09:08.170
(speaking in foreign language) which,

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.050
it's a mung bean noodle
dish with crab or shrimp.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.300
He actually bakes it
within this special pan.

00:09:16.187 --> 00:09:18.770
(lively music)

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.010
First, he boils in either
the shrimp or the crab

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.440
into the, it's a little oven pot.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.130
And then after that he mixes up a mixture.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.130
There's some oyster sauce in
there, I know there's some,

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.750
it's a mixture of sauce.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.170
He mixes that with the noodles,
drops the noodles in there.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.630
How you know that he's a master is

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.310
that he keeps an eye on
those mung bean noodles

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.930
because if you overcook
them, they'll just become

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.370
a mushy, like ball of mushiness.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.650
And then the final step is adding

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.900
a big handful of green onions at the top

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.420
and just letting it boil
for a precise amount of time

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.770
just so that they wilt,
but don't get too cooked.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:54.603
And then that's it.

00:09:54.603 --> 00:09:59.450
He takes about three minutes
I'd say per bowl, per pan.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.723
Oh, this is one of the
main events right here.

00:10:06.386 --> 00:10:09.987
(speaking in foreign language)

00:10:09.987 --> 00:10:11.350
- Yeah, yes.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.541
- Mix it up, get those
mung bean juices flowing.

00:10:13.541 --> 00:10:14.374
- Yes, it's juicy.

00:10:14.374 --> 00:10:17.020
- It's so juicy, oh,
it's so juicy down there.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.920
And that's a lot of pork fat.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.056
Yeah, it smells unbelievable.

00:10:21.056 --> 00:10:25.056
(speaking in foreign language)

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.610
This one is kung chae
nampla, which is raw shrimp.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.677
This is special, this is off-menu.

00:10:46.677 --> 00:10:49.260
(lively music)

00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:53.208
- Whoa.

00:10:55.557 --> 00:10:57.800
(speaking in foreign language)

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.693
- That shrimp is so sweet.

00:11:01.822 --> 00:11:02.798
- Mmm.

00:11:02.798 --> 00:11:04.690
This is the best kung chae nampla ever.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:05.523
- [Mark] Ever?

00:11:05.523 --> 00:11:06.455
- Yeah, ever.

00:11:06.455 --> 00:11:08.400
(lively music)

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.090
- Almost like glutinous
because of the pork,

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.053
lard, fat that goes in
there as they simmer down.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.987
As a spoon to just scoop her up.

00:11:24.615 --> 00:11:28.292
Oh, look at all that
chili and garlic. (laughs)

00:11:28.292 --> 00:11:30.886
(speaking in foreign language)

00:11:30.886 --> 00:11:32.553
A scooper of a claw.

00:11:41.436 --> 00:11:42.269
Oh, wow.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:49.670
And they're called blood cockles

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.080
because, oh, there it goes.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.838
You can see peanuts in there
and you can see chilies.

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:55.465
Oh, oh, oh.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:56.915
Oh, that's just thick.

00:11:56.915 --> 00:11:59.265
Oh, that's just thick
with peanuts and chilies.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.930
Mmm!

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.380
That's like a peanut brittle.

00:12:10.404 --> 00:12:14.110
(everyone laughing)

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.943
Oh, the double.

00:12:17.589 --> 00:12:20.172
(lively music)

00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:23.740
Oh, oh, oh, this thing is massive.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.053
Look you got to see it up to my face.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.180
Oh, the juices.
- Oh, wow.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.670
- Look at how thick and muscular he is.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.290
And just, you can kind
of like sit in there.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.740
Look, it just curls around
the entire sauce bowl.

00:12:36.658 --> 00:12:38.710
Oh, oh, that is awesome.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.844
Okay, I think that's good.

00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:43.427
(lively music)

00:12:44.413 --> 00:12:45.246
Oh.

00:12:48.859 --> 00:12:51.720
Think I can get all the way to the tail.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.060
Okay, got it.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:58.060
Oh, that was a stunning, stunning meal.

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:01.390
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.954
- Now we are in Worachak.

00:13:03.954 --> 00:13:06.080
And this is the market, the fresh market.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.230
So it's called Jay Hong Worachak.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.770
- We're walking on our way
to go eat a dish called--

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.230
- And this one's kind
of like a hidden place.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.230
- Yeah, it is.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.260
Down an alley.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.610
In the middle of the night.

00:13:18.883 --> 00:13:22.800
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:28.716 --> 00:13:30.170
Oh, that is amazing.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:31.972
She's mainly making a dish called

00:13:31.972 --> 00:13:32.805
(speaking in foreign language),

00:13:32.805 --> 00:13:35.120
which is, it's a stir fry,

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.170
but actually it's more of a slow fry.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.970
And she just smokes it out,

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.370
she uses a pot over charcoal.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.000
The charcoal is being
fanned so it's flaming.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.650
She fries up the shrimp or
the meat of your choice.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.910
And just blazes that fire.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:53.140
It's just like a volcanic charcoal fire.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.300
Then she tosses in the
noodles, she smokes it out.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.400
You can just see clouds of smoke rising,

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.617
the smoke point, and just that aroma.

00:14:00.617 --> 00:14:02.660
Oh, oh, oh, it smells so good.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.223
She is such a master.

00:14:05.083 --> 00:14:06.930
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.100
Always wear safety glasses
when you cook like that.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.440
Literally all of that smoke
that just goes up in a blaze

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.209
ends up in your bowl of noodles.

00:14:15.209 --> 00:14:18.126
(stir fry sizzles)

00:14:33.968 --> 00:14:35.718
There he is, the man.

00:14:37.387 --> 00:14:38.280
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.997
This one is the classic
(speaking in foreign language)?

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.273
- Yes.

00:14:42.273 --> 00:14:43.210
- Which is the wide rice noodles.

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:44.840
She tosses in some lettuce at the end.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.870
You can see the egg is
just curled into there.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.100
There's chicken, there's
shrimp, there's bacon.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.403
She adds a few pieces of bacon in there.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.943
Oh, cheers.

00:14:57.197 --> 00:14:58.114
Oh, oh, oh.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.503
It's hot.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.030
But you can taste like
an entire cloud of smoke

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.730
in every single bite.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.180
(speaking in foreign language),

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.513
which is the smaller, angel
hair vermicelli rice noodles.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:16.981
- [All] Cheers.

00:15:16.981 --> 00:15:19.564
(lively music)

00:15:20.742 --> 00:15:23.546
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:23.546 --> 00:15:25.450
- [P'Tan] That fried rice is very special.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:27.940
- [Mark] And then the final
dish is the fried rice.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.950
Cooked the same way in a
cloud of, check out that,

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.880
that's an entire piece of
bacon with chicken and rice.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.532
- [P'Tan And Mark] Cheers.

00:15:34.532 --> 00:15:37.441
(lively music)

00:15:37.441 --> 00:15:40.170
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.120
- If she would wait any longer,

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.450
it would turn into like charcoal.

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.360
But she takes it out
just at the perfect time,

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.460
so that it's just embedded with the smoke.

00:15:51.306 --> 00:15:53.890
(lively music)

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.355
I guarantee you she could
cook this with a welder.

00:15:56.355 --> 00:16:00.272
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:04.362 --> 00:16:06.945
(lively music)

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.060
Yeah, we made it to a
restaurant, it's called Jay Oh.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.140
And this is a legendary restaurant

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.830
near Chulalongkorn University.

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.490
It's 11:00 p.m. and there's still a line

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.060
that goes all the way down the road.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.750
People waiting to get a chair.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.849
We're going to all your
restaurants tonight.

00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:26.432
(lively music)

00:16:40.985 --> 00:16:42.970
Okay, so Jay Oh, this place,

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:47.320
they're famous especially
for definite like--

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.430
- Late night.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:51.120
- Late night student dishes,

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.240
that you would come up with late at night.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.250
Okay, I'm going to start with a bite

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.940
of the yam salmon, which is the,

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.243
it's just drenched in Thai seafood sauce.

00:17:02.722 --> 00:17:03.555
Oh, wow.

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:05.710
The salmon literally
just melts in your mouth.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.140
And then it's such a tangy,

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:11.083
spicy, ultra garlicky sauce.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.690
Wow, their signature dish,
the Mama has arrived.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.760
That is just ridiculousness in a pot.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.430
The entire bottom is instant
noodles with tom yum soup.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:30.730
The instant soup, of course.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:31.670
There's (speaking in
foreign language) on top.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.440
There's meatballs,
there's nuggets of crab.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.600
And it's a good thing we
have reinforcements now.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.737
Keep going.

00:17:37.737 --> 00:17:38.570
- You want to start?

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:39.506
- [Mark] Yes, okay.

00:17:39.506 --> 00:17:41.803
(murmurs) come to help us.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.273
Oh.

00:17:49.785 --> 00:17:50.685
An instant noodle.

00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:55.809
(speaking in foreign language)

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.183
Wow.

00:18:10.935 --> 00:18:13.518
(lively music)

00:18:17.127 --> 00:18:20.270
Yeah, it's just something you
want to be eating at midnight.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:24.832
It just has all the right
components of a midnight dish.

00:18:24.832 --> 00:18:28.960
(speaking in foreign language)

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.160
An extra part of crispy pork belly.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.572
That has to be some of the crispiest

00:18:31.572 --> 00:18:33.840
(speaking in foreign language)

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.970
Got to dip it in the (speaking
in foreign language),

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.991
the dark, it's almost
like a sweet soy sauce.

00:18:38.991 --> 00:18:41.574
(lively music)

00:18:42.927 --> 00:18:44.780
Oh, oh, oh, it's like a fat sandwich.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.800
The layers, you can feel the layers.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.763
The fat, the crispy skin.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.630
That's just like a natural
pork belly sandwich.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.763
Another nugget.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:01.683
Oh, oh, wow.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.220
It's just creamy in all the right ways.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:12.590
The lemongrass just like
blows your taste buds,

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:16.910
and then just that instant tea
kind of taste that you love.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.000
This just brings back the memories.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.850
I used to love to eat
Ramen instant noodles,

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.760
at like 2:00 a.m. in the morning.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.970
This is that same thing,
just better because

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.020
there's so many more
better ingredients in it.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.010
One of Bangkok's best late
night dishes, for sure.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.570
- The most famous place at night.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.170
- It's midnight and it's packed.

00:19:39.904 --> 00:19:42.487
(lively music)

00:19:58.814 --> 00:20:02.730
That's like the greatest instant
broth you will ever have.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.250
And there's no better time than,

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.267
oh yeah, it's just after midnight.

00:20:07.267 --> 00:20:11.184
(speaking in foreign language)

00:20:22.407 --> 00:20:24.240
- [Group At Table] Oh.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.270
- Points to your plate, he says the price,

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.620
he adds that in his head,

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.810
and then literally in seconds
he has your entire bill.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:37.810
No calculator, no paper,
just what a mathematician.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:38.900
All right, we're moving on.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.850
We've got one more place to go tonight.

00:20:42.479 --> 00:20:45.770
And we have the ultimate late
night Bangkok street food.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.160
We've got one more place
to go to tonight though.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.135
And it is, it's after midnight.

00:20:51.135 --> 00:20:55.052
(speaking in foreign language)

00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:58.683
- At Iam Pochana.

00:20:58.683 --> 00:21:02.310
- Even after, I think we've
had five or six meals,

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.138
I'm still very excited for this next spot.

00:21:05.138 --> 00:21:07.721
(lively music)

00:21:15.426 --> 00:21:19.426
(speaking in foreign language)

00:21:25.157 --> 00:21:26.240
Oh, wow, wow.

00:21:28.846 --> 00:21:32.846
(speaking in foreign language)

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.813
So we've got a (speaking
in foreign language),

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.880
the braised beef on this side.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.631
Over on this side--

00:21:42.631 --> 00:21:44.410
(speaking in foreign language)

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.350
They've got the moo-bin-hah,

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.930
it's the fried pork, grilled pork.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.260
So these are like the two main
dishes you can order here.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:54.427
(upbeat techno music)

00:22:02.373 --> 00:22:04.035
(speaking in foreign language)

00:22:04.035 --> 00:22:08.452
There's a piece of the
moo-bin-hah, the grilled pork.

00:22:09.672 --> 00:22:11.002
Mmm.

00:22:11.002 --> 00:22:15.002
Oh, it's like a very good
quality piece of pork.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:16.900
And the sauce is kind of sweet,

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.700
but with lots of chilies and garlic.

00:22:23.924 --> 00:22:27.841
(speaking in foreign language)

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.430
Fried beef with garlic and--

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.663
- [Group] Yeah.

00:22:34.663 --> 00:22:37.888
(lively music)

00:22:37.888 --> 00:22:39.556
- [All] Mmm.

00:22:39.556 --> 00:22:41.741
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:22:41.741 --> 00:22:43.020
- Awesome.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.095
- Oh, yeah.

00:22:44.095 --> 00:22:44.928
- Awesome.

00:22:44.928 --> 00:22:45.840
- Unbelievable.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.500
That's all Thai garlic,
so it's a little close.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.600
That's so fragrant.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.370
Yeah, that is amazing.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.870
And the black pepper in there.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:55.720
Whatever is in front of me,

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.750
and that happens to be a tendon meatball.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.821
Mix in some chili and vinegar
is what I prefer the most.

00:23:00.821 --> 00:23:03.730
(lively music)

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:04.563
Oh, yeah.

00:23:04.563 --> 00:23:05.820
Oh, that is hot.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.880
Tendon meatballs are one of
the best types of meatball.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.793
And when you are eating with
the fragrance of that soup,

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:16.300
the Chinese spices, the
star anise, the cinnamon.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.963
Oh, that one is stomach.

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:20.740
There's braised beef.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.080
There's intestines, there's tendon,

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.963
there's, mmm, oh, yeah.

00:23:26.038 --> 00:23:27.057
This is a nugget of the brisket,

00:23:27.057 --> 00:23:28.900
and you see pressing your chopsticks on it

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.163
how juicy it is, just the juices flow.

00:23:36.155 --> 00:23:37.779
Oh, yeah.

00:23:37.779 --> 00:23:40.113
Oh, oh, it's tender.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:42.655
Oh, it's hot.

00:23:42.655 --> 00:23:44.333
(P'Tan laughing)

00:23:44.333 --> 00:23:46.423
Oh, it's flavorful.

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.748
A flaming intestine.

00:23:55.748 --> 00:23:57.900
(lively music)

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.641
How are you feeling, full?

00:23:59.641 --> 00:24:00.474
(everyone laughing)

00:24:00.474 --> 00:24:01.443
- Very full.
- Very full.

00:24:01.443 --> 00:24:04.110
- It's the craziest night I ever had.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:06.413
- [Mark] We started at 6:00 p.m.,

00:24:06.413 --> 00:24:07.430
the first meal.
- 6:00 p.m.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:09.510
- And now it's 1:00 a.m.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.640
That was, by far, the most ultimate

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.820
late night evening
Bangkok street food tour

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.700
I've ever had in my life.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.510
- So let's do it again.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.380
- We will, we will for sure.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.560
Yeah, these are two of the most fun guys

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.760
to hang out with in
Bangkok for street food.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.450
And yeah, they are Bangkok
street food legends.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.350
P'Tan, P'Tape.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:34.620
I'll have all their information

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.060
in the description box below,

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.562
and their new show, Immheee.

00:24:39.562 --> 00:24:44.562
- [P'Tan] Immheee. (laughs)

00:24:45.713 --> 00:24:47.220
- Immheee.
- Okay.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.551
- But yeah, I want to say a huge

00:24:48.551 --> 00:24:49.384
thank you to them
- Bye.

00:24:49.384 --> 00:24:51.280
- For taking me around.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.330
Yeah, it's been so much fun,

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.570
and many more street
food adventures to come.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.110
All right, thank you so much
