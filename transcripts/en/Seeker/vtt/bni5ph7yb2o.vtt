00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.370
All those times your mother told you to play
outside because playing on the Internet is

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.490
ruining your brain?

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.879
Well, turns out she might have been wrong.

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:09.179
Sort of.

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.290
Hello everyone!

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.890
Amy coming to you on the Internet today talking
about, well, how using the Internet might

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.320
be affecting your brain.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.350
And the good news if you’re under 25?

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.300
Your internet and social media habits aren’t
necessarily damaging.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.279
Specifically, we’re talking about time spent
on social media sites like Facebook.

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.769
The issue with Facebook, according to some
scientists, is that teenagers spending an

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.880
increasing amount of time on social media
sites are stunting their neurologic development.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.290
The human brain doesn’t reach full maturity
until we’re in our mid-20s.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.850
Before that, during early and mid-adolescence,
the brain undergoes considerable growth and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.910
pruning, particularly in the forward cerebral
cortex and the prefrontal cortex, the area

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.390
behind the forehead.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.800
This is the area associated with planning
and problem-solving related tasks.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.430
As it develops, the prefrontal cortex communicates
more effectively with other parts of the brain.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.030
So, you can kind of imagine that any activity
that affects the cerebral and prefrontal cortex

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.150
could seriously affect the individual’s
development as well.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.730
Things like excessive Internet usage.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.120
One European-based study found that nine in
ten adults go online in any location, more

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.810
than doubling the number of hours spent online
each week in the last decade from ten hours

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.090
to more than 20.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.760
So is it possible, as some scientists have
suggested, that the increase in social networking

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.050
site usage is negatively affecting how we
relate to others emotionally and gain a sense

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.750
of personal identity in this critical phase
of neural development?

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.750
No.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.060
At least, not according to scientists at University
College London and the University of Oxford

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.440
who say that there is no evidence from neuroscience
studies to show that typical internet use

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.440
harms the adolescent brain.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.530
If anything, it’s actually useful.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.290
Rather than hamper social interaction, adolescents’
use of social networking sites has been found

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.500
to enhance the overall quality of friendships
and relationships.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.230
The team also found that people generally
portray their lives accurately, making online

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.560
interaction closer to in person connections.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.630
Moving beyond the social side, the same research
team found that computer games don’t necessarily

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.130
lead to impulsiveness, a shorter attention
span, or aggression.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.530
And as for the idea that easy access to search
engines breeds superficial mental processing

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.420
rather than deep knowledge and understanding,
the researchers say it’s impossible to blame

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.470
technology alone for this change in thought
process; a lot of things can contribute to

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.650
the way a person thinks.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.210
But this isn’t to say that spending all
your time online is a good thing.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.910
There are still negative effects, though it’s
an indirect correlation.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.360
It’s not technology affecting children's
capacities, it’s the fact that using technology

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.010
is displacing other activities that are equally
important for development.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.280
And these are pretty easy correlations to
see.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.770
Low levels of physical activity associated
with sitting around on the Internet have been

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.970
linked to obesity and diabetes.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.480
And it’s the time spent playing video games
rather than doing homework that’s responsible

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.680
for dropping grades among teenage gamers,
not the games themselves.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.440
So it’s not all bad.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.390
Like pretty much everything, we just need
to make sure we have a good balance in our

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.860
lives, especially those among us whose brains
are still developing.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.210
But are your online friends real friends?

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:08.020
Julia took at look at the science behind this
one:

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.250
How much time do you guys spend online every
day, and do you feel closer to your friends

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.430
for all the time spent snooping their facebook
pictures?
