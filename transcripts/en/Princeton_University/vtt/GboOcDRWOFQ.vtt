00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.900
SPEAKER 1: I ran across this
article that started with a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.680
headline, caterpillars
communicate with their butts.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.580
And when I read the headline
I thought, wow

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.640
what a great theme.


00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.750
I get to talk about
communication and animals and

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.000
funny things.


00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.280 position:97%
 


00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.290
So how do we communicate?


00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.100
SPEAKER 2: Through
sound, waves,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.920
body movements, hearing.


00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.370
SPEAKER 3: It was just
really interactive.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.940
I did the telephone.


00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.350
SPEAKER 1: And you pass the
message along [? the line. ?]

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.080 position:97%
 


00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.910
SPEAKER 4: Something,
something Monday.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.330
SPEAKER 1: Something,
something Monday.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.500
SPEAKER 5: I heard, like,
blueberry pears on Monday.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.670
SPEAKER 1: Blueberry pears
on Monday, OK.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.430
Bonnie sells bluebells at
Princeton on Monday.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.110
There's a wave of sound that
you see as a wave in the

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.060
heights of the candles.


00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.750
Right?


00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.780
Some are low.


00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.260
Everyone see that?


00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.750
SPEAKER 6: I learned that
bacteria can light up.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.750
SPEAKER 7: This certain kind
of bacteria glows up in the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.170
dark and it's on the squid.


00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.480 position:97%
 


00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.100
SPEAKER 8: The bacteria make the
light, they get fed, and

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.100
the squid uses the light
to protect itself.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.810
SPEAKER 7: And without this
bacteria, the squid could

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.490
never get food.


00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.510
SPEAKER 8: I love talking to
kids and doing outreach and

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.090
trying to make young people
or old people think

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.680
that science is cool.


00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.020
That it's mysterious.


00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.280
That it's beautiful like the
way these bacteria make

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.880
bioluminescences beautiful.


00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.400
And that anyone can learn it.


00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:25.800 position:97%
 


00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.310
SPEAKER 1: This kind of
movement, this vibration is

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.130
very important.


00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.580
Can they be made visible?


00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.940
Can we see what it is exactly
is [? the sound ?]

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.190
Can we visualize it?


00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:52.890 position:97%
 


00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.900
SPEAKER 3: I think that this was
a really cool experience.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.680
And I want to come back
for another one.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.290
Thank you.
