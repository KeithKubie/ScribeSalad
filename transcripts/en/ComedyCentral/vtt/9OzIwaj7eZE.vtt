00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.340
- Hello I'm Paul F. Thompkins.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.842
This is a bow tie.

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:11.311
This is a lie.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:19.152
I'm gonna show you
how to tie a bow tie.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.887
And then you're gonna know.

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:23.089 align:start size:84% position:16%
Here's what you do,
you have your bow tie.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.358
Put it around your
stupid neck okay

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.894
put it under your shirt collar

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:30.563
button up your collar, be nice

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.932
then pull the right side down

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:34.768
you want it so that
the left side will be

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:37.437
half the length
of the right side

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:40.473
you will cross the
right, the long end

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:43.710
over the left, the
short end, like so.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.581
Then you will flip the long
end over like this right

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:53.420 align:start size:94% position:6%
tighten it, let it drop
down, this is easy so far.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.556 align:start size:94% position:6%
You're barely doing
anything, I'm mad at you.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:01:00.693 align:start size:97% position:3%
Then this back part, you're
gonna take it like this

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:05.165
flip her over like that, this
is where you're making the bow

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.667 align:start size:84% position:16%
do you see the magic,
it is revealed,

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:09.636
everything is illuminated

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:13.139 align:start size:97% position:3%
hold the bow like this, hold
the back part like this.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:15.742 align:start size:84% position:16%
Let the front part
flop over then you are

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.645 align:start size:84% position:16%
going to bring
these ends together.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.114
The fabric here of the back part

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:23.083
you're going to
push this through

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:27.687 align:start size:97% position:3%
the little hole that you
have created behind the bow.

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:30.490
Did you see the little
hole see there's a thing

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.826 align:start size:97% position:3%
in there right that's
where the bow goes through.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:36.129 align:start size:88% position:13%
Push the fabric through
the little hole.

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:38.765
I'm trying to give you
a good angle on this

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:41.134 align:start size:97% position:3%
because a lot of tutorial
videos will not show you that

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:43.436 align:start size:97% position:3%
and it'll be very frustrating
and then you'll end up

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:45.638 align:start size:88% position:13%
with a repetitive stress
injury in your arm

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:47.574
like someone who is me

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:51.744
pull the alternating sides,
the back, front, free ends

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.281 align:start size:88% position:13%
and the closed loops,
pull them back and forth

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:59.385
to make small adjustments to
the tightness of the knot.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:00.620 align:start size:84% position:16%
Its okay if it looks
a little sloppy

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.022
that's how people know
that you actually did it

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:05.158
like a real big boy or girl.

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:06.893
That's your bow tie, I
did this without a mirror

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:10.697
and you can too once you
got it you got it for life.

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:12.999 align:start size:81% position:19%
It's just like
smoking cigarettes

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.701
which I'm assuming you're doing.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:17.837
Or should be just kidding
that's for dumb people

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:19.973 align:start size:97% position:3%
I hope you learned
something and that something

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.041
that I hope you learned
is how to tie a bow tie

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.944 align:start position:0%
because that's what I was
trying to f**king get you to do.

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.379 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm Paul F. Tompkins
and this has been

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.715
an at midnight master class.
