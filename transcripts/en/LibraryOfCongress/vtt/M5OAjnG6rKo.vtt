through donations, gifts, bequests,

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.070 position:67%

in the work that this wonderful library is doing

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.680 position:98%
and especially the work that it's doing here tonight on Africa.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.340 position:97%
We hope this morning's symposium and tonight's program will interest you

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.420 position:97%

So Imani, that's right.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.010
[ pause ]

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.210 position:72%
Imani Countess: Good evening Professor Achebe,

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.940 position:95%

On behalf of TransAfrica Forum's board of directors,

our Chairmen Danny Glover, and our Executive Director, Nicole Lee,

who could not attend this event tonight due

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.110 position:56%
to circumstances beyond her control,

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.210 position:78%
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:53.790 position:69%
for celebrating with us the 50th anniversary

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.960 position:58%
of Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.870 position:88%
We were delighted when the Library of Congress's African

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.710 position:97%
and Middle Eastern Division and the Library of Congress Center

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.020 position:80%
for the book approached us to collaborate with them

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.940 position:97%
on this very important event, and we hope that this is the beginning

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.950 position:70%
of future collaborations of our institutions.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.270 position:98%
As you know, TransAfrica Forum is a social justice organization

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.620 position:67%
dedicated to justice for the African world.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.770 position:75%
Tonight's important event is part of our mission

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.810 position:84%
through our Arthur R. Ashe, Jr. foreign policy library

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.680 position:98%
of educating U.S. citizens on issues related to Africa, the Caribbean

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:46.380
and Latin America with programs

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.120 position:72%
such as our African World Visions film series,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
our Viewpoint lecture series,

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:55.050 position:58%
Readers' Corner, and Writers' Corner.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:58.030 position:97%
There are several members of our staff, including the ever popular

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:02.830
and incredible Lezum Tali

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:07.170 position:98%
, and they would be delighted to talk with you further about the work

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:10.330 position:73%
that we do, and of course you can visit our Web

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.520
site www.transafricaforum.org.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:18.210 position:95%
Things Fall Apart exposes the destruction of African culture,

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:22.370 position:83%
agency, and governance, in this case the Igbo culture

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.200 position:56%
of Nigeria during the colonial rule.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:29.460 position:75%
More than just a study of colonial exploitation,

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:33.090 position:58%
the novel reveals the authentic voice

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.980 position:97%
of a Nigerian retelling the beauty and trials of colonial period

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:41.150 position:59%
from the perspective of the colonized.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.360 position:64%
The characters are alive with the nuances

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:47.370
and the pain of colonization.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:51.430 position:64%
The story is African, but also universal,

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:55.220 position:92%
evidenced by its worldwide appeal for the past fifty years,

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:59.250 position:91%
becoming the most widely read novel in African Literature.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.680 position:97%
When released in 1958, it emerged as an important cultural voice

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.780
of Africa's independence movement.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:13.690 position:94%
Indeed this voice impacted the African Diasporas for freedom

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.280 position:56%
against the vestiges of colonialism.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.950 position:98%
Things Fall Apart continues to influence today's emerging writers

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:27.270
of the African world and beyond.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:30.300 position:91%
Thank you, Chinua Achebe, for this universal African story

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:35.010
and happy birthday.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:46.010
[ pause ]

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:58.320 position:98%
I'm the director of the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress,

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:02.130
which is the reading promotion arm.

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:05.530 position:77%
The center was created in 1977 by Daniel Boorstin

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:10.080 position:97%
when he was the Librarian of Congress, and he wanted the Library

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:13.550 position:97%
of Congress to do more in our broader culture to promote books

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.800
and reading, and that's what we do.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.930 position:78%
We do it primarily in the states through a network

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:24.940
of affiliated state centers.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.520 position:97%
Each state has created a center to work with us to promote books

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:30.470 position:98%
and reading in their states while we do it on the National level.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:34.910 position:81%
But we're very proud that in the last fifteen years,

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:39.380
we have an international component,

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.440 position:80%
we have actually stimulated the creation of centers

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:45.340
for the book in several countries.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.370 position:66%
to mention tonight briefly, one is Russia.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:51.850 position:84%
There are over thirty five libraries throughout Russia

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:55.330 position:97%
that have created centers to help promote book and reading culture

00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.320 position:84%
in Russia, and to strengthen the democratic connection

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:03.780 position:63%
between libraries and reading in Russia.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.720
But one that started even earlier,

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:10.380 position:92%
a decade earlier was the South African Center for the book,

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.840 position:95%
it's a partnership with the National Library of South Africa,

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:17.590 position:61%
and it's based in the Cape Town Campus,

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:20.180 position:72%
and it's especially interesting because rather

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:22.440 position:67%
than doing the reading promotion in the way

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:25.050 position:88%
that we have done it traditionally, they've taken a look

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:28.850 position:83%
at the new democratic South Africa and connected some

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.620 position:97%
of the vernacular languages that have no real written culture,

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:38.390 position:80%
looked at the need for families and family literacy

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:42.240 position:84%
and started publishing books for young readers in some

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:45.950
of the vernacular languages --

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:47.730 position:72%
formally vernacular languages in South Africa.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.360 position:75%
So the new books are a family reading experience

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.400 position:84%
for younger readers and older readers, and it's turned

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:57.870 position:58%
out to be a success project supported

00:11:55.110 --> 00:12:00.110 position:59%
by publishers throughout South Africa.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:04.990 position:97%
We are so happy to have you here tonight; this is a wonderful,

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:08.470 position:67%
special kind of reading promotion activity.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:12.590 position:91%
We have had so much help, part of our help comes from you,

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:15.650 position:97%
the audience, being here and being so enthusiastic, not only tonight

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.320 position:91%
but also during today when there was a wonderful symposium

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:24.710 position:91%
and as Mary Jane had said, a wonderful way for the Library

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:28.190 position:80%
of Congress to demonstrate that it is truly a world

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:31.530
and an international library.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.800 position:69%
I, too, would like to thank our co-sponsors.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:35.890 position:56%
They have helped make this possible,

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.680 position:83%
and wait until you taste the wonderful treats for you

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:41.990
in the reception for you tonight.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.920 position:97%
But I am especially glad, of course, and thankful for the achievements

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:47.180 position:98%
and presence of our special guest, honoree, and our birthday boy --

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:52.020
[ laughter ]

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:53.020 position:98%
-- the distinguished novelist, poet, and critic, Chinua Achebe.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:59.510
[ applause ]

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:06.490 position:98%
Born in 1930, Mr. Achebe was raised by Christian parents in the Ebuke

[ spelled phonetically ]

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000 position:66%
village of Ogidi, in Southeastern Nigeria.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.960 position:67%
He excelled in school and won a scholarship

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:19.010
for his undergraduate studies.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:21.280 position:64%
He became fascinated with world religions

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:23.790 position:92%
and traditional African cultures, and began writing stories

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:27.700
when he was a university student.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:30.140 position:61%
After graduation and work as a teacher,

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:32.710 position:69%
he joined the Nigerian Broadcasting Service,

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:35.650 position:97%
and it was during this period he wrote his first and, of course,

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:38.490 position:64%
his most famous novel, Things Fall Apart.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:41.810 position:89%
It was one of the first African novels written in English

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:45.280
to achieve national acclaim.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000 position:59%
Set in the early days of colonization,

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.680 position:98%
Things Fall Apart tells the tragic story of a warrior, Okonkwo,

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:55.660 position:98%
who rigidly identifies with the values of traditional Igbo culture.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.720 position:92%
For this reason, he lacks the flexibility of mind and heart

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:03.970
to adapt to the changing conditions

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.200 position:58%
under imminent European colonization.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:10.090 position:98%
One of the first works of fiction to present African village life

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.940 position:98%
from an African perspective, Things Fall Apart was published in 1958,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:19.360 position:97%
just two years before the end of the Century of British rule in Nigeria.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:24.450 position:98%
And of course we are celebrating it as has been mentioned, tonight,

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:27.650 position:78%
the 50th anniversary of its publication this year.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:32.790 position:66%
Written primarily for an African audience,

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:35.510
Mr. Achebe's novels have gained,

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:37.460 position:75%
as already has been mentioned, universal appeal.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:40.900 position:86%
Things Fall Apart is the most widely read African novel

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:44.580 position:72%
and has become one of the most important books

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:47.100
in African literature.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.760 position:63%
It has been translated into 50 languages

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:52.530 position:72%
and has sold well more than 10 million copies.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.740 position:97%
Through subsequent novels, short stories, poetry, critical essays,

00:14:55.810 --> 00:15:00.810 position:94%
and political commentary, Mr. Achebe has consistently argued

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:05.380 position:97%
for the right of Africans to tell their own stories in their own ways.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:10.650 position:89%
Currently the Charles P. Stevenson Professor of Languages

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.820 position:97%
and Literature at Bard College in Annandale-On-Hudson, New York,

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:18.590 position:92%
he made a special trip to Washington to be with us tonight.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:22.030
May I present Mr. Chinua Achebe.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:47.010
[ pause ]

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:09.840 position:56%
I appreciate the kindness very much.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:17.600 position:94%
When the invitation came to me, it sounded as if the Library

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:29.360 position:73%
of Congress was going to celebrate my birthday.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:34.350
[ laughter ]

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:35.350 position:84%
And I said that was -- "Do they do not that normally?"

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.980
[ laughter ]

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.980 position:89%
So, anyway, it seems they do and I've seen a large number

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.760 position:75%
of organizations that have co-sponsored my visit

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:59.470 position:64%
and I really -- I deeply appreciate this.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:05.230 position:84%
All I've been asked to do in return is to read to you.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:11.510
[ laughter ]

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:12.510 position:69%
And I hope, you know, it's simply a token --

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:17.560 position:77%
the reading is simply a token of my appreciation.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.980
It doesn't pay for it.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:29.050 position:89%
It's Things Fall Apart we are celebrating, talking about.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:35.180 position:70%
Let me read you a short piece from that book.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:42.330 position:98%
But I should tell you that I have written other books, as well.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.800
[ laughter ]

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:52.800 position:77%
Though, we may not be talking about them tonight.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:57.950 position:61%
Now, this passage, I would say it's one

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:04.290 position:56%
of my favorite passages in the book.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.520 position:92%
Now and again, you know, when you pick up a book you've had

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.860 position:72%
for years -- I don't know whether this happens

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:23.490 position:58%
to other people but it happens to me.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:26.050 position:81%
Sometimes you find something you've not seen before.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.960 position:97%
And the case of a book that has been knocking around for 50 years,

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.700
that is really a surprise.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000 position:61%
And it's one of the mysteries, I think,

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:48.170
of literature, of art in general.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:52.540 position:81%
I am -- this is one such passage, which I found, no,

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:05.330 position:97%
I won't tell you what it is because it's difficult to tell other people,

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:14.280 position:86%
but I suddenly realized that this passage has a meaning

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:22.550
which I had not thought about.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:28.060 position:95%
Now I must also, by the way, before I begin I must thank many

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:33.990 position:97%
of my colleagues who've come from different parts of the United States

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.680 position:67%
and maybe even beyond to attend this event.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.840 position:86%
Real stars in the literary and the scholarly profession

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:58.100
who have honor, who honored me.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:06.620 position:97%
The great thing in my view for when people might call me up --

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:16.910 position:98%
peers, instead of being jealous of you, or being unhappy about you,

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:30.570 position:98%
when your peers suddenly show great affection by saying thank you

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.800 position:97%
to you, it's an amazing blessing and so I say thank you very much.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:51.440 position:98%
Now, I hope you have read Things Fall Apart but if you haven't --

00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.680
[ laughter ]

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.680 position:63%
-- if you haven't, there's still time --

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:04.090
[ laughter ]

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:05.370 position:86%
-- before -- because this is not at the very beginning,

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:08.720
it's towards about the middle.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:12.430 position:97%
Okay. Now the story of Things Fall Apart is a story of a strong man,

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:24.680 position:70%
that's how one of the publishers described it

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.640
when it came out in 1958.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:37.410 position:67%
This -- some people have called him a hero.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:42.110 position:70%
There is still a lot of discussion about him.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:51.330 position:89%
He suddenly was a hero in my view, a hero of these people

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:59.190 position:78%
for defending the rights of his people, he fought.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:04.340 position:78%
He was not a prophet; no hero seems to be perfect.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:11.670 position:73%
It seems the heroes have a problem quite often.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:17.090 position:78%
We create an interesting situation for the writer,

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:22.080 position:94%
because here's a man who's honored by his community and yet,

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:30.590 position:98%
there is this flaw that he doesn't seem to be able to get beyond,

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:39.660 position:61%
and it's the flaw of single-mindedness.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.480 position:56%
And so you deal with it as a writer.

00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:00.590 position:89%
This human being, and it has to be -- he has to be human.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:09.900 position:84%
There's no point writing about a hero who is an angel.

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:15.070 position:86%
That's not of any value to us because we're not angels,

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:20.300 position:67%
but we can recognize a hero who has a flaw,

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:25.360
unless we are very, very stupid.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:32.140 position:81%
So that's one reason why it's attractive to artists,

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:44.370 position:89%
Now, I won't say too much more, except that at this point

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:51.630 position:98%
in the story, Okonkwo has committed what is considered a very big

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:59.750
offense in his community.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:02.440 position:75%
He has killed a member of the clan, by accident.

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:10.910 position:84%
And because it's by accident his punishment is reduced

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:16.360
to exile for seven years.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:19.550 position:67%
If it weren't, it would have been for life.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000 position:98%
Now Okonkwo is a very ambitious man, and he's very much disturbed

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:34.790
by this turn in his life,

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:40.360 position:69%
and he goes into exile to his mother's clan.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:46.320
And he's living there, now.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:51.010 position:98%
He's so depressed that his uncle, his mother's younger brother,

00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:01.340 position:98%
who's now Okonkwo's host, looks at his nephew and he's disturbed.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:13.210 position:92%
He's troubled because he sees depression and perhaps worse,

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:23.710 position:92%
and so he decides to do something about it, to do something

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:29.870 position:63%
to get Okonkwo out of his state of mind.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:35.860 position:67%
And that's the piece I'm going to read now.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:44.730 position:83%
Okonkwo and his family -- I'm sorry I'll begin again.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:58.360 position:94%
Okonkwo and his family worked very hard to plant a new farm.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:06.800 position:97%
But it was like beginning life anew without the vigor and enthusiasm

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:14.510 position:89%
of youth, like learning to become left-handed in old age.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:22.470 position:88%
Work no longer had for him the pleasure it used to have,

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:26.960 position:98%
and when there was no work to do he sat in a silent half-sleep.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:36.260 position:67%
His life had been ruled by a great passion:

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:41.110 position:61%
to become one of the lords of the clan.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:45.270
That had been his life-spring.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:52.700
Then everything had been broken.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.200 position:69%
He had been cast out of his clan like a fish

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:05.820
onto a dry, sandy beach, panting.

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:11.290 position:97%
Clearly his personal god or chi was not made for great things.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:20.810 position:80%
A man could not rise beyond the destiny of his chi.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:27.710 position:59%
The saying of the elders was not true,

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:31.500 position:70%
that if a man said yea his chi also affirmed.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:45.290 position:98%
Here was a man whose chi had said no despite his own affirmation.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:54.870 position:98%
The old man, Uchendu, saw clearly that Okonkwo had yielded to despair

00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:01.870
and was greatly troubled.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:04.710 position:77%
He would speak to him after the isa-ifi ceremony.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.040 position:78%
On the second day Uchendu called together his sons

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:31.100 position:59%
and daughters and his nephew, Okonkwo.

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:36.430 position:97%
The men brought their goatskin mats, with which they sat on the floor,

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:42.990 position:97%
and the women sat on a sisal mat spread on a raised bank of earth.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:53.260 position:97%
Uchendu pulled gently at his gray beard and gnashed his teeth.

00:28:55.910 --> 00:29:00.910 position:98%
Then he began to speak, quietly and deliberately, picking his words

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:10.960
with great care: "It is Okonkwo

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:16.790 position:70%
that I primarily wish to speak to," he began.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:23.080 position:84%
"But I want all of you to note what I am going to say.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.960 position:64%
I am an old man and you are all children.

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:43.350 position:69%
I know more about the world than any of you.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:47.630
If there is any one among you

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:51.930 position:67%
who thinks he knows more let him speak up."

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:57.770
He paused, but no one spoke.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:10.410
This is not his clan.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:18.380
He does not belong here.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:21.150 position:97%
He is an exile, condemned for seven years to live in a strange land.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:30.660
And so he is bowed with grief.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:34.700 position:78%
But there is one question I would like to ask him.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:41.240 position:69%
Can you tell me, Okonkwo, why it is that one

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:47.510 position:83%
of the commonest names we give our children is Nneka,

00:30:55.430 --> 00:31:00.430 position:75%
We all know that a man is the head of the family

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:03.730
and his wives do his bidding.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.880 position:70%
A child belongs to its father and his family,

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:14.100
not to its mother and her family.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:17.460 position:81%
A man belongs to his fatherland, not his motherland.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:24.470 position:64%
And yet we say Nneka-'Mother is Supreme.'

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:30.140
Why is that?"

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:37.420 position:69%
"I want Okonkwo to answer me," said Uchendu.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.960 position:69%
"I do not know the answer," Okonkwo replied.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:48.080
"You do not know the answer?

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:55.080 position:98%
You have many wives and many children, more children than I have.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:03.160
You are a great man in your clan.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:06.320 position:56%
But you are still a child, my child.

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:17.290 position:83%
But first there is one more question I shall ask you.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:23.680 position:77%
Why is it that when a woman dies she's taken home

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:29.780
to be buried with her own kinsmen?

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:32.990 position:70%
She is not buried with her husband's kinsmen.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:37.790
Why is that?

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.600 position:97%
Your mother was brought home to me, here, and buried with my people.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:45.260
Why was that?"

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:52.690 position:98%
"He does not know that either," said Uchendu, "and yet he is full

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:59.950 position:58%
of sorrow because he has come to live

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:03.600
in his motherland for a few years."

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:06.560 position:97%
He laughed a mirthless laughter, and turned to his sons and daughters.

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:16.020
"What about you?

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:21.650
They all shook their heads.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:24.790 position:81%
"Then listen to me," he said and cleared his throat.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:31.640 position:72%
"It's true that a child belongs to its father.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:36.250
But when a father beats his child,

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:39.620 position:59%
it seeks sympathy in its mother's hut.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:43.560 position:98%
A man belongs to his fatherland when things are good and life is sweet.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:52.470
But when there is sorrow

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:54.150 position:77%
and bitterness he finds refuge in his motherland.

00:33:55.350 --> 00:34:00.350 position:56%
Your mother is there to protect you.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:06.650 position:72%
And that is why we say that mother is supreme.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:12.610
Is it right that you, Okonkwo,

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:19.270 position:97%
should bring to your mother a heavy face and refuse to be comforted?

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:28.790 position:64%
Be careful or you may displease the dead.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.840 position:97%
Your duty is to comfort your wives and children and take them back

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:44.340 position:58%
to your fatherland after seven years.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:48.790 position:86%
But if you allow sorrow to weigh you down and kill you,

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:03.990
"These are now your kinsmen."

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:12.080 position:84%
"You think you are the greatest sufferer in the world?

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:17.770 position:83%
Do you know that men are sometimes banished for life?

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:21.270 position:78%
Do you know that men sometimes lose all their yams

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:26.740
and even their children?

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:34.580 position:59%
I have none now except that young girl

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:37.960 position:64%
who doesn't know her right from her left.

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:40.870 position:95%
Do you know how many children I have buried, children I begot

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:48.880
in my youth and strength?

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:55.240 position:69%
I did not hang myself, and I am still alive.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:02.940 position:66%
If you think you are the greatest sufferer

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:06.060 position:58%
in the world ask my daughter, Akueni,

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:11.610 position:70%
how many twins she has borne and thrown away.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:18.290 position:89%
Have you not heard the song they sing when a woman dies?"

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:24.300 position:66%
'For whom is it well, for whom is it well?

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:29.560 position:58%
There is no one for whom it is well.'

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:38.040
[ Igbo ]

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:47.510
[ applause ]

00:36:55.990 --> 00:37:00.990 position:67%
Obviously I'm going to read one piece more.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:06.240
Can you take one more?

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:14.480 position:67%
Yeah. The language you use is very crucial.

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:20.810 position:97%
And so what I thought I should add to the prose, which just had --

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:28.440 position:97%
is a poem in which I wrote in Igbo, and then ask one of my friends

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:42.870 position:97%
And so I will read the translation first, the translation done

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:51.380 position:95%
by my friend, and then I will read the original Igbo version.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:09.810 position:97%
If anybody asks you who was the translator, it's Professor Mangate

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:17.280
[ spelled phonetically ]

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:21.010 position:98%
And this is a wake, I wrote this for a very close friend of mine,

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:32.980 position:97%
a very fine poet, some people would say the finest of our poets:

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:39.440 position:98%
Christopher Okigbo, who was killed fighting in the Biafran War.

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:46.950 position:69%
And I've sort of based this poem on the form

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:57.460
of a dirge in Igbo tradition.

00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:01.830 position:98%
The Igbo people have the custom, especially among the young people,

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:12.580 position:97%
that when a member of an age grade dies, the other members will go

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:21.080 position:58%
down to town, looking for him or her.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:26.210 position:97%
They pretend that -- not he or she, I'm sorry -- what gender does.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:38.990
[ laughter ]

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:39.990 position:61%
They sing until their age-mate returns.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.920 position:84%
This is the idea, of chanting, looking for the person.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:54.690
But it's hide-and-seek.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:59.430 position:88%
And "Nzomalizo" is the refrain you will hear frequently,

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:13.050 position:98%
And they do this until daybreak, and then they go home and accept

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:23.730
that the rumor is in fact true.

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:28.340 position:83%
Okay, "A Wake For Okigbo"* For whom are we searching?

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:38.450
For whom are we searching?

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:44.020
Nzomalizo Has he gone for firewood?

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:51.120
Has he gone to fetch water?

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:55.770
Has he gone to the marketplace?

For Okigbo we are searching.

For whom are we searching?

Nzomalizo Has he gone for firewood?

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:18.940
Has he gone to the stream?

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:24.400 position:56%
Has he gone to the market, then keep

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:27.260 position:61%
from him you Tumult of the marketplace.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:30.860 position:91%

For Okigbo we are searching.

Nzomalizo They bring home a dance, who is to dance it for us?

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:47.200 position:75%
They bring home a war, who will fight it for us?

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:52.860 position:98%
The one we call repeatedly, there is something he alone can do.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:58.910 position:92%
It is Okigbo we are calling Nzomalizo Witness the dance how

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:06.050
it arrives!

But the caller of the dance is nowhere to be found The brave one

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:16.290
in battle is nowhere in sight!

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:19.010 position:81%
Do you not see now that who we call again and again,

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:24.400
there is something he alone can do.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:27.280 position:97%
It is Okigbo we are calling Nzomalizo The dance ends abruptly!

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:37.810 position:91%
The spirit dancers fold their dance and depart in mid-day;

Rain soaks the stalwart, soaks the two-sided drum The flute is broken

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:53.430 position:75%
that elevates the spirit The music pot shattered

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:57.510 position:97%
that accompanies the leg in its measure Brave one of my blood!

Brave one of Igboland!

Brave one in the middle of so much blood!

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:02.110 position:69%
to have a brief question and answer session,

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:04.850 position:67%
and our host is going to be Mr. Moali Linos

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:08.060
[ spelled phonetically ]

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:11.050
[ pause ]

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:39.990
Audience: Good evening.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:43.600 position:61%
so I've been given some questions here,

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:48.240 position:58%
that I will pose to Professor Achebe.

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:50.130 position:98%
But I'll take the liberty to ask one that I always wanted to ask.

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:59.450
[ laughter ]

00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:02.020 position:83%
The question is: When you started writing this novel,

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:06.370 position:98%
Things Fall Apart, I believe you were in your fifties at that time.

00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:12.550
Female Speaker: Twenties.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:17.050
Chinua Achebe I was 28.

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:19.030 position:97%
Moali Linos: Did you share with your friends, or with your teachers,

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:23.060 position:69%
the fifth drafts that you made of that work?

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:26.590 position:67%
And, secondly, did you have any inclination

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:31.590 position:78%
after you had submitted the work to the publishers

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:36.060 position:59%
that this would become a classic book.

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:41.220
[ laughter ]

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:43.270 position:91%
Chinua Achebe: No, I didn't share the drafts with anybody.

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:53.190 position:59%
There was nobody to share drafts with.

00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:56.930
[ laughter ]

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:58.010 position:97%
My teachers didn't believe that there was any chance for Africans,

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:11.080 position:94%
African children, African young men to aspire to be writers.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:20.520 position:73%
I say that because when the book was published,

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:28.200 position:78%
the publisher did this news to some of my teachers

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:37.110 position:69%
and the university college: Mostly lecturers

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:45.520 position:56%
from British universities of course.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:49.590 position:97%
And they just laughed at the whole idea: Achebe write a novel?

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:57.490
That kind of thing.

00:48:56.730 --> 00:49:01.730 position:98%
So this was told by my publisher, but I already knew because I had --

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:07.070 position:75%
we had an event which the department of English,

00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:17.310 position:97%
the University College Ibadan, they asked us students to compete

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:27.010 position:98%
if we wanted to, to write a short story and I wrote one, and sent in.

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:40.930 position:67%
The result, when it came out, was not good.

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:51.030
[ laughter ]

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:52.030 position:80%
But there was a saving grace, it didn't totally say

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:56.460 position:70%
that there was no effort that was good enough

00:49:56.590 --> 00:50:01.590 position:58%
to win a prize, didn't only say that.

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:08.150 position:97%
It had a short note that said that made a comment about my own effort.

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:18.950 position:92%
It said something like, "it wasn't bad, it wasn't too bad."

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:27.800
[ laughter ]

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:28.800 position:89%
That kind of thing, and -- so it lacked form, by the way.

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:36.540
The reason is it lacked form.

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:41.560 position:89%
So I was delighted that I was mentioned these dispatches.

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:47.740
[ laughter ]

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:53.950
What was it?

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:59.890 position:91%
So I stopped her one day and I said, "But this form thing,

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:06.640 position:94%
can you tell me how -- what I need to do to get form into --

00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:15.770 position:67%
" And she was going to play tennis that day

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:19.030
so she said, "Oh yeah, we'll meet."

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:25.830 position:97%
So I asked her several times over the -- I think the whole term.

00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:36.790 position:89%
And she always found some reason not to have the meeting.

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:45.080 position:98%
And then suddenly, one day after months, she stopped me and said,

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:55.350 position:77%
"you know, I look at that -- at your story again,

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:05.230 position:89%
So, you know, what that said to me was, there's no point.

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:15.300 position:98%
Nobody here is going to tell you how you will write your story.

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:22.680 position:98%
It was made very clear to me I was young, but it was very clear

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:30.480 position:72%
that you better look for something else to do.

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:35.650
And so that's what I did.

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:37.500 position:97%
So I wasn't expecting that there was anybody I could show a draft,

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:43.140
in any case I don't work that way.

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:48.960
[ laughter ]

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:53.510
[ applause ]

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:59.160 position:81%
I am -- you become quite authoritarian when you take

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:04.020 position:56%
on something like writing, you know?

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:12.100 position:81%
I had to be the judge for what would leave my house.

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:19.270 position:63%
And onto this day that's the way I work.

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:23.490 position:77%
Moali Linos: Okay, I have another question, here.

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:28.530 position:98%
Unfortunately, people who have posed the questions have not written

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:34.160 position:80%
down their names, so I will just ask the questions.

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:37.680 position:89%
Okay, this question is, "What is the most profound effect

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:41.550 position:83%
that writing Things Fall Apart has had on your life?"

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:45.740
Chinua Achebe: Wow.

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:48.290
[ laughter ]

00:53:57.250 --> 00:54:02.250
Did it change my life?

00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:10.740 position:83%
of writing Things Fall Apart actually changed my life

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:15.110 position:80%
because I had to invent the language of that story.

00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:23.590 position:88%
It was not something that anybody was teaching anywhere,

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:30.100 position:72%
the conversation between Igbo and the English.

00:54:33.090 --> 00:54:38.090 position:92%
That had not -- and so I had to make it up as I went along.

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:46.790 position:92%
And so that meant that when I came to write the second one,

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:54.860 position:97%
I already had the style, this form of writing, which was created

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:04.530 position:83%
by the novel itself because the novel was able to say

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:09.320
to me, "No no no, not that.

00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:15.950
And so I imagined this conversation

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:19.880 position:61%
between two equally powerful languages.

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:24.550 position:61%
Not one language and some pigeon thing.

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:29.200 position:59%
Which is possible, you could use that.

00:55:30.830 --> 00:55:35.830 position:97%
What I decided this has got to be two languages in their full right.

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:44.460 position:69%
Talking or attempting to talk to each other,

00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:48.300
and that is what I wanted to do.

00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:50.770 position:67%
So there was no point going anywhere for --

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:57.770
so that was a great change

00:55:57.530 --> 00:56:02.530 position:67%
in my whole career, I think, that decision.

00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:08.620 position:59%
Moali Linos: Okay, here's another one:

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:13.150
"Are things really falling apart,

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:15.150 position:83%
or have they started coming back together in Africa?"

00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:20.210
[ laughter ]

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:21.210 position:98%
Chinua Achebe: Well, actually it's always happened in both of them.

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:26.130
Depends on where you look.

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:28.780 position:73%
And so in some ways things are coming together,

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:35.120 position:67%
in some ways they are always falling apart.

00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:41.610 position:98%
Moali Linos: Another question: "Do you think the power of the--

00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:47.940 position:97%
" sorry, "do you think that the power of the tribe can integrate

00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:51.390 position:69%
or reconcile with what is called democracy?"

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:54.130 position:88%
Chinua Achebe: I don't like the use of the word "tribe."

00:56:55.510 --> 00:57:00.510
[ cheers and applause ]

00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:06.060 position:75%
Some people don't know this -- if you take up --

00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:11.870
if you check your dictionary,

00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:14.310 position:66%
I don't know which one you use, whichever.

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:19.710 position:83%
If it's like the one I use you will find, inevitably,

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:27.940
that "tribe" carries a certain

00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:33.980 position:86%
with it. It's defined always in terms of the primitive.

00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:41.230 position:94%
Yeah. So I wasn't interested in writing about the primitive.

00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:47.910 position:67%
And so that's the first thing, I don't like

00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:54.710
[ inaudible ]

00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:55.710 position:91%
, and it's very important if you're going to talk in terms

00:57:55.870 --> 00:58:00.870 position:91%
of two languages in conversation, you mustn't think of one

00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:08.750 position:70%
as primitive and the other as something else,

00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:16.330
whatever your ideology may be.

00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:18.960 position:97%
If you want a conversation, not, you know, a governor of -- what is --

00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:41.620 position:70%
somewhere in central Africa was talking about

00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:53.040 position:91%
the horse -- something about the native is like the horse,

00:58:57.890 --> 00:59:02.890 position:92%
or something, and it needs firm handling, kind of language.

00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:13.340 position:97%
And I commented somewhere that if that's how you're going to think

00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:23.140 position:88%
of the Africans and the Europeans in this place in terms

00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:32.340 position:95%
of the Africans being the horses and the Europeans the rider,

00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:41.830 position:91%
you won't get very, very far, because -- you know, anyway.

00:59:50.310 --> 00:59:55.310
Let's leave that.

00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:59.070 position:86%
Yeah, it's the -- convey to you, and this is difficult.

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:09.450 position:98%
My rather strict position on the matter of dialogue between equals,

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:20.900
which is what is useful in the end.

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:27.060 position:73%
The sense that I'm talking to somebody like me,

01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:33.190 position:98%
no you may even be someone better than me, but not so much better

01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:44.230 position:66%
that you can afford to have something less

01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:51.930 position:70%
than the perfect language for your discourse.

01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:59.110
Okay.

01:01:02.070 --> 01:01:07.070 position:95%
Moali Linos: We would love to continue asking more questions,

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:10.420
but we are running out of time

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:13.240 position:66%
because we have something else to do here.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:18.500
So that's all folks.

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:25.340 position:77%
John Cole: We'll have a chance for more questions

01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:27.690 position:98%
at the reception following, which is going to be in the Mumford Room.

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:31.580 position:98%
In the meantime we have a -- for the next phase of our program,

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:35.960 position:89%
you've heard us talk about somebody being a birthday boy.

01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:39.810 position:81%
I think over here on my right comes a special treat.

01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:45.370
Let's all sing "Happy Birthday."

01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:51.190 position:97%

That was Eve Ferguson and Mary Jane who did the honors.

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:29.490
And on behalf of the Library

of Congress we have a small birthday gift, which is a brand new book

They are very inspiring but not quite

01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:43.290 position:69%
as inspiring sometimes as tonight's speaker.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:46.040
So thank you so much.

01:02:50.650 --> 01:02:55.650 position:95%
And Eve is going to take us to the next phase of our program.

Female Speaker: They say that I come from the Dark Continent: Africa.

They say that I come from the Dark Continent: Africa.

01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:10.090 position:61%
The last time I checked the word "dark"

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:13.760 position:98%
in the dictionary it meant evil or wickedness without knowledge

01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:18.170 position:61%
or enlightenment, a state of ignorance,

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:20.480 position:80%
difficult to understand them, the absence of light.

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:26.740 position:88%
But I still believe in Africa and proud to be an African

01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:29.970 position:98%

to disown my ancestors no matter what they say.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:58.720
I am not going to deny my race.

01:05:56.310 --> 01:06:01.310 position:58%
I have chosen to stand up for Africa.

in natural resources: From gold to diamond, rubber to copper,

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:23.640 position:98%

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:27.840 position:73%
Africa exports tea, coffee, just to name a few.
