 To be an athlete, musician, or even the best player, you have to practice uninterruptedly. But 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.430
 to what extent did talent come into play? Are some of us born with one 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.490
 the best chance of being the best in what we do? 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.039
 To study this question in sports, scientists have tried to give it to untrained people 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.449
 the same exercise, to see if the same amount of training will lead to different results. 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.269
 Not so strange, different individuals had different improvements - some improved 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.320
 in big leaps while others seemed stagnant. But interesting, individuals who are connected 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.590
 by blood had similar improvements, shows that their genetics play a role in 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.620
 their athletic potential. If your parent or brother / sister brings up terrible results from the training, 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.720
 so would you. These individuals are considered 'high responsive' in exercises. 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.030
 After the statistical analysis of patience, it was determined that 50% of the athletic improvement 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.040
 was related to genetics. In other words, big athletes are born with large genes. 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.050
 Over time, scientists have been able to isolate specific groups of genes they believe 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.970
 that they are responsible for these features. The high reactors have it and the experience of visible enhancer, 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.380
 no matter how willing they are to start. Conversely, if your genes are considered 'responsive' 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.469
 poor 'for endurance training, skiing sport may not be for you. 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:20.380
 But even before training, scientists notice something else; there were also individuals who had 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.520
 different starting points. Without any training, some individuals were simply 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.140
 more capable than others. It turns out, a different set of genes give some people a higher starting point. 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.960
 In the case of endurance, these genes can encode for large volumes of blood, which in 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.460
 generally seen only by trained athletes. 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.810
 So you may have a high starting point or high-skill training - or both! And this is likely to be our greatest athletes 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.659
 trained as strictly as they could, at the head of having some great genetics. 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.090
 It seems that talent is trained under the right circumstances. 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.000
 So you got what you need to be an Olympic athlete? Science says, you will never know until 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.400
 try it. 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.400
 Remember: we have a new video coming out every day of the Olympics. 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.400
 Can not you wait? Our amazing CBC partners already have five of the videos so far for you. 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.400
 Just go to cbc.ca/olympics/ScienceSays to see them before someone else. Below the description in the video. 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:16.400
 But we also want to know your own questions about this particular series. Use the hashtag of ScienceSays and tell us your fiery Olympic questions.
