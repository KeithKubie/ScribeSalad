JOSH LIVNI: Just hang tight and
we'll make sure everyone

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.905
has a chance to join before we
jump into the Styled Maps.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.670
You're welcome to say
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], if you have

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.540
a question.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.150
I think we by default
have people on

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.970
mute who just joined.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.650
So we'll see if we can get you
unmuted, in case you have an

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.870
immediate question while we're
waiting for some more folks.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.150
MALE SPEAKER: I do,
about Hangouts.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.050
So not about Maps.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.600
I'll save the Maps questions for
when there's more people.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.810
But Mano included a link to
the Google Moderator--

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.270
excuse me, Google Moderator.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.280
And there were different events
in Google Moderator.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.700
So different previous instances
of the Office Hours.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.830
But the link he sent
was empty.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.110
So it went by default
when you went there.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.970
I believe it was empty, or
maybe I didn't wait long

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.350
enough for it to refresh.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.700
So I guess for someone who
hasn't used it much, what is

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.700
the protocol for adding
new questions.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.115
What is the right spot
to add new questions?

00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:11.520
JOSH LIVNI: Well, probably the
right spot is to tell us that

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.060
we made a small mistake and it
should have taken you directly

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.840
to this week's moderator,
rather than the default

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.250
moderator from our
previous one.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.990
So, sorry for the
confusion there.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.490
Next week we'll make sure that
the link is right and it goes

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.360
to the appropriate moderator.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.530
But for future reference, if you
do come across something

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.390
like that, generally the
most recently created

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.672
one is at the top.

00:01:32.672 --> 00:01:36.160
So if you then selected
the top left one--

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.170
and it should have a description
like, moderator

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.210
questions or just hangouts.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.255
So there's a list of five or
six previous ones might be

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:46.385
noted on the left.

00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:48.670
So just pick the top one and
add your question there.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.180
But yes, next week we'll double
check and make sure it

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.685
goes to the correct week instead
of just the default

00:01:53.685 --> 00:01:54.935
list of all of them.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.220
And you're welcome to ask any
Maps questions as well.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.120
We don't want to make you
repeat them later.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.650
MALE SPEAKER:Oh, sure.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.960
I had a couple that I put in
Moderator, which may or may

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.190
not be in the right place.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.979
And sorry for my head appearing
large suddenly.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.730
I was turning off a small
heater that I was using.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.430
So my questions were
the ones about--

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.090
they were related
to map controls.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.870
So I didn't know that today's
topic was styled maps, which

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.450
really interest me.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.810
So I'm looking forward
to that.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.890
But I've seen the MBC how to.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.280
So using the circle and using
MVC controls, using the API.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.620
And I've seen the couple of
examples in the example

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.380
section of the developer
documents, which is a home

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.160
control and a state saving
home control.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.090
But I've been looking
for styleguides.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.330
Specifically, I wanted to
create a control, for

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.030
instance, that is like a full
screen control for hours that

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.410
looks like the control that
is Maps/satellite.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.010
And I can tell from looking at
the CSS that it's browser

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.130
dependent and resolution
dependent.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.480
And essentially I was
asking, is there a

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.470
way to recreate that?

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.790
I mean, I could have CSS that
has those thousands of rules

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.270
and sort of do, if i.e., if
Chrome, if Safari, if this

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.080
other thing.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.110
But really I wanted to
know what is the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.980
right way to do that?

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.300
JOSH LIVNI: Yes.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.730
There's two general approaches
here, I think.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.030
One is to file a feature request
that we should publish

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.640
our CSS, or some way of doing
this in the API, where you can

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.830
not have to worry about copy
and pasting the CSS.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.220
But there's also a way you can
create, for example, I think

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.320
it's really a control.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.460
I'll have to check the reference
in a second.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.500
A button that shows up next
to your other map layers.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.860
And you can customize that
to do whatever you want.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.440
So as long as you're happy with
it being part of, for

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.710
example, layer control, it will
look like your map and

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.270
satellite buttons, but it can
do whatever it is that you

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.170
might want, that's
not necessarily

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.460
just switching a layer.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.220
An example of this is the
Google Earth API utility

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.420
library, which is part
of our Maps v3 third

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.320
party utility libraries.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.930
And there's a button there
that says Earth.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.230
We just added a button next
to the other ones.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.370
But you click it and it calls
a bunch of custom code that

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.302
has an end result of putting
dibs on top of the map, and

00:04:27.302 --> 00:04:29.990
showing plug-in and so on and
so forth, even though it's

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.940
technically part of
the layer control.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.580
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, yes,
I've seen those.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.350
The examples--

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.430
JOSH LIVNI: So that would be one
way to sort of get it so

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.790
no matter what happens, even
if we change the style of

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.280
those buttons in future versions
or whatever, your

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.510
button will match.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.300
But it doesn't give you the
ability to put it in some

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.020
other control elsewhere.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.070
Although again, you can put
those controls off in a

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.116
separate dib and so forth.

00:04:55.116 --> 00:04:55.500
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.160
Yeah, I've seen that.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.770
And I work at a university, so
I've seen examples of other

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.570
universities doing complete
custom controls.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.550
They built the entire thing
themselves, usually for their

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.480
own layer controls and for
their own searches and

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.680
branding and so forth.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.280
JOSH LIVNI: So if you didn't
want it to match

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.310
ours exactly, that's--

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.684
I mean, it's a little
bit of a hack.

00:05:13.684 --> 00:05:16.700
But you might want to look at
that example of the API

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.320
utility library, and then you
could have that control do

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.200
whatever it is that you
want it to have it do.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.470
MALE SPEAKER: I like that.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.860
I would never have thought of
inserting into that array,

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.520
sort of having the box of little
bits of layer control.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.170
JOSH LIVNI: On the proximity of
your control to the layer.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.220
MALE SPEAKER:Right.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.390
That actually helps a lot.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.805
I'll have to play with that.

00:05:39.805 --> 00:05:40.090
Thank you.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.360
JOSH LIVNI: One for one.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.010
I like that.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.660
Excellent.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.920
Yes, thank you.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.910
I struggled with the same
question myself when I was

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.950
building that library.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.180
MALE SPEAKER: Oh,
you created it.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.490
That's you.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.780
You're the author of that.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.650
JOSH LIVNI: I am the
author of that one.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.390
And I had a similar question
which is I had access to all

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.821
of the CSS and so forth,
but it didn't

00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:00.290
seem appropriate to--

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.560
even if we did publish the CSS,
because we're going to

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.485
change that in future versions,
and then it would be

00:06:07.485 --> 00:06:09.315
outdated and so forth.

00:06:09.315 --> 00:06:11.270
MALE SPEAKER: So what does
it look like for you?

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.150
I mean, I can't--

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.110
it's even in line.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.350
So I'm imagining that
you're not--

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.490
those things aren't inline
styles when you are on sort of

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.490
the Google side of the world.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.010
Do you all use something--

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.640
JOSH LIVNI: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
library, and pretty much all

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.320
the tools that our team of maps
and developer relaions

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.690
put out, use the public APIs,
the exact same endpoint APIs

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.700
that you have.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.174
All I meant is that I do happen
to have also access to

00:06:34.174 --> 00:06:37.020
the code, that if I also felt
so inclined, I could have

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.855
filed a similar feature request.
And this is actually

00:06:39.855 --> 00:06:45.005
a great way that we are able
to make things as developer

00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:47.360
friendly as we can is, as we
build these tools we struggle

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.430
with the same things you guys
have struggled with.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.025
And then when we chat to you
in Hangouts, we hear the

00:06:52.025 --> 00:06:54.120
feedback you have, and then we
can go to our engineers and

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.130
say, hey, this is a problem that
we should try to solve.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.310
And so, if it turned out in
this case that using that

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.470
layer control really was not
appropriate for you, that

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:05.870
would be great feedback.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.380
And we could go task the Maps
team and say, hey, maybe

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.290
there's a way we could have some
generic control that you

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.650
could move around that had
similar styling, or something.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.290
But as it turned out, it worked
well for that library,

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.130
and it sounds like it
might work for you.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.530
MALE SPEAKER: It will.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.580
It's not layer, technically,
but a full speed control is

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.900
sort of, kind of
in that world.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.670
And isn't far from
map satellite

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:30.990
and a screen control.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.850
I could sort of see those
being related

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.990
without being too crazy.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.460
JOSH LIVNI: As long as it's
intuitive to the end user, and

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.380
that seems appropriate to me.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:45.440
All right.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.160
So I assume you had no trouble
joining this Hangout.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.420
MALE SPEAKER: No.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.250
I did last week's with Mano.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.190
JOSH LIVNI: So you
were prepared.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.020
MALE SPEAKER: So it took me a
while to get on, because he

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.020
had to see the comment and then
add me to the circle, and

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.190
then let me join.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.620
So it was a little
bit challenging.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.490
I'd done other ones.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.930
I've done other--

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.120
I guess it was not Maps
API Office Hours.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.366
It was a Google Map Office
Hour, previously--

00:08:13.366 --> 00:08:14.180
JOSH LIVNI: [MULTIPLE SPEAKERS]

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.330
so that we have the ability to
live stream them on YouTube,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.480
so anyone could watch, but not
necessarily participate in the

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.155
Hangout itself.

00:08:21.155 --> 00:08:22.960
MALE SPEAKER:Which
is a great thing.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.400
JOSH LIVNI: [MULTIPLE SPEAKERS]

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.910
so we have to grant explicit
permissions.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:30.910
And so that's why we have
this new extra step.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.986
Any other questions
while you have us?

00:08:36.986 --> 00:08:39.500
MALE SPEAKER: Well, let's see.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.360
Party--

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.804
office hours, indeed.

00:08:42.804 --> 00:08:48.640
I guess, to go back to that, I
was going to ask if there was

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:54.750
a style guide, in general,
for controls and things.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.790
Obviously, I can see what
is part of the API.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:01.180
But I was wondering if there
were guidelines for what is

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.490
recommended for custom
controls.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:03.940
JOSH LIVNI:No.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.410
We really leave it up to you,
because we like to see

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.280
developers come up with some
creative ways of-- when people

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.770
are able to make whatever they
want, then maybe they'll think

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.750
of something we never did.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.720
We don't want to say, here's
the way to make controls.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.070
But we do put out examples.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.970
And so there's the Maps v3
examples page you mentioned.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.780
There's also--

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.775
I think there's a controls page
in the documentation,

00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:30.160
which gives some additional
examples.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.510
And the style of those examples
is just what we

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:36.500
consider a reasonable way to
program against the API.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.630
But certainly, if you want to
build something that looks

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:42.260
outlandish or does something
really strange with different

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.250
JavaScript libraries, then you
should take full advantage of

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.495
the API to do that.

00:09:46.495 --> 00:09:47.030
MALE SPEAKER:Yeah.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.590
I noticed that the examples to
make it easier, and obviously

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.630
really portable, it uses
JavaScript to construct the

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.730
[? dittos ?] and the other
elements and the styles, and

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:58.060
it assigns those using
JavaScript inline.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.060
And I actually found a
technique-- since my Maps page

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.520
is already using jQuery, you can
just do dollar jQuery and

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.020
put HTML in there and it
automatically creates that.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.810
And then do a get zero and you
don't have to worry about it.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:14.470
And also, it wasn't clear
that you could do CSS.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.480
It was my own mental failing
of not realizing that

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.950
ultimately this is
part of the dom.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.090
And standard CSS, if
you have IDs or

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:22.970
classes, will be applied.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.340
You don't have to specify
everything in the JavaScript

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.790
like you do in your examples.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.550
Which, I understand why you do
in the examples, but I sort of

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.635
thought it was you could
only do it that way.

00:10:31.635 --> 00:10:32.200
JOSH LIVNI: I see your point.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.700
And we could probably add
a comment in some of our

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.445
examples that makes it clear the
reason that we're inlining

00:10:37.445 --> 00:10:42.450
the HTML and CSS is because we
want a single example there,

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.730
and not because that's
necessarily the recommended

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.610
approach for JavaScript
developers to

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.600
create new dom elements.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.840
There's always good running
debate on that, you can find

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.970
anywhere, as to where the cutoff
is between too much

00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:00.586
HTML and CSS, and just a tiny
little jQuery dib that you

00:11:00.586 --> 00:11:01.950
want to insert in something.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.460
So I think that's really up to
each developer, and a little

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.460
bit separate from our API.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.265
But yes, we could make comments
in there that make it

00:11:10.265 --> 00:11:11.880
clear why we're doing
it that way.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.510
So I think, even though we're
not sure how many people are

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:22.520
potentially watching on YouTube,
we switch over to

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.210
introducing the Style
Maps stuff.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.410
And that's what we'll do now.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.410
So I think you can see a
shared screen up there.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.755
Can you tell me if you see a
shared screen on our showcase?

00:11:30.755 --> 00:11:31.560
MALE SPEAKER: I do.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.530
I'm using a MacBook Air, and I
see the large window is you.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.770
And I see my head, and then
I see the screen.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.906
And if I click that, it's
just the screen.

00:11:39.906 --> 00:11:41.700
JOSH LIVNI: I got the
same thing, so I

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.215
think we're all set.

00:11:42.215 --> 00:11:45.970
So I'm going to go ahead and
start talking about this

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.300
developer showcase here,
which is fairly new.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.870
I'm not sure if any of you guys
have noticed that we put

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.140
up new layout in our
developers.google.com for a

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.317
showcase for Maps, and of all of
our Maps documentation and

00:11:58.317 --> 00:12:01.710
some other documentation is
also out there at the

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.200
developer site, Google.com.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.100
So, pretty nice resource.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.120
And notice that the URL here is
developers.google.com/maps.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.060
And one of the most obvious
things you can do here is hit

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.810
the big, red view
showcase button.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.380
And there's lots of great
examples in here to kind of

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.310
pull ideas from.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.480
Some of the different creative
ways people are using Maps.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.160
And you can take a look,
obviously open up the

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.910
JavaScript behind these pages,
get an idea of what people are

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.240
doing in this space.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.750
And today I wanted to talk about
Styled Maps, because

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.600
it's one of my favorite
features.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.800
And so what I'm going to do is
bring open this filter here.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.540
I can choose to look at only
a subset of these maps.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.003
And I'm going to choose the ones
that take advantage of

00:12:44.003 --> 00:12:45.030
our Style Maps.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.660
There's quite a few.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.280
I'll just bring up a couple
to prove the point of

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.230
what Styled Map is.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:55.650
Basically what it is, is this
idea that you can customize

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.870
the look and feel
of the base map.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.706
When you go to maps like
google.com, we have a whole

00:13:00.706 --> 00:13:04.140
bunch of stuff on the base map
that's really designed for

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.500
visitors of maps.google.com.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.290
A whole lot of people looking
for driving directions,

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.830
looking for places.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.090
That might not be the same story
that you're trying to

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:13.710
tell with your map.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.780
And so, what we have here is
a bunch of different people

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.430
using Styled Maps to
tell their story

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:19.350
a little bit better.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.675
I like this one, maps
without maps.

00:13:21.675 --> 00:13:23.130
I'll bring that up.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.020
So this one, it's kind
of hard to see what

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:35.900
you're looking at here.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:36.991
But what they've done is remove
all the features except

00:13:36.991 --> 00:13:38.110
for the labels.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:41.880
I think it's kind of silly, but
it's a little bit clever.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.180
And then--

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.102
KATHRYN HURLEY: No, I didn't do
it, but it's really cool.

00:13:46.102 --> 00:13:46.900
JOSH LIVNI: I like the idea.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.470
I probably wouldn't have
thought of this myself.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.820
And then as we zoom in, we can
start seeing all of the

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.510
populated places and the
relative sparseness in some

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:56.870
areas of the country.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.980
And anyway, the point here being
is we can remove a lot

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.460
of features and show just some
features to tell a really

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.590
different story than you
usually see with maps.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.460
So maybe there's not a lot that
you could do with that

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.060
map, except prove the point of
how you can do really cool

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.205
styling and see the world
in a different way.

00:14:13.205 --> 00:14:18.063
Let's take a look at another
great example,

00:14:18.063 --> 00:14:19.313
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.330
This is a really simple map, but
what I like about it is it

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.600
proves the point that if you
really want to tell a story

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.340
that has your data on top,
you're probably best off

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.290
getting rid of all of the
distracting elements that

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.560
might otherwise be on the map.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.920
Again, with Giggle based map, we
want to show you where the

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:44.680
freeways are, where the local
transit stations are, and all

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.460
of these different things
probably not

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.290
relevant to this use case.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:48.530
So I'll go down here.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.280
There's tons of saturation
way down.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.710
You get a nice gray scale map.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.250
And now their markers
really pop.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.700
They can style it, and it kind
of looks like our colors

00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:01.120
aren't competing against their
grand colors in their website.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.620
So just the simple idea of
toning down the saturation is

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.820
a great way of seeing how Styled
Maps can make it a

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:13.080
little bit less distracting to
overlay your data on top.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.330
And we'll look at some
more examples later.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.860
I see a couple more
people joined us.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.080
So before I go into a couple
more examples, and then how

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.420
you might create your
own Styled Map--

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.000
I've got Davey here.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.970
OK, great.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.570
And yeah, if you have any
questions, Davey, you're

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:28.845
welcome to ask.

00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:31.200
KATHRYN HURLEY:Just raise your
hand if you have a question.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.310
JOSH LIVNI: --if you
have a question.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:33.350
He's got a question.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.560
He's always got good
questions.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.810
How are you doing today?

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.000
I think you were muted there.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.010
Are you still possibly muted
on your end, Davey?

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:48.520
DAVEY:I was still muted, yes.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.020
JOSH LIVNI: Ok.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.890
We're all set.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:51.610
DAVEY: Doing great.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.520
Just booked my flight and hotel
for Google IO, so--

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.150
JOSH LIVNI:Oh, you
got your tickets.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.550
Congratulations.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.410
It'll be great to
see you there.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.420
Excellent.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.960
DAVEY: I actually had
a question on

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.154
the street view API.

00:16:04.154 --> 00:16:07.310
I don't know if that covers
the Google Maps family.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.040
JOSH LIVNI: We'll try our
best to answer it.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.960
You're welcome to
ask anything.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.765
We'll just say we don't know,
if we don't know.

00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:19.630
DAVEY:It's from an Android
perspective, basically.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.190
Would it be possible to load up
a KML file or something, or

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:27.560
a collection of geo points and
stream it into kind of a

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.464
street view animation?

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:40.150
JOSH LIVNI: So there's
a few different

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.860
things going on there.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.480
I'm not sure I fully understand
the question.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.220
But I think what you're asking
is if you have a bunch of

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.755
locations in KML, perhaps a
line, perhaps a bunch of place

00:16:49.755 --> 00:16:54.060
marked points, and you want to
be able to just display a

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.610
slide show kind of effect
with Street View.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:58.610
Sure, you could do that.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.980
So ignoring the Android part
of things, which I'm less

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.400
familiar with, as you probably
know from previous

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.460
conversations.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.482
Certainly, the Maps API, you can
grab the location data out

00:17:11.482 --> 00:17:15.359
of the KML, and then make a
separate call to the Street

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:20.099
View, using static image API or
the full-fledged API, and

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:23.990
have it move at whatever timing
it is that you see

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.349
appropriate.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.640
There's no [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
read this KML that would

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.056
display it in Street View.

00:17:28.056 --> 00:17:31.170
You'd have to parse It yourself
and do that, the

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:32.010
separate calls.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.530
Does that answer
your question?

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.840
DAVEY: Yes.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.290
I think I can pretty much figure
it out, how to do it

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.690
like web-based.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:42.090
But I was wondering as there
is this native Street View

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.480
Android application, is it
possible to leverage the

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.390
capabilities of that native
Android app and--

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.330
JOSH LIVNI:That's a really
good question.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:53.450
I think that the answer is no,
but I'm not 100% sure of that.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:58.240
Not that you can't use that
Street View idea, but rather I

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.810
don't think there's a really a
direct tie to read it to KML

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.950
and then say, follow it
along kind of a thing.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.420
So I'll have to ask
the Android team.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.150
Or if you want, you can join
one of the Android Office

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:10.900
Hours and ask them.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.050
But I'd be happy to pass on the
question to them, as well.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.680
I don't know that offhand.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.542
Sorry.

00:18:17.542 --> 00:18:20.160
He looks like he's got another
question there.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.000
I'm not sure if we muted him.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.300
I can't hear him.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.080
I think you're potentially
muted still.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.626
MALE SPEAKER: He's got
another question.

00:18:30.626 --> 00:18:34.360
DAVEY:I saw the demo that you
guys did in Austin with the

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.760
cap thing, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
demo.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.570
Is there like any example
source code

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.746
available for that?

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:45.610
JOSH LIVNI:There is not
currently a great example.

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:48.330
But we're going to go
into a lot of detail

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.790
about how we did that.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.810
Some cool things with web view
on Maps at the Aware

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:55.920
conference, which is
I think next week.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.920
I should probably start
prepping for that.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.600
And we're going to probably
have some things there and

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.660
afterwards that will
be pretty exciting.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.700
DAVEY: That was a cool
demo, by the way.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.590
JOSH LIVNI: There's a lof of
really amazing potential, I

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.690
think, with using the web dl.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:16.240
So that's some pretty
exciting stuff.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.070
So I'm not sure if they're
live streaming all of the

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.240
workshops at Aware.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.900
I know they're doing
the talks, but

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.880
perhaps not the workshops.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.930
So we'll definitely be
publishing some stuff online

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.346
in the days and weeks following
the conference.

00:19:30.346 --> 00:19:31.405
DAVEY:Ok.

00:19:31.405 --> 00:19:32.890
Cool.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.150
Out of questions.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.350
JOSH LIVNI: Out of questions.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.180
All right.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:44.257
Did you want to talk about
Styled Maps now, show any

00:19:44.257 --> 00:19:46.674
example or demo's or
shall I hop to it?

00:19:46.674 --> 00:19:48.642
KATHRYN HURLEY: Go ahead.

00:19:48.642 --> 00:19:49.140
JOSH LIVNI: Me?

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.740
All right.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.390
Freedom of the press?

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.100
That does look nice.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.990
Have you heard of this one?

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:57.170
KATHRYN HURLEY: I might
have heard of it.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:58.810
JOSH LIVNI: Why don't you
describe a little bit about

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:00.802
what we're looking at
here, this freedom

00:20:00.802 --> 00:20:02.810
of the press website?

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.492
What do we have here, Kathryn?

00:20:07.492 --> 00:20:10.015
KATHRYN HURLEY: Actually, I'm
not too sure of the details of

00:20:10.015 --> 00:20:13.310
what this map is showing and
it being interrelated to

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.690
freedom of the press, somehow.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.920
JOSH LIVNI: Oh, I thought
you knew all about it.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.500
OK.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.454
Well, let's take a look.

00:20:19.454 --> 00:20:20.670
It is [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.720
So what they've done
here is just

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.830
overlay the country polygons.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.030
And one of the things you
often see when you have

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:33.090
semi-opaque polygons here is
that, again, an unstyled map

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.300
can detract from this overlay
story, because we're going to

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.770
have all of these different
colors and so forth pop out.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.150
And so again, they've just
done-- oh, go ahead.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.018
KATHRYN HURLEY: I think I know
one thing about these

00:20:43.018 --> 00:20:43.485
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:20:43.485 --> 00:20:44.419
JOSH LIVNI: Oh yeah,
let's hear it.

00:20:44.419 --> 00:20:48.200
KATHRYN HURLEY: I believe it
uses [UNINTELLIGIBLE] tools to

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:48.800
draw the polygons.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.370
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, and that's a
whole another usually tricky,

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.400
problem to solve aside from
styling the map is how to get

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.570
nice big data overlays
like this.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.460
So that is a really
good point.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.190
So if you have lots of
your own custom data,

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.700
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] is a great
thing to look at.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:08.170
Let me take a quick
look and see--

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.728
is this the same as the
newspaper map, where they have

00:21:10.728 --> 00:21:12.720
that kind of overlays?

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.970
KATHRYN HURLEY: It had a
lot of markers on it.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:15.260
JOSH LIVNI:Had a
lot of markers.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.070
So same thing.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:17.980
And I think this is
also a Styled Map.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.770
And again, going back to that
same general idea of Styled

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.890
Maps is, if you have a story to
tell, you're probably doing

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:28.670
well by really making sure that
only things that help

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.700
your story, in this case, labels
and where the countries

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.530
are-- get rid of the things that
detract from your story,

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.768
maybe lots of colors or other
things that would potentially

00:21:35.768 --> 00:21:37.770
conflict with your overlays.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:39.685
KATHRYN HURLEY: Especially
like this slide where the

00:21:39.685 --> 00:21:40.250
markers really pop on it.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:40.690
JOSH LIVNI: Exactly.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.820
And if you do an overlay on
top of an unstyled map, it

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.440
would be a lot more difficult
to see the pattern and

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.110
different markers if you're
distracted by the background.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:54.900
So let's go ahead and say if
we wanted to create our own

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.670
Styled Map.

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:57.470
I'm just going to give a really
brief introduction, in

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.320
my opinion, the easiest
way to do that.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.110
The easiest way is
to do a search.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:06.787
Your favorite way to search,
which for me is just typing up

00:22:06.787 --> 00:22:10.780
top for Google Maps style
wizard, or something along

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:16.606
those lines and hitting an early
link which takes you to

00:22:16.606 --> 00:22:19.900
the Styled Maps wizard.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.975
KATHRYN HURLEY: And isn't there
a YouTube video as well?

00:22:22.975 --> 00:22:23.470
JOSH LIVNI: Oh, yes.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:29.060
We have a great screen cast
that also goes over that.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.480
I'll see if we can get a link
up here, or tell you how to

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.640
find our screen casts.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.440
But meanwhile, let's take a
look at the Styled Maps

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.512
wizard, which basically
starts you out with

00:22:37.512 --> 00:22:38.610
our default map here.

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:42.430
Let's pick a location, say
Seattle, where I used to live.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.650
Also known as the places API.

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.480
Although complete, we aren't
using Maps, and you're asking

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.640
people to type in locations
and think about taking

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.890
advantage of places they've
got on API auto complete.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:53.980
And here we are, a basic map.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.450
This is what our default map
looks like, and what the

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.060
majority of maps out
there look like.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.490
But no need for your map
to look like this.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.605
And so this is just a
kind of a wizard.

00:23:03.605 --> 00:23:06.350
It let's you change, for
example, I mentioned earlier,

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:08.000
go to a gray scale view.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.860
And already there's a lot less
distractions on the map.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.240
Or you could turn
it up a notch.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.142
And also go feature
by feature.

00:23:15.142 --> 00:23:19.180
So if I just want the water,
for example, to have a

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:24.630
different hue over here and
maybe be a little bit darker,

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.090
then I can do that.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:30.570
And then I can go ahead and
add this style right here.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.440
So I can just add that
to my set of styles.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.690
And then I could take
something else,

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:39.480
like say the roads.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.210
And let's just simplify those,
make them a little cleaner.

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.900
So now we have a
much cleaner--

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:49.810
less labels and so forth,
thinner lines, if you have

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:51.310
that style.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:52.870
And then some other things
that we could do.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:56.490
We could take just the geometry
of our administrative

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:02.240
areas and turn all of those up,
and various other things

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:08.590
like that, or what have you.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:09.466
There's a lot of great
examples of

00:24:09.466 --> 00:24:10.370
Styled Maps out there.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:11.040
But use this wizard.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.190
And then when you're done with
the wizard, go ahead and hit

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:15.990
the [UNINTELLIGIBLE] button down
at the bottom of your set

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.300
of map styles.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.910
Here's the syntax we use
to style the maps.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:23.815
And you can basically cut and
paste this into your maps API

00:24:23.815 --> 00:24:27.850
location, along with just one
or two lines where you can

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:31.960
pass into your map object an
extra parameter of styles.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.550
And you can just feed it this.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:38.000
And it'll take over your base
map style with whatever you've

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:38.800
customized here.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.420
So it's really easy to add
styles to your map.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.550
And this also applies to
terrain, and you can also

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:49.120
create a separate map layer
where someone clicks a button

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.080
and it takes them to your styled
map, and so forth.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.840
And there are examples of all of
that on our examples pages.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.580
So anyway, I would recommend
checking out this wizard if

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.140
you just want to start playing
with how different styles

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.980
could look and going down the
granularity of features that

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:02.890
you can turn off.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:04.806
Turn your parks a little
bit more green, and

00:25:04.806 --> 00:25:05.950
so on and so forth.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:09.400
So that's an overview
of the Styled Maps.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.300
Do you have anything to add?

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:11.780
KATHRYN HURLEY: No.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:12.155
They're very nice maps.

00:25:12.155 --> 00:25:13.270
JOSH LIVNI: They're
beautiful, yes.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.042
I'm not a cartographer
by trade.

00:25:15.042 --> 00:25:16.338
Obviously.

00:25:16.338 --> 00:25:21.120
Yes, it does make it easy
for you to play with.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:25.125
Do we have anyone else on
here with questions?

00:25:25.125 --> 00:25:27.840
KATHRYN HURLEY: Can you
replicate how they created

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.190
that one map without anything
except for the labels?

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.920
JOSH LIVNI:Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.280
Let's try that.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.460
That's a good idea.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.260
So I'm going to go ahead
and reset this.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.875
And remove these guys.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:41.730
Good-bye.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:43.480
So here's our basic map again.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.430
Let's see if I can
figure it out.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:45.435
The first thing I'm
going to do--

00:25:45.435 --> 00:25:46.810
I've never tried this--

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.310
is turn everything off.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.760
Boring map, let's
add that style.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.270
And then I'm going to
go to our labels and

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.930
turn everything on.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:58.240
And we're done!

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.586
That was easy.

00:26:00.586 --> 00:26:03.110
Now I might want to say, this
is pretty cool, but the

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.650
freeway labels I don't love as
much as the rest. And so I can

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:07.990
add this style that
we have here.

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:14.030
And then say, just for the
roads, let's go ahead and turn

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:15.595
those guys off.

00:26:15.595 --> 00:26:19.340
And now we just have the
other labels on for the

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.280
administrative areas.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.880
So you can take advantage of
making sure that you're

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.410
applying your labels in order,
and you can see the effect

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:30.580
that we have here.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.175
If you change the order,
you're going to have a

00:26:32.175 --> 00:26:33.425
different effect.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:38.190
OK.

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:39.640
I think that's it.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.780
So, let's see here.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.500
I'm getting some notes.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.910
Oh, let's go to our moderator
questions.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:45.830
Good idea.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:46.543
Excellent idea.

00:26:46.543 --> 00:26:48.500
We have some questions.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.350
I think that this
first question--

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:51.910
I'll give it a big check
mark, excellent

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.160
question, we answered.

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:59.280
Are you using Street View images
to find and interpret

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.755
business signs and places
to Google Maps halfway?

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:08.450
The answer here is we do look
at a lot of the data that

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:11.390
comes back from the Street
View cars, and we run all

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.800
kinds of analysis on that data,
ranging from where the

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.200
cars are and taking into account
all kinds of things

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.200
that they interact with
along the way.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:24.910
I don't know for sure we're
using OCR recognition on

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:25.580
business signs.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.215
It's kind of a trick problem.

00:27:27.215 --> 00:27:29.515
You've got all these little
A-frames out on the sidewalk

00:27:29.515 --> 00:27:32.240
and different labels that might
or might not apply to

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.160
the business itself that
might be in the window.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.480
I'd have to ask the team.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.110
My guess would be that
they thought of that.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.920
But certainly, the best way
to think about adding your

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.330
business would be to add it in
Map Maker, not put a big sign

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:46.130
in your window and wait
for the cars to go by.

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:47.245
But good question.

00:27:47.245 --> 00:27:48.170
I'm not [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:52.280
And my guess would be that's
a tricky issue that would

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.960
probably only, in the best
case scenario, apply to a

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.210
small amount of businesses.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.140
OK.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.390
Next question.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.770
Why does it take as much
time to update

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.020
the Street View images?

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.060
Shall I answer that question?

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.730
Why does it take
a lot of time?

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:19.650
There are a lot of things
that have to occur.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:23.805
First of all, we have to have
someone taking the images.

00:28:23.805 --> 00:28:25.425
So you have to drive
a car around,

00:28:25.425 --> 00:28:26.720
which is time consuming.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.490
And so you can imagine, as soon
as we're done in one area

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:32.758
of the country, we don't just
immediately re-do that city.

00:28:32.758 --> 00:28:36.260
There's other interesting areas
maybe we've updated.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.595
It's kind of a similar question,
of why don't you

00:28:38.595 --> 00:28:41.400
update your satellite imagery
and Google Earth everywhere,

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.970
over the whole world
every day?

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:46.600
And the answer is, we always
have to decide for the cost

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.100
that it takes to acquire the
imagery and process it, what's

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.070
the most positive affect
it can have on all

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.950
of our users worldwide.

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:57.090
And so with Street View,
it turns out there's

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:58.260
just a lot of roads.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.510
And so the biggest slowdown is
obviously driving the cars and

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.480
getting back the imagery or
perhaps taking the boats down

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.250
the Amazon and getting
the imagery.

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.600
There's just tons of new areas
to got out, and it's

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.960
time-consuming to do that.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.930
But then after we drive through
a place, obviously we

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:15.430
have to post-process all of that
data and make sure that

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:20.150
the quality is appropriate and
make sure that it's sort of

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.570
better imagery than we had
before, and then get it into

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:24.140
our systems and put it out.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.050
But all of that time
in processing is

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:29.200
obviously less than--

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.630
you're going to see us back in
the same area probably because

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.088
we just have so much more
new area to cover.

00:29:35.088 --> 00:29:36.840
Hopefully that answered
that question.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.175
I don't think that
person's here.

00:29:40.175 --> 00:29:41.940
KATHRYN HURLEY: I always
wondered that

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:42.660
same thing, too, actually.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.700
JOSH LIVNI: Why don't
we just have cars

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.120
everywhere all the time?

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.082
KATHRYN HURLEY:Sometimes you'll
see a car driving

00:29:49.082 --> 00:29:51.584
around, and you're like, oh,
someday maybe I'll be on

00:29:51.584 --> 00:29:51.900
Google Maps.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.460
I keep checking that one spot
to see myself there.

00:30:01.245 --> 00:30:02.610
JOSH LIVNI:Moving on.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:06.900
We've answered that NVC control
question previously.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.850
And then, are you-- we
answered that one.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:10.510
I think we are done.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.625
I think we answered
all the questions.

00:30:11.625 --> 00:30:14.830
There's no more questions.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:15.550
One more question.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.700
Did someone just
add a question?

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.580
Oh, here's a question.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.080
I have made a wrapper to make it
simpler for people to pick

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.760
up and use the API.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.230
Now I'm having trouble with
geocoding API requests and

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:29.440
dealing with multiple
instances.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.680
Any tips or suggestions
are welcome.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.260
So first, just let me mention
the word wrapper.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.510
I'm not familiar with your
project offhand.

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:40.010
I'd point out that we do have
one clause in our terms of

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:44.290
service that relates to building
a wrapper library

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:46.830
around the Maps API itself.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.950
And I was just reading
the terms of service.

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:50.690
I searched for the word,
I think, wrapper.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:55.220
But read them through and make
sure that you're not

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.150
potentially violating any
of the terms in there.

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.280
And if you have a question, you
can toss us a note on the

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.400
forum for clarification
or otherwise ask here,

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.390
specifically if you have
a question about that.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.400
Second question is trouble
with geocoding requests.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.740
I'm not sure what trouble
is, exactly.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:14.690
But I'm guessing, based-- when
you said multiple instances,

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:19.400
that you're using server side
geocoding, and that as more

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.662
people are using your servers
to do geocoding, you're

00:31:21.662 --> 00:31:22.240
running out of quota.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.170
That's just a guess, with
no additional context.

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:28.220
And if that's true, I'd suggest
that you certainly use

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.430
client side geocoding.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:34.270
So each of the users that makes
geocoding requests, that

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:38.820
quote is being applied against
their IP and not against your

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.090
server instance.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:44.672
So we have a blog post written
by my colleague Mano about--

00:31:44.672 --> 00:31:47.710
or an article, rather, about
what the difference between

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:50.550
client side and server
side geocoding is.

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.430
So just do a search for that.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:57.020
And again, I'm not familiar with
your library, but chances

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.216
are you want to be using
client side geocoding.

00:31:59.216 --> 00:32:01.700
So I hope that answers
that question.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.520
And looks like Davey's
got his hands up.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.715
So more tricky questions.

00:32:05.715 --> 00:32:06.540
We're ready.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.630
DAVEY:Not tricky at
all, I think.

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:10.050
But the question anyhow.

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:11.700
I think it's for Kathryn,
this one.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.160
It's regarding fusion
tables and security.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.530
In my application recently I've
been starting to use the

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:23.490
document list API to access
the fusion tables and to

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:26.990
enable sharing of fusion
tables in my Android

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:31.440
application, using the document
list API, which is I

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.240
think the appropriate way to
share fusion tables from a

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.792
Java application.

00:32:36.792 --> 00:32:40.521
KATHRYN HURLEY: Yes,
that's correct.

00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:42.460
DAVEY:I'm using [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.100
for that, for security.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.990
But the thing is that I need
to provide the Google

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:49.200
documents scope there.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.726
So although I'm only interested
in fusion tables,

00:32:53.726 --> 00:32:57.610
the user basically gets to see
that my application wants to

00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:59.730
access all his documents.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:04.090
Is it possible to define a more
narrow scope through the

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:07.595
document list API so that we
only target fusion tables and

00:33:07.595 --> 00:33:10.016
a user is made aware of that?

00:33:10.016 --> 00:33:11.450
KATHRYN HURLEY: That's
a good question.

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:13.340
Not that I know of.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.348
I think you just have to
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] go back they

00:33:16.348 --> 00:33:20.252
have listed in the Google
Document API, part of the

00:33:20.252 --> 00:33:23.750
Google Documents list, that's
why it's using that scope.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:27.490
It's something I can look
into and find out more

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:28.740
information for you.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:35.320
DAVEY:Would it be possible to
log a feature request or

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.760
something like that, for that?

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:41.150
Because I think within the OR
framework there is like a

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.190
mechanism to define more
narrow scopes.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:46.420
I think the Google Latitude API,
for example, allows you

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:49.970
to define various levels of
scopes and turn on what you

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:51.095
want to see.

00:33:51.095 --> 00:33:53.460
So I think Interior should
also be possible with the

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.986
document list API.

00:33:54.986 --> 00:33:55.474
KATHRYN HURLEY:Yes.

00:33:55.474 --> 00:33:58.490
And please do open up a feature
request. That's a

00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:59.410
great idea.

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:00.330
DAVEY:OK.

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:04.770
Then I had another question,
that's more of a Google

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.610
Latitude question.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:11.050
I seem to recall, but I'm not
100% sure, that a couple of

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:16.480
months ago Google Latitude
worked for Google app domains,

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.659
non-Gmail domains.

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:22.424
And recently, I discovered that
it doesn't work anymore.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:28.300
JOSH LIVNI: That's a
don't know offhand.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.710
I'm not aware of any changes
that would have suddenly made

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.610
it not work on apps domains.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:41.699
I actually have not tried it
myself on an apps domain.

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:43.800
And I don't know the answer
to that, either, offhand.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:48.380
But if you want to toss a note
on G-plus to me asking that

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.812
question, I can find
out really quickly

00:34:49.812 --> 00:34:51.440
and get back to you.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.480
DAVEY: I have an issue in the
Latitude issue tracker.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:59.080
On the Latitude website
it gives you--

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:03.140
it allows you to activate
latitudes from a Google Apps

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.450
domain, but it doesn't
really activate it.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:08.027
It's kind of a bug in the
website, I think.

00:35:08.027 --> 00:35:09.250
JOSH LIVNI: That sounds
very much like a bug.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:11.120
Yeah let me look into that.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.913
I'll take a look at--

00:35:14.913 --> 00:35:16.520
We'll see what's going on.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.930
DAVEY: And then, a final
question, regarding reverse

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:23.000
geocoding, which we talked about
a couple of minutes ago.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.020
I'm also doing reverse geocoding
in my application,

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:29.560
Find Site, using
the standards--

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.540
I think it's the
Android reverse

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.290
geocoder that I'm using.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:36.380
And very often I'm getting
no response at all.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:39.420
I'm getting like this internal
error or something.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:43.590
I don't think that it's quota
related, because sometimes,

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.240
for example, for the first time
today when I'm starting

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.980
the app, it immediately
gives me an error.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.745
And like two minutes later, it's
able to reverse geocode

00:35:52.745 --> 00:35:53.650
the address.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:58.020
So it's very randomly that
it returns an error.

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:02.480
JOSH LIVNI: Do you know what
the error is, offhand?

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.620
DAVEY:I could look it up.

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.260
It's some kind of internal--

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.390
JOSH LIVNI: That also
definitely--

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:08.890
I mean, I can't say for sure
that it's possible that it's

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:10.610
quota related or something.

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:14.700
But it sounds like you should
file an issue there as well.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.298
And if you can just supply the
exact error that it is, and

00:36:17.298 --> 00:36:21.410
the call that you're making,
so you can nail down

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:22.150
what's going on.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:23.810
DAVEY: I don't think it's
related to the actual

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:28.060
location, because sometimes
when I'm at a fixed point

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.170
where I know it is able to
reverse geocode that

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.210
latitude/longitude, sometimes
it works and

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:33.975
sometimes it doesn't.

00:36:33.975 --> 00:36:36.810
JOSH LIVNI:And again,
I would suggest--

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.080
I know the Android guys are
having their regularly

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.530
scheduled Office Hours.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.590
Ask them that same thing.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:43.970
[MULTIPLE SPEAKERS]

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:45.753
their message as well.

00:36:45.753 --> 00:36:48.850
And I think they have Office
Hours every day.

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:51.530
So perhaps even in an hour
or two from now.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:52.983
I'm not sure what time it is.

00:36:52.983 --> 00:36:54.200
You're in the Netherlands
I think--

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.450
DAVEY: Belgium.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:08.900
JOSH LIVNI: --vaguely similar
area of time zones So I think

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.830
they're still having them later
on today, our time.

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:14.060
But otherwise, they have a list
of scheduled hours for

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:18.200
all of their Office Hours, and
you can ask them that.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.110
KATHRYN HURLEY: Can I just
ask one question?

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.866
It might be a silly question,
but the phone is connected to

00:37:22.866 --> 00:37:24.160
the internet when you're
making your requests?

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.880
DAVEY:Yeah, definitely.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.360
Using wi-fi 3G.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.600
I don't know.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.980
It's a very random thing.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.630
It's a very simple
API call to make.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:41.290
You can't do any by client
sites errors with that.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:44.590
It's just a simple call, reverse
geocode a certain

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:45.370
location point.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:48.210
And like I said, sometimes
it works.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:48.960
JOSH LIVNI:Interesting.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.040
If it's only occasionally
failing, but usually working

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.530
well-- first of all, definitely
let us try to

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.180
figure out what's going
wrong here.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.760
And as a work around, you could
potentially fall back to

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.760
using a web service on fail.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:09.760
So have the service side call
in case of failing.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.080
But yeah, it sounds like if
you're making a reverse

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.320
geocode to the exact same place
and it doesn't work, it

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.440
doesn't work, and then it works,
something's amiss.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.835
It could be--

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:27.324
it's not just a daily quota,
it's also a quota of if you

00:38:27.324 --> 00:38:33.155
ask bunch of times in a burst,
that will also get you a

00:38:33.155 --> 00:38:33.940
denied message.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:37.150
So it's hard to say without
seeing what call you're making

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:39.030
and what the error is.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:40.278
DAVEY: I have an issue for it.

00:38:40.278 --> 00:38:43.040
I'll make sure I have the
exact error message.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.420
JOSH LIVNI:OK.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:50.010
You're always finding out
good edge cases for us.

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:54.436
DAVEY: I would make a great
tester probably.

00:38:54.436 --> 00:38:55.686
JOSH LIVNI:OK.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.450
Any other questions?

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.860
OK.

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.490
KATHRYN HURLEY: If anybody's
on YouTube, a

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:06.710
reminder on how to join.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:07.170
JOSH LIVNI:Yes.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:10.330
If you're on YouTube, you
should-- your time is running

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:14.550
low here, but you can try to
make a run for the G-plus

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:16.480
stream of Mano Marks
or myself.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.070
And wherever you saw this post.
And you can ping Mano

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:23.020
and ask him to add you to a
circle, which will then allow

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:28.425
you to join the Hangout live
and ask questions.

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:34.230
OK.

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:35.970
Well I think we're going
to wrap it up.

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:38.720
Did you have anything else
you wanted to cover?

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.410
KATHRYN HURLEY:Nothing.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.060
JOSH LIVNI: The new Styled
Maps, please.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:44.400
That was the main takeaway I
wanted to give you guys.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:49.110
Oh, yes.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:50.820
One more question.

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:51.800
We're ready for it.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.570
Ask away.

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:54.440
Captive audience.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.180
MALE SPEAKER:OK.

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:56.520
So the last one.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.800
So I was trolling stack overflow
for Google Maps API

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.630
questions, trying to get some
that I could answer.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:05.590
And there's one which is a
reference to a tutorial done

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:09.830
by Google, where you use the
static map API to put a static

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:13.320
image in, and then when the map
fully loads, you switch

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.090
the static image with the live
content using the API.

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:19.510
But that particular
tutorial/example uses the

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:20.920
version 2 API.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:24.720
So the version 2 JavaScript Maps
API, not the version 2

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.570
static maps API.

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:28.970
And so the personal stack
overflow was asking

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:32.090
essentially Google, but I
think someone else may

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:35.480
volunteer, to update
the API part of the

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.155
tutorial for version 3.

00:40:38.155 --> 00:40:41.080
JOSH LIVNI:Yes.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.530
We should probably--

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:43.260
MALE SPEAKER:Fundamental
question,

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:44.810
is that a good practice?

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:46.280
JOSH LIVNI: It is
a good practice.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.980
In fact, the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.900
API automatically does this
under certain circumstances.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.764
For example, on a mobile
device or if there's a

00:40:55.764 --> 00:40:59.710
relatively low bandwith
connection, we will, by

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:05.430
default, load a static map and
then bring in the full

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.720
JavaScript API when it's
finished loading.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.960
So if you're looking on a mobile
phone, that's very

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.120
likely what's occurring anyway
by default in a webpage where

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.670
you're just loading
the Maps v3.

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:18.860
So you don't need to go to any
extra effort at all yourself.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:23.105
But on a desktop website,
we might not do that.

00:41:23.105 --> 00:41:25.235
And if for some reason you did
want to do it-- or another

00:41:25.235 --> 00:41:30.580
common use case is you just have
a bunch of pages on your

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:34.070
website and you think it's
unlikely someone might click

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.660
on the map for any
interactivity.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.380
You see the little
thumbnail there.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.530
There's no need for you to load
up the entire JavaScript

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.890
API each time.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:44.020
You could just load the static
map, and then when someone

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:46.950
clicks on it or something like
that, bring in the full

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:47.850
interactivity.

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:49.510
So there are going to be some
cases for doing that.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:55.590
And it's not a bad idea for us
to update the example to show

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:56.270
that feature.

00:41:56.270 --> 00:42:02.600
But if you're just concerned
about having a little speedier

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.180
instant access to someone
looking at a map on a mobile

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.760
device, and that's the reason
you're interested, note that

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:11.160
the v3 automatically
does that for you.

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.940
Also, if you are going to take
any of these approaches, pay

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:19.990
attention to the quota of maps
that you're using, static and

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:21.790
regular JavaScript
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.190
Did that answer your question?

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:31.100
MALE SPEAKER: That did, sorry.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:31.560
You muted--

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.230
But yes, that answered
the question.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:35.430
Thank you very much.

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:37.401
JOSH LIVNI:Davey had one
more question, I think.

00:42:37.401 --> 00:42:38.770
DAVEY:Sorry.

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:39.820
JOSH LIVNI: No, don't be.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:40.190
It's great.

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:42.966
We want to be here to
answer questions.

00:42:42.966 --> 00:42:46.690
DAVEY:What do you guys think of
the performance of Google

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:53.220
Maps when run through a web
view on a mobile device?

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:57.430
Because usually what you do is,
in like an Android or an

00:42:57.430 --> 00:43:00.370
IOS, you have like these
dedicated map components that

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:04.710
you can use, native components,
that are very

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:05.630
responsive.

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:09.250
They support pinch and
zoom very well,

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:11.770
all these fancy gestures.

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:13.700
JOSH LIVNI: Obviously, it's
going to be faster to run the

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:18.505
compiled code off the native
application than it is to load

00:43:18.505 --> 00:43:19.755
the web view.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:26.515
It's often just inherently
faster to do that than to have

00:43:26.515 --> 00:43:31.200
an embedded browser load up
the JavaScript and then

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.900
compile them from
that on the fly.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.890
That's always going
to be true.

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:38.630
That said, there are still a
bunch of additional features

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:44.472
that we have in the JavaScript
Maps API that aren't in the

00:43:44.472 --> 00:43:44.870
native one.

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:49.950
So it's just a choice to use as
developer, if that feature

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:55.860
meets your needs for whatever
hardware you're running on,

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.090
which one to use.

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:58.870
But I think it is
pretty speedy.

00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:59.930
It's a pretty speedy load.

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:02.570
Like we mentioned in the last
question, you get a map very,

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:03.820
very quickly.

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.870
Is it a few hundred milliseconds
here or there

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:12.400
potentially before everything
occurs?

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.705
I'm not sure exactly
what the tests are.

00:44:14.705 --> 00:44:17.550
It's always going to be a little
faster no matter what

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:18.620
to run things on the
native outlet.

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:21.500
DAVEY: Yes, especially when you
load up lots of markers on

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.670
the map and you try to navigate
through the map

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:27.500
really quickly.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.280
That's something that you can
do in a really fancy way on

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:33.500
the native component, like you
put a bunch of markers-- like

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.670
I had, in my application I put a
bunch of markers on the map.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:37.680
I have display button.

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.010
My replay, all of my locations
on the map component, which is

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:45.760
really fluid in the
native components.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.600
Whereas if I load it up on the
standard browser in a web

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.200
view, it's actually--

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.480
it's not a tad slower, but it's
a lot slower, if you know

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.772
what I mean.

00:44:58.772 --> 00:45:00.680
And I was wondering,
is there like--

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:04.670
do you guys see that
progressing, in the sense that

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:07.740
with Chrome coming to Android
might that give better

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:11.480
performance, or do you see stuff
like WebGL also coming

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.890
to mobile devices in
the near future?

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:17.900
JOSH LIVNI:Well, slowly WebGL
is being made available on

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.810
more and more phones.

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:21.950
And the hardware phones, of
course, is getting better.

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:26.150
And at the same time, we're
trying really hard to optimize

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:29.073
all the features on Maps v3 to
be as snappy as possible on

00:45:29.073 --> 00:45:31.070
the whole spectrum of
devices out there.

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:33.100
So if you're seeing a regression
in terms of

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.541
something that used to be
faster, let's say a hundred or

00:45:35.541 --> 00:45:39.320
a thousand markers, potentially
pushing the limits

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.760
of some phones, then
let us know.

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.400
Because it should certainly
not be getting slower, it

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.030
should be getting faster.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:50.140
And we are trying to take
advantage if the browser can

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:53.500
support something like Canvas
or different techniques that

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:57.230
we can use to make hte markers
snappy, then we'll use those

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.970
techniques.

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:00.600
So you should be able to get
increasingly more and

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.580
increasingly faster markers
over Web View.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:05.685
And if you're seeing the
opposite of that, definitely

00:46:05.685 --> 00:46:06.650
give us a heads up.

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:09.040
DAVEY:I'm not seeing the
opposite, it's just comparing

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:14.290
it with the native component,
like the speed gap is

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:16.510
substantial, I mean.

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:17.450
JOSH LIVNI:OK.

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:19.100
Well, that's good feedback.

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.090
I'm not going to chat
again with the team.

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:25.640
I know they're aware of a lot of
different phones out there

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.220
and trying to make things
as snappy as possible.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:30.180
Yes, and again, there's always
going to be some optimal

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.930
things that you can do in native
application, no matter

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:35.920
what you want to do, compared
to running it

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:36.550
through a Web View.

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:39.260
But that said, we should
certainly try to make sure

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:42.260
that those cases where there
are 500-plus markers to

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:47.650
display, it's feasible to do
that in some way on Web View.

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:49.650
--without any kind
of noticeable

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:52.936
slowdown, if possible.

00:46:52.936 --> 00:46:56.840
DAVEY:Because my company is
trying to move away from the

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.310
entire native development
thing.

00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:03.610
They want to do cross platform,
HTML5 developments.

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:08.550
Like write once and run on any
device, which I don't really

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:11.115
think is technically possible
all the time.

00:47:11.115 --> 00:47:15.370
But we're trying to see what the
capabilities are of using

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:19.400
the JavaScript in the JavaScript
Maps API in a Web

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.982
View, and see what the
performance is.

00:47:21.982 --> 00:47:22.720
JOSH LIVNI:Absolutely.

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.570
And if you do notice something
where you think--

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:27.660
I have no idea of the number
of markers you're doing,

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.670
exactly what kind of effects
you're doing to them and so

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:34.760
forth, that seems like it's
not what you would expect,

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:37.930
file a feature request or a bug
and say, this doesn't seem

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:38.470
quite right.

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:41.130
Because now Street View should
be pretty snappy on mobile

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:43.130
devices, certainly for many
hundreds of markers.

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:46.053
It should not be a noticeable
slow down

00:47:46.053 --> 00:47:48.742
on any modern device.

00:47:48.742 --> 00:47:49.992
DAVEY:OK.

00:47:55.358 --> 00:47:57.500
JOSH LIVNI:I think we're going
to finish it up here.

00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.925
So thanks a lot, guys, for
joining us and for all the

00:47:59.925 --> 00:48:01.070
good questions.

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:02.680
We'll be back, I think,
next week.

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:03.870
I'm not sure of the
exact date.

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:09.140
But you can check our SG-plus
streams. And we will look

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:11.110
forward to seeing whoever wants
to join us next week.

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:12.570
So thanks again for coming by.
