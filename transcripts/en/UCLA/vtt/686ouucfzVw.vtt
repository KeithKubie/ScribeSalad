00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.980
ELFIN was proposed about 10 years ago,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.420
and we had about three generations of students
 that went through.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.240
This is a culmination of 250 students 
working over 5 years.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.440
In a way it's our child that we've built and we're putting out into the world for it to live on its own.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.800
The three, four of us would be in the basement forty hours a week.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.080
You know, barely coming out to see the light
kind of a thing.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.200
It will always be a moment of pride for me,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.740
because how many people can say that they put something into space.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.100
This is ELFIN. This is actually a mass model.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.620
And as you can see, it's just the size of a loaf of bread.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.380
ELFIN is an acronym for the electron losses
and fields investigation.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.440
And as the name suggests, we'll be studying the precipitation processes

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.460
of energetic electrons and ions as they 
come out of the radiation belts.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.660
So, we'll be looking into that with two different instruments that we've built.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.940
One is an energetic particle detector
and another is a fluxgate magnetometer.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.920
Space weather from a top-down view is really

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.980
the Earth's response to the sun's driving forces.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.380
And the Sun puts off a strong stream of charged particles known as a solar wind.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.680
So, as the solar activity waxes and wanes,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.760
space weather also increases and decreases
in activity and severity.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.180
There have been a number of near misses,
particularly with Apollo missions.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.760
There have been massive storms from the Sun 
that have just barely missed

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.320
and would have been devastating.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.820
But the best way to protect people
from space weather is actually to

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.060
predict when space weather events
are going to happen.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.740
Information gained in these type of studies will allow us

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.680
To better model and predict future space weather forecasts.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.120
And this is crucial if we ever want to venture into space.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.160
We space physicists have a very nice way of

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.980
telling what's going on out in space.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.180
All we have to do is look at our images of the Aurora.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.460
Because, really, the Aurora is a sort of a TV screen
of what happens out in space.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.580
It's going to be really, really exciting because

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.820
there's just so much emotion and
so much history to this.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.800
A lot of people had really poured their 
undergraduate years into a project like this.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.640
And to see it finally launch, it's something that a lot of people are looking forward to.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.040
There were some moments here that I struggled academically,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.760
having to take all upper division classes 
plus research on top of that.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.980
It's maybe too much time in the lab.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.920
But in the end, you know, 
I'm putting a satellite into space.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.500
I think that ELFIN really helped me learn what it meant 
to be on a like a real engineering team.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.740
So, the thermal team is this kind of a special 
case where we didn't really have

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.620
an expert, kind of here on campus, to talk to.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.180
It also meant that we had to learn a whole new software that really no one else was using.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.420
You need to be available. You need to solve problems.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.040
You need to be the one willing to put your face out there and take the hit if things go wrong.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.120
Oh, it is very exciting to see the
difference between the students

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.780
when they come in versus when they
go out of the project.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.900
They stand on their own two feet when they go out.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.300
And they speak like professionals.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.680
And they expect people to treat them as professionals.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.100
One way ELFIN has opened my eyes is that I can have students in the future

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.800
that I'm mentoring through research using the actual data from the satellite that I helped build.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.480
By launching ELFIN we are preparing UCLA

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.120
towards the future of space exploration 
in terms of being able to

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.220
launch an end-to-end mission from UCLA.
