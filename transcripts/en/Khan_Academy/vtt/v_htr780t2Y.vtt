Hi, this is Sal Khan,
founder of the Khan Academy,

00:00:02.928 --> 00:00:05.321
and I'm just here to
remind everyone watching

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:08.266
that Khan Academy is a
not-for-profit organization,

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.587
which means no one owns Khan Academy,

00:00:10.587 --> 00:00:12.445
we are a public charity,

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.045
and we are dependent on donations.

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:17.112
And donations from folks like you

00:00:17.112 --> 00:00:19.295
are what allow us to create the content

00:00:19.295 --> 00:00:20.502
and the interactive software

00:00:20.502 --> 00:00:23.051
that you and folks like you use.

00:00:23.404 --> 00:00:26.794
So I encourage you to
think of making a donation,

00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:29.348
even a few dollars from
everyone watching this video

00:00:29.348 --> 00:00:32.646
would cover Khan Academy's
costs for the coming year.

00:00:32.646 --> 00:00:34.457
We're a small team here at Khan Academy,

00:00:34.457 --> 00:00:36.483
under 100 folks, and
we're literally reaching

00:00:36.483 --> 00:00:39.039
tens of millions of people every month.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.266
So the social return on an
investment here is quite high.

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.296
So, once again, really
encourage you to consider

00:00:45.426 --> 00:00:47.397
donating even a few dollars.

00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:48.251
Thank you.
