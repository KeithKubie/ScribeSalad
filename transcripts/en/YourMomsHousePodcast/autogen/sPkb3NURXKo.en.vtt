on both of our bedside tables now what

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:04.540
on both of our bedside tables now what
 

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:07.440
on both of our bedside tables now what
happened was we lived in Redondo and you

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:07.450
happened was we lived in Redondo and you
 

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.420

and so I reasoned my reasoning was well

01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:17.500
and so I reasoned my reasoning was well
 

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.260
and so I reasoned my reasoning was well
there's no outlet I guess I can't have a
