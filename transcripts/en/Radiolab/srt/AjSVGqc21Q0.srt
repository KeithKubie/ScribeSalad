You are listening to radio lab radio lab

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,080
from [inaudible], w.

3
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:11,670
N y. S. C. E. N. N. P. R.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,350
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich, Radiolab, the podcast,

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,770
and today on the podcast, something
from our producer, Sean Cole.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,910
You've been out doing something.
I've been doing many things,

7
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:27,900
but I mean in particular with regard to
this podcast, you have a story for us.

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,880
I do. Don't tell us about this
other thing. Nope. What's his story?

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,000
So this is a story about a woman.
You've probably seen her. Really?

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,020
You've seen her face. Oh,
you may have even dated her.

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,390
We'll put your mouth on her to explain.

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,470
So you know when you got to bring
somebody back to life. One, two, three.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,820
Hold on, let me come take a class. Yep.

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,310
And they make you practice
on this dummy CPR.

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,920
The dummy has this face that you
suck on. Well, you don't suck on it.

16
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:58,540
You blow into us. When I met you don't
know a lot about CPR. Yeah, right. Well,

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,400
what's the story with the dog?
Shoot was so, so that lady,

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,110
we're nine 30 before she was a dummy.

19
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:08,260
That face belonged to
an actual woman's face,

20
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:13,261
CPR dummies faces and actual an actual
lady that was transfixing and inspiring

21
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,350
to millions of people and
used to basically hang out
with Napoleon and Mozart.

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,730
True. Yes. I first heard this
story from this guy, Jeremy Grange.

23
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:27,930
I'm a producer with BBC radio in the UK.

24
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,550
He made it a documentary about
all of this, well a while back,

25
00:01:30,551 --> 00:01:34,420
but basically we story starts.
Our story starts in Norway.

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,890
In the early 1950s there was this toy
maker named Osman, the layer doll,

27
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,390
and last month lay Adele was making
plastic toys, brightly colored toys,

28
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:47,240
and their story also involves
his two year old son. Ta-Da.

29
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,590
I'm the Torah LADOT. He's
all grown up. Now what?

30
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,100
Obviously I don't recall
the details myself,

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,470
but it's being told to me that
one day he and his father,

32
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,140
Osmond victim are at their summer home,

33
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:04,141
which is on the ocean and somehow tore
toddles is way out of sight and the next

34
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:05,410
thing anyone knows,

35
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,490
the OSI was found floating

36
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,300
face down and the C

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,120
and a I was just kept floating by
some air trapped in a rain coat.

38
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,520
He's on top of a raincoat on
the water. So I think the,

39
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,700
I think the raincoat is on top of him,
but basically it's keeping him a lot.

40
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:29,690
So there's a bubble of air under.
Yeah. And then Osman, his dad sees him.

41
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,420
I don't know how long I
have been in the water,

42
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:36,400
but when I was pulled out by
my father, I was life, uh,

43
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,293
less.

44
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,620
And not only does Asman not know
mouth to mouth resuscitation,

45
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,110
this was in 1954.

46
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,530
There is no mouth to mouth
resuscitation. I mean, no,

47
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:49,900
people didn't know about it. It
hadn't really been developed yet.

48
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,280
And so his dad, they was shaking
me on doing whatever he could.

49
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,540
Gradually I responded and as fate would
have it, not long after that, Osmond,

50
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,100
I mean freshly saved,

51
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:04,450
a son from drowning is contacted by the
man who is developing mouth to mouth

52
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,090
resuscitation. An Austrian
doctor called Peter Safer,

53
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,270
a good name for a guy
trying to keep people safer.

54
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,110
We'd worked out all the basics of
CPR with the mouth to mouth and the

55
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,640
compressing the chest
and everything like that.

56
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,600
But he realized he needed a way
for people to practice this.

57
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,920
And my father was asked whether he
possibly could help making some kind of

58
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:26,890
training device. And pretty
quickly, Osman thought, well,

59
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,450
we need the dummy and the
mannequins. Somewhere along the line,

60
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,430
Aspen had to decide what the face
of this dummy was gonna look like.

61
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,570
Yeah.

62
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,270
Should it be a woman? Should it be a man?

63
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,890
I think you felt that
people would be more, um,

64
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,790
intimidated or shy or
if it was a man's face.

65
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:51,791
So he decided to go with a woman's face
and attractive woman's face because at

66
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:57,611
that time you were asking lay people to
blow into the quote unquote dead person.

67
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,050
You know, you don't want to blow into
somebody who's gaping with a horror face.

68
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,410
She should, she should look
comfortably dead. And then the, uh,

69
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,340
came across this, uh, um,

70
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,680
girl in my grandparents' home asthma and
is there in the house and he looks up

71
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:19,490
at the wall and sees this face of a woman.

72
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,760
It's a mask.

73
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,490
And my father was taken back by the
beauty of this face and he says,

74
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,520
that's the face. That's the face.

75
00:04:28,521 --> 00:04:33,050
I'll use this as a mass as what kind
of mask was this? It was a death mask.

76
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,430
What's the death mask? All
right, I'm going to get,

77
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,790
I'm going to go back even further
here. So stay with me for a minute.

78
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,740
Back in the 19th century, commonly
people after they were dead,

79
00:04:45,741 --> 00:04:49,700
they'd have masks made of their
faces. Here's one of Abraham Lincoln.

80
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:51,890
There's a death deathmatch.
Really? Yeah, cause you want,

81
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,430
you want to preserve their countenance.
So right after the person dies,

82
00:04:55,431 --> 00:04:59,390
pretty much you take a bunch of clay and
you stick it on their face and you make

83
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:02,420
a mold, fill the mold with plaster
and then you've got a plaster masking.

84
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:05,480
You can reproduce it and reproduce
it. It was especially common in Paris.

85
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,520
Hey Radiolab. It is a sunny,

86
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:13,380
cold Paris October morning
and weeks, months makers,

87
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:16,830
workshops that existed
around Paris 120 years ago.

88
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,000
There's only one left nor about to
visit. Cool. Lorenzi is, which is a,

89
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,960
which is it like a mass making
shops. So coming up to the gate,

90
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,640
we asked our friends, Kristin Clark,

91
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,550
and tomorrow's Red Dorevitch
to drop by there for us.

92
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,420
I've still got this incredible workshop
and you go up some rickety narrow wooden

93
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:37,194
stairs

94
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,810
and you get to the top and there's just
level pranks of faces or rows and rows

95
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,710
of people that look like they're sleeping.

96
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,980
Death mosques of who is
the one at the top there?

97
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Everybody Know Napoleon and bullion
here where the rope spear Hovis.

98
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,570
He was in the French
mucked sauce and Beethoven.

99
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:00,680
It's the mask of shopper.

100
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,400
The composer looking at you from
the wall and from the ceiling.

101
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,460
All of their eyes are closed
face after face after face.

102
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,070
And there are famous historical figures,

103
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,340
but also among them is this girl.

104
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,140
Oh,

105
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,590
she is not a poet. She's not
a conqueror's. Not Anybody.

106
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:18,990
[inaudible]

107
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,890
which has gotta be somebody.
I mean who, who? Well,

108
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,020
the story that emerged after she died
in, this is possibly fancy, possibly,

109
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:28,810
you know, maybe fact, but
the sources are lost to us.

110
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:31,630
So we were not sure exactly what happened,

111
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,260
but she was young in her early
to mid twenties who, you know,

112
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,270
came from the countryside,
not from Paris, you know,

113
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:44,200
she was a sort of poor, uneducated
woman, but she came to Paris,

114
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,380
meets a man and there was a love affair,

115
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,230
which then turns sour

116
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,140
the stories that may be she was pregnant
and abandoned or maybe she was just

117
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:55,974
abandoned.

118
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,630
She goes to a bridge that's
stretching across the same,

119
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,830
might be the one by the loo

120
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,060
steps to the edge and she
threw herself into the river

121
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,120
and he drowned and then
the body was recovered.

122
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,620
She was taken to the morgue,
which wasn't that far away.

123
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,540
And in those days police would be
displayed behind glass and hopefully their

124
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:31,780
relatives or their friends
would come along and say, yes,

125
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:34,480
that's my father or my
sister or my daughter.

126
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,970
And they would reclaim the bodies

127
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,120
since they were displayed.

128
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,590
We're also like strangers coming around
for a kind of like weird Museumy,

129
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,200
um, thrill that. Absolutely, yes it was.
That's probably what it was with her.

130
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,700
She was a particularly beautiful co-ops
and everybody rushed down to see her.

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,760
And eventually the,

132
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,350
the guy who ran the morgue took a plaster
cast of her face because she was so

133
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:03,370
beautiful. He was just struck
by her, just like layer it all,

134
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:05,670
just like everybody.
What'd she look like? Yeah,

135
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,930
I wouldn't say sort of plump face
around it face. She's lovely,

136
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,600
but not in a come hither way.

137
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:18,601
She's more like sort of weirdly
saintly looking like she's serene,

138
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,600
innocent, serene, innocent,

139
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,600
but also sort of knowing
and she has a little smile.

140
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:26,650
If you look at the master,

141
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,660
there's just this little smile playing
on the lips and it's just enough to kind

142
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:35,950
of make you think, well, why
is she smiling and who is she?

143
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:40,180
And the problem was if wasn't
identified, oh, so they didn't know. No.

144
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,520
And so ultimately people started
calling her by this name,

145
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,580
the [inaudible]. Um, can you,

146
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,950
well, so you know, like the word
Ingenue, which means innocent lady like,

147
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,950
or the character of the
ingenue, the movies. This is

148
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,780
long canoe, which means unknown. And
can you tell us the unknown woman,

149
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,280
uh, of the scene? And
then gradually the, uh,

150
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,690
plastic cost worked its way into the mask
makers workshops and now it's onto the

151
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:10,530
streets of Paris.

152
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:17,290
And it wasn't long before this woman
became a sensation and everyone started

153
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:18,560
writing about her,

154
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,560
the face of the young drunk woman real
cause beautiful because it's mild smiled

155
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:30,020
so deceptively as though it view a Niacin
in the woman who had drawn a self here

156
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:33,550
years ago and who is so
beautiful that's Nabokov,

157
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:38,180
touchingly frail young shoulders who
wrote this entire poem sort of demanding,

158
00:09:38,181 --> 00:09:40,720
you know, who made you
jump? Who was he? You know,

159
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,450
who was the guy that'd be [inaudible]
tell me your mysterious seducer.

160
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,190
Was He some neighbors? Curly locked nephew
of the loud tie and gold capped too.

161
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,940
In any case, this mask is a
huge deal in all thousands.

162
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:56,180
Countless people have it hanging on
their wall the same way you would hang

163
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:59,690
Napoleon on your wall because he's
Napoleon, but they don't know who she is.

164
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:01,700
And that's sort of the point.
They're like, who is she?

165
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,370
And everybody's captivated, including

166
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,340
our toy maker, a small layer doe.
He felt that the [inaudible] canoe,

167
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,370
the attractiveness and the story would
be the right model to use for the first

168
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:18,320
CPR mannequin in history.

169
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:23,350
Who has a name crystal CN resusci n could
you describe what we have in front of

170
00:10:25,131 --> 00:10:29,660
us here? What we see
is the very first, uh,

171
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,860
production muddled. I'll recess the
album from 1968. She's had to check.

172
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,920
The face has changed slightly
because if you want to do CPR,

173
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,460
you have to have an open
mouth. So regrettably,

174
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:43,830
the slight smile is now imparted,

175
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,700
but you've still got the high
forehead and the closed eyes.

176
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,570
And I'm every went through the
[inaudible] CPR mannequin that's produced.

177
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:57,860
300 million people have been trained on
this thing since it was first introduced

178
00:10:57,861 --> 00:11:02,330
in 1968. And every single dummy
has the face of the encore,

179
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,710
new still stiller. And um, hopefully

180
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,130
she's looking quite attractive. Four six,

181
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:17,840
seven, eight, nine,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

182
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:19,190
16, 17, 18.

183
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:24,191
Craziest part about it is that this
face of this wound woman nine 30,

184
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:31,211
becomes the face that people blow into
to learn how to save drowned people.

185
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,840
It's like, it's like over
and over and over again.

186
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,700
Thousands and thousands of people

187
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,950
are trying to bring
this woman back to life.

188
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,440
That's kind of beautiful. [inaudible]

189
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,550
issue. Maybe like it's like it'd be fact.

190
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,890
You've just given her isn't
really a given about her. Actually

191
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,850
no about this, this
woman. Well, so I mean,

192
00:12:02,851 --> 00:12:05,130
Jeremy went into his research
sort of asking the same question,

193
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,920
what do we really know? What
we really know what's true?

194
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,140
I, uh, I have a horrible
suspicion. The truth, you know,

195
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,580
is that she didn't die. Yeah. I mean,

196
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,600
having shown the mask to
Pascal's your account,

197
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:21,510
who's a member of the BRCA and fluvial

198
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,980
this is the river police whose job it
is to pull dead bodies out of the sane

199
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,360
rescue people from the sane.
And Pascal is in charge. So

200
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,150
whoa, you know, hundreds
of have drowned bodies. Uh,

201
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:38,350
he can look at a face and he can know
whether that's somebody who's drowned.

202
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:41,800
And he said it's surprising
when I saw the picture to, to,

203
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:45,250
to see that so peaceful
face just because, uh,

204
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,470
everyone we found in the water is never
are so peaceful and not to put too fine

205
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:54,370
a point on it, but when somebody drowned,

206
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,740
they start decomposing quite quickly.

207
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,920
They are swollen most of the times or
the features that you have seen in life

208
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:04,750
don't really last very long.

209
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,720
It's not so nice looking once
somebody who's been in the water.

210
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,140
Do you think she's attractive? Yeah.
Yes, of course. Yeah. Yeah. Just,

211
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:20,430
she looks very regretful.

212
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,300
So if she didn't die
then who was she then?

213
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,260
She may have been a model that
somebody just thought was pretty,

214
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,510
wanted to take a plaster
cast for her face.

215
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,780
I facing Munis really at that
point it's, it's anybody's guess.

216
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,650
We don't know this,

217
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:36,040
this is our end of knowing her
and knowing what's frustrating,

218
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,250
but maybe it's better that way.
I mean, if you don't like the,

219
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:43,180
the reason why she was so captivating is
because people don't know and they can

220
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:47,440
just feel this gap with their own stories
that can just sort of sit there and

221
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,720
muse a better. In fact, uh, Jeremy, uh,

222
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,110
told me this story about this
museum that he went to in Liverpool.

223
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:56,170
It was the historic house
of a photographer there

224
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,400
[inaudible] in the kind of
waiting room, the walls,

225
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,180
the mask of the ankle knew
actually on the wall there.

226
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,890
So you know, slightly disingenuously
I asked the Guide, Oh,

227
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,930
what's that? Very disingenuine. Well
then you knew everything about it.

228
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:17,130
At that point I thought, I thought
I'd see, and it was amazing.

229
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:21,930
She told me this story about twins, two,

230
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,030
two girls from Liverpool,

231
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,170
and this is the important bit from where
we were from the city where we weren't,

232
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,730
not from no from anywhere.

233
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,560
The story was almost exactly the same
except this time one of the twin girls

234
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:40,030
left Liverpool in her late teens or
early twenties, made her way to Paris,

235
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:42,010
fell in love, got
knocked up. The guy left,

236
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,040
she despaired and then [inaudible] off
the bridge and drowned and the mosque of

237
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,590
this beautiful corpse was taken. But
this, this version keeps going after that,

238
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,790
50 years later,

239
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,720
the surviving twin who never
knew what happened to her sister,

240
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,310
takes a trip to Paris

241
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:03,390
walking through the streets of Paris
and sees this face on the wall and yeah,

242
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,310
this time, instead of
it being her own faith,

243
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,000
it's the face of her twin
sister who's there. And,

244
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,770
and so her twin who,

245
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:16,360
who died long before her is kind
of kept forever young. Well,

246
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,310
she's had to hage and so she's from
Liverpool now as far as you know,

247
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,480
as far as the Liverpudlians
are concerned. Yeah.

248
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,840
And I wonder if she's also
from Cornwall as far as,

249
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,260
as far as the corn plants are
concerned and from, you know,

250
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,070
like maybe she's, um, a Moscow bite
as far as the people in Moscow,

251
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,270
she says Cillian as far as
the Sicilians are concerned,

252
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,550
maybe she's a Laotian as far as the
Laotians has been some kind of Buenos

253
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:43,580
already in Australia. Hello
cal cutten. As far as the

254
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,900
[inaudible], as far as the
bay routines are concerned,

Dean Denver as [inaudible]

256
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,380

Pretty sure Sanko. And before we go,

257
00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:59,900
thank you to Jeremy
Grange and to our readers,
