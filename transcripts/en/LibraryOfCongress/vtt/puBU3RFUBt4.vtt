00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.220
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: I'm Mr. Patrick.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.540
I'm director of something they
call the Veterans History Project.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.730 position:56%
Okay, this is your quiz for the day.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.500
Who can tell me what a veteran is?

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.060
You had your hand up first.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.390
&gt;&gt; A person that helps animals.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.690
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: A
person that helps animals.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.930
You know, a lot of
people sometimes say that.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.340
That's a veterinarian.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.320
Okay, I'm going to
try you, young man.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; A person who used to be in a war.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.780
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: A person
who used to be in a war.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.080
Pretty good.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.270
&gt;&gt; A person that you
should remember.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.620
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: A person
that you should remember.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.920
Thank you.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.220
And you?

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.380
&gt;&gt; It's somebody that
spends [inaudible].

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.680
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick:
Okay, that's right.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.720
That's another definition
for a veteran [inaudible].

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.020
And then you.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.460
&gt;&gt; Somebody in the Army.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.940
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick:
Somebody in the Army, yes.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.310
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.240
There's a whole collection of what
you just said that's kind of right.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.750
A veteran in terms of what we're
talking about today, though,

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.890
is somebody that has served in the
military, in any of the military:

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.040
Army, Navy, Air Force,
Marine Corps, Coast Guard.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.280
All those people who served in
the military are called veterans,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.660
once they come out of the service.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.240
Who in here knows a veteran?

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.950
Who do you know?

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.250
&gt;&gt; Me.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: You're a veteran?

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.850
&gt;&gt; No, [inaudible comment].

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.150
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: I did.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.450
Your father?

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.750
What service was he in?

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.050
&gt;&gt; He was in the military.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.350
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: Do you
know what service he was in:

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.650
Army, Navy, Marine Corps?

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.950
&gt;&gt; Marines.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.250
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: He's Marines?

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.550
That's why you got a
good haircut, right?

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.850
Okay, yes, you.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.150
&gt;&gt; My grandfather.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.450
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick:
Your grandfather was.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.750
Do you know what service he was in?

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.660
Marines? My gosh, we got
a bunch of marines here.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.780
Yes sir? Your cousin?

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.940
Do you know what service he was in?

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.750
&gt;&gt; She was in the Navy.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.050
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: In the Navy.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.760
Has she been recently in the Navy?

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.010
Okay. And you, sir?

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.580
One of your uncles
was in the service?

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.230
You don't know what service it was?

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.530
Yes, ma'am.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.270

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.530
She's in the Navy?

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.830
Your uncle?

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.000
Do you know what service he was in?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.470
The Army. I'm an Army veteran,

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.540
so he's probably a
pretty good guy, right?

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.840
Yes sir?

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.140
&gt;&gt; My father.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.440

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.040
He went overseas?

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.570
Did not go overseas.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.100
But he was in the military?

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.800
Whoever is in the military,
no matter what they do,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.860
no matter they serve,
they're all veterans

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.990
and they should be remembered.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.650
Did someone else have
their hand up over here?

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.510
Yes sir?

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.200
Your friend's father
was in the Marines.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.090
So the fact that a lot of you folks
know veterans, have some veterans

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.230
in your family, your friends
have people in veterans,

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.600
that says there's probably
a lot of veterans around.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.030
And really there are.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.540
Believe it or not, there
are 20 million veterans

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.260
who are in this country today.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.810
In this room alone, Mr.
Cole [assumed spelling],

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.030
where'd Mr. Cole go?

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.960
He's a veteran, in the
Army many years ago.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.580
I was a veteran.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.880
There's veterans everywhere.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.800
I bet there's veterans
in your school.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.480
I bet there's veterans that
live down the street from you.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.070
I bet there's veterans
you go to church with.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.660
They're everywhere.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.990
And each and every one of them have
what we call an important story

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.510
to tell.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.590
It's a story of serving
their country.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.030
No matter where they go,
no matter what they do,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.890
what they do is important.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.970
Why do you think veterans
are important?

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.270
Anybody have an idea?

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.570
Yes.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.920
&gt;&gt; Because I think they
fight for [inaudible].

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.260
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: Exactly.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.350 position:56%
They're willing to fight, in some
cases lay down their lives, for each

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.710
and every one of us so that we
can enjoy what we have today

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.010
in this country.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.530
And that's happened from day one

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.720
from when this country
started all the way up to today

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.690
that there're men and women
who've been willing to do this.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.840
And that's why we think
those stories are important.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.360
So we here at the Library
of Congress,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.080
actually the United
States Congress thought

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.380
that this would be a good idea

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.740
and they created something called
the Veterans History Project.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.200
And this is a project where
we encourage people to sit

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.030
down with a veteran in their
life, their neighbor, their uncle,

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.430
their mother, their grandmother,
their teacher, whoever,

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.810
and listen to their story.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.550
And generally this is
done, this is something

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.770
that we ask high school
students and above to do for us.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.140
And we've had people all
over the country doing this,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.890
students all over the country.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.030
We've had people like
in the Red Cross.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.060
We've had people in
veterans' organizations.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.430
We've had people in the Department
of Veterans Affairs, just all kinds

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.010
of people recording these stories.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.980
But you can kind of
be a part of it too.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.140
And if you want to, you
can go online and hear some

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.170
of these stories on our website.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.600
But I would also encourage
you to talk about,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.030
we talked about those veterans you
know or maybe that you don't know

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.370
to sit down and talk to them.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.250
Ask them what's it
like being in the Arm.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.590
What'd you do in the Army.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.890
Where'd you go.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.120
What was important for you.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.790
What was some of the funny
things that happened to you?

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.100
Believe it or not, there are
funny things that happen to you

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.400
when you're in the military.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.380
I have 28 years' worth of them.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.510
But also ask them what does it mean
for them to say, "I'm a veteran?"

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.320
And when they think back on
their service to their country,

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.950
how they look at that and the
importance they put on that.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.760
And whether they would
do it all over again.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.690
And nine times out of ten
they would say they would.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.050
There's another veteran
sitting back there.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.350
That young man's a veteran.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.650
I'm a veteran.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.630
Mr. Cole's a veteran
who was just here.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.420
So we're everywhere.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.750
So that's the story
I have for you today.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.500
You're going to be
hearing some other stories

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.940
from a very important veteran
that I think Miss Jaffe is going

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.160
to introduce at this time.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.420
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Brian
Thacker is a Vietnam vet

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.000
and a Congressional
Medal of Honor winner

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.290
and you're going to
learn all about that.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.590
And yesterday, which was
Memorial Day, we were talking

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.410
about that a little bit earlier.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.010
He participated in
a special ceremony

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:07.130
in which the US Postal
Service launched three stamps

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.120
and on those stamps it
features the Congressional Medal

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.000
of Honor, very unique opportunity.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.660
And Brian was one of ten
veterans who was at that service

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.720
and I believe who spoke,
at least to the media,

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.210
because I saw it, thanks
to Bob Patrick.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:34.100
So without further ado, I'm
going to introduce Mr. Thacker.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.240
He will be doing two things.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:43.880
He's going to talk a bit about a
new book about "Choose Courage,"

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.000
which is a book about the
Congressional Medal of Honor,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.770 position:56%
winners and citizen winners, citizen
honor winners, and then he's going

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.460
to talk a bit about
himself and feel free to do

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.190 position:56%
that in whichever order pleases you.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:05.230
Okay? And then after he
speaks, we will have opportunity

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.930
for you to ask some questions.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.840
This is what I'm going to do when
that happens, I'm going to sit

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.410
over there, but when the
question and answer period starts,

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.830
he will pick the person
that starts the questions

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.710
and he will call on them.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.830
I will give the first person the
microphone and then you'll look

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.700
to see who's been called on
next and then you'll give

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.330
that person the microphone.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.300
Because this is videotaped,
we want to be sure

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.520
that everyone gets their
question on the mike.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.910
Okay? Alright, thank you.

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:44.500
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: Can we start the
lesson with a fine point for us

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.400
that we think of ourselves
as recipients, not winners.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.040
We entered no contest.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:09:00.680 position:56%
It's a little thing but it's one
that I've been given the opportunity

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.460
to speak to, coming
out of the shoot.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.680
Got to get my [inaudible].

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:14.380
This is not a me award.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.770
This is an us award.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:21.200
Yesterday when I was down at
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.110
and the questions were always
what does this day mean to you,

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.790
what are you thinking about,

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:33.390
and the short answer is the same
thing I think about every day.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.780
On panel four west, there's
a place on that panel

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:42.950
that remembers March 31, 1971.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:46.190
And it was an average
day in Vietnam.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:52.390
There's nine names on that wall,
in that section and a little

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:57.280
down about 85 to 95 row levels.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.970
But for the efforts of five other
people, mine would be the tenth.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.090
And every day I thank them for the
opportunity for a second chance.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:16.120
I hope that when I
walk out of here today,

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.800
you will think that
I did them proud.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:37.170
This award is since the Civil War,
just about 3500 soldiers, sailors,

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.440
airmen, coast guard,
one coast guard,

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:46.040
one woman have received the
honor out of over 40 million

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.870
that have ever served,
same time frame.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:57.930
I had nothing to do with
nominating myself for this thing.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.010
None of us did.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:05.050
It was our peers that when
all the dust had settled

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:10.690
and there's usually a commander
that says, okay, awards,

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.250
what do you think,
who made a difference,

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:22.930
and somebody nominated us with
me to carry the responsibility

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.520
of receiving the award
and presenting it

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.650
in their behalf, to
whoever I talk to.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.320
That's the way it is
with all of them today,

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.670
all of the living recipients.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.330
It wasn't always that way.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:42.620
Back in the Civil War, you could
promote yourself and many did.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.890
And that era has passed.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:59.400
This book, "Choosing Courage,"
is not just about this award.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.620
It's about some civilians
that have done the same thing.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.850
That would be you.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:10.450
There's at least two stories in
there that are from children,

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:15.720
maybe three if I remember right.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:25.260
Doolittle's daughter wrote one
but I knew her as an adult,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.410
not when she was in sixth grade.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:36.820
Jencie's story is a tough one.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:47.020
It's a reality in every school
that all of the teachers train for.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.560
My generation did not.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:57.800
It's one of the differences between
the good old bad days in the 1950s

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:04.110
and yet when I say that
I'm a product of a separate

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:10.750
and unequal school system,
it hadn't changed over yet.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.900
Having a weapon in school was
the last thing we thought of.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.870
I certainly knew how to use them.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.340
I'd been taught.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.750
Don't point that thing at me, boy,

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.530
that's the way my uncles
addressed me when I needed

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.100
to improve my behavior and conduct.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:37.070
But it was very clear from first
grade on that you shoot at targets.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.230
If you're hunting, you
shoot at the animal

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.850
but you never point
he weapon at a person.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:48.580
And I got that training early on.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:54.890
We didn't have weapons
in the schools.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:59.970
We had these but that was it.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:09.160
The challenge that
Jencie faced was one

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.520
that here we are, we
have to deal with it.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.990
If you go down to Union
Station and you watch the metro,

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:22.970
the Amtrak videos, there's a video
there that tells you what to do.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.540
You only have three choices.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.500
Two of them are run away.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.150
And they come first.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:39.450
The third one is the
soldier's solution

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:49.740
and the third solution is attack,
only if you have to because

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.970
at that point you've
already made the decision

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.130
that the shooter that you're next.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:15:02.490
You're trapped and that's an
ugly reality that we all face

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.960
in public spaces and in school.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.630
Let me start with Jencie's story.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:17.960
If any of you have
questions, break it up.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.410
Am I going to read the whole thing?

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:22.800
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.100
It's a short one.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:35.130
I need to read the first paragraph
and then I'll probably skip over.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:40.970
I'll probably read about the
young man that she confronted.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:52.100
I have not made a phone call
to the Foundation in years

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.530
about what's happened next.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:59.740
But when you hear the
date is March 14, 2006,

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.360
Jencie Fagan was a
phys ed teacher setting

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.830
up for volleyball for first period.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:09.210
I think you all have been there.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.770
Some of you might've
been there to help.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:18.490
She was at the Edward Pine
Middle School in Reno, Nevada.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:22.480
And she was one of the more
popular members of the faculty.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:29.900
She had enthusiasm but she
also had high expectations.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:36.090
And she was involved with her kids.

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:41.300
She ran the laps with the kids.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.850
She encouraged those that were
having trouble to keep up.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.740
She ran with you to
try to help you along

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.440
because running is a challenge.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.300
I don't like to do it.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.060
But it's one of those
things that you have to do

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:01.430
to develop your lungs,
to develop your body.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:07.070
The bad news is that the
lungs mature next to last.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:12.380
The last to mature is
this thing up here.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:19.970
But if you don't exercise
both before you get there,

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:27.430
you don't come out as strong.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:33.010
Anyway, James, I don't know if
that's his real name or it's

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.840
to protect him, was one of
the loners at Edward Pine.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.020
School was a struggle.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.560
He had a dark feeling that
no one, not his schoolmates,

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.670
his parents, cared about him.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.160
He was angry, confused.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:54.970
It had come to a boil when he
watched a video of Columbine.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:03.070
He came to school that morning

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.870
with a 0.38 caliber
pistol in his backpack.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:12.790
Went to the boys room,
loaded it, and came out ready

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:22.080
to shoot before first period.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.070
One of his friends, he
did have at least one,

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:30.600
he didn't recognize it though,
passed him and asked him

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.820
to take the gun away,
put the gun away,

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.310
and then James told him
to run for his life.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.610
And then he opened fire.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.740
Jencie recognized the sounds.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.970
There were three rounds.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:57.040
And she sprinted to the sound
even though she didn't have to.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.940
The first rule when you hear
those sounds is to move away.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.280
Code Red had been sounded.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.820
That was their emergency signal.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.370
Jencie huddled as many
students as she could

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:21.460
into the offices along
the way to the gym.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.110
One of her students said, yeah,

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.770
we kind of expected Jencie
to come to the rescue.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.070
That's the kind of
teacher that she was.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.450
And then she saw James.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:45.960
And she walked up to him
and started talking to him,

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:52.080
not in a loud yelling voice at all.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.680
You talk in a soft voice.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:03.320
The book says she began
talking to him in a soft voice.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.330
She kept telling him
that he was not a killer

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.940
and that he would be all right.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.670
You know, worried that someone else
could come in to the cafeteria,

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:15.400
he'd turn and shoot, so she stood
in front of him to make sure

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.900
that if he was going
to pull the trigger,

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.200
she was going to take
the first round.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.510
She wasn't angry with James at all.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:32.750
She felt sympathy and was
determined to keep him

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:36.270
from hurting anybody else.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:41.140
She remembered her own
difficulties growing up.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:45.070
One of six kids, brought up by
a single mother, in a small town

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:53.370
in Alabama, she felt disadvantaged
in comparison to normal families.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:58.230
But her mom who worked
wouldn't tolerate self pity

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:01.930
and she was taught
mom didn't give up.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.230
She pushed us harder.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.530
She taught us to never quit.

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.610
And that's one of the
things that made her stick

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.970
with James rather than run.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:26.360
She asked him to put down the
gun, please put it on the floor.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:31.990
As long as you've got that thing,
we're in an unstable situation.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:41.200
As soon as he did put it down, she
hugged him and kept talking to him.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.490
She said we're not going anywhere.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:44.840
I'm going to be with you.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.720
I'll see you through this.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.500
You have at least one
teacher on your side.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.800
Yep.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.570
The part that I'm unhappy about
because I don't know the rest

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.320
of the story on this side
is, you know, James was --

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.660
Two students were treated.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.500
He did wound two students.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:16.290
He was tried as a minor, arrested,
tried, convicted of two counts

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:21.440
of battery with a deadly weapon,
and I'm sure he went for treatment.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:26.300
What I don't know is what's
happened to him since.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:31.580
And that bothers me.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:40.710
When she was asked why she
had put herself in harm's way,

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.010
Jencie talked about her mother.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.200
She taught us to think that
if you see something happening

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.270
that isn't right, you do something.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:56.790
You don't look for
someone else to handle it.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:01.460
She said I'm a teacher,
a mom, a human being.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.350
These are our children.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:09.220
There's no way I'm going to call a
parent after something has happened

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.540
and tell them that I
didn't do everything I could

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.880
to protect their child.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:24.930 position:56%
A couple years later in 2008, March
25, that's a significant day for us,

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.670
it's the Medal of Honors' birthday.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:32.270
We celebrate it.

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:34.640
We recognized Jencie.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.150
I think she was one of
our first recipients

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:41.330
of our citizens above
self recognition.

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:46.510
That was a dream come true.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:53.790 position:56%
We think as recipients that we need
to recognize people in civilian life

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:59.290
when they step up to the
plate and it's a small token

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:03.430 position:56%
of our appreciation to Jencie Fagan.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:08.420
What she did when facing
harm was every bit

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:11.350
as courageous as what
a soldier faces.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:19.240
And that is an abbreviated
version of what's in print here.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.050
I skipped some of the
words and inserted some

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:25.290
of my own comments along the way.

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:31.500
But it's a short story,
unfortunately one

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:35.680
that almost every school
has to be aware of.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:47.490
Now I think comes the hard part.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:51.940
I'm supposed to talk about me.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:25:00.970 position:56%
I never know what to say on that and
we'll open it up for questions next.

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.650
We were soldiers.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.290
We were in Vietnam.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:16.890
We were on a isolated
small fire base.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:21.560
The only way we could get
to it was by helicopter

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:28.230
because it was surrounded with
North Vietnamese regulars.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:36.390
On March 31, the North Vietnamese
decided they wanted the fire base.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:40.620
And we didn't want to give it up.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:51.590
I lost three men, very quickly,
because they were awake.

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:56.610
They were on duty,
5:30 in the morning,

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:59.780
6 o'clock in the morning
you're supposed to be asleep,

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.490
unless you're a soldier
in a combat zone.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.920
And then you either have a third
or half of your people awake,

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.480
ready to fight all the time.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.840
That was a rotating duty.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:17.900
My turn would've been the
day before or the day after.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.150
We just took turns being up,

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.970
taking watch at all hours
of the day and night.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:38.210
We were outnumbered, outgunned.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:44.460
The only advantage that we
had is that we were on top

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.640
of the hill shooting down and
they had to shoot up at us.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:56.450
But eventually by the end of the
day, we were not going to be able

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:02.970
to hold that position for that next
night and wait for reinforcements.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:10.770 position:56%
In order to get people away, I asked
for artillery fire on that position

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:18.140
so that they could form up in what
turned out to be a small platoon,

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.690
move down a trail through a place

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:21.980
where they could be
extracted safely.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:27.310
I was waiting for that
fire to get to me

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:34.710
and it was taking much too long
for me, seconds if you were

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:36.730
down at the firing battery.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:44.690
And I wanted to make darn sure
that when I left the first base,

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:48.980
and there was one South Vietnamese
soldier standing right beside me.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:53.850
He had the machine gun.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:56.670
They weren't messing with him.

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.640
They could listen to
us on the radio.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.210
They knew that I was going
to shoot the location.

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:06.210
It was just a matter of do we
want to rush across that fire base

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:09.930
and try to get to them or do we
want to hold back and let them go.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:15.640
I don't know what was going
through the enemy commander's mind.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:20.680
What I was looking to do at
that point in time was buy time

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:26.830
so that what was left of a
friendly unit could separate.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:29.620
Hopefully there wasn't an
ambush waiting for them.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.280
And they could get to a place
farther away from the fire base

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:38.310
where helicopters could
land and extract them.

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:39.920
I tried to catch up.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:48.180
Did not. Ended up deciding that it
was better to stay still and hide

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:52.100 position:56%
where I wasn't supposed to be and
hope that they wouldn't look for me.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:59.570
And that was a successful
strategy the first night.

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:09.900 position:56%
The next day I was trying to move to
a safer location and we got bombed.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.680
And when the dust settled,
I was surrounded

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.740
by a North Vietnamese
machine gun position.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:22.370
And I had to wait in a bamboo
thicket that had been prepared

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:27.940
by some animal, probably a
tiger, when I think back on it.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:35.560
And I just had to wait until I
thought it was safe to go back

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:41.490
up to the fire base, which had been
retaken by the South Vietnamese.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:42.880
There was a battle going on.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.870
You could hear it all day.

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:50.600
Whenever helicopters came in
to resupply the fire base,

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.460
they flew right over my position.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:57.280
The machine gun -- The North
Vietnamese machine gun emplacement

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:04.090
opened up on them and they
either had to go up, go around,

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:08.150
maneuver to land at the fire base.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:09.800
We got strafed every day.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:16.290
We knew that a resupply was coming
because we got strafed followed

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:22.000
by the supply helicopters and
the North Vietnamese just stayed

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
in their little holes and waited
for the strafe to end and came up

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.540
and were read to shoot at the
next round of helicopters.

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.080
It was a pretty simple game.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:35.570
And eventually I decided
I had to crawl back

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:40.800
up the mountain and
was successful here.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.410
I was thirsty.

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:44.710
I was tired.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:46.270
I was hungry.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:47.570
Mostly thirsty.

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:52.000
And I was evacuated and two

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.690
and a half years later
I got the phone call

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:56.400
that you're going to be decorated.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:01.940
And that, sort of in a
nutshell, is my story,

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:07.560
whatever I could pull
up today and remember.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:12.420
I don't know to this day
what I did that was heroic.

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:16.930
I had a job to do.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.310
I was the team leader.

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.810
They were my men.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:26.340
I had tools at my disposal.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:31.010
I used every one of them
to the extent I could.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:38.610
But I think that's what
I was expected to do.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:40.250
I have to trust my colleagues

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:44.840
that whatever they saw
trust their judgment

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:50.990
because that's what we were doing
because you don't give an order,

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:54.670
an order that you give that
nobody follows is useless.

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:57.950
People have to accept the
guidance and the instruction.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:06.170
But they did put me in and it
survived all the reviews and two

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:08.900
and a half years later
I was decorated.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:17.920
Hopefully, I don't know,
we'll know from your questions

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:23.900
because that's what's going to come
next after about one or two lines.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.320
So I'll give you a
break, give you a chance.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.460 position:56%
I joined the Medal of Honor Society.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:35.330
In 1973 there was almost
400 living recipients.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:43.790
I got to meet guys from World
War I, II, the Interim, Korea.

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:48.870
All the people in this
book I've known.

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:51.200
It's kind of neat.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.500
It's personal.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:56.350
But it's all after Vietnam.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:33:03.140
That the book was published
is a dream come true,

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:11.020
that we can recognize people like
Jencie Fagan is a dream come true.

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:14.200
It's something we've wanted to do.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.980
We've worked hard to do.

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:20.920
With the help of a lot of other
people, we can make it happen.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:27.880
And we hope that you pay attention.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:34.530
A lot of people trying to
get you to pay attention.

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.400
I know that.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.880
And this is one way we hope
we get a sound bite in.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.270
Do you have any questions?

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:47.060
Yes ma'am.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.260
Yeah, you get to practice
using the microphone.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.480
Say your name.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.140
&gt;&gt; My name is Cassandra
[assumed spelling].

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:05.130
And the first thing that you said
was you considered as recipients.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.430
Why?

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:11.230
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: This
happens to me.

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:13.340
That's a good question.

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.910
I didn't volunteer for this award.

00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:20.950
I didn't put in an application.

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:28.370
As one of my colleagues and
you'll read about him in this book

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:34.780 position:56%
and it's Ron Rosser, he says what it
means to me is that the other people

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:41.440
that were with you had a difficult
time and when you see his video,

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:45.620
when he says that his voice
starts to quiver and break

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:49.000
because the emotions
are bubbling up.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.060
They thought you were worthy of it.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.620
I'm not sure that I am.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:01.600
And that's not a winner.

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:06.280
A winner is something that
you work hard to try to get.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.970
And I didn't work to get this.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.390
Did that answer the question?

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:17.690
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:18.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: Sort of?

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:20.290
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:21.590
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: It's okay.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.890
It's okay to have follow-up
questions but I'm sure some

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.190
of your other colleagues
would like to ask a question.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:40.730
Yes sir. Take the mike.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:42.470
You're going to have --

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:45.020
&gt;&gt; Why did you want
to come in the Army?

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.910
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: In
the Army or an officer?

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:49.210
&gt;&gt; Officer.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: Okay, in
those days there was a law

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:55.350
that said you get drafted.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.730
Every able-bodied male was going

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:04.150
to be drafted whether
you liked it or not.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:08.350
Most people don't like that at all.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.420
I was in college.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.610
I was flunking out of college.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.150
In fact, I did.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:21.390
Fifty years ago, I had
flunked out of college.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:28.400
And when I went back to
school, ROTC was available.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:33.890
If you were in ROTC, you
were deferred from the draft.

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:36.870
But you went in as a
commissioned officer.

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:40.750
And an officer is responsible
for everything

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:43.920
that his unit does and doesn't do.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.940
I wanted to find out
if I could do that.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:52.020
I wanted to find out if I
could get men to do something

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.860
that they didn't want to do
in a hostile environment.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.400
I didn't know if I'd like it.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:02.420
Didn't know if I would
thrive on that.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.140 position:56%
But wanted to know if I could do it.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:10.040
And those were my reasons
for going ROTC.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.340
Yes ma'am.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:23.440
No. You need the practice of
speaking into the microphone.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.410
I'm sorry.

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:30.430
Your colleagues have
to pass it to you.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:32.630
&gt;&gt; My name D'Kaya [phonetic].

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:38.630
When you served in the Army, did
it make you proud [inaudible]?

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:42.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: I'm
very proud of my service.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:48.620
I'm proud of the people I was with.

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:53.020 position:56%
They were from all over the country.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:58.970
And they were good soldiers.

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:03.140
And they wanted to come home and
they were willing to work together

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.970
to come home rather
than by themselves.

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:17.130
I wouldn't -- It's one of those
things that you don't want people

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:19.480
to have to go in the Army.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.310
You don't want war.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:28.640
But if you have to, it seems
like almost every generation

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:33.060
in our country has had to.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:38.870
It's kind of like learning what to
do when there's a weapon in school.

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:40.540
It's not what you want.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.490
It's not what you like.

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:47.590
But it's an ugly reality of
what you have to life with.

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:49.890
And --

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.440
I'm perfectly willing to
come back to you but I want

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.570
to see somebody else get
their questions in too.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:06.930
Follow-up question?

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:13.010
&gt;&gt; Did you have any family members
when you was in the Army, well,

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:15.030
like, was you married back then?

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:18.400
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: Okay,
no, I was not married.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.070
My father is an Air Force officer.

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:24.560
And I grew up in the Air Force.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.220
Let him have it first.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.030
&gt;&gt; My name Isaiah.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:38.100
And what it is like
to be in the Army?

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.850
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: When
you're in the Army,

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:44.660
you go where the Army wants
you to go, first of all.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:50.640
I got very used to living
out of a duffle bag.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.910
Everything I owned and needed
was in a small suitcase.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.770
You only need three
pair of underwear.

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:06.870 position:56%
One that you got on, one that's
clean and one that's in the laundry.

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:14.480
You quickly learn it's
nice to have a fourth,

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.790
just in case the laundry
doesn't work.

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:21.630
Same with your uniform.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:27.460
Two pairs of boots, one that
you've got on, one that's resting

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:31.870
and you switch off every day.

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:36.770
The first thing you do
is you brush your teeth.

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:39.530 position:56%
Then you wash the rest of your body,

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:41.970
depending on how much
water you have.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:49.490 position:56%
Of course, you're training to do the
one thing that we don't want to do

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:53.030
as humans and that's
hurt somebody else.

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:57.700
It goes against every
grain in your body.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.610
But that's what you're
training to do.

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:04.400
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Brian, I
have a question for you.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.320
In reading this book,
one of the points I got

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:14.670
of it was the universality
of certain characteristics

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:20.210
of both outstanding military
soldiers who were recipients

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:22.990
of the medal and citizens

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:26.730
who received the honor
medal from the Society.

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:29.910
So I wondered if you could
talk a bit about some

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:36.090
of these important characteristics
about courage that are applicable

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:42.990
to everyone, including our
students from L Pine School.

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:45.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: I'll try.

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:50.010
The enemy is selfishness.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:42:01.230
The enemy is me, I, and thinking
that the world revolves around me,

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:04.400
and accepting the reality
that it doesn't,

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:11.130
that there's something bigger
than you, more important than you,

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:17.870
and that you can get along a whole
lot better if you think that way.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:25.380
The most -- One of the
most fundamental instincts

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:30.900
that we all have is self
preservation and I want me

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:37.530
to be saved first as opposed
to me being saved last.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:43.170
If you make me saved first,
you're going to have regrets

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:45.470
for the rest of your life.

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:56.610
Even though it may be more
difficult in the short run

00:42:56.610 --> 00:43:02.970
to say save me last,
if you are saved.

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:07.980
You don't wonder, could
I have done more.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:13.620
What about if I'd only
done this, then maybe one

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:17.100
or two more would've made it.

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:20.920
I still think about the men I lost.

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.500
Is there anything that we
could've done differently.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:29.330
And at the end of the day,
no, we were going to have two

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:35.240 position:56%
or three people on duty that morning
that were going to be fully armed,

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:40.780
loaded, letting the rest of us
catch a few Z's, a few more Z's.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:44.580
And that when the attack
came, they were the ones

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.880
that were going to be on the line.

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.260
And I lost them very early.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:56.190
I can't change that.

00:43:56.190 --> 00:44:01.560
The others, yeah, we could've
tried to bug out early

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.970
and we would've all, none of us
would be here to talk about it.

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:16.210
In all of the stories in
there, it's an individual

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:21.590
who was putting other
people ahead of themselves

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:26.590
and it makes a difference
whether it be Jencie

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:29.220
or Dr. Cox [assumed
spelling] who was the doctor

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:32.050
from the Doctors Without Borders.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.880
There are other individuals that
eventually their stories will get

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.530
in to print and will
be added to that.

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:48.970
I'm thinking of one detective up
in Philadelphia that got a medal

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:54.210
from the 8-year-old that he
saved in the river that day.

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:56.920
That award means more
to him than ours.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:00.540
And that's the difference
that he made on that day.

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:12.970
You had another question.

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:21.490
&gt;&gt; What is the --

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:33.150
I forgot.

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:36.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: It'll
come back to you.

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:38.870
That was a dirty trick
to play on you.

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:47.610
Yes sir.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.470
&gt;&gt; So my question is
what was it like --

00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:55.940 position:56%
What was your experience like coming
out of the military [inaudible]?

00:45:55.940 --> 00:46:00.230
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: My whole
experience, even in Vietnam, was,

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:04.620
when I reflect on it, not normal.

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:11.820
But when I came home, I came
home to a military base,

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:17.710
where everybody there had
already returned home.

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:22.060
So from startle response was
everyone knew what it was.

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:24.160
We all laughed about it.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.590
And it's okay.

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:28.090
We've all done that.

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:30.630
We still are jumpy.

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:34.060
Anything else going on and
they talk to you about it.

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:38.610
And instead of being
different, I was with people

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:42.970
who were the same and
they understood.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:54.880
I was in a state that was pro
military, the state of Hawaii,

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:59.790
not one that you would
expect would be pro military

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:03.450
but the state is very pro military.

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:07.830
As a people, they are very
pleased and proud and be Americans

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:10.280
and they understand
that that Navy base

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.790
at Pearl Harbor has a
lot to do with that.

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:19.730
And they're very proud of now
it's their grandfather who served

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:26.750
in the 442 or the 100th

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:31.010
in the Japanese regiments
that fought in Europe.

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:35.350
They fought for their citizenship.

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:38.450
And they're very proud of it.

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:42.970
So I was in a friendly,
understanding environment.

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:50.490
And by the time I got to
graduate school in '73,

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:54.350
my own generation was getting
over that and we were trying

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:59.920
to get back together again.

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:03.110
Eventually we'll heal.

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:06.200
That's work in progress.

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.730
Yes ma'am.

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:09.310
You remembered?

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:17.840
&gt;&gt; What is the ITC,
NTC, ITC, I don't know?

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.260
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: ITC?

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.560
&gt;&gt; ROTC.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: ROTC?

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:26.630
Okay. It's Reserve
Officers Training Corps.

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:33.340
It's a military school
command structure

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:37.860
that helps college
students become officers.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.870
In many colleges it's a
minor in military science.

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:45.830
You'll find it in the
department of social studies.

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:47.130
You're done?

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:49.430
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:55.090
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: Yes ma'am.

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:57.690
&gt;&gt; I was going to ask a similar
question [inaudible] does have ROTC

00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:59.060
for high school students

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:03.690
and our building actually
shares the [inaudible] building

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:06.180
with the ROTC headquarters.

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:09.720
They're in our middle school.

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:15.200
And so I know our kids see it a lot

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:22.200
and they're not sure what
exactly the ROTC wing is about.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:28.460
And so I was just wondering if you
got any advice for them or any sort

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:32.950
of decision-making advice when it
comes, when they get in high school

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:36.980
and they have the opportunity
to join ROTC?

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:39.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: When
I was in sixth grade,

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:42.510
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:48.390
It wasn't until eighth grade that I
even realized that I wanted to fly.

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:50.340
Still do. I'm too blind
but in the back,

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:52.200
one of the things that's
driven a lot

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.960
of my decision making was
how do I become a pilot.

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:07.410
Junior ROTC in high school
is an interesting program.

00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:09.710
It's not for everybody.

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:16.080
It's one that you need to
look at but it's a program

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:25.750
that gives you a sense of belonging
to something bigger than yourself.

00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:32.620
They do -- It is -- They do
have some discipline in it.

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:39.580
Like Jencie Fagan, the cadre
tend to have high expectations

00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:42.640
of the students that do it.

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:47.910
So if you're -- Some
students in high school need

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:52.390
that for structure, for help.

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:58.070
Others don't and would
chafe at the regimentation.

00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:06.180
You have to first look in and learn
to know yourself, what do I need

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:14.680
and then will this help me
get to where I want to get.

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:20.070
I have to admit, in sixth grade
I wasn't thinking that way.

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:24.640
That would've been a stretch.

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:29.470
But by eighth grade,
it was -- I was very --

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:34.750 position:56%
I had some skill in the STEM side
of [inaudible], so I kind of pointed

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:42.280
that way as preparation
for being a pilot.

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:46.010
Somebody waiving their
hand with another question?

00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:47.310
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:49.610
Yes ma'am.

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:55.820
&gt;&gt; My name is Oshay [phonetic] and
I wonder who was your inspiration

00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.120
when you went to the Army?

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:06.670
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: When I was young,
my parents, my dad in particular,

00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:10.990
was my mentor, was who inspired me.

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:16.590
As I've gotten older
and older and older,

00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:28.950
I look at a couple of middle school
teachers, junior high teachers

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:38.510
who had high expectations
for their students,

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:47.910
were strict about your behavior
in class, Miss [inaudible]

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:53.650 position:56%
in eighth grade was the first one
to give me leadership responsibility

00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:57.510
on the fire patrol and
later on the safety patrol.

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:06.360 position:56%
Somebody has to tell you that along
the way and identify it and point it

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:14.000 position:56%
out to your parents that this one
has potential in the following area.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.830
I can see it already.

00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:23.790
Miss Hall in Montgomery, Alabama,
ninth grade Latin teacher,

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:29.310
taught us more English in that
Latin class and taught us more

00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:34.720
about English in that
Latin class than we had had

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:40.520
in our English teacher but
she was an experienced teacher

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.440
and could do that.

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:48.030
It was not fair to ask a first-year
teacher who was an art major

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:50.570
to teach ninth graders English.

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:56.260
But Miss Hall had no
problem teaching English,

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:58.010
Latin, any of the courses.

00:53:58.010 --> 00:54:01.590
I think she could've taught
any class in that middle school

00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:03.440
at the ninth grade level.

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.740
She was that good.

00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:09.410
&gt;&gt; Brain, can I ask a question.

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:10.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: Yes sir.

00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:15.060
&gt;&gt; My name is [inaudible]
and my question is

00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:22.370
that what was your most favorite
thing when you was in the Army?

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:23.980
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: You asked
what's the most favorite thing

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:25.280
when I was in the Army.

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:40.060
Well, it was usually Saturday
night but we weren't on duty then.

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:48.200 position:56%
When I was on duty and doing my job,
I really liked and analyzed things.

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:52.220
I liked to say -- I liked to look
at the terrain and ask the question

00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:58.520
if I were the enemy,
where would I be.

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:00.810
And try to figure that out.

00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:07.880
And if you can do that, then
you can defend yourself better.

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:16.920
I liked to make organizations work.

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:21.800
And later on that became favorite.

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:28.630
But in the beginning, it was
down in the weeds doing the math,

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:31.990
doing the calculations, thinking

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:34.660
about what the enemy
was trying to do to us.

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:35.960
Yes sir.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:42.890
&gt;&gt; My name Isaiah and what was
the most important thing that --

00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:45.610
What was the most important
thing that you had

00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:49.540
to learn during the Army?

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:52.120
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: Ask for help.

00:55:54.270 --> 00:56:00.110
The question was what was the
most important thing that I had

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:04.670
to learn to do in the Army.

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:10.970 position:56%
Well, you walk in as this brand new
second lieutenant and every sergeant

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:17.660 position:56%
in the unit has been there and knows
more about their job than you do.

00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:22.330
Your job isn't to tell
them how to do their job.

00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:26.620
As a lieutenant, you have to
learn can they do their job,

00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:30.140
do they do it well,
can they do their job

00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:35.040
without messing somebody else up
because it doesn't do any good

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:38.290 position:56%
to do your job if you've made
somebody else's life more difficult.

00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:41.930
You had to learn to
ask them for help.

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:47.750
You had to learn to ask
the question, serg, chief,

00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:53.190
is this is a sergeant problem
or is this an officer problem.

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:56.540 position:56%
Inevitably, the sergeant said,
well, let me take a look at it first

00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:59.140
and if I can't handle it,
it's an officer problem.

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:08.550
And, you know, only one or two
times did I ever get a problem.

00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:14.100
But learning that and learning
how to make that work for you,

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:15.460
that was all after school.

00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:17.180
That was on-the-job training.

00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:19.810
Yes sir. Thank you.

00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:21.370
&gt;&gt; I know you guys have leave.

00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:29.480
And when you are on leave, what
did you do for fun or [inaudible]?

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:33.330
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: The unit
I was in, in Vietnam chose

00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:39.770
to let their officers have leave,
R&amp;R, after 11 months in country.

00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:48.510 position:56%
I never got to 11 months in country.

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:52.030
So I don't know.

00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:54.840
Your choice was go to Bangkok,

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:58.530
see an incredible culture
that's very different from ours.

00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:02.760
Go to Australia, see an English
speaking culture that's very

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:04.220
different from ours.

00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:08.980 position:56%
Go to Hong Kong, get a suit made
that's going to be too small for you

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:11.500
because when you get home
you're going to put on weight.

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:18.900
I don't know where
I was going to go.

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:28.380
With an older audience, I would say
what that did was in that battalion

00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:33.200
after you went on R&amp;R,
you were given light duty

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.900
and you were never
sent back to the field.

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:39.400
And then you went home.

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:43.400
So that was the mindset
about the command decision

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:48.380
about not giving R&amp;R
midway in between.

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:51.620
It was a command decision
and it was for the good

00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:58.550
of the battalion, not
immediately obvious.

00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:05.820
I think people are getting
antsy, just a little.

00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:08.440
Are there some more questions?

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:10.510
Yes ma'am.

00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:17.400
&gt;&gt; Okay, I asked the same question.

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:22.260
What was the funniest thing
that you have [inaudible]?

00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:26.290
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: Funniest thing?

00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:35.080
The funniest thing that happened
to me in the Army was when you pull

00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:43.810
in to a firing site and the
XO, the officer in charge,

00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:51.480
has to point the direction that he
wants the artillery tubes to point.

00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:56.260
The first time that I pulled the
firing battery into a firing point

00:59:56.260 --> 01:00:02.360
and wanted them to align on the
direction, I went like this.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:08.130
And the chief sergeant said, sir,
which way do you want the tubes

01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:11.710
to point, this way or this way?

01:00:17.290 --> 01:00:24.550
He needed to know from me which
way and I didn't give it to him.

01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:27.680
I just gave him an
azimuth direction.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:32.370
I didn't point him in
the right direction.

01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:38.780
It was a learning experience for
me but I was also the subject

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:45.950 position:56%
of laughter that evening in the BOQ,
where all the officers were sleeping

01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:49.410
in the same room, dorm style.

01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:55.880
Everybody in the battalion learned
that you point this way, this way,

01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:00.710
this way, but don't do it this way.

01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:04.560
And I was the butt of
the joke for a night.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.940
Yes sir?

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:08.020
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.520
&gt;&gt; My name is Mawqua [phonetic]

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:14.660
and what is your favorite weapon
while you were in the war?

01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:19.130
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: What
was my favorite weapon?

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:24.240
My favorite weapon was
one that I didn't have.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:29.800
An artillery piece in those
days was an eight-inch howitzer.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.950
It's big. It's mean.

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:37.820
When it hits somebody, it
really kicks your butt.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:42.020
But it's very accurate
for a weapon that big.

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:52.930
And that was the weapon I needed
most the day of the action.

01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:57.200
I would've loved to have been
on the wrong end of that weapon

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.660
because it would've missed me by --

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:01.850
If I had asked it to
miss me by 50 meters,

01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:03.490
it would've missed me by 50 meters.

01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:06.480
If I had asked it to
miss me by 10 meters,

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.340
it would've missed me by 10 meters.

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:11.990
That weapon is that good.

01:02:13.090 --> 01:02:15.960
And that's what I needed
and I didn't have it.

01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:22.960
It's not the answer you
were expecting, I'll bet.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.130
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Okay,
well thank you so much.

01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:29.850
You want to give Brian a
round of applause [applause].

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:35.320
&gt;&gt; Brian Thacker: Thank you.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.660

of the Library of Congress.
