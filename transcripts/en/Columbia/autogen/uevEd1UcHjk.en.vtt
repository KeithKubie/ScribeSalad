within the state for the state to be

01:01:57.330 --> 01:01:57.340
within the state for the state to be
 

01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:59.520
within the state for the state to be
sort of critiquing itself and and I

01:01:59.520 --> 01:01:59.530
sort of critiquing itself and and I
 

01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:01.860
sort of critiquing itself and and I
thought this was interesting because in

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:01.870
thought this was interesting because in
 

01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:03.600
thought this was interesting because in
some ways you know a democratic regime

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:03.610
some ways you know a democratic regime
 

01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:05.700
some ways you know a democratic regime
is one could see arguably specifically

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:05.710
is one could see arguably specifically
 

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:08.160
is one could see arguably specifically
that it's it's something which has

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:08.170
that it's it's something which has
 

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:10.170
that it's it's something which has
co-opted the mechanisms of criticism

01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:10.180
co-opted the mechanisms of criticism
 

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:13.140
co-opted the mechanisms of criticism
from the outside into itself and I think

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:13.150
from the outside into itself and I think
 

01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:15.540
from the outside into itself and I think
this might be it's sort of funny I when

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:15.550
this might be it's sort of funny I when
 

01:02:15.550 --> 01:02:17.010
this might be it's sort of funny I when
I was reading your paper initially I was

01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:17.020
I was reading your paper initially I was
 

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:18.180
I was reading your paper initially I was
thinking too that there's some

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:18.190
thinking too that there's some
 

01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:20.070
thinking too that there's some
difference between thompson this is an

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:20.080
difference between thompson this is an
 

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.450
difference between thompson this is an
american where there's been a continuity

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:21.460
american where there's been a continuity
 

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.940
american where there's been a continuity
of a regime over you know 200-some years

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:23.950
of a regime over you know 200-some years
 

01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:26.160
of a regime over you know 200-some years
versus you know France were this the

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:26.170
versus you know France were this the
 

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:31.260
versus you know France were this the
succession of regimes but and there was

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:31.270
succession of regimes but and there was
 

01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:33.720
succession of regimes but and there was
this this detail you also brought up in

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:33.730
this this detail you also brought up in
 

01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:35.910
this this detail you also brought up in
your longer version of your paper about

01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920
your longer version of your paper about
 

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.360
your longer version of your paper about
the ducati a where you have this

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:39.370
the ducati a where you have this

mechanism of eggettes neighborhood watch
 

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.099
mechanism of eggettes neighborhood watch
is the what we have here

01:02:43.099 --> 01:02:43.109
is the what we have here
 

01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:46.099
is the what we have here
in English the where the state is

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:46.109
in English the where the state is
 

01:02:46.109 --> 01:02:48.650
in English the where the state is
relinquishing its own responsibilities

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:48.660
relinquishing its own responsibilities
 

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:51.470
relinquishing its own responsibilities
or you know of policing basically and

policing so it's it's actually and I
 

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:01.579

think you said this was brought about by

01:03:01.579 --> 01:03:01.589
think you said this was brought about by
 

01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:03.319
think you said this was brought about by
as a initially was brought about because

01:03:03.319 --> 01:03:03.329
as a initially was brought about because
 

01:03:03.329 --> 01:03:05.239
as a initially was brought about because
there was 40 cab state power citizens

01:03:05.239 --> 01:03:05.249
there was 40 cab state power citizens
 

01:03:05.249 --> 01:03:06.739
there was 40 cab state power citizens
wanting to assume more control with the

01:03:06.739 --> 01:03:06.749
wanting to assume more control with the
 

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:08.390
wanting to assume more control with the
good troll they're assuming is actually

01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400
good troll they're assuming is actually
 

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.249
good troll they're assuming is actually
the sort of control the state would be

01:03:10.249 --> 01:03:10.259
the sort of control the state would be
 

01:03:10.259 --> 01:03:12.380
the sort of control the state would be
assuming anyway it seems well though

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:12.390
assuming anyway it seems well though
 

01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:14.900
assuming anyway it seems well though
there might have been a difference and

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:14.910
there might have been a difference and
 

01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:16.789
there might have been a difference and
this question you raised then and that

01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799
this question you raised then and that
 

01:03:16.799 --> 01:03:18.799
this question you raised then and that
your conclusion that your quote from

01:03:18.799 --> 01:03:18.809
your conclusion that your quote from
 

01:03:18.809 --> 01:03:22.519
your conclusion that your quote from
balt on ski about about art criticism

01:03:22.519 --> 01:03:22.529
balt on ski about about art criticism
 

01:03:22.529 --> 01:03:25.940
balt on ski about about art criticism
and how that operates within the

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:25.950
and how that operates within the
 

01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:30.289
and how that operates within the
neoliberal state and in contrast of

01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:30.299
neoliberal state and in contrast of
 

01:03:30.299 --> 01:03:33.349
neoliberal state and in contrast of
political criticism I'd be tested

01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359
political criticism I'd be tested
 

01:03:33.359 --> 01:03:34.700
political criticism I'd be tested
whether you see that as sort of working

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:34.710
whether you see that as sort of working
 

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:37.519
whether you see that as sort of working
as in a collaborative way with power

01:03:37.519 --> 01:03:37.529
as in a collaborative way with power
 

01:03:37.529 --> 01:03:39.979
as in a collaborative way with power
then I mean you should you sort of raise

01:03:39.979 --> 01:03:39.989
then I mean you should you sort of raise
 

01:03:39.989 --> 01:03:44.319
then I mean you should you sort of raise
this question yourself I think and so

01:03:44.319 --> 01:03:44.329
this question yourself I think and so
 

01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:49.460
this question yourself I think and so
then with a Sylvia's paper it's very

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:49.470
then with a Sylvia's paper it's very
 

01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:50.630
then with a Sylvia's paper it's very
interesting because it first you

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640
interesting because it first you
 

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:54.140
interesting because it first you
mentioned how vardi made the decision

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:54.150
mentioned how vardi made the decision
 

01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:56.630
mentioned how vardi made the decision
not to join the Communist Party for for

01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640
not to join the Communist Party for for
 

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.940
not to join the Communist Party for for
various reasons and one can't help but

01:03:58.940 --> 01:03:58.950
various reasons and one can't help but
 

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:00.289
various reasons and one can't help but
wonder because she's although she's

01:04:00.289 --> 01:04:00.299
wonder because she's although she's
 

01:04:00.299 --> 01:04:04.220
wonder because she's although she's
working you know from the left it also

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:04.230
working you know from the left it also
 

01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:05.630
working you know from the left it also
seems that she's working within state

01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640
seems that she's working within state
 

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.279
seems that she's working within state
apparatus is like the institutions of

01:04:07.279 --> 01:04:07.289
apparatus is like the institutions of
 

01:04:07.289 --> 01:04:08.989
apparatus is like the institutions of
museum institutions of public education

01:04:08.989 --> 01:04:08.999
museum institutions of public education
 

01:04:08.999 --> 01:04:11.299
museum institutions of public education
and so she's very much working within

01:04:11.299 --> 01:04:11.309
and so she's very much working within
 

01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:13.069
and so she's very much working within
the system but with a kind of different

01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079
the system but with a kind of different
 

01:04:13.079 --> 01:04:16.279
the system but with a kind of different
agenda perhaps and yet then it comes out

01:04:16.279 --> 01:04:16.289
agenda perhaps and yet then it comes out
 

01:04:16.289 --> 01:04:17.839
agenda perhaps and yet then it comes out
at the end that she actually resigns

01:04:17.839 --> 01:04:17.849
at the end that she actually resigns
 

01:04:17.849 --> 01:04:19.609
at the end that she actually resigns
from these positions because of a

01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619
from these positions because of a
 

01:04:19.619 --> 01:04:25.999
from these positions because of a
political difference so so I guess I'd

01:04:25.999 --> 01:04:26.009
political difference so so I guess I'd
 

01:04:26.009 --> 01:04:30.829
political difference so so I guess I'd
just like to see how to what extent he

01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:30.839
just like to see how to what extent he
 

01:04:30.839 --> 01:04:32.390
just like to see how to what extent he
saw that she could actually work within

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400
saw that she could actually work within
 

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.680
saw that she could actually work within
the state like what were the limit of

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:33.690
the state like what were the limit of
 

01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:35.269
the state like what were the limit of
that lower the limits of collaboration

01:04:35.269 --> 01:04:35.279
that lower the limits of collaboration
 

01:04:35.279 --> 01:04:39.170
that lower the limits of collaboration
in that situation finally with

01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:39.180
in that situation finally with
 

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:43.430
in that situation finally with
Francesca's paper um I think in some

01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440
Francesca's paper um I think in some
 

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.529
Francesca's paper um I think in some
ways you hadn't necessarily raised the

01:04:45.529 --> 01:04:45.539
ways you hadn't necessarily raised the
 

01:04:45.539 --> 01:04:47.989
ways you hadn't necessarily raised the
so explicitly this idea of the critique

01:04:47.989 --> 01:04:47.999
so explicitly this idea of the critique
 

01:04:47.999 --> 01:04:49.539
so explicitly this idea of the critique
of the state and in some ways maybe were

01:04:49.539 --> 01:04:49.549
of the state and in some ways maybe were
 

01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:51.890
of the state and in some ways maybe were
imposing this on you because of the

01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:51.900
imposing this on you because of the
 

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:53.350
imposing this on you because of the
panel's topic but

01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:53.360
panel's topic but
 

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:58.740
panel's topic but
so but I think it's interesting because

01:04:58.740 --> 01:04:58.750
so but I think it's interesting because
 

01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:02.080
so but I think it's interesting because
it seems like the definitive plan would

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:02.090
it seems like the definitive plan would
 

01:05:02.090 --> 01:05:04.810
it seems like the definitive plan would
be the perfect plan for a neoliberal

01:05:04.810 --> 01:05:04.820
be the perfect plan for a neoliberal
 

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:07.870
be the perfect plan for a neoliberal
state and in that and yet the state was

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:07.880
state and in that and yet the state was
 

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:13.030
state and in that and yet the state was
the one who rejected it and and I be

01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:13.040
the one who rejected it and and I be
 

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.260
the one who rejected it and and I be
interested to hear a little bit more

01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:14.270
interested to hear a little bit more
 

01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:16.630
interested to hear a little bit more
than about like these practices of

01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640
than about like these practices of
 

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.430
than about like these practices of
mapping and the ideas of sort of you

01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.440
mapping and the ideas of sort of you
 

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:19.510
mapping and the ideas of sort of you
could see this in some ways at the

01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520
could see this in some ways at the
 

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.820
could see this in some ways at the
actual perfect architectural realization

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:21.830
actual perfect architectural realization
 

01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:24.190
actual perfect architectural realization
of a more abstract concept of

01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:24.200
of a more abstract concept of
 

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.820
of a more abstract concept of
collaboration you know versus critique

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:27.830
collaboration you know versus critique
 

01:05:27.830 --> 01:05:31.750
collaboration you know versus critique
and so far as the very specific ways and

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760
and so far as the very specific ways and
 

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.610
and so far as the very specific ways and
use the word transplant i think but is

01:05:33.610 --> 01:05:33.620
use the word transplant i think but is
 

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.130
use the word transplant i think but is
it actually very specific ways in which

01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:35.140
it actually very specific ways in which
 

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.960
it actually very specific ways in which
definity is saying what should remain

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:37.970
definity is saying what should remain
 

01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:40.540
definity is saying what should remain
and what should you know what should be

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:40.550
and what should you know what should be
 

01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:42.720
and what should you know what should be
changed and there's so much it's very

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:42.730
changed and there's so much it's very
 

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:45.040
changed and there's so much it's very
it's he's going down to the small

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:45.050
it's he's going down to the small
 

01:05:45.050 --> 01:05:46.810
it's he's going down to the small
details of that in a way that sort of

critique but is that to open my would
 

01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:42.720

like I'm not sure I could so yeah

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:42.730
 

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:46.210
perhaps one thing i can see that i can

01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:46.220
perhaps one thing i can see that i can
 

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:48.550
perhaps one thing i can see that i can
say that it seemed actually really

01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:48.560
say that it seemed actually really
 

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.020
say that it seemed actually really
really powered

01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:50.030
really powered
 

01:06:50.030 --> 01:06:53.680
really powered
as you say because these social

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:53.690
as you say because these social
 

01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:58.720
as you say because these social
movements actually expressed some

01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:58.730
movements actually expressed some
 

01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:03.340
movements actually expressed some
protest and like they were fighting

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:03.350

01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:06.610
protest and like they were fighting
against that clear with Lazio I just

01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:06.620
against that clear with Lazio I just
 

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:08.830
against that clear with Lazio I just
explained against instead but when we

01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:08.840
explained against instead but when we
 

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:12.790
explained against instead but when we
when we look at more precisely it seems

01:07:12.790 --> 01:07:12.800
when we look at more precisely it seems
 

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.440
when we look at more precisely it seems
like more it appears like more

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:16.450
like more it appears like more
 

01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:20.440
like more it appears like more
collaboration and I think that this way

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:20.450
collaboration and I think that this way
 

01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:24.930
collaboration and I think that this way
of explaining explaining this process of

01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:24.940
of explaining explaining this process of
 

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:27.280
of explaining explaining this process of
fighting states at social criticism

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:27.290

probably it can be on appetizers is

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:33.260
probably it can be on appetizers is

probably it can be on appetizers is
probably a vision that was inherited

01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:36.260
probably a vision that was inherited
 

01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:42.460
probably a vision that was inherited
from this period itself so actually it

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:42.470
from this period itself so actually it
 

01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:46.120
from this period itself so actually it
as if it was a main story to express

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:46.130
as if it was a main story to express
 

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:50.230
as if it was a main story to express
this process that helps probably to

01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240
this process that helps probably to
 

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:55.030
this process that helps probably to
construct the social criticism I can

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:55.040

with my English because it's hard to
 

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:09.660
with my English because it's hard to
explain these things in English for me

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:09.670
 

01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:13.420
yeah what can I say also

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:13.430
