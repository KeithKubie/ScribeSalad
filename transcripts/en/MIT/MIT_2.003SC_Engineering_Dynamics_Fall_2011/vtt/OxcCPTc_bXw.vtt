00:00:21.343 --> 00:00:22.218
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:22.218 --> 00:00:25.270
I'm a little slow
getting started today,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.100
better get going.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:38.590
What we're going to talk
about today is a technique--

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.130
you guys done?

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.550
OK, thanks.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.760
We're going to talk about
today a technique known

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.840
as modal analysis,
and it's a way

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.290
of analyzing things that
vibrate, essentially thinking

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.860
about them one mode and a time.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.220
Though you might not
make a lot of use

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.280
of the actual calculations,
doing the math,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.959
throughout your careers, I
think if you understand it

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:09.370
conceptually it'll help
you just have a better

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.170
understanding of what
vibration is all about,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.640
just give you some insight
to it that you otherwise

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.480
wouldn't have.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.960
So the basic concept is
that you can model just

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.080
about any structural
vibration as the summation

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.970
of the individual
contributions of each

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.370
what we call natural mode.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.440
So what we mean
by that is, let's

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.800
start by thinking--
actually, let

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.150
me say that this applies
to both continuous systems

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.010
like vibrating strings or
beams or buildings as it

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.510
does to finite degree of
freedom rigid body systems.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.450
We haven't talked about
continuous systems.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.060
I'll do a lecture on
it as the last lecture

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.230
of the term, just kind of an
enrichment sort of lecture.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.590
But everything I say about
finite degree of freedom

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.360
systems can be extended
to continuous systems.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.610
But since we've been studying
rigid bodies and systems

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.270
with finite numbers
of degrees of freedom,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.430
I'll explain-- I'll go
through this analysis

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.330
in the context of rigid body
finite degree of freedom

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.700
systems.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.020
So in general, we can write
the equations of motion

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.380
for finite degree of freedom
systems as a mass matrix.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.020
And to keep the kind
of writing down,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.080
I'm just going to underline
matrices and a squiggle

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.525
under vectors so we have them.

00:02:36.525 --> 00:02:39.300
In general, we can write
the equations of motion

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.880
as a mass matrix times
an acceleration vector

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.030
plus a damping matrix
times a velocity vector,

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.430
stiffness matrix times
a displacement vector,

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.970
all equal to some external
vector of excitations.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.100
And I'm writing these as
if these are translations,

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.570
but you know, like from doing
the pendulum on the cart

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.860
problem, that the
equations of motion

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.700
might involve rotations
and displacements.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.250
And we let them-- they mix
together here however they

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.440
fall out.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.000
But just to write
them symbolically,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.990
I'm just going to refer to
all of those coordinates

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.650
with an x vector.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.880
OK, now the basic
premise of modal analysis

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:43.825
is a thing called the
modal expansion theorem.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.330
It's basically the
assertion that you

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.460
can represent any
motion set of vectors--

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:03.420
I'll write them kind of as a
vector here for a moment-- x,

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.270
as the superposition of
each contributing mode.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.100
Now each mode has
a mode shape to it,

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.490
which I'm going to call
u, and up here I'll

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.315
put a superscript
for what mode it

00:04:21.315 --> 00:04:27.980
is, the first mode, times
its time-dependent behavior.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.010
And this is called, what
they call in textbooks,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.700
the natural coordinates.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.430
And we'll see what
those are in a second.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.640
So mode shape one.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.430
This is the time-dependent
and amplitude part

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.630
that says how much the
contribution of mode one

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.000
is to this motion and what its
time dependence is, this is.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.200
And then you'd have mode
two's contribution, q2.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:10.000
And this goes out to the nth
mode's contribution, qn of t.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.150
And that's the
proposition, that you

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.300
can represent the total
response of the system

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.230
as a superposition of
the response of each

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.250
of the natural
modes of the system.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.790
And if it's an n degree
of freedom system,

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.590
there will be n
natural modes, so.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.710
Now something I didn't say here.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.250
This all assumes that
the system vibrates.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.820
So this is all in the
discussion of things

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.160
that exhibit vibratory motion.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:08.243
So this is all, it should say
here, of vibrating systems, OK?

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.190
So this kind of a long
and cumbersome way

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.830
of writing this out.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.475
So if you notice, each one of
these is the mode shape vector.

00:06:24.475 --> 00:06:31.010
And if I put them together in
a matrix just side by side,

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:41.920
here's a u1 over to un and
multiply it by this vector,

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.815
q1 of t down to qn.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.800
That's the same
statement but said

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.670
in a much more compact way.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.070
So this statement, this
modal expansion theorem,

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.230
basically says the
vector of-- these

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:09.720
are your generalized
coordinates, which

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.269
we've been using all term long.

00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:12.810
These are the
generalized coordinates

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.820
that you choose to derive the
equations of motion around.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.300
The vector of
generalized coordinates

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.320
can be written as uq.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:32.190
And these are often called
the modal coordinates

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:40.450
or sometimes called the
natural coordinates, OK?

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:58.820
So if we can say that
x is uq, then x dot,

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.260
you take the derivative of
each one of those expressions.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:07.450
You'll find that's
going to be uq dot.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:12.800
And x double dot
equals uq double

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.000
dot because these
are just constants.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.270
The mode shape vectors are
just a fixed set of numbers

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.620
that represent the mode
shape to the system.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:27.132
Now just to-- I think maybe
this is a good time to do this.

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:28.070
You grab one end.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.960
So this is a-- and it's hard
to see black against black.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.919
My apologies for that.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:42.770
So this is a guitar string
or any stringed instrument.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:48.200
In fact, any long, slender thing
under tension will vibrate.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.620
And it has, if I
do this carefully,

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.290
that's called the first
mode of vibration.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.240
And that's when you pluck
your guitar string or violin

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.060
in the middle.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.280
You mostly hear that.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:09.300
But at twice the frequency,
if I can get it going here,

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.400
there's a second
mode of vibration.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.460
And for a taut
string, it happens

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.900
to be at twice the
frequency of the first.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.530
And if my hand is
well calibrated--

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.060
it may be easier if it's
a little longer-- if I

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:32.580
get this going right,
there's a third mode, OK?

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:38.020
So that's what
we're calling-- oh,

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.660
what I meant to say
when I was doing

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.070
this is these shapes for
the vibrating string,

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.933
that second mode shape happens
to be one full sine wave.

00:09:47.933 --> 00:09:54.160
And the mode shape has the
form sine n pi x over l,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.290
where l's the length
of the string.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:58.430
n's the mode number.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:59.540
So first mode.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.060
Second mode is
this, when n is 2.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.530
First mode, n is 1.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.300
nth mode or something high,
you get higher modes like that.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.780
So these are the mode shapes
for a vibrating string.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:15.930
That's good for now.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:23.114
This two degree of freedom
system with the two lump

00:10:23.114 --> 00:10:24.530
masses-- and it's
going to show up

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:28.570
there, yeah-- this is
basically two lump masses.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.960
And we idealize the
springs as being massless,

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.610
but it's a pretty
good approximation.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.920
This has two modes of vibration.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:46.060
And Professor Gossard made
these neat little things that

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.810
can make it so-- and I'm
going to come back to this,

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.130
but there's mode one.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.160
And the mode shape
is as this goes down

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.310
one unit, that goes down
about two times as much.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.340
I'll give you the exact
numbers in a minute.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:10.504
And the other mode
shape of the system--

00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:12.920
we're going to talk about this
today and why this happens.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.010
But if I give it the
right initial conditions,

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.360
I can make it vibrate only
in the second mode shape.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.780
And so it's now deflected
with the right conditions

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.922
so that it'll respond
only in second mode.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.190
This mass goes up
and down a lot.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.130
That mass goes up in that
little, opposite to it,

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.710
actually.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.420
The frequency is
different from the first.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.640
But if this is moving one
unit, then this down here

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.220
is moving minus 0.3 or
something like that.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.740
And that ratio is constant.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.660
And that's called
the mode shape.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.740
So if you just pick one of them
and say, let its motion be one,

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.090
then all of the other
masses in the system

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:56.760
will move in a particular
ratio to the motion of that one

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.830
that you arbitrarily set to one.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.620
So this is what we
mean by mode shapes

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.150
and their natural frequencies.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.900
There's the natural
frequency associated

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.030
with that first mode.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.360
And we can solve these
things mathematically,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.499
and we've been doing
that a little bit

00:12:11.499 --> 00:12:12.790
in the last couple of lectures.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.040
All right.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.670
So this is the relationship
between these things,

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.200
the generalized coordinates
and the modal coordinates.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:34.140
And we now need to see how
we're going to use these.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.710
So in general, we have
our equations of motion.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:01.310
And I'm going to
substitute for x, x dot,

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:27.870
and x double dot, these and
pre multiply by u transpose.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.545
Remember the
transpose of a matrix.

00:13:29.545 --> 00:13:32.410
You just take the first
column, make it the first row.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.580
Second column, make
it the second row.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.540
So if I plug in
these up here, I get

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:47.213
muq-- I'm going to
leave some space here

00:13:47.213 --> 00:13:55.980
because I'm going to pre
multiply in a second-- plus cuq

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:10.740
dot plus kuq equals the
external exciting forces.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:25.150
Now I'm going to pre
multiply by u transpose, OK?

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:30.300
Now a remarkable thing happens.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:35.350
It happens that when you do this
calculation, when you multiply

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:39.640
this matrix times that,
one row at a time-- so this

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.430
has vectors in it, 1 through n.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.860
I'm going to pick
vector r, the rth one.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:49.160
If I take that rth vector
and multiply it one

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.700
at a time by row by
row by row, then I

00:14:53.700 --> 00:15:00.350
get a new vector
that results, which

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.240
I'm going to multiply by this.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.190
And so if I'm going to pick
out one of the vectors,

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:13.850
multiply it through
times one of the rows

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.290
here-- when you transpose them,
the rows are now the vectors.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.230
So I'm going to pick.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:26.640
If I do the calculation-- lost
my right piece of paper here.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:46.670
So I'm going to just pull
out one of the calculations

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:51.600
that you end up doing if you
do this whole triple matrix

00:15:51.600 --> 00:16:00.610
multiplication, you need
to know the following fact.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:04.280
So for the mode s
transpose-- that's one

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:10.410
of the rows out of
here-- times m times

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:17.340
one of the columns,
the rth one from here,

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:25.165
and I do this calculation,
this is 0 for r not equal to s.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:32.240
What that statement says is, the
only non-zero result from this

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.810
is when you multiply-- when you
take the rth column from here

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.380
and you use the rth from here.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.780
All the other combinations
of this thing go to 0.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.580
And the net result
of that is that this

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:53.820
implies that u
transpose mu always

00:16:53.820 --> 00:17:01.080
equals to a diagonal vector,
which I'll call this like that.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.590
Sometimes a mass matrix
is diagonal to start with.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.050
But even if it isn't,
you do this calculation,

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.310
it will produce a
diagonal matrix.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:12.680
And that's because these
multiplications are always

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.160
0 unless r is the same as s.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:23.619
And the same is true for u
transpose Ku will give you

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:31.090
a K matrix that is diagonal.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:32.640
And you know,
normally the stiffness

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.930
matrix we've come
up with, they've

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.330
generally been full
matrices oftentimes.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:42.640
But you do uKu, you will get
a diagonal stiffness matrix.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.430
And there the
little problem comes

00:17:48.430 --> 00:18:04.510
because u transpose cu, well,
sometimes, this one is diagonal

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:14.110
only for ideal
conditions of damping.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.205
So that's something you
just have to address.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.470
So only for ideal
conditions, and that's

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.250
just something you
have to deal with.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.720
So why is this?

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.720
Why is there this
special, wonderful thing?

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.050
The natural modes of
a system-- this one is

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:54.510
a two degree of freedom system--
form a complete and independent

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.430
set of vectors.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.810
And in this case of this two
degree of freedom system,

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:07.440
I can pick any kinematically
allowable position,

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:13.000
like this-- stationary, static
is one of the solutions,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.150
right, to this two degree
of freedom system--

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:19.720
so any possible allowable
position of these two things,

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.270
static or moving,
can be described

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:28.950
by a linear combination of
the mode shapes of the system,

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.041
a weighted sum of the
mode shapes of the system.

00:19:32.041 --> 00:19:33.040
And that's all it takes.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.990
So this one has two
mode shapes, one

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.050
that looks like
that, one that looks

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.490
like this one's going
down, this one's going up,

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:44.990
their particular ratios.

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:49.000
And I can take a weighted amount
of that first mode, so much

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
of it, and a weighted
amount of the second mode

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.500
and add them together and
describe any possible position

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.670
of the system.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.590
The same thing is
true of that string.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.790
It has mode shapes
that are sine waves,

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:08.100
but they're sine 1 pi x, sine
pi 2x, over and so forth.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.190
Any possible allowable
shape of that guitar string

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.980
can be made up of a
weighted sum of the mode

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.670
shapes of the system.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:19.940
And moreover, the mode
shapes, the reason

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:34.500
this works is because
the mode shapes

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.540
are orthogonal to one another.

00:20:45.812 --> 00:20:50.860
Now, you know that if you take
2 sine waves like that string

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.140
and you take first
mode sine pi x over l,

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.560
and second mode say
sine 2 pi x over l

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.984
and you multiply them
together and integrate from 0

00:20:59.984 --> 00:21:00.900
to l, what do you get?

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.950
You'll always get 0
if the two sines are--

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.530
if they're full wavelengths,
they go to nodes at the end,

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.890
you will always get 0 if the
wavelengths are different,

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.610
always, right?

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.510
That's a statement
of orthogonality

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.500
of sine functions.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.000
All right.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.958
The same thing is true
of these simple vectors.

00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:28.140
They are orthogonal
to one another such

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.940
that if you do this
multiplication,

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.930
you transpose mu, you
only get contributions

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:39.475
when you are using mode
r transpose m mode r.

00:21:39.475 --> 00:21:41.602
You only get a contribution
of each of those.

00:21:41.602 --> 00:21:42.810
That gives you the diagonals.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.600
The same is true when
you do u transpose ku.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.620
Because of orthogonality, you
only get a diagonal matrix

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.610
at the end.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.450
And under the right
conditions, u transpose cu

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.950
gives you a diagonal matrix.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.370
So what's that good for?

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:13.470
Well, here was the
set of equations

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.240
that we get when we
make that substitution.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:23.730
This is going to give
us a diagonal mass

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:29.590
matrix times q double dot plus,
when conditions are right,

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:34.518
a diagonal damping
matrix times q dot,

00:22:34.518 --> 00:22:41.990
plus a diagonal
stiffness matrix times q

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:49.970
equals u transpose F, which
as a vector times a matrix

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:52.390
gives you back a vector,
which we call capital

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.795
Q. It's a function of time.

00:22:54.795 --> 00:22:56.465
And this is called
the modal force.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.240
But if you look
carefully at these,

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:13.150
if I pick the rth one, mode
r out of this whole thing--

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.540
if I just pick any mode out of
this, any part of this vector,

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.100
and complete this
multiplication,

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:22.750
I will find that I get an Mr,
which is the rth entry here.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:26.125
And now I'm going to refer
to these as the modal masses,

00:23:26.125 --> 00:23:28.080
and I'll write
them with capitals

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.690
and I'll give a subscript to
tell you what the mode is.

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.250
This is a number.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.140
This is the modal
mass for mode r.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.070
This gives me an
equation that looks

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:50.161
like Mrqr double dot plus crqr
dot plus Krqr equals Qr of t.

00:23:50.161 --> 00:23:55.410
And what does that remind you
of that we've done a lot of work

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:56.517
with?

00:23:56.517 --> 00:23:58.271
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:58.271 --> 00:24:00.145
PROFESSOR: How many
degree of freedom system?

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:07.150
That's the equation of motion,
the generic equation of motion,

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.130
of a single degree of
freedom oscillator.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:11.450
And you know how to
calculate the response

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.160
to initial conditions for that.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.920
You know how to calculate
the steady state

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.600
response for that when you
have a harmonic input, right?

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:23.360
What I said at the beginning of
the discussion about vibration

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.540
is it's really
important to understand

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.410
the single degree of
freedom oscillator

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:31.290
because it'll give you
insight as to the behavior

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.920
of complicated multiple
degree of freedom systems.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.723
And here's the proof of this.

00:24:40.347 --> 00:24:47.430
This is now n uncoupled single
degree of freedom systems.

00:24:47.430 --> 00:25:01.000
This is n independent single,
one degree of freedom systems

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.600
which you can solve
one at a time.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:25.610
Now, lots of times a vibrating
system, a complicated one,

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.440
might be this thing.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.110
If I hit this, it's vibrating.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.930
And actually, it's
pretty much vibrating

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:32.846
at a single frequency.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:41.320
And once I've hit it, are there
any external forces driving it?

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.060
So what kind of
response are you seeing?

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.032
Response to?

00:25:47.032 --> 00:25:48.240
AUDIENCE: Initial conditions.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.230
PROFESSOR: Initial
conditions, right?

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:54.720
Now in general, each one of
the natural modes of a system

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.730
has a different natural
frequency, right?

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.979
So if I hit this thing
and I look at it,

00:26:00.979 --> 00:26:03.020
really, I can just see it
wiggling back and forth

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.140
basically at one
frequency So if you

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.580
wanted to come up with a
simple model of this system,

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.630
how many natural
modes you think you'd

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.320
have to include to describe
the motion of this system?

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.220
AUDIENCE: One.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.150
PROFESSOR: One.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.570
Now is that a lot
easier than having

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.120
to do the full general
equation of motion

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.780
for all the possible
modes that this thing has?

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.654
And it turns out
a lot, right, you

00:26:27.654 --> 00:26:29.320
have to deal with the
equation of motion

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.890
of a single degree of freedom
system to describe this.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.050
And that's the real point.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:36.440
You know they built
the Hancock building

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.350
across the river 35 years ago.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.510
It was losing
windows like crazy.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.250
It was a brand new building.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.800
And when the wind would
get above 40 miles an hour,

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.180
the windows started falling out.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:53.900
60 stories high, 60, 61 stories
high, and the wind was blowing.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.440
Where do you suppose
the windows fall out?

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.072
What part of the building?

00:26:58.072 --> 00:26:59.425
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:59.425 --> 00:27:00.359
PROFESSOR: Huh?

00:27:00.359 --> 00:27:02.400
I mean, you'd think that
when the wind is blowing

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.650
it get stronger as it goes up.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:06.860
It was probably blowing out
the windows at the top, right?

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.010
But the windows were
breaking-- as time went by,

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:13.530
every time a window would break,
they replaced this five foot

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.580
by nine foot sheet of glass
with a piece of plywood.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.250
And so you get this
statistical sampling

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:20.190
after a while of where
the breakage was.

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:24.060
So you had no windows
broken at the top and a few

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.380
as you got further down and
more and lots of them broken out

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.860
at the bottom.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:34.750
It turns out that that
building was vibrating mostly

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:35.925
in its first bending mode.

00:27:35.925 --> 00:27:39.315
It was going back
and forth like this.

00:27:39.315 --> 00:27:40.940
Also happened to have
a torsional mode.

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.120
Its first torsional mode
was kind of twisting around

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.400
the base like that.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.415
So in fact the
moment when the wind

00:27:46.415 --> 00:27:47.790
would get about
40 miles an hour,

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.270
this building would start
rocking and rolling,

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:54.590
mostly like this with a
little of this thrown in, OK?

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.420
But you can basically model
that complicated building that

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:01.200
has millions of possible
natural modes in it by one

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.520
or possibly two single degree
of freedom oscillators.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.240
So that's the power
of modal analysis.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.580
But I think the real
power of understanding

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.080
that you can do this
is that it gives you

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.779
this immediate
insight as to what

00:28:13.779 --> 00:28:15.070
might be going on in something.

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.090
So I look at this.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.860
I don't see a
complicated thing that I

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.900
have to model with a big
finite element model.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.570
I see something that's
vibrating at one frequency.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:26.260
And I know it has
a little decay.

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.390
It'll have damping.

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.480
It'll have a natural frequency.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.970
And I get immediate
insight as to its behavior

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:34.238
by knowing this, OK.

00:28:34.238 --> 00:28:38.060
And that's the real reason why
I wanted to show this to you.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:46.595
So today we'll do-- there
are sort of two directions we

00:28:46.595 --> 00:28:47.640
can go with this.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.340
One is to talk about response
to initial conditions,

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.190
and the other is to
talk about the response

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:54.700
to force excitation.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:29:08.810
So we're going to begin by
doing response to ICs, OK?

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.350
And then we'll move
on probably next time

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.960
and talk about response
to harmonic excitations.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:21.310
And we're going to use
that as the example.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:25.920
Before I go there, once we
have broken the system down

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.637
and analyzed this way,
how do we get back

00:29:29.637 --> 00:29:34.811
to the motion of the system in
our generalized coordinates,

00:29:34.811 --> 00:29:36.560
which are the ones
we're comfortable with?

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.930
Because I don't know where
to take a ruler and go

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:45.090
measure this natural coordinate.

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:46.850
So somehow I have to
get back to putting

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:49.570
in the real physical
measurements

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:50.590
that I can relate to.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.620
Well, that's easy because
where did we start with this?

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.960
We started by saying this
whole thing began right here.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:09.180
And so at the end we just
come back and say, oh, well,

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.420
x here, our generalized
coordinates,

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:24.180
is this summation of the
mode shapes ui here, summed

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:30.880
over i of qi of t.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.750
Now the reason I wrote
it here as a summation

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.735
is to remind you
that you do this.

00:30:50.272 --> 00:30:51.730
That's the beauty
of this thing, is

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:54.570
you only have to do it
over the modes that matter.

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:56.830
So if you've decided to
approximate the motion

00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:00.020
of this complicated
system, by just a couple

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.550
of motile contributions
because you

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.210
know they're the
important ones, this

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.450
is a pretty short summation.

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:09.770
This is how you get back to
your original modal coordinates.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:15.630
Just take the modal amplitude,
multiply it by the mode shape.

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:18.360
And when you do that, it
says, if this turns out

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:23.130
to be, say, sum a sine omega t,
when you multiply by the mode

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:25.440
shape it basically
tells you how much

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:29.150
each generalized coordinate
gets of the motion.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:31.570
The mode shape
distributes thing answer

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.360
out proportionally in
the correct amount.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.270
So this is how you get
back to the original.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:43.710
So let's think about
that system and we'll

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.190
do an initial conditions
kind of problem.

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:48.120
So I think Professor
Gossard-- I think

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.070
in class you sort of figured
out what the approximate ks

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:53.500
and ms and things
were for that system.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.830
So I actually took
it apart, weighed it,

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:58.470
measured some
natural frequencies,

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:06.120
and have come up with
a pretty good model,

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.800
or at least pretty
good set of numbers,

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.690
characterizing this two
degree of freedom system.

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:36.210
So c1, k1, m1, k2, c2, x1, x2.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:39.094
So these are my generalized
coordinates, measured probably

00:32:39.094 --> 00:32:39.885
from what position?

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.690
Static equilibrium, right?

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.980
So I don't have to mess
with gravity in this.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.960
Measured from
static equilibrium.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:58.780
And to try to help keep
things understandable,

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.840
I tried to write the
parameters of the system

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.690
as lowercase k1s,
k2s, k3s because I

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:09.490
want to write modal stiffness
for mode one as a capital K1,

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:12.200
so I try to be
consistent about that.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:16.000
And notice where I put
the dampers in the system.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.010
That's because most of
the damping in this thing

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:23.400
comes from the upper mass rubs
against a stationary object,

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.930
which is the bar here.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:28.610
The lower mass rubs against
a stationary object.

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:32.010
So I'm going to model that as
a dashpot between each mass

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:36.230
and the fixed reference frame
because the bar doesn't move.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:38.680
So it's an approximate
model of the damping.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:43.180
And so if we do our sum of
forces on each of these masses,

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.440
just do Newton's
laws on the mass,

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.530
we can come up with our
two equations of motion.

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:50.140
We get two equations of motion.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:55.740
And let's see.

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.746
I think I'll give you some
information here first.

00:34:01.746 --> 00:34:02.246
m1.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.150
And I really don't
know the damping,

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:49.000
but we can get that by just
counting how many cycles it

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.110
takes to decay and so forth.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:53.850
So that's basically what I
come into this problem knowing.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:00.210
And I'm going to write
my equations of motion

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.300
in matrix form.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.560
So it's going to end
up looking like m1.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:22.320
Now notice the damping in
this one, the damping force,

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:26.190
is only proportion--
it'll be c1 x1.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.640
Doesn't involve the motion
of the other object.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.270
In this one, the
damping force only

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.990
involves the second motion.

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:37.680
So this one happens to
look like a c1, 0, c2.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:55.170
And the stiffness matrix, well,
that's k1 plus k2, minus k2,

00:35:55.170 --> 00:36:05.520
minus k2, and k2, x1, x2.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:11.586
And for no external forces,
this starts off this one

00:36:11.586 --> 00:36:14.380
has nothing on the right
hand side. it's equal to 0.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.130
So those are my
equations of motion.

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:17.730
And you know if you
multiply these out

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:19.620
you'd get two equations.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.030
And each one would
be this result

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:25.380
that you get by apply
Newton's law to mass one

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.239
and Newton's law to mass two.

00:36:27.239 --> 00:36:28.780
But you we've done
that enough times.

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.070
I'm not going to go
through that part of it.

00:36:34.014 --> 00:36:34.514
OK.

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:17.115
And putting it in real numbers,
that's our mass matrix.

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.760
I don't know this.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.180
My stiffness matrix.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.160
So this is my K matrix here.

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:55.635
And stiffness matrices,
they're always symmetric.

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:00.130
Although this one
happened to be diagonal,

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.660
you'll find that mass matrices
and even the damping matrices

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:05.430
for our linear
systems are symmetric.

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:06.960
So here's my stiffness matrix.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.770
Here's my mass matrix, OK?

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.690
And also in this case
here's my damping matrix,

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:16.981
but I'm going to leave that
because it's the one that's

00:38:16.981 --> 00:38:19.420
a little bit troublesome.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:24.810
So what do I need to do to this
to carry out my modal analysis?

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:31.250
So I need to go find the results
of computing u transpose m

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:34.912
and u and transpose Ku.

00:38:34.912 --> 00:38:36.130
And let's see what we get.

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:45.630
So we need to know a couple
things about this system.

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.920
We need to know natural
frequencies and mode shapes.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.210
So if we have this
mass matrix and we

00:38:55.210 --> 00:39:00.710
have the stiffness matrix,
then we know we can cast this.

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:09.555
We want the undamped natural
frequencies and our mode

00:39:09.555 --> 00:39:10.055
shapes.

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:32.440
And we know that
we can transform

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.700
the equations of motion into
an algebraic problem where

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.390
we solve for the natural
frequencies and mode shapes.

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:43.340
So we have, just to remind
you really quickly of that,

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:46.550
remember our equations
look like this undamped.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:58.240
And you assume that x is some
form u in fact e to the i omega

00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.990
t.

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:12.210
Plug it in, you get minus
omega squared m plus K u e

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:15.155
to the i omega t equals 0.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.160
And this now is your
algebraic problem.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:24.140
e to this unknown set
of amplitudes is 0.

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.850
These are going to turn
out to be the mode shapes.

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:30.660
And they're not generally 0 so
that means this has to be 0.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.460
That means we know the
determinant of this matrix.

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.670
And that'll give you
in this case the two

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:45.680
natural frequencies.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.490
This gives of you the
omega ns of the system.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:51.190
Omega n squareds is
what you solve for, OK?

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:57.830
And then you go back and you
get the mode shapes out of it.

00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:59.640
But this you can do
on the computer too.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.190
You can either crank out-- for
a two degree of freedom system,

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:06.140
this gives you a
quadratic omega squared.

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.507
You solve it.

00:41:07.507 --> 00:41:09.340
You plug it back in and
get the mode shapes.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.839
I'm not going to
take the time to do

00:41:10.839 --> 00:41:13.820
that today because I want to
emphasize the modal analysis

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:14.527
part.

00:41:14.527 --> 00:41:15.735
So I'll give you the answers.

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:23.910
Where are we here?

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:38.250
So you get omega 1 is 5.6546.

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:42.080
And I seem to be keeping a
lot of significant digits,

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.330
and there's a reason for that.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:56.040
In both mode shapes
and natural frequencies

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.020
you need to carry a lot
of significant digits

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:01.070
or modal analysis doesn't
work, or at least you

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:02.710
don't get the clean
results you expect.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:06.150
If you're sloppy about the
number of significant digits

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:09.440
and you compute u
transpose mu, then the

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.750
[? off ?] diagonal terms
won't quite go to 0.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:17.040
And it's just because you're
not carrying enough precision.

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:22.040
OK, now that's the two
natural frequencies.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:25.320
Now the u matrix, the mode
shapes for this system

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.270
that goes with that.

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:40.089
u comes out to be
1.0 and 2.2667.

00:42:40.089 --> 00:42:40.755
And that's mode.

00:42:40.755 --> 00:42:43.230
I'll do this to help you.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:46.040
The columns are the mode shapes.

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.925
That's the first mode shape.

00:42:47.925 --> 00:43:01.100
And the second mode shape
is 1 and minus 0.2236.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:04.010
So those are the mode shapes
for the first and second mode

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:06.740
that go with these two
natural frequencies.

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.310
So that's for this system.

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:09.810
The top one moves one unit.

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:15.380
The bottom one moves 2.27
times that, same direction,

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.750
positive, positive.

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:18.396
So the upper one moves one unit.

00:43:18.396 --> 00:43:20.270
The bottom one moves
the opposite direction--

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:22.186
that's the minus signs--
equivalent to a phase

00:43:22.186 --> 00:43:26.740
angle of 180 degrees
minus 22% of the amount

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:28.570
that the upper one moves.

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:31.760
So first one moves one unit.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.820
The bottom one moves
2.2 times that.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:39.100
And then the second mode, which
is much harder to get going.

00:43:42.765 --> 00:43:44.140
Guess the only
way I can do it is

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.470
to do it the way Professor
Gossard intended here.

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:58.510
One unit up and down, minus
0.2236, going the opposite way.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:59.890
So those are our mode shapes.

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:01.570
These are the
natural frequencies.

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:04.240
I calculated this one and
measured it with a stopwatch.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.650
This one I can do watching
it with a stopwatch.

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:12.856
And I came within better than
1% of getting the same number.

00:44:12.856 --> 00:44:13.355
OK.

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.510
So I want my model mass matrix.

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:40.680
I carry out this calculation.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.680
And for this system,
remember, it's

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:48.540
going to give me back a diagonal
matrix looking like this.

00:44:48.540 --> 00:45:05.120
And in fact, the numbers are
3.5562, 0, 0, and 0.3508.

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:10.430
And when I calculate
u transpose Ku,

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:12.690
gives me a diagonal
stiffness matrix.

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:38.670
And I get the numbers
113.71 and 0, 0, 109.839.

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:43.480
And that's my diagonalized
stiffness matrix.

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.090
Now something had
better be true.

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:47.820
I'm saying that
this is now going

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.230
to give me my two independent
single degree of freedom

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:51.640
equations of motion, right?

00:46:03.219 --> 00:46:07.380
So what I'm seeking here, I
want to get two equations,

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:17.550
one that looks like m1q1 double
dot plus c1q1 dot plus K1q1

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:20.137
equals 0 for no external force.

00:46:20.137 --> 00:46:21.720
That's one of the
equations I'm after.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:30.496
And the other one will look like
m2q2 double dot plus c2q2 dot

00:46:30.496 --> 00:46:30.995
K2q2.

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:36.730
Now one way to check that
you've gotten the right thing

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:39.700
is now these are two independent
single degree of freedom

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:40.340
systems.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.173
What's the natural
frequency of this system?

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:53.250
Yeah?

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:55.870
Actually, I heard somebody
say square root of K1 over m1.

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:56.870
That had better be true.

00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:58.650
But numerically
what's the number?

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:02.010
What had it better be?

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.510
It better be the omega
1 of the system, right?

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:07.230
And so a check that
you can perform

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:18.560
is to check to see if the
omega 1 squared equals K1/m1.

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.590
You found two numbers.

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:27.950
You've got, up
here, K1 is 113.7.

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:29.990
m1 is 3.55.

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:33.850
Take K1/m1, and take
its square root.

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:39.530
So K1/m1, that's
about 30 something.

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:43.946
Square root of 30 something
is a little less than 6.

00:47:43.946 --> 00:47:46.660
Omega 1 is 5.65.

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:49.980
And same thing,
omega 2 had better

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:54.130
be equal to the
square root of K2/m2.

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:55.640
So one of the things
you can always

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.100
do when you do your
modal analysis,

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:01.480
you do your calculations, u
transpose mu, u transpose Ku.

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:04.326
If you calculate the ratios
of each one of these things,

00:48:04.326 --> 00:48:05.742
you can go back
and check that you

00:48:05.742 --> 00:48:07.408
can see that the
natural frequencies are

00:48:07.408 --> 00:48:09.020
the ones that you started with.

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.730
If they are not, then you've
messed up in your arithmetic.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:14.550
So now we've got our two
independent equations.

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:18.310
And the natural
frequencies check out.

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:21.880
But we still have a couple
of things to deal with.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.030
We have to figure
out how to calculate

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:26.469
the initial conditions,
and we have to figure out

00:48:26.469 --> 00:48:27.510
how to deal with damping.

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:34.280
Let's do ICs first.

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:56.020
So those of you who
were here last time,

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:59.930
I ended kind of
right at the end.

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:02.550
We kind of worked our
way through figuring out

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:06.214
the initial conditions for a
two degree of freedom system

00:49:06.214 --> 00:49:07.130
doing it the hard way.

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:09.840
You end up with four
equations and four unknowns

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.450
for the a1, a2, phi 1, phi two.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:13.070
Remember that?

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:16.150
I mean, it's really painful.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:18.510
This is incredibly easier.

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:23.160
We're going to do the same
thing, but extremely easily.

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:27.000
So I would never go myself
given the choice of grinding out

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.850
all those phase
angles and amplitudes

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:31.260
in simultaneous equations.

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.740
I'd do the following.

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.960
Generally now I know the
initial conditions are

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.790
going to be specified
not in q coordinates

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:40.050
but in what coordinate system?

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:47.200
In your original generalized
coordinates, right?

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.687
You know, your x, this one.

00:49:49.687 --> 00:49:51.520
If I'm going to set
initial conditions here,

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.640
I'm not going to say q1
is equal to something.

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.420
I'm going to put this one
down one unit and this one

00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:59.110
down two units and let go.

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:01.070
This is in x1 and
x2 coordinates.

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:07.085
But the beautiful thing here is
that we know that x equals uq.

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:13.340
So if I know the initial
conditions on I'll

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:18.840
call it x0 here, if I know
the initial deflections

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.540
of the system,
they're going to be u

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:27.190
times the initial values of q.

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:33.070
And if I know a vector of
initial velocities at time 0,

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:35.780
they're going to be uq0 dot.

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:44.070
So if I told you
values of x0 and you

00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:48.050
know that this equation's
true, what we need is the q0s.

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:50.730
We need the initial
conditions in the modal

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:53.249
coordinates in order
to finish this problem.

00:50:53.249 --> 00:50:55.290
If I told you this, how
would you solve for that?

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:01.160
Just a little
linear algebra here.

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:05.960
AUDIENCE: Inverse matrix of u?

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.400
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
do what with it?

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:08.900
AUDIENCE: Then you
multiply x by it.

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:13.290
PROFESSOR: Multiply it
by u inverse, right?

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:24.440
OK, so this implies
that q0-- well,

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.480
I'll write it out a
little more fully here.

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:37.590
So if I do u inverse
x0, that's going

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:40.885
to be equal to u inverse uq0.

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:48.390
u inverse times u gives you?

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:50.010
1, basically, right?

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:58.337
And so if I do u
inverse x0, I get q0.

00:51:58.337 --> 00:51:59.420
That's all there is to it.

00:51:59.420 --> 00:51:59.920
Yeah?

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] initial
conditions, what about c?

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:04.820
PROFESSOR: All right,
c's a problem, OK,

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:07.050
and I'm leaving it to the end.

00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:09.530
We're going to deal with
it as the last step.

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:15.690
And if I have initial
velocities u inverse times x

00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:20.440
initial velocities vector, I get
the initial velocities vector

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.700
in the natural coordinates.

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:25.600
So that's how simple it is
to get the initial conditions

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:26.650
in modal coordinates.

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:29.030
Boom, OK?

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.830
And we'll do a numerical
example in a second here.

00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:51.089
We're seeking a solution
of the form to do response

00:52:51.089 --> 00:52:52.005
to initial conditions.

00:52:55.290 --> 00:53:05.094
We seek equations
that we know are

00:53:05.094 --> 00:53:07.260
right for a single degree
of freedom system response

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.380
to initial conditions.

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:16.430
So we know that for a single
degree of freedom system, x

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:33.940
of t-- this is for
SDOF system here--

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:38.660
we worked out before is equal
to some e to the minus zeta

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.570
omega nt.

00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:50.640
This is just a transient decay
problem of x0 cosine omega dt

00:53:50.640 --> 00:54:07.860
plus v0 plus zeta omega n x0
all over omega d sine omega dt.

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:10.680
We know that that's what the
response of a single degree

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:16.000
of freedom system looks like to
initial conditions x0 and v0.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.980
And for light damping,
for small damping,

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:21.280
you can usually even
ignore this term.

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:24.300
So it's just even simpler.

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:28.700
This term is small compared
to that, all right?

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:33.040
This term, contribution from x0,
is small compared to this term.

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:36.340
So it's basically dominated
by an x0 cosine and a v0

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:38.070
over omega d sine.

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:40.770
But we know that's
the exact response

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:43.900
for a single degree of freedom
system to initial conditions.

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:46.120
So just by analogy
to that, we're

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:49.890
looking for mode one
in modal coordinates.

00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:52.360
It's going to look
exactly the same way.

00:54:52.360 --> 00:55:03.120
e to the minus zeta omega
nt, q0 cosine omega 1

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:17.960
d-- this is omega dt-- plus
q0 dot plus zeta 1 omega 1 q0.

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:24.080
I guess I need to
do q10 like that.

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:27.710
This is the first
mode's equation, zeta 1.

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:29.507
And I'll call this omega 1.

00:55:29.507 --> 00:55:31.840
But now that you get multiple
degree of freedom systems,

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.173
you got to keep track of what
mode you're talking about.

00:55:34.173 --> 00:55:36.140
Mode one, damping
ratio mode one,

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:40.800
natural frequency mode one,
initial displacement mode one,

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:48.810
initial velocity mode
one, omega 1 d like that.

00:55:48.810 --> 00:55:51.670
And mode two is going
to be exactly analogous.

00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:56.650
q2 equals, and it's
exactly similar,

00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:59.210
except you update it
with a 2 instead of a 1.

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:05.510
And if you plug in the
initial-- you over here

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:14.990
have found the initial values
for q10 and q20 and q1 dot 0

00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.650
and so forth.

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:19.410
You found the initial values
that plug into that equation

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:20.560
by just doing this.

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:25.950
And once we have this, then
we can go back to saying,

00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:29.570
how do you get to
the final answer?

00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:31.350
Well, you just
multiply the result

00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:33.300
for q times the mode
shape and add them up.

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.435
And you have the answer.

00:56:35.435 --> 00:56:37.560
But we still have to deal
with the damping problem.

00:56:41.224 --> 00:56:43.687
We're going to do that one next.

00:56:43.687 --> 00:56:45.770
But I see a bunch of hands
and some puzzled looks,

00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:49.060
so it means it's a good time
to stop and talk for a second.

00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:50.354
Yeah?

00:56:50.354 --> 00:56:53.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:53.872
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:56:53.872 --> 00:56:55.080
AUDIENCE: What if
you [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.329
PROFESSOR: I can't quite hear.

00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:58.489
AUDIENCE: The sine theta
and the sine rate of g.

00:56:58.489 --> 00:56:59.780
PROFESSOR: Yeah, what about it?

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:00.800
AUDIENCE: Why do we lose it?

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:01.660
PROFESSOR: Why do we use it?

00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:02.409
AUDIENCE: Lose it.

00:57:02.409 --> 00:57:03.860
PROFESSOR: Oh,
you don't lose it.

00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:07.450
I was saying, you see
this bit, it's like that.

00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:11.860
These are two pieces
that behave like sine.

00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:14.630
And see, this one depends
on initial displacement

00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:17.002
but is multiplied by
the damping ratio.

00:57:17.002 --> 00:57:19.210
And the damping ratio for
things that are interesting

00:57:19.210 --> 00:57:21.040
is usually pretty small.

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:29.480
So here you have a term that's
x0 cosine omega 1 damped,

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:34.030
and here you have a contribution
that's x0 small times

00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:39.600
x0 sine omega 1 damped.

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.910
So you multiply the same.

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:42.620
They're operating on
the same frequency.

00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:44.920
Two terms at the same frequency,
you add them together,

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:49.620
it's like a cosine omega
t minus some phase angle.

00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:52.197
If this little term is small,
that phase angle's almost 0.

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:03.940
x0 cosine plus
something x0 sine,

00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:07.930
it gives you a cosine term
that is shifted a little bit

00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:11.562
and its magnitude is different
by this little amount.

00:58:11.562 --> 00:58:13.270
I'm just saying
oftentimes this is small.

00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:14.820
But if you don't want to
make that approximation,

00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:15.660
just carry it along.

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:16.321
Just do it.

00:58:16.321 --> 00:58:17.196
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:20.290
PROFESSOR: Mm-hmm.

00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:21.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:22.790
PROFESSOR: Oh, no.

00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:25.950
I'm just saying you can
throw out this piece usually.

00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:31.930
And it makes-- I keep
in my mind-- let me see.

00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:32.430
OK, now.

00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:35.990
Vibration engineering is full
of lots of approximations

00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:38.570
because it's very
hard oftentimes

00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:43.990
to get detailed quantitative
numbers on exactly

00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:45.310
everything you need to know.

00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:47.120
So I carry around
little approximations

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:49.390
that I know is the way
the world mostly behaves.

00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:50.890
And the way the
world mostly behaves

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:52.431
for a single degree
of freedom system

00:58:52.431 --> 00:58:55.610
is the response to initial
conditions looks like this.

00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:03.690
And this initial value here
is always approximately x0.

00:59:03.690 --> 00:59:09.920
And this initial slope here
is always approximately v0.

00:59:12.842 --> 00:59:13.550
That's the slope.

00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:20.590
Now, it turns out that this
thing is shifted just slightly.

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:21.090
Why?

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:23.600
Because of this term, OK?

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:25.430
But honest, to
tell you the truth,

00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:27.420
it really rarely matters.

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:30.590
So as a vibration
engineer, I just

00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:32.860
remember I have an x0 cosine.

00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:34.650
I have a v0 over omega d sine.

00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:37.090
And the whole thing
decays like that.

00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:40.080
But if you like to be
mathematically precise,

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.630
you carry along
that a little bit.

00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:42.130
Yeah?

00:59:42.130 --> 00:59:44.510
AUDIENCE: Don't you lose
[INAUDIBLE] sine wave?

00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:46.476
PROFESSOR: You're not
going to lose the sine.

00:59:46.476 --> 00:59:48.474
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:48.474 --> 00:59:49.390
PROFESSOR: Oh, oh, oh.

00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:50.500
Wait a minute.

00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:51.455
I just left it out.

00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:57.310
You guys are-- well,
I'm glad you're awake.

00:59:57.310 --> 00:59:58.060
This is good.

01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:03.680
Now how's that?

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.560
Ah, good.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:07.390
Now I know why I had
so many puzzled looks.

01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:08.860
Anybody have a
different question?

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:11.677
Just anything now about this
whole modal analysis thing?

01:00:11.677 --> 01:00:14.010
Because then we have to deal
with this awkward part that

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:16.620
has to do with the damping.

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:19.326
And I've got to
finish on time, OK?

01:00:23.821 --> 01:00:24.320
All right.

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:28.760
So damping.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.460
I've gotten this far.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:37.080
What I need is I need estimates
for the damping for mode one

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.400
and damping for mode two, right?

01:00:54.030 --> 01:01:12.110
So the problem is that
utcu does not always

01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:17.210
equal some nice
diagonalized matrix.

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:29.350
You sometimes get these
are not always 0, OK?

01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:31.330
The orthogonality
principle just doesn't

01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:34.879
apply to the damping terms.

01:01:34.879 --> 01:01:35.420
Just doesn't.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.780
But this actually
doesn't hurt you a lot.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:43.210
You just got to know that
this is going to be a problem.

01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:45.170
And when the systems
are lightly damped,

01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:49.050
the approximation, even if
your true damping in the system

01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:51.700
gives you some
non-zero elements here,

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:53.974
the first order
behavior of the system

01:01:53.974 --> 01:01:55.890
is basically going to
be-- you can just ignore

01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:57.800
the off-diagonal elements.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.520
What practical
consequence do you

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:06.520
think it has if you have some
actual non-zero numbers here?

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.080
Go back and look
at the equations

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.170
that you're trying to derive.

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:14.810
These were the equations that
we were trying to come up with.

01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:20.970
And we wanted them to be
n individual single degree

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:22.570
of freedom systems.

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:26.060
But if this has non-zero
off-diagonal terms,

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:29.230
you're going to find popping
up in this single degree

01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:34.200
of freedom equation another term
that couples it through damping

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.950
to the other modes.

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:39.160
It provides a little bit
of coupling to other modes.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:43.170
They can talk to one
another, all right?

01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:47.340
And what that means is if
I-- this may be a good time

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:50.590
to do the demonstration.

01:03:03.485 --> 01:03:04.970
How do I want to say this?

01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:22.210
If the initial
displacement of the system

01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:32.260
is in the shape of one
of the natural modes--

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:36.810
so if this is some u, this is
exactly shaped like mode r.

01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:38.605
So this looks like
the ur vector.

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:47.250
When I carry out
this multiplication,

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:50.152
what do you think will happen?

01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:58.350
If this is shaped
like mode r, because

01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:01.870
of orthogonality when
I do u inverse, which

01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:04.450
is all about the mode shapes
information and the mode

01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:08.890
shapes are these orthogonal
set of independent orthogonal

01:04:08.890 --> 01:04:12.970
vectors, if this
is exactly one mode

01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:17.160
and I do u inverse times
that, I will get 0 over here

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:22.200
on the right hand side for
every mode except the mode

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.650
that that's shaped like.

01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:28.210
So if this is shaped
like a particular mode,

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:31.310
then over here all the
modal initial conditions

01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:35.140
are 0 except that mode.

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:39.530
That means if I set this, give
its initial conditions are

01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:45.370
equal to the shape
exactly of mode one,

01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:49.490
it only responds in mode one.

01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:56.180
And if I give it initial
conditions that are exactly

01:04:56.180 --> 01:05:01.090
shaped like that of
mode two, then it only

01:05:01.090 --> 01:05:03.670
responds in mode two.

01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:10.290
And if I give it anything else,
like I move just the top one

01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:13.550
but not the bottom
and let it go,

01:05:13.550 --> 01:05:17.180
then there's-- maybe I
better do the other one.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:19.610
That one had too much of
one and not the other.

01:05:19.610 --> 01:05:21.590
If I hold this one,
here's its reference.

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:23.256
I'm going to hold it
right there and I'm

01:05:23.256 --> 01:05:26.352
going to give this one a
unit deflection and let go.

01:05:26.352 --> 01:05:30.240
Now you see a get some
of both, all right?

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:46.520
So if when I do this
first one, say first mode,

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.660
I could sit here and
measure how many cycles

01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:51.400
it takes to decay halfway and
estimate the damping ratio

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.680
for that mode.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.630
If it's only moving
in this mode,

01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:58.300
I can estimate its damping
directly for that mode

01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.375
and get zeta 1.

01:05:59.375 --> 01:06:00.563
You agree?

01:06:00.563 --> 01:06:01.430
OK.

01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:04.460
And I did the same thing with
mode two, it's too fast for me

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:07.680
to catch it with
a stopwatch, but I

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.980
could measure its damping.

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.930
And as it decays, I could
get an estimate for zeta 2,

01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:15.090
for the damping ratio
for mode two, all right?

01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:16.370
All right.

01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:18.710
But somehow I have
to get damping

01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:21.300
ratio for mode one, zeta
1, and damping ratio

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.590
for mode two, zeta 2.

01:06:22.590 --> 01:06:26.260
I have to somehow
get it out of this.

01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:30.030
I have to model it somehow with
these damping coefficients that

01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:35.210
come from computing
this u transpose cu, OK.

01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:41.160
So I'm going to show
you kind of damping

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:53.830
called Rayleigh damping, OK?

01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:56.630
Lord Rayleigh, who did
lots of things in science

01:06:56.630 --> 01:07:00.590
that you've probably
run into, proposed

01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:07.940
that if you model your
damping, the c matrix as-- this

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:11.210
is just now the
system damping matrix

01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:20.150
that you start with-- some
alpha times the mass matrix

01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:24.520
plus beta times the stiffness
matrix-- these are now

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:27.400
the original ones in your
generalized coordinates,

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:30.740
just your mass and
stiffness matrices.

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.340
If you say, I'm going to
approximate my damping model

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:50.265
like this, then I want to
compute u transpose cu.

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:57.000
I'm going to get
alpha u transpose

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.390
mu plus beta u transpose Ku.

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:10.020
But we know that this gives you
the diagonalized mass matrix,

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.630
known as the modal mass matrix.

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:14.960
This gives you the
diagonalized stiffness matrix.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.810
And so this damping
model, this is

01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:23.560
guaranteed to give you a
diagonalized damping matrix

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:27.899
which we'll call, somehow,
some capital C2, 0,

01:08:27.899 --> 01:08:31.920
0, C2, all right?

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:40.810
And it's going to be alpha
times the modal mass matrix

01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:46.319
plus a beta times the
modal stiffness matrix.

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:47.979
And those alphas and
betas you adjust.

01:08:47.979 --> 01:08:49.395
They're just
parameters you adjust

01:08:49.395 --> 01:08:54.380
to get the amount of
damping you need, OK?

01:08:54.380 --> 01:09:09.450
So for a two degree
of freedom system,

01:09:09.450 --> 01:09:23.240
C1 here is alpha
m1 plus beta K1.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.620
Modal mass, alpha
times the modal mass

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:27.310
plus beta times the
modal stiffness.

01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:29.715
That's what you get
for the first one.

01:09:29.715 --> 01:09:39.288
And C2 is alpha m2
plus beta K2, OK?

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.510
And the alphas and betas
give you two free parameters

01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:49.950
you can play with.

01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:52.520
And for a two degree
of freedom system,

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:55.680
I can manipulate alpha and
beta to get the damping

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:58.020
that I measure.

01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:01.900
And I forced my equations
of motion a couple.

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:04.160
Now, Mother Nature may
say, you know, Vandiver,

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.227
they don't uncouple,
and there's going

01:10:06.227 --> 01:10:07.810
to be a little
crosstalk between them.

01:10:07.810 --> 01:10:10.580
But I say, yeah,
but to first order

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:13.580
I'm going to get a pretty
good model of the system.

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:15.280
So let's do that in this case.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.650
Let's maybe just to keep
it-- I've got numbers here,

01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:24.840
so let my notes so I don't
get completely lost here.

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.020
So I'm going to just
pick one for now.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:29.890
I'm going to model
my damping with just

01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:54.640
beta K, beta times my
diagonal, my stiffness matrix.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:57.257
And let's see what happens here.

01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:07.240
So that says my modal
damping is going to be some,

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:12.110
for mode one, beta K1.

01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:13.790
Now what's damping ratio?

01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:18.850
Zeta 1 for a single
degree of freedom system

01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:27.540
is the damping constant for
the system over 2 omega 1 m1.

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:37.610
But that's going to be
beta K1 over 2 omega 1 m1.

01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:41.980
But m1/K1 is omega 1 squared.

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:45.720
So I get an omega 1
squared in the numerator.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:54.344
Beta omega 1 squared
over 2 omega 1.

01:11:54.344 --> 01:11:56.920
Remember, the K over the m
gave me the omega one squared,

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:58.560
so the ms are gone.

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.200
You can cancel one of these.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:04.010
This gives me beta
omega 1 over 2.

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:14.390
So this now gives me a way I
can fit one of the dampings.

01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:17.450
I can get exactly what I
want, say, for mode one

01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:21.910
if I pick beta to
be the right number.

01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:27.820
OK, so in this case, I
actually did some numbers.

01:12:33.772 --> 01:12:36.715
Pardon?

01:12:36.715 --> 01:12:37.340
Can't hear you.

01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.690
PROFESSOR: No.

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:43.790
K1/m1 is omega 1 squared.

01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:45.730
Omega 1 squared
takes care of the m1.

01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:47.490
I get rid of one
of the omega 1s.

01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:51.531
I'm left with this, OK?

01:12:51.531 --> 01:12:52.030
OK.

01:12:54.690 --> 01:13:00.970
So let's just let
beta equal 0.01.

01:13:00.970 --> 01:13:03.250
And if you let
beta equal to 0.01,

01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:09.420
then zeta 1 equals
0.01 omega 1 over 2.

01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:13.250
We know omega 1 is 5.65.

01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:15.940
This when you work
it out then gives you

01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:24.230
a number of 0.0283, about 3%.

01:13:24.230 --> 01:13:28.290
And that would say that
this system when it vibrates

01:13:28.290 --> 01:13:30.960
in mode one is going
to damp out up to 50%

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:34.020
in about three cycles.

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:35.282
Not bad approximations.

01:13:35.282 --> 01:13:36.740
I'm just guessing
about what it is.

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:39.910
That's a reasonable amount
of damping for mode one.

01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:45.300
Now the problem is when I only
use just beta K as my model.

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:48.220
Now I'm stuck with whatever
happens for mode two

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:53.450
once I pick beta
because zeta 2 is going

01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:57.840
to be beta omega 2 over 2.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.350
And omega 2 is
quite a bit larger,

01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:05.770
so now I'm stuck with a greater
value for the second mode.

01:14:05.770 --> 01:14:11.800
In this case, it's 0.0885.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:16.010
So if I just pick a one
parameter model for my damping,

01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:18.160
I can make one perfect.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.050
I can match it
perfectly, but then I'm

01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:22.440
stuck with whatever
the other one is.

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:25.230
So I did this because I
could do it simply with one.

01:14:25.230 --> 01:14:30.710
But if I'd kept the full
two-parameter model,

01:14:30.710 --> 01:14:33.260
with manipulating
both alpha and beta

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:37.050
I could actually get both
of the two measured dampings

01:14:37.050 --> 01:14:38.569
exactly right.

01:14:38.569 --> 01:14:40.110
But if I have an n
degree-- if I have

01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:42.220
three degree of freedom system,
I only have two parameters.

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.800
I can fit two of
the damping ratios,

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.133
but then I'm going to be stuck
with whatever it gives me

01:14:46.133 --> 01:14:46.750
for the third.

01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:50.000
But oftentimes it's just one
mode you really care about.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:50.937
It's the problem mode.

01:14:50.937 --> 01:14:52.270
You're at its natural frequency.

01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:54.670
It's going like crazy.

01:14:54.670 --> 01:14:58.320
Initial conditions make it
vibrate a lot in that mode.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.440
But this is what Rayleigh
damping allows you to do.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:05.260
It guarantees you that you
will have a diagonalized set

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:06.754
of equations of motion.

01:15:06.754 --> 01:15:08.420
And it gives you two
parameters that you

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:12.260
can play with to fit the
damping model however you want.

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:17.900
Once you have damping, now
you have the complete solution

01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:19.394
for decay from
initial conditions.

01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:25.130
And there's your two models.

01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:28.710
You can solve for q1, transient
decay given initial conditions.

01:15:28.710 --> 01:15:33.100
You can solve for q2,
transient K of the second mode.

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:37.130
And then to get
back to the initial

01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:39.900
to the response in terms
of your modal coordinates,

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:44.342
you just add the
two together, OK?

01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.345
I got some numbers here
which are just instructive.

01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:54.072
u Inverse.

01:15:54.072 --> 01:15:55.780
In order to get these
initial conditions,

01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:56.988
you've got to know u inverse.

01:15:56.988 --> 01:15:58.300
Do we know u?

01:15:58.300 --> 01:15:59.430
I gave us u.

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:03.080
Here's our set of
mode shape vectors.

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:05.530
And I've run out of boards.

01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:32.710
So we have the u matrix.

01:16:32.710 --> 01:16:36.020
We need u inverse, so u
inverse for this problem.

01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:53.110
And we're going to
quickly do some examples.

01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:59.320
Let's let the v0s be 0.

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.260
No initial conditions
on velocities.

01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:12.450
And let's do x0, the initial
displacements, be 1 and 0.

01:17:12.450 --> 01:17:14.690
So the 1 and 0,
what we're saying

01:17:14.690 --> 01:17:18.945
is the bottom one doesn't
move, unit deflection here, let

01:17:18.945 --> 01:17:20.000
it go.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.530
What are you're going to get
for the initial conditions?

01:17:23.530 --> 01:17:35.290
x0 equals 1 and 0, well,
that implies that the qs are

01:17:35.290 --> 01:17:38.460
going to be u inverse x0.

01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:40.370
So by the way, if
this is true, this

01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:47.820
implies that all q dot initial
conditions equal 0, right?

01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:49.730
No initial velocities
in generalized

01:17:49.730 --> 01:17:52.770
coordinates, no initial
velocities in modal

01:17:52.770 --> 01:17:54.462
coordinates.

01:17:54.462 --> 01:17:56.420
But we are going to have
an initial deflection.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:06.280
I want to then compute u
inverse x0 and see what I get.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:20.320
And what I get back when I do
this one is 0.0898 and 0.9102.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:24.280
Remember, this is q10, q20.

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:33.640
So for that case, it says
I'm going to get 0.08 or 0.09

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:37.770
equal to q1 and 0.9 of q2.

01:18:37.770 --> 01:18:41.120
And I go back over here
to my transient decay.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.850
There's no velocity.

01:18:42.850 --> 01:18:51.720
So it's basically going to
look like q10 cosine omega

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:58.190
dt, e the minus zeta
omega t, decaying, cosine.

01:18:58.190 --> 01:19:03.510
But for mode one, its initial
amplitude's less than 0.1.

01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:06.580
And mode two, it's
got a lot of mode two.

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:09.910
So what happens?

01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:15.650
So unit deflection here, in
fact it's mostly mode two.

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:18.820
And just quickly
I'll do one other.

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:22.990
x0 is 0, 1.

01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:30.400
That implies that q0
that you get from that

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:40.830
is 0.4016 and minus 0.4016.

01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:44.690
Says you get about
equal amounts.

01:19:44.690 --> 01:19:46.100
So that's this one.

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:49.110
I don't move this one,
but I give this one

01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:52.390
a unit deflection, let go.

01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:55.190
I get about equal
amounts of each one.

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:59.120
And of course I've told
you the answer to this one.

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:04.250
If I let x equal mode
one's mode shape,

01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:16.250
1 and 2.266, that implies
that q1 equals 1 and q2, when

01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:18.780
you multiply it out, is zero 0.

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:23.260
If I deflect it in the shape of
mode one and I do u inverse x0,

01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:25.620
I will get back 0 and 1.

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.960
And if I make this
the shape of mode two,

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:31.676
I will get back 0 for mode
one and 1 for mode two.

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:41.780
I've out of time, but that's
your intro to modal analysis.

01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:43.966
So I think it's
conceptually powerful.

01:20:43.966 --> 01:20:44.466
Yes.

01:20:44.466 --> 01:20:47.868
AUDIENCE: How did you
get from the 0.898 value

01:20:47.868 --> 01:20:56.616
to the 0.0898 value?

01:20:56.616 --> 01:21:00.018
AUDIENCE: The inverse
should be 0.0898.

01:21:00.018 --> 01:21:01.910
PROFESSOR: Oh, is this 0.08?

01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:03.416
Yeah, OK.

01:21:03.416 --> 01:21:04.730
I may have written that down.

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:11.870
Yeah.

01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:12.970
I'll double check that.

01:21:12.970 --> 01:21:14.040
But yeah, question?

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.550
AUDIENCE: Why is it for
here that we picked c

01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:18.840
to be only a function of--

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:19.575
PROFESSOR: Beta?

01:21:19.575 --> 01:21:19.830
AUDIENCE: A.

01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:22.205
PROFESSOR: Because I want to
get done by the end of the--

01:21:22.205 --> 01:21:22.760
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.620
PROFESSOR: --60
minutes, 80 minutes.

01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:26.550
I could have put
both of them in,

01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:29.120
manipulated both parameters
as two equation with [? two ?]

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:31.130
modes, two target
values of dampings.

01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:33.070
I'd find an alpha
and a beta that would

01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:35.410
make both work exactly right.

01:21:35.410 --> 01:21:38.870
Actually, just this one model
is pretty good for this case.

01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:40.840
The damping for
second mode is greater

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.890
than the first mode
just happens to be.

01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:44.032
This model's not bad.

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:45.740
AUDIENCE: All right,
so you try the three

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:47.690
and see what gets
you the best results?

01:21:47.690 --> 01:21:49.240
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
