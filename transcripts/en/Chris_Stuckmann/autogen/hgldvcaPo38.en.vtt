00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.949
that though I think the film takes a
nosedive into

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959
nosedive into
 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.259
nosedive into
unintentionally hilarious territory and

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269
unintentionally hilarious territory and
 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.869
unintentionally hilarious territory and
I found the film to get considerably bad

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879
I found the film to get considerably bad
 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.789

after that to the point of cringe-worthy
 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.960
after that to the point of cringe-worthy
sequences and an ending that was so so

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970
sequences and an ending that was so so
 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.149

disappointing and so out of left field

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159
disappointing and so out of left field
 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.460
disappointing and so out of left field
and very unnecessary that it was a

little bit maddening to be honest it's a
 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.140
little bit maddening to be honest it's a
film that sets up questions and kind of

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150
film that sets up questions and kind of
 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.119
film that sets up questions and kind of
prides itself specifically the

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129
prides itself specifically the
 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.490
prides itself specifically the
screenplay on being really clever and

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500
screenplay on being really clever and
 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.059
screenplay on being really clever and
inventive and it makes you ask questions

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069
inventive and it makes you ask questions
 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.819
inventive and it makes you ask questions
about things you see early on a doctor's

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829
about things you see early on a doctor's

about things you see early on a doctor's
name for instance and in the film tries

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019
name for instance and in the film tries
 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.770
name for instance and in the film tries
to tie this into things as the film gets

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780
to tie this into things as the film gets
 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.280
to tie this into things as the film gets
to the end but the film cops out and

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290
to the end but the film cops out and
 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.800
to the end but the film cops out and
leaves you with no answers and instead a

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810
leaves you with no answers and instead a
 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.440
leaves you with no answers and instead a
setup for a sequel that was just very

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450
setup for a sequel that was just very
 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.589
setup for a sequel that was just very
lame and so it's almost like they said

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599
lame and so it's almost like they said
 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.390

hey we've got you on the hook with these

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400
hey we've got you on the hook with these
 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.970
hey we've got you on the hook with these
interesting questions but we don't want

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980
interesting questions but we don't want
 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.650
interesting questions but we don't want
to bother ourselves with actually

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660
to bother ourselves with actually
 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.479
to bother ourselves with actually
crafting these answers into the film

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489
crafting these answers into the film
 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:28.770
crafting these answers into the film
we're just going to assume that

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780
we're just going to assume that
 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.689
we're just going to assume that
hopefully this makes enough money so
