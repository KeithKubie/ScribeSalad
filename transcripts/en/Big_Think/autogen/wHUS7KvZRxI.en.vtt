so I've been concerned because Finance

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.330
so I've been concerned because Finance
 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.600
so I've been concerned because Finance
has become demonized in the last several

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610
has become demonized in the last several
 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.989
has become demonized in the last several
years and decade or two and in part it's

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:12.999
years and decade or two and in part it's
 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.209
years and decade or two and in part it's
for good reason which is the practice of

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219
for good reason which is the practice of
 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.640
for good reason which is the practice of
finance in many ways is broken we see a

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650
finance in many ways is broken we see a
 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.980
finance in many ways is broken we see a
lot of activity that is value extracting

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990
lot of activity that is value extracting
 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.740
lot of activity that is value extracting
as opposed to value creating and that is

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750
as opposed to value creating and that is
 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.630
as opposed to value creating and that is
really disturbing and you know that's

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640
really disturbing and you know that's
 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.640
really disturbing and you know that's
not just the financial crisis but we see

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650
not just the financial crisis but we see
 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.100
not just the financial crisis but we see
it in various parts of finance and as a

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110
it in various parts of finance and as a
 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.950
it in various parts of finance and as a
management to some degree in banking and

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960
management to some degree in banking and
 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.460
management to some degree in banking and
so it is really worrisome that a people

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470
so it is really worrisome that a people
 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.870
so it is really worrisome that a people
have such a terrible impression of it

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880
have such a terrible impression of it
 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.190
have such a terrible impression of it
and B that we sometimes live up to it

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200
and B that we sometimes live up to it
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.870
and B that we sometimes live up to it
but the truth is that we can't live

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880
but the truth is that we can't live
 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.610
but the truth is that we can't live
without finance and we need to

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620
without finance and we need to
 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.590
without finance and we need to
rehabilitate finance and the reason we

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600
rehabilitate finance and the reason we
 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.319
rehabilitate finance and the reason we
can't is because it is so central to the

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329
can't is because it is so central to the
 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.510
can't is because it is so central to the
modern economy so I think even people

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520
modern economy so I think even people
 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.139
modern economy so I think even people
who are really upset about finance have

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149
who are really upset about finance have
 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:56.549
who are really upset about finance have
to acknowledge that it's really central

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559
to acknowledge that it's really central
 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.590
to acknowledge that it's really central
and we have to make it better it is the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600
and we have to make it better it is the
 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.170
and we have to make it better it is the
fundamental mechanism by which companies

fundamental mechanism by which companies

how do you know whether you're creating

how do you know whether you're creating
 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.690
how do you know whether you're creating
value and what is the recipe for

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700
value and what is the recipe for
 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.660
value and what is the recipe for
creating value so you know that sounds

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670
creating value so you know that sounds
 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.130

which is a very odd parable from the

you do it for a very long period of time

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230
you do it for a very long period of time
 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.590
you do it for a very long period of time
and you continue to grow so that's how

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600
and you continue to grow so that's how
 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.440

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770
Talent and in fact John Wesley Mitchell
 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.680
Talent and in fact John Wesley Mitchell
was the founder of Methodism in his

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.530
essay on the parable of the talents
basically says almost the exact recipe

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540
basically says almost the exact recipe
 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.150
basically says almost the exact recipe
for value creation that kind of comes

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160
for value creation that kind of comes
 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.060

out of a textbook which is you know beat

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070
out of a textbook which is you know beat
 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.770
out of a textbook which is you know beat
your cost to capital its race and you

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780
your cost to capital its race and you
 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.110
your cost to capital its race and you
know give back more than you take as

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120
know give back more than you take as
 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.410
know give back more than you take as
long as you can to as many people as you

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420
long as you can to as many people as you
 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.330
long as you can to as many people as you
can and and so on and so forth

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340
can and and so on and so forth
 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.620
can and and so on and so forth
so it's actually kind of neat in the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630
so it's actually kind of neat in the
 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.940
so it's actually kind of neat in the
sense of the parable the talents that

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950
sense of the parable the talents that
 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.310
sense of the parable the talents that
recipe or value creation actually maps

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320
recipe or value creation actually maps
 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.860
recipe or value creation actually maps
to the recipe for a reasonably

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870
to the recipe for a reasonably
 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.470
to the recipe for a reasonably
reasonably good life so that's one

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480
reasonably good life so that's one
 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.670
reasonably good life so that's one
example that there is like you know the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680
example that there is like you know the
 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.170
example that there is like you know the
book is littered with kind of basically

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180
book is littered with kind of basically
 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.150
book is littered with kind of basically
examples like that so one of the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160
examples like that so one of the
 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.030
examples like that so one of the
mechanisms by which finance is kind of

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040
mechanisms by which finance is kind of
 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.259
mechanisms by which finance is kind of
gone wrong is they've kind of made it

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269
gone wrong is they've kind of made it
 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.509
gone wrong is they've kind of made it
more complex than it needs to be and so

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519
more complex than it needs to be and so
 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.210
more complex than it needs to be and so
what I try to do in the book is tell

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220
what I try to do in the book is tell
 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.160
what I try to do in the book is tell
these stories from literature and

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170
these stories from literature and
 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.680
these stories from literature and
philosophy and history that actually

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690
philosophy and history that actually
 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.590
philosophy and history that actually
make the ideas really quite intuitive so

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600
make the ideas really quite intuitive so
 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.360
make the ideas really quite intuitive so
ideally you take a look at the book and

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370
ideally you take a look at the book and
 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.729
ideally you take a look at the book and
you kind of get a host of ideas the core

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739
you kind of get a host of ideas the core
 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.800
you kind of get a host of ideas the core
ideas of finance but just by reading

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810
ideas of finance but just by reading
 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.390
ideas of finance but just by reading
stories and I think that's a much more

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400
stories and I think that's a much more
 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.069
stories and I think that's a much more
powerful way for people to understand

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079
powerful way for people to understand
 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.170
powerful way for people to understand
finance and in that process of

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180
finance and in that process of
 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.780
finance and in that process of
demystification what I hope will happen

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790
demystification what I hope will happen
 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.610
demystification what I hope will happen
is people will feel empowered you know

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620
is people will feel empowered you know
 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.530
is people will feel empowered you know
they'll understand what finances they'll

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540
they'll understand what finances they'll
 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.380
they'll understand what finances they'll
understand what finance is doing and so

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390
understand what finance is doing and so
 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.090
understand what finance is doing and so
they'll a be more appreciative of the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100
they'll a be more appreciative of the
 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.530
they'll a be more appreciative of the
underlying functions even if it is

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540
underlying functions even if it is
 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.050
underlying functions even if it is
broken today but also feel more

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060
broken today but also feel more
 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.150
broken today but also feel more
empowered to talk about it and think

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160
empowered to talk about it and think
 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.100
empowered to talk about it and think
about it and confront people when

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110
about it and confront people when
 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.930
about it and confront people when
they're faced with it there are a bunch

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940
they're faced with it there are a bunch
 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.340
they're faced with it there are a bunch
of different ideas that are kind of core

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350
of different ideas that are kind of core
 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.289
of different ideas that are kind of core
to finance the most important one is

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299
to finance the most important one is
 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.569
to finance the most important one is
risk and insurance which is just to

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579
risk and insurance which is just to
 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:01.890
risk and insurance which is just to
really try to understand the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900
really try to understand the
 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.170
really try to understand the
omnipresence of risk and then to think

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180
omnipresence of risk and then to think
 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.360
omnipresence of risk and then to think
about how all the kinds of things that

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370
about how all the kinds of things that
 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.509
about how all the kinds of things that
pay off in life really the way they're

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519
pay off in life really the way they're
 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.940
pay off in life really the way they're
priced are a function of those risks

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950
priced are a function of those risks
 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.220
priced are a function of those risks
that they address and how they are

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230
that they address and how they are
 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.440
that they address and how they are
associated with those risks so that's a

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450
associated with those risks so that's a
 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.330
associated with those risks so that's a
really big idea in finance that

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340
really big idea in finance that
 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.529
really big idea in finance that
underlies the way we think about

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539
underlies the way we think about
 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.659
underlies the way we think about
security is another price the way we

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669
security is another price the way we
 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.610
security is another price the way we
think about chunks of corporate finance

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620
think about chunks of corporate finance
 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.430
think about chunks of corporate finance
and that's a really core idea so for

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440
and that's a really core idea so for
 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.720
and that's a really core idea so for
example to think about risk and

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730
example to think about risk and
 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.190
example to think about risk and
insurance and to think about the

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200
insurance and to think about the
 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.650
insurance and to think about the
omnipresence of risk I use these two

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660
omnipresence of risk I use these two
 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.780
omnipresence of risk I use these two
folks who are really fun this

folks who are really fun this
philosopher Charles Sanders person and

philosopher Charles Sanders person and
this poet Wallace Stevens so by using

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220
this poet Wallace Stevens so by using
 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.790
this poet Wallace Stevens so by using
people like that people who actually

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800
people like that people who actually
 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.100
people like that people who actually
really deeply appreciated risk and

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110
really deeply appreciated risk and
 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.780
really deeply appreciated risk and
insurance but people who you would never

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790
insurance but people who you would never
 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.090
insurance but people who you would never
expect to be in a finance book I think

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100
expect to be in a finance book I think
 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.680
expect to be in a finance book I think
you can actually explore the idea of

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690
you can actually explore the idea of
 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.390
you can actually explore the idea of
risk and insurance in a different kind

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400
risk and insurance in a different kind
 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.090
risk and insurance in a different kind
of way their various misconceptions so

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100
of way their various misconceptions so
 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.730
of way their various misconceptions so
the first is about risk is somehow that

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740
the first is about risk is somehow that
 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.080
the first is about risk is somehow that
it is complete randomness actually risk

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090
it is complete randomness actually risk
 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.720
it is complete randomness actually risk
is something that can be understood

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730
is something that can be understood
 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.700
is something that can be understood
there are patterns and it can be managed

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710
there are patterns and it can be managed
 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.280
there are patterns and it can be managed
so in fact that is what finances stance

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290
so in fact that is what finances stance
 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.770
so in fact that is what finances stance
is all about those patterns about those

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780
is all about those patterns about those
 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.930
is all about those patterns about those
regularities and then figuring out how

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940
regularities and then figuring out how
 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.510
regularities and then figuring out how
to manage in that world so risk is not

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520
to manage in that world so risk is not
 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.760
to manage in that world so risk is not
really randomness risk is you don't know

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770
really randomness risk is you don't know
 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.020
really randomness risk is you don't know
what the particular outcome is going to

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030
what the particular outcome is going to
 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.240
what the particular outcome is going to
be but there can be all these patterns

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250
be but there can be all these patterns
 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.710
be but there can be all these patterns
in life that can actually help us

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720
in life that can actually help us
 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.159
in life that can actually help us
navigate what seems like chaos so and in

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169
navigate what seems like chaos so and in
 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.570
navigate what seems like chaos so and in
fact that is exactly what insurance

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580
fact that is exactly what insurance
 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.860
fact that is exactly what insurance
companies do and that's what a lot of

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870
companies do and that's what a lot of
 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.510
companies do and that's what a lot of
people in finance do is try to make

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520
people in finance do is try to make
 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.070
people in finance do is try to make
sense of the chaos of the world by

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080
sense of the chaos of the world by
 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.740
sense of the chaos of the world by
exploring those regularities and in fact

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750
exploring those regularities and in fact
 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.140
exploring those regularities and in fact
that's exactly why charles sanders purse

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150
that's exactly why charles sanders purse
 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.540
that's exactly why charles sanders purse
who's this philosopher i mentioned

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550
who's this philosopher i mentioned
 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.820
who's this philosopher i mentioned
actually said near the end of his life

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830
actually said near the end of his life
 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.710

he just kept walking around everywhere

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720
he just kept walking around everywhere
 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.150
he just kept walking around everywhere
saying you know we are all insurance

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160
saying you know we are all insurance
 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.550
saying you know we are all insurance
companies because we are all insurance

sense of the chaos and he was the

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100
sense of the chaos and he was the
 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.700
sense of the chaos and he was the
founder of pragmatism and so his recipe

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710
founder of pragmatism and so his recipe
 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.010
founder of pragmatism and so his recipe
for figure out the chaos was you sample

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020
for figure out the chaos was you sample
 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.310
for figure out the chaos was you sample
you try you try everything which is a

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320
you try you try everything which is a
 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.380
you try you try everything which is a
pragmatic approach to life it's also the

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390
pragmatic approach to life it's also the
 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.270
pragmatic approach to life it's also the
approach that insurance companies take

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280
approach that insurance companies take
 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.940
approach that insurance companies take
so well once you kind of come to terms

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950
so well once you kind of come to terms
 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.560
so well once you kind of come to terms
with the omnipresence of risk then you

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570
with the omnipresence of risk then you
 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.450
with the omnipresence of risk then you
kind of think about risk management and

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460
kind of think about risk management and
 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.030
kind of think about risk management and
in particular hedging and one of the

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040
in particular hedging and one of the
 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.640
in particular hedging and one of the
counterintuitive pieces of this is there

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650
counterintuitive pieces of this is there
 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.960
counterintuitive pieces of this is there
are these things that help you manage

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970
are these things that help you manage
 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.270
are these things that help you manage
risks things like diversification things

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280
risks things like diversification things
 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.909
risks things like diversification things
like options people get a little

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919
like options people get a little
 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:23.080
like options people get a little
confused about that because they think

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090
confused about that because they think
 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.969
confused about that because they think
they're an end in and of itself like

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979
they're an end in and of itself like
 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:27.820
they're an end in and of itself like
you're just trying to prevent risks from

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830
you're just trying to prevent risks from
 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.830
you're just trying to prevent risks from
affecting you you know in reality those

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840
affecting you you know in reality those
 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.450
affecting you you know in reality those
are instruments which allow you to take

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460
are instruments which allow you to take
 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.630
are instruments which allow you to take
bigger risks right so you can take you

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640
bigger risks right so you can take you
 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.250
bigger risks right so you can take you
can buy little insurance and then that

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260
can buy little insurance and then that
 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.250
can buy little insurance and then that
allows you to take the

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260
allows you to take the
 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.170
allows you to take the
your bets in life so for example and

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180
your bets in life so for example and
 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.080
your bets in life so for example and
options people think options as in

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090
options people think options as in
 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.110
options people think options as in
financial options are Gamble's you know

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120
financial options are Gamble's you know
 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.690
financial options are Gamble's you know
they can be but in reality the way we

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:47.700
they can be but in reality the way we
 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.310
they can be but in reality the way we
typically think about using options in

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320
typically think about using options in
 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.170

finances has insurance and it's

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180
finances has insurance and it's
 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.870
finances has insurance and it's
protection and that protection allows

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880
protection and that protection allows
 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.480
protection and that protection allows
you to take bigger kind of idiosyncratic

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.490
you to take bigger kind of idiosyncratic
 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.150
you to take bigger kind of idiosyncratic
bets because you have these options that

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160
bets because you have these options that
 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.410
bets because you have these options that
