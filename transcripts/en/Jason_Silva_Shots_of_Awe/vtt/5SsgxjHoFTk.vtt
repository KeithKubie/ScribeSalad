JASON SILVA: So I
feel like there's

00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:15.104
a connection between the human
desire to lose ourselves,

00:00:15.104 --> 00:00:17.465
and the human desire
to be enveloped

00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:20.691
by a technologically-mediated
environment.

00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:24.890
The reason why higher
fidelity, sense surround

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.146
sound, the ultimate Bose
speakers or Beats speakers,

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:33.430
we want to raise the caliber,
the intensity, the fidelity,

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.194
the resolution of the signal
that mediates us so that we

00:00:36.194 --> 00:00:38.940
can lose ourselves in it.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.340
There's something about
the dissolution of self,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.315
technologically-mediated
ecstasy that we crave.

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:47.870
It's why we go see
enormous IMAX films.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.912
It's why we used to go
to the Gothic cathedral.

00:00:50.912 --> 00:00:54.060
It's why we're chasing these
technologically-mediated highs.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.640
It's why the trope
high is associated

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.080
both with drug binges as
well as with high technology,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.670
high resolution, high
fidelity, high, high, high.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.881
Human beings want to
mediate their encounters

00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:09.260
with the other, with
logos, with dream space.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.900
And I think that our urge to
create better technologies

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.945
is a reflection of this
desire to transfigurate,

00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:20.105
to have feverish hunts for
rebirth, to have catharsis,

00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:22.495
to have illumination,
to become one

00:01:22.495 --> 00:01:26.640
with everything, to dissolve
and to reconstitute.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.180
That's just what
it means to be us.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.460
That's the human story.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.140
That's what we do, and that's
reflected in our shopping

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.190
habits in our hi-tech world.
