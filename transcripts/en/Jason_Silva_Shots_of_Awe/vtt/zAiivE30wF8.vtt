00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.360
SUBJECT: So I believe
that we are all wounded.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.080
I believe that we
are all bleeding.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.660
And I think the reason
that in romantic context

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.715
we are attracted to
others who are wounded

00:00:28.715 --> 00:00:32.400
is because we feel that
by saving them, we in turn

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.360
save ourselves, right?

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.240
Romantic love as
defined by Ernest Becker

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.400
is a perfect consummation
with perfection itself.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.280
We are purged in these
instances in which we

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.390
find another in whose eyes we
will be reflected and saved,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.890
right?

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.130
This notion that we will see
ourselves being seen by another

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.510
who bestows us with light.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.945
And ultimately, the crux
of the human condition,

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:06.300
the existential
impotence, of you will,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.160
is the perhaps
tragic realization

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.190
that you can't save
the ones you love.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.946
Those wounded birds, the
manic pixie dream girl--

00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:16.750
you can't save her.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.727
So what does that mean?

00:01:17.727 --> 00:01:20.310
It means if you can't even save
the ones you love, how can you

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.110
save yourself, right?

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.670
This is the tragedy of
the human condition.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.990
This is the sad song that
gives you the goosebumps

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.540
and makes you cry.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.610
This is the lyric that
makes you tear up.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.520
It is this acknowledgement
of something

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.730
that aches, of something that
is, of something that we wish

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.240
was not the case.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.750
There is beauty in
this tragedy, but first

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.780
let us acknowledge
the tragedy of it.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.730
And then we can make
a poem or make a video

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.755
or make a film to frame that
holy moment to at least cement

00:01:58.755 --> 00:02:01.875
the tragedy by
saying, it happened.

00:02:01.875 --> 00:02:03.100
We exist.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.918
We felt something.

00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:09.541
I've talked about
this before, but ugh.

00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:10.415
It's why we make art.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.120
"City Verite" is a
weekly series that

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.850
illuminates the life
and beauty of a city

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.930
by capturing a series of
breathtaking, intimate,

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.030
and eye catching moments
from a single day.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.960
It shows the amazing yet
everyday elements and sights

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.220
that make places like
Brooklyn, Buenos Aries,

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.610
and Mumbai feel like
bringing things.
