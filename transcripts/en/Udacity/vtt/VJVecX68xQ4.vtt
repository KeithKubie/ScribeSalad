00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.540
Well it turns out it would be best to subtract 30a from both sides. I know

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.380
there's a lot of different options here, so let's see why. We've seen factoring

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.418
quadratic equations in this form. The variable was x and the numbers were a, b,

00:00:10.418 --> 00:00:19.179
and c. In this case, my variable isn't x. It's a. And my numbers are 2, 30, and

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:25.504
112. If I can move this 30a to the other side, then I'll have my quadratic in

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:30.774
this form. 30a is not like with a squared or 112. So, I'm going to list it here,

00:00:30.774 --> 00:00:35.436
so that way it falls in the middle of the 2 terms. I'll get 0 on the right, and

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:41.051
then 2a squared, minus 30a, plus 112 on the left. Now this is something I'm

00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:43.113
familiar with and we can factor it.
