00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:03.236
Oh, what's up?
- All right.

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:04.504
- You good?
- Who's this?

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:06.172
- Oh, this, uh,
Michelle, my n---a,

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:08.174
this my n---a, James--
- Michelle Nychole.

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:10.810
 - That's Michelle Nychole,
 Stevie's ex.

00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:13.813
 And just like the 2Pac movie,
 she's gang related.

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:15.481
Michelle Nychole
has the same problem

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:16.983
as many female gang members.

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:19.052
She can't seem to
meet the right guy,

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.520
and get up out that life.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.255
- The guys that
Michelle attracts

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:23.856
and that she's attracted to

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:26.125
bring just more
drama in her life.

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:28.027
D--she's always--
- Like what you did.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.196
- I mean, yeah, but
I--I'm a hood n---a,

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.831
so, like, you feel me?

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:33.399
Like, I--I ain't exempt
from what I'm saying.

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:35.034
- [laughs]
- You know what I'm saying?

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:36.836
I'm just saying, you should

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.704
date a different type of dude--

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:40.807
or--and/or girl,
you know how you get down.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.142
- What are some deal breakers?
- Gay.

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:44.944
- Gay, okay.

00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:46.179
But aren't you bi?

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.647
- Yes.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.848
- I get it.

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:50.683
What's the best date you had

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:53.619
with a hard, banged-out?

00:00:53.652 --> 00:00:55.288
- The best date I had was...
- Was with me.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.823
We was breaking in
cars that night.

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.391
- How you know
what I was gonna say?

00:00:58.424 --> 00:00:59.859
- 'Cause I already know.
'Cause it was when...

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:01.127
- Is this real?
Is this really real?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.995
- So we breaking in cars, right?

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:05.064
I'm like, "Baby, you need some
beat for your whip." She like...

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:06.432
- I did, in my Honda.
- "Hell yeah, I need some beat."

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:08.101
I see one, boom.
It got beat, right?

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:09.635
So I crack it, bam.
Right, I get in there, right?

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:11.170
I'm just like,
"Come on, come on, come on."

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:13.239
It was, like, exciting--
 [bell dings]

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:15.208
 - The views of Stevie J and
 Michelle Nychole in no way

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.542
 reflect the views of
 James Davis, Comedy Central,

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:18.377
 or its parent company Viacom.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.712
Let's face it: robbery dates
just aren't healthy.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:21.214
Homegirl needs our help.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.116
We're gonna set you up
on a speed date.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.984
We're gonna get you
some other options.

00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:26.319
That's what we're gonna do--
- And calm down, too.

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.020
Don't be aggressive
in your dates.

00:01:28.053 --> 00:01:29.689
Just be you.
- I'm like--

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:31.124
- I'm not saying
change Michelle Nychole.

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.126
But I'm just saying
don't scare 'em off

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.427
'cause you know how you get...
- How am I supposed to know?

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.795
- Don't hit nobody.
Just relax.

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:37.396
- I'm not gonna hit nobody.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:38.931
- You--you sure?

00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:42.135
- No promise is
meant to be broken.

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:44.070
 - Time for Michelle Nychole

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:46.539
 to dive into
 a whole new dating pool.

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:47.740
- Hello, I'm Zack!

00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:49.475
- Oh, wow.

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:51.444
- Am I coming in too hot?
- Uh, yeah, you just...

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:53.713
- I'm sorry, I just--
- A little loud, it's crazy.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:54.881
- You know, I just get excited.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.582
- Joey. Nice to meet you.

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:58.151
- Michelle Nychole.
- Oh, I love that name.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.819
I also like those
burgundy J's you got on.

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:01.154
I got some white ones.
I just got 'em.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.622
- Nice!
- Okay, okay.

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.690
- He winning, we good.
- Jordan talk.

00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:06.359
- Let me see 'em.
- Well, they're J's.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.693
They're not, like,
one of the number ones,

00:02:07.726 --> 00:02:08.794
but Jordan's on it...

00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:10.363
- What are those?

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:11.764
- You got two kids?

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:13.266
- Two children.
I'm not a billy goat.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.101
- I am a comic book dealer.

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:16.702
- We said no dealers,

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:18.070
but I guess
we can make an exception.

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:19.805
- If a guy touched my ass,

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:21.507
would you fight him?

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.242
- What kind of guy
are we talking about here?

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:24.610
- What do you mean what kind
of guy, does it matter?

00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:25.845
Because if a girl
touched your ass,

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:27.413
then I'd whoop her ass.

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:28.981
So you not gonna stand up
for a man for me?

00:02:29.014 --> 00:02:31.284
- No, I--I would,
you know, say something.

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.986
- What the [BLEEP]
are your hands doing, bro?

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.622
- Um, so my nails, uh,

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:38.424
I fell asleep at the manicurist,

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:40.660
and, uh, my friends pranked me.

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:43.062
They paid $20
for them to get painted.

00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:46.799
Do--can I see your nails?
[soft laugh]

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:48.601
Oh, wow, those are nice.
Did you...

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:50.269
- You're lying, because
I bite my [BLEEP] nails.

00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:51.837
Now you're a liar.
- I'm not lying.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.206
I would never--I wouldn't--

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.874
- You just told me
my nails are nice.

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:57.310
And I know I have [BLEEP] nubs,
so you're a liar.

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:58.945
[laughter]

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.413
I like Roscoe's.

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.814
Maybe we can, uh,
meet up at Roscoe's.

00:03:01.847 --> 00:03:03.015
- Yeah, anytime, you know?

00:03:03.048 --> 00:03:05.084
Like, for real, get my number.

00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:06.452
- Oh, this is happening.

00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:08.321
It looked Vin Not-So-Diesel

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:10.156
was closing the deal.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.825
But you'll never guess
who Michelle Nychole chose.

00:03:12.858 --> 00:03:14.860
- You're low-key hot.
[soft laugh]

00:03:14.893 --> 00:03:17.563
 [bomb drops]
 - She chose Zach, y'all.

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:18.564
So I hooked Zach
and Michelle Nychole up

00:03:18.597 --> 00:03:19.932
with a his and her spa date.

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:22.101
Swag.

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:24.837
 - My first impression
 of Michelle Nychole was, uh,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.405
she's super intimidating,

00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:27.807
but, like, also, like
super attractive,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.475
just, like, so smart.

00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:32.144
I've never met someone in a gang
or around a gang.

00:03:32.177 --> 00:03:34.447
Uh, but I think it's cool
that she's a part of one.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.749
 [laughter]

00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:39.752
 [upbeat music]

00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:41.787
This is definitely
my first time dating a mom.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.724
I think it's cool
that she's so responsible and...

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.993
- Hey, guys, Michelle--
[soft chuckle]

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:49.528
Michelle Nychole, uh,
got arrested.

00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:51.330
- Are you serious?

00:03:51.363 --> 00:03:52.965
Michelle Nychole got arrested.

00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:55.798
- She's not here
because she's in jail, so.
