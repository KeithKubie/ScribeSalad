00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, here's my solution to the 3rd substitution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We've got our new string that takes these name substitution variables,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and this time, it uses our function parameters and substitutes those into the string.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's make sure this works.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I run this with a couple things and it says, I'm maverick.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
My real name is steve, but my friends call me maverick. Cool.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now as you can see, this one is more complex,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and it's starting to resemble something that might be useful to us.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Of course, this whole string got cut off a little bit, but it's over here on the edge.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Alright. Okay, let's talk about how to use this in practice now.
