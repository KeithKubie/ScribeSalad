00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.376
So we spent so long talking about what CUDA doesn't guarantee,

00:00:02.376 --> 00:00:04.514
you may be wondering what CUDA does guarantee.

00:00:04.514 --> 00:00:06.209
There are 2 main things.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:10.385
Again, recall that all the threads in the block are guaranteed to run on the same SM at the same time.

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:15.552
Second, all blocks in the kernel finish before any blocks from the next kernel are launched.

00:00:15.552 --> 00:00:17.893
This goes back to our programming model diagram

00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:20.657
where you'll remember, we had some threads running one kernel, say foo,

00:00:20.657 --> 00:00:23.628
and then some threads running another kernel, let's say bar.

00:00:23.628 --> 00:00:27.315
So what CUDA is promising is any threads running foo will finish

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:31.660
in their entirety before any threads running bar are launched.
