that we've seen on the CW in terms of
 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.260 align:start position:0%
that we've seen on the CW in terms of

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 align:start position:0%
the flare over right now absolute it
 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.730 align:start position:0%
the flare over right now absolute it
seems<00:02:38.450><c> like</c><00:02:38.570><c> it</c><00:02:38.690><c> would</c><00:02:38.750><c> be</c><00:02:38.810><c> a</c><00:02:38.930><c> strong</c><00:02:39.290><c> addition</c>

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 align:start position:0%
seems like it would be a strong addition
 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.510 align:start position:0%
seems like it would be a strong addition
to<00:02:40.340><c> the</c><00:02:40.490><c> team</c><00:02:40.760><c> because</c><00:02:41.690><c> you</c><00:02:41.840><c> have</c><00:02:42.020><c> the</c><00:02:42.920><c> serious</c>

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
to the team because you have the serious
 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.870 align:start position:0%
to the team because you have the serious
arrow<00:02:43.900><c> flash</c><00:02:44.900><c> which</c><00:02:45.350><c> is</c><00:02:45.530><c> a</c><00:02:45.560><c> little</c><00:02:45.890><c> bit</c><00:02:46.220><c> it's</c><00:02:46.730><c> a</c>

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
arrow flash which is a little bit it's a
 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
arrow flash which is a little bit it's a
great<00:02:47.150><c> mix</c><00:02:47.450><c> between</c><00:02:47.690><c> the</c><00:02:47.959><c> humerus</c><00:02:48.350><c> and</c><00:02:48.440><c> the</c>

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 align:start position:0%
great mix between the humerus and the
 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
great mix between the humerus and the
serious<00:02:48.980><c> and</c><00:02:49.280><c> then</c><00:02:49.459><c> Legends</c><00:02:49.910><c> which</c><00:02:50.239><c> is</c><00:02:50.420><c> just</c>

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 align:start position:0%
serious and then Legends which is just
 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:58.229 align:start position:0%
serious and then Legends which is just
insane<00:02:52.070><c> it</c><00:02:52.520><c> embraces</c><00:02:53.090><c> the</c><00:02:53.209><c> in</c><00:02:53.330><c> Santa</c><00:02:53.660><c> oh</c><00:02:53.750><c> yeah</c>

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:02:59.239><c> Black</c><00:02:59.570><c> Lightning</c><00:02:59.810><c> seems</c><00:03:00.500><c> as</c><00:03:00.709><c> though</c><00:03:00.890><c> it</c><00:03:01.100><c> is</c>

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 align:start position:0%
so Black Lightning seems as though it is
 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
