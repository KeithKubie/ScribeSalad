00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.980
Hey, evolution, why aren't giant pets a thing
yet, huh?

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.549
If dinosaurs grew enough to fill a whole room,
why can’t I have a big red dog the size

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:09.549
of a house?

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.900
Well, they would take room sized poops though.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.250
Hey everyone, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.800
Part of what captures our imagination about
dinosaurs is just how huge some of them were.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.160
The American Museum of Natural History has
a cast of a titanosaur that’s so big it

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.600
doesn’t completely fit in the dinosaur wing.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.060
The 37 meter (122 foot) long behemoth’s
head has to poke out towards the elevators.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.560
It’s got individual bones bigger than people.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.980
The very name of the group of dinosaurs it
belongs to has the word TITAN in it.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.060
But when you start to consider the size of
some of these extinct species, it can make

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.310
you a philoso-raptor.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.110
“Why isn’t any land animal this huge today?”
you may wonder...

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.880
Well you’re not the only one.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.829
Paleontologists have been debating the same
question, and they’ve come up with a number

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.489
of different factors that could explain why
some giant reptiles of yesteryear dwarf modern

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:04.489
land creatures.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.010
It’s important to keep in mind that dinosaurs
lived a long time ago.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.010
No duh, right?

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.220
But what you may not realize is, before the
dinosaurs were wiped out they were living

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.190
on a completely different kind of earth than
we live in today.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.130
Dinosaurs actually started coming onto the
scene about 230 million years before present.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.510
During their existence, CO2 levels were all
over the place.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.260
Estimates vary but (for some stretches) there
could have been 3 to 5 times as much carbon

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.700
dioxide in the atmosphere as there is today.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.689
This means the world, on the whole, was a
lot hotter - even up at higher latitudes.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.830
And, because at the beginning of the Mesozoic
Era, all land was clumped together in Pangea,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.810
the ocean didn’t have as much of a cooling
effect on the supercontinent.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.710
This would make the planet a more hospitable
place for, I don’t know, giant cold-blooded

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.000
reptiles that wouldn’t have to waste energy
maintaining body heat.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.060
See... another reason to worry about global
warming.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.520
Get out of that SUV and onto a bike unless
you want to see T-rexes in your sideview mirror.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.600
It may comfort you to know that paleontologists
aren’t all in agreement on the exactly how

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.380
much the atmosphere’s impacted dinosaur
size.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.030
It could have had no effect at all, and whether
or not dinosaurs were all cold-blooded, is

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.020
even up for debate.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.860
Their size could have also been driven by
an abundance of food.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.160
All that CO2 meant there was likely more vegetation.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.940
If there’s plentiful vegetation, then large
herbivores can thrive.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.069
They’d actually benefit from being bigger
because longer intestines would be better

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.500
at breaking down plant matter and extracting
its nutrients.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.069
Then... they could spend less time chewing,
and more time stuffing green down their giant

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.069
gullets.

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.890
Also if the herbivores grew larger, then they
were harder for predators to take down.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.270
Until the predators got bigger.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.400
Then the herbivores would get bigger.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.370
Then the predators would get bigger.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.590
You see where this is going.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.300
But there is an upper limit to size, because
of physical constraints -- like gravity.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.160
Part of the reason whales can get so huge
is because the ocean supports their weight.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.220
On land, a similar sized animal would crush
itself without some clever life hacks.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.430
Huge dinosaurs like sauropods had lightweight
bones compared to mammals because theirs were

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.870
hollow.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.810
Dinosaurs also had another advantage over
mammals, when it comes to living large: they

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.810
laid eggs.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.739
If they had to give birth to live young, it
would be much harder for them to have large

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:18.970
offspring quickly.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.750
For instance, elephants have 22 month gestation
periods… they can't breed very quickly because

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.090
live-birth is so resource intensive -- and
it requires a large birth canal.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.310
Interestingly, these traits of hollow bones
and egg-laying have come in handy in a very

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.630
different way today: they make it possible
for the descendants of dinosaurs to fly.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.540
That’s right, I’m talking ‘bout birds.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.240
Look, WHY they were so big is still a matter
of debate, and hopefully we'll find more research

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.790
out there… but at the moment they’re trying
to put together a hundred-million-year-old

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.140
puzzle with a lot of missing pieces.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.230

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.260
Seriously, though, dinosaurs equal birds.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:10.920
Here’s a video all about their gradual shift
from ferocious predators to feathered peckers.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:21.629
So are you glad giant reptiles no longer run
amok, or would you want a pet raptor?

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:25.389
Maybe tie a bandana ‘round it’s neck,
name her Clover.

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.330
She would be the best dino ever.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.330
Yes she would.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.999
Yes she would.
