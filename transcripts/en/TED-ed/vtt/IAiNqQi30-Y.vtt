00:00:06.698 --> 00:00:08.698
When the Wright brothers
had to decide

00:00:08.698 --> 00:00:11.840
who would be the first to 
fly their new airplane

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.640
off a sand dune, 
they flipped a coin.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.459
That was fair:

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.188
we all know there’s an equal chance 
of getting heads and tails.

00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:22.080
But what if they had 
a more complicated contest?

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.500
What if they flipped&nbsp;coins&nbsp;repeatedly,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.381
so that Orville would win as soon as 
two heads showed up in a row&nbsp;on his coin,

00:00:29.381 --> 00:00:35.260
and Wilbur would win as soon as heads 
was immediately followed by tails&nbsp;on his?

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.685
Would each brother still have had an equal
chance to be the first in flight?

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:44.580
At first, it may seem they’d still have 
the same chance of winning.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.142
There are four combinations
for two consecutive flips.

00:00:48.142 --> 00:00:50.281
And if you do flip a coin just twice,

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:54.351
there’s an equal chance 
of each one -- 25%.

00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:58.461
So your intuition might tell you 
that in any string of coin flips,

00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:02.374
each combination would have 
the same shot at appearing first.

00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:04.963
Unfortunately, you’d be wrong.

00:01:04.963 --> 00:01:08.993
Wilbur actually has
a big advantage in this contest.

00:01:08.993 --> 00:01:12.432
Imagine our sequence of coin flips 
as a sort of board game,

00:01:12.432 --> 00:01:15.684
where every flip determines which
path we take.

00:01:15.684 --> 00:01:18.664
The goal is to get from start to finish.

00:01:18.664 --> 00:01:21.705
The heads/tails board looks like this.

00:01:21.705 --> 00:01:24.405
And this is the head/head board.

00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:26.393
There’s one critical difference.

00:01:26.393 --> 00:01:30.706
Heads/heads has a move that sends you 
all the way back to the start

00:01:30.706 --> 00:01:33.503
that heads/tails doesn’t have.

00:01:33.503 --> 00:01:36.904
That’s why heads/heads
takes longer on average.

00:01:36.904 --> 00:01:41.485
So we can demonstrate that this is true
using probability and algebra

00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:46.835
to calculate the average number of flips
it would take to get each combination.

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:49.074
Let’s start with the heads/tails board,

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:53.404
and define x to be the average 
number of flips to advance one step.

00:01:53.404 --> 00:01:56.144
Focus only on the arrows.

00:01:56.144 --> 00:01:58.316
It has two identical steps,

00:01:58.316 --> 00:02:02.693
each with a 50/50 chance of staying 
in place or moving forward.

00:02:02.693 --> 00:02:09.114
Option 1: If we stay in place by getting 
tails, we waste one flip.

00:02:09.114 --> 00:02:10.846
Since we’re back in the same place,

00:02:10.846 --> 00:02:15.374
on average we must flip x more times 
to advance one step.

00:02:15.374 --> 00:02:17.286
Together with that first flip,

00:02:17.286 --> 00:02:22.306
this gives an average of x + 1 
total flips to advance.

00:02:22.306 --> 00:02:26.254
Option 2: If we get heads 
and move forward,

00:02:26.254 --> 00:02:30.726
then we have taken exactly one total flip 
to advance one step.

00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:35.125
We can now combine option 1 
and option 2 with their probabilities

00:02:35.125 --> 00:02:37.165
to get this expression.

00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:42.368
Solving that for x gives us an average 
of two moves to advance one step.

00:02:42.368 --> 00:02:44.667
Since each step is identical,

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:50.348
we can multiply by two and arrive
at four flips to advance two steps.

00:02:50.348 --> 00:02:53.666
For heads/heads, 
the picture isn’t as simple.

00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:59.196
This time, let y be the average number 
of flips to move from start to finish.

00:02:59.196 --> 00:03:03.318
There are two options for the first move, 
each with 50/50 odds.

00:03:03.318 --> 00:03:05.719
Option 1 is the same as before,

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.067
getting tails sends us back to the start,

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:12.499
giving an average 
of y+1 total flips to finish.

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:17.258
In Option 2, there are two equally 
likely cases for the next flip.

00:03:17.258 --> 00:03:20.550
With heads we’d be done after two flips.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.609
But tails would return us to the start.

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.990
Since we’d return after two flips,

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.200
we’d then need an average
of y+2 flips in total to finish.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.011
So our full expression will be this.

00:03:35.011 --> 00:03:38.021
And solving this equation 
gives us six flips.

00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:43.361
So the math calculates that it takes an
average of six flips to get heads/heads,

00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:46.960
and an average of four 
to get heads/tails.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.561
And, in fact, that’s what you’d see if you
tested it for yourself enough times.

00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:55.771
Of course, the Wright brothers didn’t 
need to work all this out;

00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:59.462
they only flipped the coin once,
and Wilbur won.

00:03:59.462 --> 00:04:02.832
But it didn’t matter: 
Wilbur’s flight failed,

00:04:02.832 --> 00:04:05.961
and Orville made 
aviation history, instead.

00:04:05.961 --> 00:04:07.432
Tough luck, Wilbur.
