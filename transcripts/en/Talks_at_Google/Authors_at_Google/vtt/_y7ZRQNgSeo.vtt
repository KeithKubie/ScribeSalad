BRUCE: On behalf of the Reading
Odyssey and Collaborative

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.620
Gain and Google, to this
special presentation

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.260
of "Julius Caesar," one of the
greatest works of all time.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.436
It's kind of fitting that we're
presenting this book at Google

00:00:21.436 --> 00:00:23.060
within the entire
tech community, which

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.530
puts such a big emphasis
on product experience

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.120
and user experience and design.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.310
These books-- I
met Bob Strassler,

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.080
the series editor,
10 years ago when

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.000
I was a reporter at "Forbes."

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.770
Now I'm in PR, if
you will, because it

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.990
was an amazing story of an
entrepreneur, if you will,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.650
or someone who had retired
and saw a need in the market

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.240
for essentially, a
usable classics series.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.800
Because the books that everyone
was using for almost 100 years,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.317
those Penguin
editions are dense.

00:00:55.317 --> 00:00:56.900
There's maybe one
map in the beginning

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.520
with dozens of labels on it.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.180
No footnotes.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.882
No context.

00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:02.340
And you're just thrown into it
as a student in high school.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.636
And obviously, it turns
off a lot of people,

00:01:04.636 --> 00:01:06.260
and they never get
back to the classics

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.300
again, which is a huge loss.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.400
So Bob said, wait.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.020
I can fix that.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.790
So he took his own
money and decided

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.250
to design an edition
that had all of that.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.590
Every page would be
dripping with context.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.010
There'd be a place, a time,
footnotes, side notes,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.960
pictures, maps in context.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.790
He did it all by hand, hired a
few people out of the academia

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.260
after getting a
lot of rejections

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.110
from university professors
saying, you can't do this.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.070
You're an amateur.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.528
Well, that's usually
the best kinds

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:37.010
of people, the
passionate amateur.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.810
So this series came out.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.030
The first edition came
out almost 20 years ago,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.584
"Landmark Thucydides."

00:01:42.584 --> 00:01:44.000
I caught up with
Bob 10 years ago,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.190
and he was just putting
out a second one, "Landmark

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.750
Herodotus."

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.430
And since then, there's
been at least two more.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.900
This is the fifth, I think.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.890
And it's one of the bestselling
classics series of all time.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.387
So without further ado, I
won't give any much more away,

00:01:57.387 --> 00:01:59.720
because Bob will tell you the
story of how it all began.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.090
And we'll hear a
lot from the editor

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.610
of this particular volume,
Kurt, who's here as well.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.060
A professor from Brown, who's
one of the world's experts

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.988
on Caesar, to tell you
the story behind the book.

00:02:10.988 --> 00:02:14.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.380
ROBERT STRASSLER:
Thank you, Bruce.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.830
It's a pleasure
to be here today.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.700
I am proposing to spend
a little further time

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.890
on what Landmark books are.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.610
And to explain why and
how they were determined

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.140
to be the way they are.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.060
And how we hope to accomplish
certain things with them.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.070
And then after that, we'll
talk about the challenges

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.650
to Landmark books
that were posed

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.560
by the immense amount
of data that is known

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.924
about Caesar and his world.

00:02:45.924 --> 00:02:47.340
We were delighted
with the amount.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.680
And then we were
drowned in the amount

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.620
and we had to flounder
with it a while.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.184
We came up, we hope,
with an optimum solution.

00:02:56.184 --> 00:02:57.600
And then if I have
time, I'm going

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.750
to talk about
Caesar as a general.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.230
Illustrate some of his skills,
looking at three battles

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.450
that he undertook.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.120
In each, his role
is quite different.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.930
They're quite different battles.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.810
And the third one, he
didn't write this narrative.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.260
It was written by an unknown
author who was clearly

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.630
an eyewitness and
very likely is thought

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.560
to be an officer in his
army at that third battle.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.440
I hope we get to
all of them, but I'm

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.470
determined to give Kurt
Raaflaub, my colleague

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.030
here, all of his time that
he certainly well deserves.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.650
So let's talk about
the Landmark books.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.530
It occurred to me
about 30 years ago,

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.410
when I was doing a little
teaching at a place called

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.880
Simon's Rock of Bard College.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.080
I discovered that my
students had difficulty

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.310
dealing with the histories.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.600
They handled Homer.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.090
They handled the poetry.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.835
They handled the
plays, which were often

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:59.160
very foreign in content.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.920
And they'd come to
Herodotus and Thucydides

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.600
and you'd think, well,
that's duck soup.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.420
It reads like a history,
which it does because they

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.060
set the paradigm of histories.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.010
We write the way
they wrote history.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.580
And I would watch with
dismay as one by one,

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.250
the eyes of the students
would glaze over.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.990
And you'd see that
they were lost,

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.490
and they couldn't
keep up with it,

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.720
and didn't know from where this
happened and why that happened.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.800
And I decided that it was a
problem of the two editions

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.820
that we had for students,
Modern Library and Penguin.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.010
Those are both very
good translations.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.700
But in the volume, they
are simply black pages.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.670
As Bruce said, there are
no appendices worth a damn.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.030
The maps are in the back,
a little section where

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.910
pretty soon you stop going
because the names on the maps

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.540
are not spelled the same way
as the names in the text.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.030
And so you're never sure
if this is the right place.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.280
And what's more, some
of them are modern maps

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.870
and the places have moved.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.640
And in a lot of ways, they're
just less help than harm.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.070
And most students,
I think, just stop

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.170
using them because they're
difficult to get to

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.070
and they provide little in the
way of additional information.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.840
And in addition,
there are things

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.780
that go on in the ancient world
which puzzled modern readers.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.320
Why not?

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.330
What can they be expected to
know about a religion that

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.850
has animal sacrifice?

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.490
It sounds sort of primitive,
and brutal, and nasty.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.260
And certainly, foreign.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.100
Or the problems, let's say, of
a very complex political system

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.210
like Rome's political system in
the last years of the Republic.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:43.140
Or the problems of running
a boat with the engine being

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.770
175 people rowing it who
need to be fed and slept

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.170
and all kinds of
things every night.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.400
So these are difficulties that
even the most astute and I

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.930
would say well-educated, but not
classics-educated modern reader

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.690
is going to need help to
figure out what's going on.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.220
So those gaps in knowledge,
those gaps in culture,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.320
have to be somehow filled.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.650
And we determined to fill
them in the Landmark books.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.810
We have explanatory footnotes.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.100
Let me show you this guy here.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.810
We'll get to him in a minute.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.470
We have explanatory footnotes.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.310
For real questions like, what
is religion in the pagan world,

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.620
we have an appendix
in the back--

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.410
In this case, not in the
back, but on the web--

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.610
that the reader can go to get
as much information as he wants.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.040
We have maps that
are clear and that

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.900
are embedded in the
text within a page

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.940
or two of the relevant sections
that they are supporting.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.590
So there's no going to the back.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.230
We have illustrations
also embedded.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.880
Not to be pretty, as you'll see.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.190
I'll show you a few of them.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.746
Although, some of
them are pretty.

00:06:50.746 --> 00:06:51.870
But they're not adornments.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.570
They're there to emphasize
the historicity of the text.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.610
This is not a
Tolkien fairy tale.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.630
There were no dragons and
there were no flying elephants.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.737
These events really happened
to people who fought and died

00:07:08.737 --> 00:07:11.070
and didn't know in the morning
what was going to happen,

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.110
just as you don't know
in the morning what's

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.530
going to happen particularly.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.390
And they suffered, and
planned, and did all the things

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.580
that you do in their way.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.980
And it is a true story.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:25.595
It is real.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.070
It's important to
impress students

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.734
with that because it's
all too easy to begin

00:07:33.734 --> 00:07:35.900
to think with these foreign
names and foreign places

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.040
and strange goings on,
I'll just get a good exam.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.540
I don't have to worry
about it too much.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.010
That's a mistake.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.170
If you lose the
sense of historicity,

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.790
you've lost half of the
value of these books.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.650
That's my personal opinion.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.460
In any case, we give all
kinds of other supports.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.770
We have, as I mentioned,
the appendices.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.220
We have a glossary.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.480
We have a very rich index.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.490
And we have a
strong introduction

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.200
to tell you about the writer.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.790
Of course, in
Caesar's case, it only

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.514
can partially tell
you about the writer

00:08:09.514 --> 00:08:11.180
because there's so
much you can't put it

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.480
into an introductory
section of a book.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.650
But we put as much
into it as we can.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.834
Whenever we think
there's something here

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:23.750
that will cause somebody's
brow to wrinkle up,

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.780
what does that mean,
we try to fix it

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.060
with a footnote
that explains it.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.220
A footnote that tells
them where to go.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.460
Let me show you a page.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.679
You see, it's the text.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.960
There are side notes for each
chapter, which explain where it

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.140
took place, when it took place.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.840
You'd be amazed at how Penguin
and Modern Library don't have

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.990
dates for a history of a war.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.650
And then, a little write-up
of where it is because people

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.070
need to come back to this book
and figure out where they were.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.460
Because if you've
partied all weekend,

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.160
as students do, or even just had
to put it down for two weeks,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.560
as people do, you
come back and you

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.870
want to be able to find
out where you were before.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.250
These things help you.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.060
These footnotes are-- you
can't read them, unfortunately.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.810
Down here, you can see
there's a reference

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.710
to letters to his brother
Quintus by Cicero.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.450
Quintus was in Caesar's army.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.200
And we learn about
some of the things that

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.210
were going on in Caesar's
army from the things

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.599
that Quintus
wrote-- his brother.

00:09:24.599 --> 00:09:27.140
And particularly, we learn a
few dates because they're dated.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.420
Quintus wrote on
the 17th of June.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.910
And so that helps us
to establish dates.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.370
Up here is one of those--

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:38.000
a reference to Cantium,
which is modern Kent.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.240
Map 519.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.840
Map 519 is right
around the corner.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:47.580
And here is a coin from
Cantium minted by a king--

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.430
a king named Tasciovanus.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.160
But we don't know anything
about him except his coins.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.000
But it's there, again, to
emphasize that this is real.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.020
He mentions this place.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.840
And there's some practical
evidence that it exists.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.680
Now, I talked about maps.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.780
I could show you
some other maps that

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.680
are horrible in the Penguin
and the Modern Library.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.380
These you can't
really see very well,

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:17.510
but the purpose is we
have a locator map, which

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.790
shows Italy, Britain, and Gaul.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.757
And in the outline is
where this is taking place.

00:10:22.757 --> 00:10:23.840
So you're always oriented.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.780
You know where it is.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.750
In effect, this
is a campaign map.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.100
Caesar is dividing about
14 campaigns, more or less.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.670
And in the beginning of each
one, we have a campaign map.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.720
And this one, in fact, is
his first campaign in 48 BC.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.290
He comes running up, A--

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.460
and you can follow the
alphabetic letters--

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.490
from Cisalpine Gaul, where he
has his winter headquarters.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:54.020
B, he massacres
the [? Titarini ?]

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.580
crossing the river Aras.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.900
And it tells you where in
the text you can find this.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.050
It says here, this is 4--

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.830
I don't know-- 26.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.660
Hard to read.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:11.270
It means it's in chapter
4, Section 26, Bibracte.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.120
He defeats the Helvetii.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.260
Here, he catches up with them
and forces their surrender.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.760
And now he goes after
Ariovistus, the German.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.590
And Ariovistus is here.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:24.830
Caesar marches on him--

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.280
I'm encapsulating a
lot-- wins a victory,

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.830
defeats him, and takes
his army from F to G

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.080
back to Vizantio for
winter headquarters.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.324
That's what you're going
to read in the book.

00:11:35.324 --> 00:11:36.240
And then you go ahead.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.920
There are maps within the
text of the book supporting

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.040
what happens in an expanded
way, so that there's

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.660
more data, more detail.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.530
But you can always
refer back to this

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.190
to find out what was going
to happen next, or whatever.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.260
It's useful to understand.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.230
This is an easy one I picked.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.220
Some of them get pretty
complicated because he

00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:00.560
tended to run all over,
go back and over his path.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.360
And in order not
to make them look

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.000
like spaghetti running
back and forth,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.990
we had to do some
particular tricks.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:12.200
In one case in book 7 where
there's a great revolt

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.500
and he spends a lot of
time running all over Gaul,

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.960
we had two campaign maps
because there was no other way

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.490
to show it.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.350
Here's another map that
we'll explain a little bit.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.800
It's very hard for you
to see, but here's Rome.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.480
Here's the coast of
Italy on this map.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.800
Here's the upper Adriatic and
the Adriatic on the other side.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.150
Caesar comes down from Rome
and goes to Brundisium,

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.860
chases Pompey out.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.890
And then later, he comes
back to Brundisium,

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.220
and he crosses over the
Adriatic to Palaesta.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.720
Now, the telescoping here is
to accomplish different scales

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.520
so that you can show detail.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.330
If we put all these places
at this scale over here

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.070
on the Adriatic,
it would just be

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.285
a bunch of dots all together.

00:12:55.285 --> 00:12:57.160
And you'd have trouble
putting the labels on.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.493
You'd have trouble reading them.

00:12:58.493 --> 00:13:00.220
You would not, in
effect, have been

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.420
imparted any real information.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.390
So in order to
make that clear, we

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.240
had another-- a
third telescope map.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.220
This is the square
that shows it.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.120
And here it is.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.760
And at least you now
know that Bouthroton

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.960
is at approximately 80
miles from Apollonia.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.095
And you could never
meaningfully show that.

00:13:19.095 --> 00:13:20.470
So that's the kind
of thing we do

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.880
to try to make the maps
as clear as possible.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.160
There's no extraneous
stuff on these maps.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.265
It's only the labels that
are shown in the text, that

00:13:30.265 --> 00:13:31.690
are described in the text.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.060
We try to keep it as
simple as possible.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.500
This is a map I really love,
and we'll come back to it.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.900
It's a campaign in
a way of its own.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.120
Caesar-- you won't
believe this, but he

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.430
suffered some serious defeats.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:50.170
In the vicinity of Dyrrachium,
Pompey beat him badly.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.350
And he caused heavy
casualties into his army.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.980
And Caesar then withdrew
south, skillfully

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.520
withdrew from Pompey.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.160
Pompey chased him, but
couldn't catch up with him.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.010
And then Pompey turned
back and went down

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:10.270
the main road, the Via
Egnatia, on his way

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:15.160
to meet Scipio, who
was Pompeian, up

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.710
and to head for Pharsalus.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.700
Caesar went south and
had some adventures

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.070
here with two cities,
Gomphi and Metropolis,

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:25.360
and ended at Pharsalus.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.250
So it ends up with
the two of them

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.080
facing each other at Pharsalus.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.230
Caesar offering battle
and Pompey refusing it.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.030
One little side thing
I should mention.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.830
There was a general,
a Caesarean general,

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.750
with two veteran
legions which would

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.390
have been very important
to Caesar, who didn't know

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.040
anything about that defeat.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.150
Caesar's attempts to
reach him with a courier

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:48.700
didn't get through.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.280
And he's marching
up the Via Egnatia

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.490
when his scouts inform him--

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:55.990
and it's an interesting
way they do.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.870
But they're Gauls, and they
run into their brother Gauls,

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.790
who are scouting for Pompey.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:04.270
And they find out he's four
hours' march away from Pompey

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:07.170
coming down the Via
Egnatia with nine legions.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.630
He has two.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:12.040
So that showed how abruptly
he gets out of there.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.270
And he goes south and
meets Caesar at Aegenium

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.120
and on into Pharsalus.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.890
So I think it's
an engagement map.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.590
And all of these
notes down here,

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.970
some of which you can
see, explain what's going

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.090
on in the A, B, C, Ds and E's.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.790
But-- oh, here's a
picture of what the Via

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.120
Egnatia looks like today.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.340
A section of it.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.489
So Pompey might have been there.

00:15:35.489 --> 00:15:36.780
Domitius might have been there.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.760
Well, Pompey
certainly was there.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.010
He went the whole way.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:43.810
So this is a way of explaining
a very complex maneuver of two

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.530
armies that Caesar's
description is difficult to go

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.530
because it's going back.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.440
Meanwhile, back at the so--

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.210
and so it goes back and forth.

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.390
And it takes some real analysis
to figure out what's going on.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.550
Believe me, that
map helps a lot.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:01.810
Now, here's an illustration
that I think, in fact,

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:03.790
is quite beautiful.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:05.255
It shows a slinger.

00:16:05.255 --> 00:16:06.510
He's not a Roman, probably.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:07.870
Probably, a Gaul.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.320
Or certainly, somebody
in Italy who is not--

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.580
an Italian who's not Roman.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:17.170
Very possibly, slingers came
from Numidia or from Crete.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.490
So he could be one of these.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:19.660
And he's about to throw--

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.875
he's surrounded with others.

00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:22.750
This one's just going
to throw with his hand.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:27.340
And he's got his weapons
there, his ammunition.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.600
And over here, it goes on
to show somebody firing

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.580
a scorpion.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.890
And that's the
ammunition lined up

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:40.150
for a scorpion, which
is a small catapult.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.470
That's a pretty picture.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.600
This next one gives
you verisimilitude

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.150
and the historicity.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:51.340
These are two wire
containers, as you can

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.980
scale by the gentleman there.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.410
They're at Uxellodunum,
the last battle

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:00.130
that Caesar fought in Gaul.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:04.839
And they contain literally
thousands of sling stones

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:06.940
that were gathered from
the battlefield, which

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.380
is not a big area.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.880
Believe me, it wasn't as
big as the campus here.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.240
And piled up just to
see how many there were.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.210
And one wasn't enough.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.790
They had to get
another container.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.980
And I don't think
it's been counted,

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.690
but there are thousands of them.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:26.220
And it indicates the scale of
how this ammunition was used,

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.160
even in what was a relatively
small battle in a fairly

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.450
confined space.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.010
Part of a siege.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.610
So if you see this, you know
that that's not a fairy tale.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:36.690
There they are.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.231
There are the stones that people
were throwing at each other.

00:17:41.309 --> 00:17:43.600
Before I go on with this, I
want to talk about the fact

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.190
that the format of
the Landmark series

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:53.320
ran into a tremendous
amount of data about Caesar.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.545
There are five extant,
ancient, contemporary,

00:17:56.545 --> 00:17:58.930
or almost contemporary sources--

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:02.830
historians, whose work we have--
and they wrote about Caesar.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.750
And there's just about nobody
else in the ancient world

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.510
that we have that
much material on.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.600
Plus you have all
kinds of letters

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.410
from Cicero, to his brother,
to Atticus, to various people.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.390
There are letters
from Cicero to Caesar.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:19.870
And letters from
Caesar back to Cicero.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.350
There's not a lot, but some.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.780
So that, again, they
must be real people.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.330
They say, how is
your daughter doing?

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:26.950
I understand she was sick.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.770
Well, that's personal.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.630
And it makes it
clear that these were

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:35.840
people talking to each other
and not some historic document.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.340
But we learn lots of things
about Caesar from it.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.420
Cicero's letters
often have gossip.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.967
Oh, I heard Caesar was
at Lutetia on the 17th.

00:18:44.967 --> 00:18:47.050
He's supposed to have
suffered a bad defeat, which

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.040
we know is not true.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.270
But that's what Cicero--

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.710
that's the misinformation
that Cicero had at that day.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:53.740
And those kind of
things really help

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.714
us to understand
and see a continuity

00:18:55.714 --> 00:18:56.630
of what was happening.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.140
And what it looked like
in Rome, because Cicero

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.710
stayed in Rome when all--

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:04.060
or at least at home in
Arpinum during all this time.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.210
This is to show you--

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.890
well, I'm not going
to get to this yet.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.150
Let me go back again.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:16.900
We had so much data, we did not
know how to put it together.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:22.630
I knew as Kurt came up with more
and more ideas for appendices

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:24.700
that we were running
over what we would have.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.460
But I assumed, frankly,
as the series editor,

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.150
that we'd find a way to
reduce the size as we

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:32.965
had done in previous editions.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:38.950
Another problem is as you're
doing one of these books,

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.290
you don't know how many
pages you've accrued.

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:44.080
Your 8-by-11 type
script does not at all

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.570
represent how many
pages you have.

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.000
So it wasn't until
we finished and we

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.570
had it paginated by the genius
lady, Kim Llewellyn, who

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:56.720
makes these pages work
and be attractive even.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.080
Being attractive is
not trivial for a book

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.650
that you want the lay readers
to delve into and find

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:05.050
useful and interesting.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.050
So in order to
have it paginated,

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:09.160
she worked hard on it.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:14.270
And we came out with
1,350 to 1,400 pages.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.220
Now, a trade book--

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.136
I don't have one here.

00:20:16.136 --> 00:20:17.780
I was sure one would be here.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.860
But a trade book is
about this thick.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.490
About 950 to 1,000 pages
is all it can accommodate.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.370
So I went to the publisher
and I said, can we

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.360
do a second volume?

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.560
And he said, absolutely not.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.180
And I think he's right.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.660
You're not going to get two
volumes bought, of which one

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.330
is only essays about Caesar.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.570
So we had to come up
with another solution.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.840
To make a long story
short, we went to the web.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.550
It's the only place we could go.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:49.930
It was a brilliant solution,
but the only solution possible.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:54.520
So some 40 appendices,
now called web essays,

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.861
are still an integral
part of the book.

00:20:56.861 --> 00:20:58.360
You still have a
footnote there that

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:04.000
says see web essay L for
stuff about Lucius so-and-so.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.750
And you can go to it
with a few finger clicks.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.150
Or you can take
down the appendices

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.760
and download them yourself
to your own computer.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:18.130
Or you can take them down to a
disk or you can print them out.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.290
So they're all very
accessible to you.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.800
And they're even accessible to
people who don't read our book

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.830
and don't buy it
because it's on the web

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.360
and we're not going to try to
code it and make it difficult.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.840
It's fine if they get it.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.590
Our goal is to-- we're hoping
if somebody does that, they'll

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:34.330
end up buying the book because
they'll want to know where

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:35.560
these things came from.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:41.050
But basically, what we have
here is almost 30% of the book

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:42.520
is not printed.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.300
It's not in the book because
of the printed medium's

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.160
limitations.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.940
We couldn't get in one
volume all of the material.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.910
And I was reluctant
to really cut it hard

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.010
because once I read them
all with that intention,

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.850
they were extremely good essays.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.740
As a body, they formed
a terrific amount

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.590
of supplementary
material for somebody

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.660
who's interested in learning
about Caesar in his time.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.300
And Caesar's time was one of
those interesting moments.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:15.587
A 500-year government is
breaking down, breaking apart.

00:22:15.587 --> 00:22:17.920
When we started, we didn't
think there was any relevance

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.630
to that, to our modern day.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.580
But right now,
there are people who

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.890
suspect that the
American government is

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.170
in a situation where
norms are being stretched

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.990
and things don't
look like the way

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.030
they did 10 or 20 years ago.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.210
And it's conceivable
that, in fact, this

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.460
is part of a
process that's going

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.780
to end with a major
change in the government.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:43.090
I don't know, but there
are parallel items,

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:48.160
stretches of the norms in
Caesar and going on today.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.920
So let's now turn to the
maps and the battlefields.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.800
This-- I know you
can't see where it is.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.760
It's in the central,
northwest of--

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.910
northeast of Paris.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.460
Paris is about here somewhere.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.230
And up here on the
Sambre River is

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.640
where Caesar has a major
battle with the Nervii

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.660
tribe, a major Belgian--

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.630
Belgae, it's called--

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.220
Gallic tribe.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:17.320
And it's the only
instance I know of where

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.250
he's taken by surprise.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:24.430
He's informed that the Nervii
and their allies are here.

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.320
He comes up here
to build a camp.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.900
Everybody pitches in
to build the camp.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.750
When suddenly, out
of the nearby woods

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:35.780
come the Atrebates, the
Viromandui, and the Nervii.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.800
And he writes about it.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.800
Says, they came down the
hill, across the river,

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.830
and up the hill so fast, it was
like it all happened at once.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:48.550
And his Latin was probably
much, much swifter than that.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:52.270
And in the next part of his
writing, it's an absolute--

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.940
maybe one of the best, if
not the best description

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.440
of an ancient battle.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.850
Because he describes
what he had to do.

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:02.290
He gives tribute to the
soldiers that if they weren't

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.600
by their own unit, they
fell in line in nearby units

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.669
because their training was good.

00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:08.710
Some of them had no time
to put their helmets on.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:12.220
They couldn't take-- the shields
are carried in a shield cover.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.780
They couldn't take
the covers off.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.630
And so they are really
under assault suddenly

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.760
and without preparation.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.200
And they're surprised.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.420
And they could have
been overwhelmed.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.730
But being Roman soldiers,
they fall into line

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:26.170
and they start the battle.

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:28.390
He goes to the 10th Legion,
which is his favorite,

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:29.930
and starts as he says.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:34.180
And he gives them a pep talk
and sends them across the river.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.610
The 11th and 8th
Legion deal with--

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.700
I'll show you the next slide--
deal with the Viromandui.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.520
But the crisis forms
here on the Roman right,

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.180
where the 7th and 12th Legion
are overwhelmed and almost

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.350
encircled by the Nervii.

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:54.530
Here's the 9th and 10th
having defeated the Atrebates.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:58.970
The 11th and 8th have stabilized
and held off the Viromandui.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:02.630
But the Nervii are
getting around the 7th

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.460
and threatening the 12th.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:08.660
And entering even the
half-built Roman camp.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.760
And normally, if you
enter the enemy's camp,

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.979
you win the battle.

00:25:11.979 --> 00:25:13.520
Because the enemy
soldiers don't want

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.640
to stand by and watch all their
belongings and their slaves

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.530
or their women
and their servants

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.540
and their private
stuff get taken away.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.870
And they go running off
the line to protect that.

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:25.547
That wouldn't be
the total case here,

00:25:25.547 --> 00:25:27.380
partly because Romans
were very disciplined.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.660
And partly because the
camp not being completed,

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:33.080
probably didn't have all of
those accoutrements in it.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.006
But there still
was a chance that--

00:25:35.006 --> 00:25:36.380
Caesar says when
he got there, he

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.060
saw the men clumping
together, which

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.460
is a very bad thing for
the kind of warfare it is.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.180
You have to have space for
people to use their weapons.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:48.020
He saw some of them wavering and
beginning to head to the rear.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:55.010
He saw confusion and
so many of the officers

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.140
killed that there was
actually a lack in some

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.940
of the units of direction.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:03.380
And so-- he only did
this twice, I think--

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.960
he grabs a shield
from a soldier.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.330
And probably with
his red cloak, he's

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.190
very-- that's a general's cloak.

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:11.390
He's very visible.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.430
He runs up to the
front line and he

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:20.990
calls on the centurions, who
are the sergeants of the era.

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:26.090
And he calls them by name to
come and to give direction

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.600
and put the lines together.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.810
And I figured out that there
were eight legions in his army,

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:36.080
and there are 60 centurions
in each army-- each legion.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.280
And so we can assume he had
480 to 500 centurions, which

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.944
he knew by name.

00:26:41.944 --> 00:26:44.360
And I think I read somewhere
that he had a fabulous memory

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.680
for things like that.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.710
And here's a case where he
used that to good effect

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:49.730
as a general.

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:53.720
In the end, he put the
12th Legion behind the 7th.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.160
He moved it, flitted
over, faced it around

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.820
so it was facing this way, which
was stopping the encirclement.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:05.060
And at least protected
the 7th from the rear.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:09.560
Labienus was on the hill here,
the general of the 10th Legion.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.239
And he saw what was happening,
and he sent the 10th Legion

00:27:12.239 --> 00:27:14.030
all across the battlefield
here, which went

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:16.130
to the flank of the Nervii.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.830
And these two, which were
green recruit legions,

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:21.830
had been used only to
accompany the baggage.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.680
Their appearance
on the scene was

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.700
enough to give the Nervii
pause because they were there

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.410
in the flank and the rear.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:33.650
So basically, the
battle was stabilized.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:35.570
The Romans when they
got a stabilized battle,

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:39.380
they could fight the Germans
and the Gauls to a finish

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.230
because they had a better
means of replacement,

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.400
and better weapons,
and better tactics.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.670
And so it ended up
with just butchery.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:48.140
Caesar does say
that the Germans--

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.270
that the Nervii
just kept coming.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.690
They would climb now the
rampart that the dead bodies

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:55.730
of their compatriots
formed and be

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.320
fighting from above with
them until they were killed.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.756
And then, new ones stepped
up, until the day was over

00:28:00.756 --> 00:28:01.880
and most of them were dead.

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:08.330
He ends that their reputation
for valor was justified.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.650
OK.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:13.650
That's one battle which shows
him operating in an emergency.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.740
You've got to remember,
this is his second year

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.970
of his campaigning.

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:19.550
He doesn't have the seven
years where these guys--

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:21.170
where he's a successful general.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:22.880
He's made them all rich.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.970
They're completely
devoted to him.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.490
He had to really show what
he could do here in order

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:31.460
to save this situation.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.360
His main opponent was a
former military genius,

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.440
a Roman one named Pompey.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.670
And here the two of them are.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:44.480
And as I mentioned before,
at Dyrrachium Pompey defeated

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.930
Caesar rather handily.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:49.670
Caesar made an error here.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:50.480
Two of them.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.820
He left open a part
of a fortification,

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.530
which he should have closed.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:57.740
He didn't blame himself, but
he should have blamed himself.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.350
And then he saw an opportunity
for a counterattack,

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.610
which was risky.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:04.910
And he sent his men into it and
they got lost in the terrain.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:08.060
They had not really
reconnoitered it well enough.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.950
And they broke down some walls--

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:12.080
holes in walls, so
they could get through.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.080
And when Pompey counterattacked
and they needed to retreat,

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.370
those holes in the walls
became choke points.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:20.300
And so many of their
casualties were men

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.440
being trampled as others fled.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.380
The cavalry also tried
to get back through them.

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.900
It was a disaster.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.340
And right away, Caesar
had to break the siege.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.900
Here's that map again.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.860
Caesar went down south,
avoided Pompey's pursuit.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.550
And then they went on
their ways to Pharsalus.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:43.850
And I mentioned at Pharsalus,
for a few days there--

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:45.065
we don't know how many days--

00:29:45.065 --> 00:29:49.040
Caesar would offer battle and
Pompey wouldn't accept it.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.230
Pompey knew that
his troops would not

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.870
stand up to Caesar's, even
though Pompey had twice as

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:54.680
many.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.450
He had Roman recruits
and Greek recruits.

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:01.650
And Caesar had real veterans
who had been through eight,

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:04.380
nine years of heavy warfare.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.800
So Pompey didn't want to fight.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:11.720
But his men misjudged the nature
of their victory at Dyrrachium.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.820
They thought they
had won it by--

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:18.990
how much?

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:20.300
Zero.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:20.985
OK, quickly.

00:30:23.926 --> 00:30:25.800
They thought they had
won it with great skill

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.080
and Caesar was finished.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.010
And so they wanted to battle.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.490
Pompey accepted it
with a special plan

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:37.666
that he was going to use his
cavalry, which he had 7,000

00:30:37.666 --> 00:30:41.280
to about a 1,000 of Caesar's
to overwhelm Caesar's cavalry

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.690
and fight--

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:44.390
attack the Caesar in the rear.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:48.330
Caesar's counter-plan was
to bring a fourth line up

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:52.230
by calling on cohorts
from his third line.

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:53.850
And that worked just right.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:56.580
They attacked Pompey's
cavalry from the flank.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:57.870
They threw them out.

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:02.490
And then they-- that
is, the fourth line--

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:05.820
walked past Pompey's flank
and attacked the rear.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:09.290
Caesar sent his third line
in and Pompey's troops broke.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:11.040
And it was a major victory.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.280
Here I just say he's
a major tactician.

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.180
He foresaw what was
going to happen.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.290
He organized his troops,
a successful counter.

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:22.540
His role was just to set it in
motion and watch what happened,

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.880
at least as he describes it.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.280
And it happened pretty
much according to his plan.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.200
But I want to show
you one last picture.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:30.780
It's a map.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.100
I don't know if you can see it.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.430
Down here is Egypt.

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:35.960
Up there is northeastern Turkey.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:40.890
Here's Thessaly,
where Pharsalus was.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:41.970
Here's the Adriatic.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:43.350
Here's Italy.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:46.740
Here's Africa, Spain, and Gaul.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:49.590
Caesar fought
battles everywhere.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:54.150
In these 14 years, he was
a general whose chessboard

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:56.320
was the entire Mediterranean.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.420
And I leave you with that
thought and this image.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:04.321
And I turn it over to my
colleague, Professor Raaflaub.

00:32:04.321 --> 00:32:07.267
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:12.240
KURT A. RAAFLAUB:
Good afternoon.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.350
I'm Kurt Raaflaub.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:14.610
I'm the editor of this work.

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:16.830
But I want to start--

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:20.760
I will build on
Bob's presentation.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.100
But before I start,
I want to just say

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:28.800
that this volume is really the
result of teamwork, of very

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.710
rare and high-quality teamwork.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:37.710
Bob has assembled a group
of very devoted specialists.

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:41.820
And he, himself, has shown
throughout the process

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:45.960
an incredible commitment
to producing this volume.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:50.250
I spent lots of time on it, but
he's spent nearly as much time

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:51.360
on it.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.800
Spending hours and hours
talking with the cartographers,

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.140
designing the maps himself.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.280
I corrected them, sent them
back, he sent them back.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.630
And when we both were
convinced this is what it is,

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:07.920
he went to his freelance
cartographers, who then

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.470
produced these beautiful maps.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:14.010
And the negotiations
behind this, I just

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:15.250
know that they happened.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:20.360
But then, illustrations
and everything else.

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.760
And these specialists
are high-quality people

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.520
who are really committed
to producing these volumes.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:30.200
So I could not have done
anything like this on my own.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.840
And I'm very grateful
to Bob and his team,

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.110
that they showed this commitment
and produced this, which

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:39.860
I think a very useful volume.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:45.620
I thought I would start by
showing you the difficulties.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:49.310
Bob talked about the
difficulties that Caesar posed.

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:53.030
He wrote his, what
was called Comentarii,

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:58.010
which is a report on these
Gallic wars, on his own wars.

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.380
But he had literary ambitions.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.980
And he didn't want to
write a general's report.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:06.660
Generals give dates and
distances and routes,

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:07.460
and so on.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.170
Historians don't.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:13.370
And Caesar knew
Thucydides very well,

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:17.210
so he knew that historians
don't go into these details.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:20.690
They show the big outlines,
and the dramatic episodes,

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:21.409
and so on.

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:23.420
And that's what
Caesar wanted to do.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:28.429
So for us modern scholars
to reconstruct the way

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:31.429
that Caesar fought
this war in Gaul based

00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:33.840
on his very limited
information that he

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:37.730
gives in this respect was
sometimes quite difficult.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:42.870
And I want to illustrate this
for you with two episodes,

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:47.810
at both the landings in
Britain in 55 and in 54.

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:54.020
In 55, he tells us that
he landed three days

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.030
before a full moon night.

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:58.070
During that night,
the storm combined

00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:02.540
with the springtide heavily
damaged the anchored fleet.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:07.910
Now, we know because scientists
have calculated this.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:11.060
And we know that the
times of the dates

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:16.790
of full moons and new moons and
equinoxes back to Caesar's time

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:18.090
and farther back.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:21.940
So we know that full moon
nights in the late summer of 55

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:22.790
were three--

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:26.750
July 31, August 30,
and September 28.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.870
And Caesar tells us he
returned to the mainland

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:32.720
before the equinox,
the fall equinox, which

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.580
was on September 26.

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:39.620
So the date for the full moon
of September 28 is too late.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:43.600
If we add up, as we
did, all the time Caesar

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.120
must have consumed for
his trips before he

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:53.660
came to the start-off point
for the expedition to Britain,

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.160
you don't see the ocean lines.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.590
This is very unfortunate,
but that's what it is.

00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:01.250
Here, Portus Itius,
moderne Boulogne-sur-Mer.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:07.610
And here is Caesar's
departure for Britain.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:11.480
Before he arrived there,
he did various things,

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.860
crossing Gaul from
west to east and back.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:20.360
And so just barely
enough time for him

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:25.670
to reach the departure
point and to get to Britain.

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:31.880
So we can say that the July 31
date is absolutely too early.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.050
It cannot have been that.

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:38.420
That leaves one date, and
that is the August 27,

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:42.170
the full moon, and the
springtide of that date, which

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:45.500
helps us date precisely
when Caesar actually

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.720
landed in Britain.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.650
Now, the second case
of the landing in 54

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:55.180
is more interesting
and more complicated.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:58.310
Caesar writes he sets
sail around sunset,

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:02.120
is carried by a southwest wind.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.460
Around midnight, the wind stops.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.250
The current drives
him far to the east.

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:11.210
You see that on the map
with the arrow there.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:16.555
And then around dawn,
he sees far to the left

00:37:16.555 --> 00:37:18.620
the coast of Britain.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:22.190
And then the current changes
and carries him back.

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:26.450
And when he uses the rows and
he finds the landing's beach

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:27.860
and is able to land.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.370
The second night
after his landing,

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:32.450
there is another huge storm.

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:36.270
And that again damages
his fleet very heavily.

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:42.710
The whole army works for 10 days
to repair as many of the ships

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:43.910
as possible.

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:48.050
So that's what Caesar
tells us himself.

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:52.580
Scholars naturally connect
this storm with a full moon

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.500
as it was in the previous year.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.380
I don't think this could
be because Caesar knew

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.570
that full moons are dangerous.

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:03.160
And so he would have
taken special precautions.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.810
But anyway, that's what
scholars tend to do.

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:08.750
Now, Bob mentioned
the correspondence

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:13.400
between the subcommander,
the deputy commander,

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:17.195
Quintus Cicero, who
was a subcommander

00:38:17.195 --> 00:38:19.190
in Caesar's army at the time.

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:23.930
And his brother, the famous
orator, Marcus Tullius Cicero--

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:28.430
Tully in early
American language--

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:29.390
in Rome.

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:34.040
And from this
correspondence, we can

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:40.280
derive with absolute certainty
that August 2 or 3 in the Roman

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:45.530
calendar system was the latest
possible date for Caesar's

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:47.990
landing in Britain.

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:52.160
Hence, the full moon of
August 14 is too late.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:58.930
But there was a new moon on
the night of July 30, 31.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:04.540
And we know that new moon and
full moon are equally liable--

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:08.170
likely to produce
springtides, so on.

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:11.140
Now, the pattern
that Caesar describes

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:17.680
for what happened to him
when he crossed over,

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.930
studying these patterns over a
long period of time have found

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:27.190
applies only to the days
shortly before a full moon

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:29.410
or a new moon.

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:33.300
So here is what they sent us.

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:37.330
We wrote to the National
Oceanographic Institute

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:40.450
in Liverpool and found
an interested person who

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:44.170
sent us these illustrations.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:47.320
And you see that exactly
what Caesar describes

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.170
happens in these schemes--

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:54.730
current to the northeast,
current to the southwest

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:57.430
after 5:00 AM.

00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:58.610
And this is Caesar.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:02.770
So we know it had to be
just before a full moon

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:04.600
or a new moon.

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.330
And so that helps us
because Caesar says two

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:09.385
days before this, he landed.

00:40:09.385 --> 00:40:12.520
It must have been July 29.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.730
And again, if we add all
the activities of Caesar

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:19.910
before then, it couldn't
have been an earlier date.

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:20.830
So that helps us.

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:24.100
And this is actually
completely new with certainty

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:32.600
to date the second landing
on the 29th of July.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.480
Right?

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.030
Yes.

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:41.010
Now, Caesar is a
fascinating personality.

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:45.390
He came from a family
that was very old,

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:49.380
went back to the beginnings of
Rome, or even to the goddess

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:54.460
Venus as ancestress
of the family.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.930
It had lost much of
its luster over time.

00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:00.750
There were no famous
immediate ancestors of Caesar,

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:03.160
but he belonged to the
highest aristocracy.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:07.500
And he took that very seriously.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:13.290
His aunt was the wife of the
famous war hero Gaius Marius.

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:19.260
And Gaius Marius was a
populist politician in Rome.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.050
In the 80s, there were
civil wars between--

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:25.830
you may have heard the
name of Sulla and Marius.

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:28.320
And Sulla was a
very conservative

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:34.200
right-wing politician
who, when he was in power,

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.930
ordered Caesar to
divorce his wife,

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:40.650
who was the daughter
of the heir of Marius.

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:43.260
And Caesar refused,
putting himself

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.840
into a very dangerous situation.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:51.150
He survived it, but this
prompted him to become really

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:56.100
a convinced populist
against this entrenched

00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:00.765
aristocracy in the Senate
that were the heirs of Sulla.

00:42:00.765 --> 00:42:04.320
And he was also a
very ambitious man.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.160
He was a gambler.

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.300
He loved to play at high stakes.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:12.060
And he was always
in debt and had

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:15.870
to be bailed out, even before
he could leave for an earlier

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:21.120
provincial command by the
richest man in Rome, Marcus

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.790
Crassus.

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:27.900
And all that combined to
make a lot of enemies.

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:31.620
The entrenched aristocracy
didn't like Caesar.

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.960
And so they put all the
obstacles in his way

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.500
that they could.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:39.390
And he knew that he would
not secure an election

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:41.580
to the consulship,
the highest office,

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.830
unless he had powerful allies.

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:45.990
And so he formed
this Triple Alliance

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:49.860
with Pompey, mentioned
before, and Crassus,

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:54.600
who both had their reasons to
be at odds with the Senate.

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.890
And they secured
Caesar's consulship.

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:02.010
He did favors to them
and they did the favor

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:05.910
that they secured for him a
big provincial command in Gaul.

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:08.400
Because in the
meantime, earlier Pompey

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.010
had done great
conquests in the east,

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:16.650
fighting the famous
Mithridates and had

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:20.430
added provinces and territories
to the Roman Empire.

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:21.900
He had raised the bar.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.780
If one wanted to be
the greatest Roman,

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:27.090
one had to be
better than Pompey.

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:29.130
And Caesar was
extremely ambitious.

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:32.790
And he, therefore,
secured these commands,

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:35.340
and then hoped that there
would be an opportunity

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.500
to create a war and start a war.

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:42.000
And the Helvetians in the first
year gave him the opportunity.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.800
And out of this developed
this entire war, which he then

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:50.470
described not only in his
reports to the Senate,

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:53.850
but in these elaborated
commentaries,

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:57.780
reports that we now
have and can read.

00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:00.540
And they gave us
so many insights

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:05.970
into how a leading
Roman of the time

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:11.160
perceived his role, perceived
the role of the army, the role

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:16.860
of a general, as Bob described
it, the role of a leader.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:21.570
And I just put in a
few possible focuses

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:25.290
one could talk about
in this context--

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:28.140
the perfect Roman,
the perfect general,

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:31.260
which is very important
for Roman cultural history.

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.380
He was an extremely
talented author as we

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.240
shall see in a moment, I hope.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.420
And at the end,
I would just like

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.540
to briefly talk about
what is the dark side

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:43.740
of this whole story.

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.610
Namely, the brutality
of imperial conquest,

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:51.300
the masses of losses
that it caused in Gaul.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:57.210
And balance this by looking at
Caesar as the clement victor

00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:00.720
because Caesar was very
innovative in this way as well.

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.720
So I will see how far
I get with all this.

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:08.400
This is Caesar, the
organizer and improviser.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.530
Imagine for a
moment that this is

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:13.610
a war that is fought
in an unknown country.

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:16.170
Caesar didn't know
where he was going.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:17.190
He didn't have maps.

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:18.690
There were no maps.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:23.580
And there was no developed
good road network.

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:28.500
So Caesar had to balance this
shortcoming by building up

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.670
an extensive network of
intelligence, questioning

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:34.460
all kinds of people
about where he was going

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.530
and where the goals were
that he was aiming at.

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:40.580
A highly-developed
system of logistics,

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:43.190
bringing the supplies
for an increasing number

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:45.830
of legions, tens of
thousands of soldiers

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:51.560
who needed to be fed and
supported with boots, and so

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:52.790
on.

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:55.790
Reliance on the group
of favored allies

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:58.670
who helped him with
difficulties that he

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:03.110
might have in these
supplies, storage,

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:05.300
increasing number
of hostages that

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.150
were given by the
defeated peoples that

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:09.810
needed to be somewhere.

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:13.940
Caesar couldn't take them
all along on his campaigns,

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:16.610
so he relied on
some of these allies

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:19.910
to take care of these hostages.

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:23.750
He needed to be extremely
versatile in mastering

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:28.420
the challenges of naval and
siege warfare, engineering.

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:30.560
I'll show you an
example in a moment.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:36.680
And in short, his
inventiveness was called for.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.760
Circumspection, his ability
to think outside the box,

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.550
of finding solutions
that were unusual,

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:47.240
understanding the conditions
under which his army fought,

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:50.090
both from the enemy side
and from his own side.

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:54.410
Caesar, for example, never
led his army into a fight

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:57.530
before he knew that
they were rested enough

00:46:57.530 --> 00:47:01.460
and they had eaten before
they went into battle.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.480
One of his subcommanders
at some point

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:07.310
ignored these elementary
rules and promptly suffered

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:08.195
very bad defeat.

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:16.250
Using even deception
systematically and frequently,

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:19.250
but always based on a
psychological assessment

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:20.250
of the enemy.

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:22.700
How far he could go,
how he could trick them.

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:25.070
And he did that as
much as he could.

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:30.140
But let me show you here another
aspect we tend to forget.

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:33.170
Namely, that Caesar's
army was on its own.

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:36.740
And he needed the specialists
in his army, the engineers,

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:39.620
who would train the
soldiers to do the works.

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:42.350
So they knew what
they had to do.

00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:44.690
The engineers provided
the blueprint.

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:51.380
OK, this is going to be a
bridge with 20-feet-long timber

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.790
crossing the Rhine.

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:57.380
In 54, a bridge built
across the Rhine 400 meters

00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:02.990
wide and 12 feet deep
on average in 10 days

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:05.970
once the lumber
started to come in.

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:09.380
A major achievement-- and Caesar
tells about it very proudly

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:13.070
because he was aware that he
had accomplished something

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:14.840
very extraordinary here.

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:20.420
Or the ability to improvise
and surprise the enemy.

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:25.250
His famous speed, the speed is
one of the most frequent words

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:28.430
that he uses, his celeritas.

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:31.370
And there's an example
I give you here.

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:36.230
His effort to get
back to his army

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:40.880
when the big rebellion of
52 led by Vercingetorix

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.230
had broken out.

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:45.650
He came to the province
here in the south.

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:47.490
Here's the province.

00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:52.810
And he had to get up here
where his legions were

00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:55.190
in winter quarters.

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:59.590
And this was all enemy-infested,
rebellious territory.

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:02.050
And the enemy was convinced
that Caesar couldn't

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:04.120
reach his legions
because they were

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:06.800
in control of the territory.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:10.030
So what Caesar
did was he started

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.700
a diversionary attack
across a mountain

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.580
range-- the Cevennes
mountains-- in winter.

00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:19.660
There were 10-feet-high
walls of snow and ice.

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:24.310
And his army cut through
and made a path for him.

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:28.850
He led parts of his army into
the territory of the Arverni,

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:33.710
which was the tribe, the
nation of his enemy leader--

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:34.750
general.

00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:37.930
And he started to
devastate the country.

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:41.110
The Vercingetorix was
operating up here.

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:46.330
He was called back by his people
to defend his own country.

00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:50.560
Caesar then himself went
back to the Rhone valley,

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:54.250
joined a cavalry escort
that was well-rested here.

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:55.990
And then in four
days and nights,

00:49:55.990 --> 00:50:00.700
dashed up to meet his
legions and reunite his army

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:04.090
before the enemy even
knew what was going on.

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:08.540
That is an example of his
inventiveness, of his speed,

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:14.860
of his ability to surprise
and reach success here.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:19.210
Another aspect I want to bring
out, which is his leadership.

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:22.180
It's not the same
as his generalship.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:24.940
His ability to bond
with his soldiers,

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:28.240
to create an army that
was in deep loyalty

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:33.280
tied to him and of which he
could expect total effort,

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.710
but he had to create this bond.

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:39.760
And he was extremely
good in doing that.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:44.410
During a very difficult
siege at Avaricum, he--

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:47.920
in winter, where the food
supply was interrupted

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:51.370
because the enemy was using
a scorched earth strategy,

00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:55.150
Caesar offered to his
soldiers to give up.

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:58.210
If this is too hard
for you, let's go.

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:00.520
We can try something else.

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:01.900
And the soldiers said, no.

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:03.140
We never give up.

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:04.180
We never gave up.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:07.870
We never betray you.

00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:11.050
So let's finish this up.

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:13.900
But showing this
compassion, even

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:18.070
sleeping out with his soldiers
on guard during the night,

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:21.430
so that they knew he was
part of the enterprise

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:25.450
and he was not somewhere
in a warm bunker,

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:29.120
but he was right there where
the action was taking place.

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:31.540
This is a hypothetical
reconstruction

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:34.840
on the left of this siege.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:40.120
The siege works at Avaricum,
an 80-foot-high siege ramp,

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:43.120
a tower, and covered galleries.

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:46.580
And on the right,
I just showed you

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:53.300
the Masada where the Roman siege
ramp is still visible here.

00:51:56.450 --> 00:52:00.590
So that is also a very steep
ramp on which a tower was then

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:04.310
moved up so it could
shoot across the wall

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:05.960
and defeat the enemies.

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:09.230
You see the Roman
camps here and here.

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:11.820
And there's one
down here as well.

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:17.180
So this gives us an idea of
what was going on in Avaricum.

00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.660
Just very briefly other
aspects of leadership.

00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:24.680
Bob mentioned this.

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.980
Exposing himself to
danger, taking the shield,

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:30.560
rushing to the front,
encouraging his soldiers.

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:33.470
And through his
presence, giving courage

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:37.790
to the soldiers who always in
the presence of the general

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:42.890
tried to excel and show, and
of course, hope for rewards.

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:46.760
But this was very crucial
to stabilize the situation

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:50.270
and actually, as I
say, steal victory out

00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:51.785
of the jaws of defeat.

00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:55.850
Then, other aspects.

00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:57.680
Caring for his soldiers' lives.

00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.890
Caesar often-- several
times at least--

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:04.280
forfeited a certain
victory or an easy victory

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.220
because he wanted
to avoid the losses

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:08.840
this would cause
to his soldiers.

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:12.230
He was very generous in
rewarding outstanding

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:15.800
performances of
soldiers and officers.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.780
He shared the hardships.

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:22.940
He was able to build up a
very deep sense of loyalty.

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:26.000
He says at some point
during the civil war,

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.650
when two officers,
Gallic officers,

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:33.800
deserted to the enemy, that
this was the first time

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.450
ever that this has happened.

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:38.030
While constantly
there was a flow of

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:44.300
deserters from the enemy to
his camp in all his campaigns.

00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:49.400
And he gives us an example of
an officer who was captured

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:54.560
and who was offered his
life and monetary rewards

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:57.620
if he fought against
Caesar with his enemies.

00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:00.770
And he not only
refused to do that,

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:04.310
but he offered the
commander of the enemy

00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:07.550
an opportunity to see
what the enemy was

00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:08.870
he was fighting against.

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:13.940
He said, give me
10 men of my own

00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:17.750
and I will fight against the
whole company of your troops

00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:21.260
and you will see against
whom you are fighting.

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:23.930
And then, of course, he
was immediately executed.

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:27.650
But the story is told
by one of his officers

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:30.720
as an example of this loyalty.

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:34.160
And then, my favorite episode.

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.180
Caesar was impatient.

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:38.930
He departed for the
African war in 46,

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:42.920
before his army had
completely assembled.

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:47.270
And then there was a storm
and his whole flotilla

00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:48.980
was dispersed.

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:52.400
He arrived with just a
couple of thousand soldiers

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.650
and a few hundred cavalry.

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:57.500
And for two days, the
others didn't show up.

00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:01.190
So he put soldiers on
ships in the harbor

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:03.920
and waited during the night.

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.470
He didn't tell his soldiers
what he had in mind

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:08.360
because he knew that
there was communication

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:10.040
across the fronts.

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:15.680
And he didn't want his
plan to be betrayed.

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:18.890
And then the soldiers
were very despondent.

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:22.130
They knew they were a few,
they were inexperienced,

00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:24.720
they were new
recruits, and so on.

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:29.420
And this is what
this author writes.

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:33.200
This is, again, the officer
that writes this, not Caesar

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.160
himself.

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.020
"These soldiers
sitting on the ships

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:38.090
could not find any
kind of comfort

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:39.890
in their present circumstance.

00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:42.860
All they could do was look
to their general's face,

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:47.030
which was full of heartiness
and unbelievably good spirits.

00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:49.250
His courage was like a standard.

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:50.950
He carried in front.

00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:54.020
He carried straight up
high right in front of him.

00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:56.120
This calmed down the men.

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.520
And trusting his
expertise and planning,

00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:01.940
they all hoped that everything
would turn out well for them."

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:05.630
Imagine-- this is the way
that they saw their general,

00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:06.380
these soldiers.

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:11.100
That's part of the secret
of Caesar's success.

00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.870
I'm not going to
talk about this.

00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:16.940
Caesar was also a very talented
author, an intellectual

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.530
of the highest rank.

00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:22.130
He could hold his own in
discussions with philosophers.

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:26.720
And he was one of
the great orators.

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.390
He only gave speeches at
the beginning of his career,

00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:31.310
but these made
such an impression

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:35.690
that Cicero said he was ranking
among the highest, the best

00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:38.870
orators that Rome ever had.

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:41.600
He was an expert in style.

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:45.090
He wrote his historical
works, his commentaries,

00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:48.680
with the intention that
anybody could read them--

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.990
uneducated/educated persons.

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:56.120
And so he created a very simple,
straightforward, clear style

00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:59.630
that conveyed clearly
what he wanted to convey.

00:56:59.630 --> 00:57:04.710
And he wrote a work on good
style, good Latin style.

00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:06.620
And he dictated
this work while he

00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:10.280
was traveling on
horseback across the Alps

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:12.380
to rejoin his army.

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:14.360
Very unusual.

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:20.630
And then, of course, he also
wrote these commentaries.

00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:23.150
And they were
praised very highly.

00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:26.390
I only gave you the
second quote by Hirtius,

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:28.940
who wrote the eighth
book of the Gallic war.

00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:32.000
"The universal judgment
is that other writers,

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:37.790
despite their
painstaking efforts

00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:39.890
have produced
nothing that is not

00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:43.850
outdone by the refined elegance
of Caesar's commentaries.

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:46.850
They have been received
with unanimous approval.

00:57:46.850 --> 00:57:50.270
Yet we may feel greater
admiration than all others,

00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:54.210
for they know how well
and faultlessly he wrote,

00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:57.270
while we also know with
what ease and speed

00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:59.910
he completed the work."

00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:01.680
So this is Caesar,
the intellectual.

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:04.290
Let me just for the
end, turn briefly

00:58:04.290 --> 00:58:06.030
to what I call "the dark side."

00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:10.140
Of course, this conquest of
Gaul caused enormous losses.

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:14.040
Here you have the tally,
the casualty count.

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:17.490
1 million Celts dead,
1 million enslaved.

00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:19.980
This is what ancient
authors tell us.

00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:23.400
Out of the population
of 8 to 12 million--

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:27.150
reasonable estimates--
one fourth to one sixth

00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:31.110
of the total population
died in these conquests.

00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:35.220
In his triumph, in his great
victory celebration of 46,

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:39.990
Caesar listed the total
number of casualties, enemy

00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:42.090
casualties, in his battles.

00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:46.680
Not just in Gaul, but
all over the place.

00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:49.260
1,192,000.

00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:51.060
These are staggering figures.

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:54.545
And if you read
Caesar's story, when

00:58:54.545 --> 00:58:57.630
enemy swore an oath
of capitulation,

00:58:57.630 --> 00:59:00.990
and then broke the oath
and started to fight again,

00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:03.400
punishment was
absolutely brutal.

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:08.380
Either execution or enslavement.

00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:11.130
This is from
Trajan's Column where

00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:14.045
you see a scene like that.

00:59:14.045 --> 00:59:18.420
The Gallic War is beautifully
illustrated by this spiral

00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:23.740
column in Rome, which is, of
course, almost 200 years later.

00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:26.400
But the army didn't change
much in the meantime.

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.360
And it, therefore,
gives us a good idea.

00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:31.980
And I just give you
two examples of where

00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:38.250
the label of genocide that has
sometimes been used for Caesar

00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:40.770
actually would apply.

00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:48.275
One is a campaign in 55,
where Caesar massacred

00:59:48.275 --> 00:59:52.380
two German nations that
had crossed over into Gaul,

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:54.980
and that he distrusted deeply.

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:56.460
He wanted them out.

00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:58.980
And since they didn't
react quickly enough,

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:03.150
he just massacred
children, women, everybody.

01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:06.330
And he gives the
number as 430,000.

01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:08.220
Probably vastly exaggerated.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:12.450
But still, this was a
campaign of elimination.

01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:15.690
And that is very bad.

01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:19.370
And then, there was
one enemy leader,

01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:21.690
a leader of a Gallic nation.

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:23.890
His name was Ambiorix.

01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:25.620
He had been a
friend of Caesar's.

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:28.440
He had served in his army.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:31.980
And then he attacked
one of his winter camps

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:35.820
and tricked the
Caesar subcommanders

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:40.290
into leaving the camp, and
then ambushed and annihilated

01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:41.910
one and a half legions.

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:47.360
And Caesar pursued this man
with deep hatred after that.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:50.380
And not only the man
himself, but his nation.

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:53.760
And it was his goal to
eradicate this nation,

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.690
so that if Ambiorix ever
came back to his nation,

01:00:57.690 --> 01:01:01.500
he would not find anybody
whom he could rely on.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:05.670
That was a campaign of
revenge and eradication.

01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:08.730
That is, again, quite radical.

01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:11.850
On the other hand, there
is a balance to this.

01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:16.230
Caesar is to my
knowledge, the first,

01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:19.440
perhaps the only
ancient general,

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.220
who made clemency
his watch word, who

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:31.350
declared it to be his goal
and his default action

01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:33.780
and did it whenever he could.

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:38.280
If an enemy capitulated
before fighting broke out,

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.040
they could expect
to suffer no harm.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.730
And I give you two quotes
from the Gallic War.

01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:47.940
He said to a tribe
named the Atuatuci,

01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:50.070
"He would spare their nation--

01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:53.970
more because it was his habit
than because they deserved it--

01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:56.670
if they surrendered
before the battering ram

01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:58.470
touched their wall."

01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:03.000
And in the last year of the
war, in Uxellodunum, which was

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.270
mentioned by Bob, he punished--

01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:08.370
he had to set an
example because he

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:11.760
wanted this constant
rebelling to stop.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.610
He knew his command
was coming to an end.

01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:18.330
He wanted to leave a
pacified and quiet country.

01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:21.000
And so he punished
when they capitulated.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.630
He punished the defenders,
the men who had been fighting,

01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:27.000
by cutting off their hands.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.840
Letting them live, but
cutting off their hands.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:35.010
And he writes, "Caesar was aware
that his merciful disposition

01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:37.920
was known to everyone,
and he did not

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.670
need to be afraid that if he
acted more harshly than usual,

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:46.350
it would be ascribed to
his cruel character."

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:50.720
But then in the civil war,
both Pompey and Caesar

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.140
were expected to
behave like Sulla had,

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:59.030
with relentless persecution
of their opponents.

01:02:59.030 --> 01:03:01.220
And then after
his first victory,

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:06.710
even a large number of elite
Romans fell into his hands.

01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:10.250
He let them sensationally
go unharmed.

01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:14.630
And that brought a big
turn in public opinion.

01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:19.040
And in a letter that was
disseminated throughout Italy--

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.930
and Cicero has a copy.

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:23.900
And in his letters, we
can read that copy--

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.505
he made this
programmatic statement

01:03:26.505 --> 01:03:28.730
to two of his supporters.

01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:31.850
"I'm glad that you approve of
what happened at Corfinium"--

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:32.910
that's the place.

01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:34.910
"I had already
decided on a policy

01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:38.060
to demonstrate as much
leniency as possible.

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:41.600
Let's try whether in
this way we can regain

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:45.410
the goodwill of all people
and achieve lasting victory,

01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:48.410
because others have not
been able by cruelty

01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:51.200
to escape hatred and
to hold onto victory

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.700
for any length of time--

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:56.180
except only for Sulla whom
I not going to imitate.

01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:59.630
Let this be our new
way of conquering--

01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:03.800
to protect ourselves by
mercy and generosity."

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.250
I find this one of the
very impressive statements

01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:10.760
in history.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:15.020
In an earlier episode
in the civil war,

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:20.210
Caesar had trapped an enemy
army, immobilized them.

01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:24.920
And his army, his own army,
was sensing an easy victory

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:27.830
and demanding the
command to attack.

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:29.720
And Caesar refused.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.880
And he writes, "He
had come to hope

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.000
that he could finish this
business without a battle

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.600
and without exposing any
of his men to injury.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:42.290
Why, he thought, should he
risk losing some of his men,

01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:44.210
even in a successful battle?

01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:46.280
Why should he
accept that soldiers

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.240
who had served him with supreme
loyalty would be wounded?

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.510
He was also moved by pity
for his fellow citizens

01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:57.540
on the other side who, he
knew, would have to be killed.

01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:00.080
He preferred to achieve
his objective while they

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.450
were safe and unharmed."

01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:05.300
And so he forced
them to capitulate

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.050
by starving them out.

01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:13.960
So the idea, the
propagation of clemency

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:17.680
as a general's and
ruler's cardinal virtue

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.630
is Caesar's merit.

01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:22.750
And Augustus was the first,
who after the victory

01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:25.410
in the civil wars, was
given by the Senate

01:05:25.410 --> 01:05:31.650
a shield, a golden shield,
inscribed by the four--

01:05:31.650 --> 01:05:35.020
what became the four
cardinal virtues--

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:38.620
virtue, clemency,
justice, and piety.

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:40.300
And we have the inscription.

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:42.310
We have copies of it.

01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:44.710
It's illustrated on coins.

01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:49.000
So Augustus was the first
who actually expressed

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.420
these cardinal virtues, but they
go back to Caesar's initiative.

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:56.020
And I think that is worth
recording and mentioning

01:05:56.020 --> 01:06:00.200
because that also helps to
balance that dark picture which

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.880
I drew earlier.

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.390
Thank you very much.

01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:07.040
[APPLAUSE]
