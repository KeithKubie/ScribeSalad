00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
Hey, everyone. Hope you're having a fantastic day today. It's Mark Wiens in Tokyo Japan and

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:10.049
Today, I'm going to take you to eat at two of the most legendary

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.729
Some say they are the best for serving tonkatsu, Japanese tonkatsu, which is a breaded deep-fried pork cutlet

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.080
We're going to eat them back-to-back and a full review coming up about both of them

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.069
We just arrived to the first restaurant for tonkatsu and this place is really a cool place

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.180
In the neighborhood it occupies this little Corner Street

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.739
It has a real classic heritage appearance to it my mouth is watering for something deep fried and something crispy for to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.470
All thinking okay, okay, just opened up. Oh look at that pig

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.309
Oh arigato

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.149
We made it into the restaurant this place is called Butagumi and this is a really cool place

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:18.049
We came upstairs they led us to a table upstairs where right as they're open for lunch today, and it's a Japanese-style room

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.329
We got it's all wooden

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.250
this is

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.170
This is a cool dining atmosphere

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.789
It just has this amazing

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:34.098
Heritage classic feel through I got this restaurant recommendation from the Japan Times and they said you will not find may better

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.390
Tonkatsu in Tokyo that

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.140
one of the legends, one of the best and let's

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:42.409
Really, I already love this restaurant just looking through the menu

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.130
I've never seen so many types so many breeds of

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:50.839
Pig on one menu and all they're all labeled. They're all

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.410
Can you know exactly the type of pig that you're going to order and eat?

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.150
Isn't all this one has already filled out. Oh

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.819
Okay, I think so. They have like they have like

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.560
Over 20 different types of pigs available at this restaurant

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.810
But they only have they mark it with these little little pink strips, and those are the only ones that are available today

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.810
So today we have real

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.219
Real Cotton from Okinawa

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.270
All the Golden boar the Golden boar is available. I gotta have the golden boar I can get this restaurant

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.109
They know that when you're looking through the menu and when you're ordering they know your mouth

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.249
It's going to be watering so as soon as you order, then they give you a little dish of tomatoes

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.579
And these are a little little appetizer

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.850
Wow

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.930
Wow

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.640
That has like a porky flavor or am I just imagining that that is the only evening though that is one of the juiciest

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.780
Like single bites of tomato maybe I've ever had. How did they do that to a tomato?

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.040
Okay, so first we're getting the rice and soup

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:22.140
Okay, the anticipation is increasing the Golden boar is about to arrive. Oh, thank you very much, Golden boy

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.340
Arigato. As soon as she brought this to the table, I can smell the aroma of that meat

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.629
Smells incredible. How to enjoy tonkatsu - they even have a printout of how to enjoy tonkatsu

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.450
Ponzu sauce

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.689
Oh - sprinkle with Himalayan pink rock salt and spoon the sauce into the small dish and then

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.870
Do not drizzle do not drizzle it over the pork and then I need it with Japanese mustard

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.730
if you look deep

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.350
closely into that tonkatsu

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.859
and almost it like reminds me of

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.960
when they they chop a big stone in half with gems and all the minerals in the middle

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.820
It's it's it's unique like a snowflake. Every tonkatsu is different. Oh

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.669
That's gorgeous, a very pretty thing

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.920
It's served with rice on the side as well as cabbage salad and some pickles and miso soup and also

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.420
I just got to go straight in for the golden boar. That's going to be my first bite. Oh

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.390
It's so pretty.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:40.159
I was just going to look at that because the way that the the crunchiness is just piled onto that piece of that slice of pork?

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.349
Wow, that's beautiful and even in my chopsticks. I can just feel the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.890
collapsing of those little crunchy bits oh

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.890
that meat has that meat is fatty oh and

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.900
Juicy I was expecting it to be more kind of heavy and ready

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.279
But it's so light and like a like a fluffy crispiness

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:17.270
I will prepare my dressing sauce is next. This one here is the main tonkatsu sauce, the main ponzu sauce

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.060
Which I will

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.340
add to this bowl

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:28.359
and then they said to sprinkle it with a little bit of the Himalayan salt - which is this one? Could that be the

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.009
No, that's mustard. Oh I do like the mustard too. Well maybe I'll add some mustard to

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.340
the bowl as well

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.520
Give that just a little sprinkle

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.690
it's already a little bit salty but not too salty, but just a little sprinkle, and I should do it and

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.010
moving back

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.520
It dip into the classic tonkatsu sauce

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.959
Well, that's just ridiculous or even the sauce is amazing. It's a little bit has that Worcestershire sauce flavor to it

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.230
it's a little bit sour and

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.259
You know this golden boar. I think as opposed to just regular

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.810
regular raised farm raised pig it has a little slightly more of a

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.600
like a gamey taste, but but like a

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.120
Like a free-range - well, it's a boar

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.000
So like a free-range taste to it

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.589
you got to have that you gotta have the cabbage salad with tonkatsu to kind of break the grease and

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.660
To switch up the flavor, so you'll almost always be served a cabbage salad when you when you order tonkatsu

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.680
very light and very refreshing and I like how it shaved so thin

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.900
next type of tonkatsu and this one is from an

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.850
Okinawan breed. This one was the recommended pig of the day. This is the pig of the day

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.039
Oh look at just how thick that is

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.840
Hoho

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.449
It's like just just deep-fried pork on another level. For this one, I'll go mustard

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:15.929
This one has a totally different texture to it than the golden boar, this one is more

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.129
It literally has like the softness of a chicken breast

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.619
What a balanced tough tender meat and crispy edges

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.029
And then that at the end of your meal, you're served a cup of tea

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:44.490
Very light, but it really feels good to drink something hot to wash it down. Oh, I guess though

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.729
They have a little cabinet here right at the front of the restaurant where they have some premium

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:56.020
Pork cuts, oh

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:02.160
I don't know which one is the golden boar. Maybe one of these that I just ate. That is a restaurant

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:08.579
I'm coming out of here feeling like I have experienced something new with pork that was very, very tasty

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:11.020
very, very elegant

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:16.770
Delicate, pretty high-end. But really really classy, really really well done, extreme quality and

00:08:17.289 --> 00:08:19.919
How can you beat choosing your pig?

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:30.628
one legendary tonkatsu down it's time to go directly to the next tonkatsu and the next place as

00:08:30.939 --> 00:08:31.979
This is the place

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:38.369
I'm really really looking forward to people people actually have mixed reviews about it some people say it's the absolute best in tokyo

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:44.579
Some people say it's kind of old style, but whatever whatever anybody says is

00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:51.299
there's no doubt that this is one of the most legendary places to eat tonkatsu in Tokyo and

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:54.328
We're going to go jump on the train to get there

00:08:55.839 --> 00:08:59.939
Go in here. Yeah, we're on our way to Meguro station for the next home costume

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:15.100
Made it to Meguro station, and it should be just a short walk from here to the next tonkatsu restaurant

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.599
The next tonkatsu restaurant is called Tonkatsu Tonki and they open up at 4 p.m.. In the evening

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.489
We're here just about 15 minutes before they open and there's gonna be about

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.810
10 people in front of me, but they're opening up pretty soon

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:42.609
This is one of the ultimate legends of tonkatsu in Tokyo they've been serving tonkatsu since 1939 so you can be

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:46.450
assured that they they have a proven recipe.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:58.839
I am loving this place as soon as we stepped foot in here you it's just uh it's really really spacious

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.220
It's just an entire bar counter seating and they have about about 10

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.530
Employees or master tonkatsu chefs who are working around the bar counter

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:15.250
It's extremely spacious They just say you can sit there and watch them as they make the tonkatsu they put the give us

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.099
Chunks of pork and then put it into flour and then dip it in the egg mixture and then back in the flour

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.330
He does that like two or three times

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.410
and then finally into the bread mixture and that into the hot oil

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:32.079
This is so cool. And then right into the big vats of boiling oil

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:38.019
I can smell the like deep frying oil bubbles in this establishment

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:51.959
The wait is over, my tonkatsu has arrived

00:10:52.449 --> 00:10:55.199
I think it took about 15 minutes for it to come

00:10:55.199 --> 00:11:01.498
but that 15 minutes went by so fast because I was just watching them in awe as they make this tonkatsu they

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:07.980
Could make this with their eyes closed. They've done so many times, and it's just a beautiful process and it comes to you

00:11:08.079 --> 00:11:09.930
They take it out of the hot oil

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:15.629
And then he cuts it into bite-sized pieces. Cuts it long ways and then cut it into bite-size pieces

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:22.199
You can see that. It's a totally different style. It's totally different breaded crust

00:11:23.079 --> 00:11:29.549
It's almost like a like a deep-fried skin around the tonkatsu and then they serve it with a pile of cabbage rice

00:11:29.579 --> 00:11:35.219
There's pickles, miso soup, the classic works, and then a dab of mustard on the side. Oh, I can't wait

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:40.438
It is just glistening and steaming hot right now. That golden-ness. They put a little bit of sauce

00:11:40.439 --> 00:11:42.399
But then they have the sauce up on that

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:46.799
Counter there where you can grab it yourself and most people I see just drizzle it all over their tonkatsu

00:11:47.079 --> 00:11:50.008
But you can see that skin just kind of peels back that deep fried crust

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:56.579
I'm going to go for a piece with no sauce on it for my first bite and right out of that center console right there

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.450
Well that has a totally different

00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:12.829
Texture feel and taste to it and the other version that I had

00:12:13.649 --> 00:12:15.510
This is much more

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.019
Like your like a pork fried

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.010
like a deep-fried pork country style the pork is

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.490
Maybe there's some fattier sides

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:31.159
But the piece I got was quite lean and then you have like almost like a it's almost like a crunchy pancake breaded layer

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.720
on the outside

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:39.890
That's good, but I am going to I'm going to drench it in the sauce, and I see most people apply pretty generously

00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:43.399
both on the tonkatsu and

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:49.849
On the salad you try another another piece in this time. I'm going I'm going all in with the mustard and sauce

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.230
Well, oh

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:07.820
All that mustard in the contrast of this mighty mustard without a sweet-and-sour wish - sure tonkatsu sauce

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.060
It's delicious

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.120
absolutely delicious, it's uh

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.900
like Your country Style fried tonkatsu

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:22.919
I got the leaner side on my first few bites, but this side over here

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.850
That is the fatty side check out that you really got to get it

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:31.109
You got to be careful here, or you'll lose your your breading will fall off your pork.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.330
But I'm a huge fan of the mustard

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:51.020
All that one on my nose all that was done fatty juicy piece kind of crunchy in a fried batter kind of way

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.810
it's not nearly it's not exactly not a delicate tonkatsu this is a

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.710
This is a diner style. Don't God oh

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.820
That is amazing

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.310
oh

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.119
Then the final component of this meal deal is the soup the miso soup

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:27.200
And this is not just any miso soup aww there are pieces of what looks like pork bellies sliced up within there

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.570
porky miso soup

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:41.960
That soup's amazing. Oh, oh you can make the fatty richness the fatty pork fattiness of that

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.040
That's one of those warming broths

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:56.059
In mission tonkatsu in Tokyo it accomplished that was delicious

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:03.349
But totally different from the other tonkatsu experience. This place. It's just absolutely legendary

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.700
Such a cool restaurant

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.100
They're friendly here

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:14.780
And it just it has a almost like a like a social Barbershop atmosphere kind of feeling to it

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.080
finished with the Duo tonkatsu in Tokyo

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.509
I thought it was going to be easier to compare the two

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:28.219
But they're actually they're so different, almost uncomparable, almost like two completely different schools of Japanese tonkatsu

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.480
the one at

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:37.250
Butagumi, the first place, it was I mean it was by all all means the most gourmet high quality ingredients

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.939
Really, but it was really really delicate really

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.369
Elegant it was one of those fried pieces of fried pork. It wasn't just any piece of fried pork

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.370
It was a piece of fried pork that you wanted to kind of like

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:54.829
nibble on partly because it's so expensive and then also because of the quality whereas the one here at

00:15:55.430 --> 00:16:01.789
Tonki it was that diner style that you get and where you want to just you you can just dump on the sauce

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.000
You can take big bites. You can scarf it down

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:12.140
The is so totally different totally different styles. They're really hard to compare or to even

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:19.190
Put them up against each other yeah. I mean that's my consensus definitely the one at Butagumi is better quality

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:24.950
That was the awe in your mouth, but the one at Tonki. I really like the style

00:16:25.529 --> 00:16:28.489
Where you can sit the open bar you can watch them

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:30.630
creating

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.659
Expertly cooking up your your tonkatsu

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.209
Yeah, or you're just going to have to see for yourself.

00:16:35.209 --> 00:16:40.459
You're going to have to you're going to have to come to both of them or try other tonkatsu is around Tokyo

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:47.510
I'm going to leave all of the details in the description box about both restaurants, so you can check them out yourself and

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.770
I think that comes to the end of this Tokyo tonkatsu

00:16:54.149 --> 00:16:58.399
