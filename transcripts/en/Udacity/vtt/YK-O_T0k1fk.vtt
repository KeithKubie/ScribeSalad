00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.050
Humans have been trying to figure out how traits are inherited

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.430
in all their peculiar ways since the beginning of recorded history.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.640
&gt;&gt; Listen. I think we can even hear the eternal argument happening now.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.000
&gt;&gt; You gotta be kidding me. Pea plants. I can explain blended

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.410
traits, but you think what works for pea plants works for humans?

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.930
&gt;&gt; My method explains all the traits

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.950
that yours can't, even those that appear to

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.640
skip generations. After the rules of heredity

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.470
are true for all living things. From pea

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.380
plants to humans.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.180
&gt;&gt; No, you guys are forgetting about the really complex

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.530
behavioral traits that play a big part in the environment.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.530
&gt;&gt;

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.700
[CROSSTALK]

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.040
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.270
&gt;&gt; guys, there's no need to yell at each other. I'm sure this is something

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.220
we can settle with the friendly demonstration. Hippocrates

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.970
Why don't we go with your idea first?
