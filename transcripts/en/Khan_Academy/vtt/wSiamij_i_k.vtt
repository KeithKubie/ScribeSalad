00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.770
So we have f of x is equal to
negative x plus 4, and f of x

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.460
is graphed right here on
our coordinate plane.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.690
Let's try to figure out
what the inverse of f is.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.770
And to figure out the inverse,
what I like to do is I set y, I

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.590
set the variable y, equal to f
of x, or we could write that y

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.130
is equal to negative x plus 4.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.040
Right now, we've solved
for y in terms of x.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.750
To solve for the inverse,
we do the opposite.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.600
We solve for x in terms of y.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.570
So let's subtract 4
from both sides.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.160
You get y minus 4 is
equal to negative x.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.000
And then to solve for x, we can
multiply both sides of this

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.960
equation times negative 1.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.530
And so you get negative
y plus 4 is equal to x.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.390
Or just because we're always
used to writing the dependent

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.770
variable on the left-hand side,
we could rewrite this as x is

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.620
equal to negative y plus 4.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.300
Or another way to write it
is we could say that f

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:06.840
inverse of y is equal
to negative y plus 4.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.470
So this is the inverse function
right here, and we've written

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.360
it as a function of y, but we
can just rename the y as x

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.950
so it's a function of x.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.080
So let's do that.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.120
So if we just rename this y as
x, we get f inverse of x is

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.780
equal to the negative x plus 4.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.540
These two functions
are identical.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.730
Here, we just used y as the
independent variable, or

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.760
as the input variable.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.660
Here we just use x, but they
are identical functions.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.840
Now, just out of interest,
let's graph the inverse

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.220
function and see how it
might relate to this

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.190
one right over here.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.250
So if you look at it,
it actually looks

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.510
fairly identical.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.010
It's a negative x plus 4.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.395
It's the exact same function.

00:01:48.395 --> 00:01:51.630
So let's see, if we have-- the
y-intercept is 4, it's going

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.950
to be the exact same thing.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.810
The function is
its own inverse.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.990
So if we were to graph it,
we would put it right

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.930
on top of this.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.730
And so, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.530
In the first inverse function
video, I talked about how a

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.390
function and their inverse--
they are the reflection

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.030
over the line y equals x.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.220
So where's the line
y equals x here?

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.445
Well, line y equals
x looks like this.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.710
And negative x plus 4 is
actually perpendicular to y is

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.780
equal to x, so when you reflect
it, you're just kind of

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.830
flipping it over, but it's
going to be the same line.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.670
It is its own reflection.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.470
Now, let's make sure that
that actually makes sense.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.700
When we're dealing with the
standard function right

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.480
there, if you input a 2,
it gets mapped to a 2.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.750
If you input a 4, it
gets mapped to 0.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.370
What happens if you
go the other way?

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.460
If you input a 2, well, 2
gets mapped to 2 either

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.870
way, so that makes sense.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.180
For the regular function,
4 gets mapped to 0.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.320
For the inverse function,
0 gets mapped to 4.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.710
So it actually makes
complete sense.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.610
Let's think about
it another way.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.770
For the regular function-- let
me write it explicitly down.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.390
This might be obvious to
you, but just in case it's

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.950
not, it might be helpful.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.440
Let's pick f of 5.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.020
f of 5 is equal to negative 1.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.900
Or we could say, the function f
maps us from 5 to negative 1.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.230
Now, what does f inverse do?

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.190
What's f inverse of negative 1?

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.325
f inverse of negative 1 is 5.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.000
Or we could say that f maps
us from negative 1 to 5.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.140
So once again, if you think
about kind of the sets, they're

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.370
our domains and our ranges.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.070
So let's say that this is
the domain of f, this

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.760
is the range of f.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:59.040
f will take us from
to negative 1.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.960
That's what the
function f does.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.920
And we see that f inverse takes
us back from negative 1 to 5.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.720
f inverse takes us back
from negative 1 to 5, just

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.320
like it's supposed to do.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.200
Let's do one more of these.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.070
So here I have g of x is equal
to negative 2x minus 1.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.000
So just like the last problem,
I like to set y equal to this.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.340
So we say y is equal to g
of x, which is equal to

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.740
negative 2x minus 1.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.950
Now we just solve for x.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.910
y plus 1 is equal
to negative 2x.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.920
Just added 1 to both sides.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.050
Now we can divide both sides of
this equation by negative 2,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:46.630
and so you get negative y over
2 minus 1/2 is equal to x, or

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.420
we could write x is equal to
negative y over 2 minus 1/2, or

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.260
we could write f inverse as a
function of y is equal to

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.435
negative y over 2 minus 1/2, or
we can just rename y as x.

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:08.270
And we could say that f inverse
of-- oh, let me careful here.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.250
That shouldn't be an f.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.300
The original function was
g , so let me be clear.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:21.850
That is g inverse of y is equal
to negative y over 2 minus 1/2

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.340
because we started with a
g of x, not an f of x.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.120
Make sure we get our
notation right.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.010
Or we could just rename the y
and say g inverse of x is equal

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.320
to negative x over 2 minus 1/2.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.140
Now, let's graph it.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.970
Its y-intercept
is negative 1/2.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.970
It's right over there.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.460
And it has a slope
of negative 1/2.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.760
Let's see, if we start at
negative 1/2, if we move over

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.500
to 1 in the positive direction,
it will go down half.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.770
If we move over 1 again, it
will go down half again.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.650
If we move back-- so
it'll go like that.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.440
So the line, I'll try my
best to draw it, will

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.830
look something like that.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.580
It'll just keep going, so it'll
look something like that, and

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.170
it'll keep going in
both directions.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.400
And now let's see if this
really is a reflection over y

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.910
equals x. y equals x looks
like that, and you can see

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:22.750
they are a reflection.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.440
If you reflect this guy, if you
reflect this blue line, it

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.220
becomes this orange line.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.885
But the general idea, you
literally just-- a function

00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:34.460
is originally expressed, is
solved for y in terms of x.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.530
You just do some algebra.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.750
Solve for x in terms of y, and
that's essentially your inverse

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.120
function as a function of y,
but then you can rename

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.700
it as a function of x.
