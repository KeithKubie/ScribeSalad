and of course that would be enough just

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700
and of course that would be enough just
 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.130
and of course that would be enough just
to do that I've wanted it to do it

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140
to do that I've wanted it to do it
 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.039

it that's great I so tell us a little
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.030
it that's great I so tell us a little
bit about the set up so we can say that

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040
bit about the set up so we can say that

front of the cake droid there so so how

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290
front of the cake droid there so so how
 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.480
front of the cake droid there so so how
does that work what does what does that

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490
does that work what does what does that
 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.120
does that work what does what does that
bring to the equation well the idea is

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130
bring to the equation well the idea is
 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.710
bring to the equation well the idea is
that you know you really let people know

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720

that's telling you to do is you need to
have an NFC badge of some kind you can

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729
have an NFC badge of some kind you can
 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.300
have an NFC badge of some kind you can
use the standard sticker kind it's just

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
use the standard sticker kind it's just
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.459
use the standard sticker kind it's just
got a tag number on it or what we're

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469
got a tag number on it or what we're
 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.520
got a tag number on it or what we're
having fun doing is using our

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530
having fun doing is using our
 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.350
having fun doing is using our
our voyage phones that have the NFC

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360
our voyage phones that have the NFC
 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.420
our voyage phones that have the NFC
built into it so as long as i unlock my

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430
built into it so as long as i unlock my
 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.070
built into it so as long as i unlock my
phone and hold it over the scanner

one of the two options well what happens
then so does that still get controlled

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590
then so does that still get controlled
 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.430
then so does that still get controlled
by the zoom in the ATK yeah so now that

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440
by the zoom in the ATK yeah so now that

actually opens up it that sends a
 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.500
actually opens up it that sends a
message to the Arduino that then tells

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510
message to the Arduino that then tells
 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.290
message to the Arduino that then tells
they actually resets the flow meter and

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300
they actually resets the flow meter and
 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.600

you thought about what the next steps

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979
you thought about what the next steps
 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.010
you thought about what the next steps
might be about from different beers of

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020
might be about from different beers of
 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.279
might be about from different beers of
course yeah actually we you know this is

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289
course yeah actually we you know this is

what happens now if you think about it

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210
what happens now if you think about it

what happens now if you think about it
you have two taps but you can only do

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889
you have two taps but you can only do
 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.460
you have two taps but you can only do
one at a time so if you actually have a

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470
one at a time so if you actually have a
 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.950
one at a time so if you actually have a
professional system you know each tap

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960
professional system you know each tap
 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.629
professional system you know each tap
should be independent and work that way

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639
should be independent and work that way
 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.939
should be independent and work that way
and right now it only you can do one at

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949
and right now it only you can do one at
 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.749
and right now it only you can do one at
a time so we're looking at the vote and

things which we find we can use as
 

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:30.970

means vote but don't be offended if we
 

00:12:32.779 --> 00:12:34.930
means vote but don't be offended if we
don't pick all of the apps specifically

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:34.940
don't pick all of the apps specifically
 

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.350

enough housekeeping let's also look at
 

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.550
enough housekeeping let's also look at
some apps why would it forgot so we've

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560
some apps why would it forgot so we've
 

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.530
some apps why would it forgot so we've
got three and note-taking apps which

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:44.540
got three and note-taking apps which
 

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.790
got three and note-taking apps which
hopefully will get a chance to look at

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800
hopefully will get a chance to look at
 

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.879
hopefully will get a chance to look at
notes well so you can probably read it

00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:48.889
notes well so you can probably read it
 

00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:51.970
notes well so you can probably read it
here notes notes and share note and

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:51.980
here notes notes and share note and
 

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.610
here notes notes and share note and
papyrus so let's let's get started with

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:54.620
papyrus so let's let's get started with
 

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.540
papyrus so let's let's get started with
notes and share open that up on first

00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:58.550
notes and share open that up on first

okay so so this is an app which is using

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240
okay so so this is an app which is using
 

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.650
okay so so this is an app which is using
sort of a non-standard style if you will

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:13.660
sort of a non-standard style if you will
 

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.999
sort of a non-standard style if you will
so it looks like they've gone with sort

00:13:14.999 --> 00:13:15.009
so it looks like they've gone with sort
 

00:13:15.009 --> 00:13:16.350
so it looks like they've gone with sort
of a you know your standard sort of

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:54.480
now there's a lot of people which will
argue with me they will you know point

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:54.490
argue with me they will you know point
 

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.220
argue with me they will you know point
out all the reasons why is a user they

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:56.230
out all the reasons why is a user they
 

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.170
out all the reasons why is a user they
want to have an exit button and I

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:58.180
want to have an exit button and I
 

00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.910
want to have an exit button and I
understand where you're coming from the

00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920
understand where you're coming from the
 

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.110
understand where you're coming from the
thing to remember is it's totally

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120
thing to remember is it's totally
 

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.090
thing to remember is it's totally
ambiguous because you as a user have no

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:03.100
ambiguous because you as a user have no
 

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.910
ambiguous because you as a user have no
idea what the developer has done to

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:05.920
idea what the developer has done to
 

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.010
idea what the developer has done to
implement that exit button so maybe it

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:08.020
implement that exit button so maybe it
 

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.110
implement that exit button so maybe it
does what you want maybe it turns off

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.120
does what you want maybe it turns off
 

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.630
does what you want maybe it turns off
all of the services removes all of the

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640
all of the services removes all of the
 

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.660
all of the services removes all of the
alarms and exits the app or more likely

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:15.670
alarms and exits the app or more likely
 

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:18.110
alarms and exits the app or more likely
all it's going to do is call finish and

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120
all it's going to do is call finish and
 

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.340
all it's going to do is call finish and
calling finish is exactly what happens

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:20.350
calling finish is exactly what happens
 

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.330
calling finish is exactly what happens
when you hit the back button on your

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:21.340
when you hit the back button on your
 

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.490
when you hit the back button on your
main activity so it's effectively doing

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:23.500
main activity so it's effectively doing
 

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.170
main activity so it's effectively doing
the same thing and the difference here

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:25.180
the same thing and the difference here
 

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.480
the same thing and the difference here
is a user is you don't know what it's

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:27.490
is a user is you don't know what it's
 

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:29.970
is a user is you don't know what it's
it's an ambiguous button it it doesn't

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:29.980
it's an ambiguous button it it doesn't
 

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.650
it's an ambiguous button it it doesn't
have any clear directive to know what's

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:31.660
have any clear directive to know what's
 

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.430
have any clear directive to know what's
actually half

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:32.440
actually half
 

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.860
actually half
so I'm going to stop ranting before I go

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:34.870
so I'm going to stop ranting before I go
 

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:38.940
so I'm going to stop ranting before I go

three bottom buttons are kind of
 

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.340
three bottom buttons are kind of
unnecessary to have on the main screen

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:50.350
unnecessary to have on the main screen
 

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.590

see here that they've actually
 

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.490
see here that they've actually
implemented the button behavior properly

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:01.500
implemented the button behavior properly
 

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.619

fantastic a lot of people building
 

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.600
fantastic a lot of people building
custom controls forget to implement

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:12.610
custom controls forget to implement
 

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.869
custom controls forget to implement
those state indicators and it makes a

00:19:15.869 --> 00:19:15.879
those state indicators and it makes a
 

00:19:15.879 --> 00:19:18.299
those state indicators and it makes a
huge difference so yeah this is this is

00:19:18.299 --> 00:19:18.309
huge difference so yeah this is this is
 

00:19:18.309 --> 00:19:20.730

text notes okay I wonder if they

00:19:22.169 --> 00:19:22.179
text notes okay I wonder if they
 

00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:25.560
text notes okay I wonder if they
implemented a focused state that's a

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:25.570
implemented a focused state that's a
 

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:27.269
implemented a focused state that's a
good question i'm not advise tested our

00:19:27.269 --> 00:19:27.279
good question i'm not advise tested our
 

00:19:27.279 --> 00:19:29.249
good question i'm not advise tested our
advisor so that's a good point actually

00:19:29.249 --> 00:19:29.259
advisor so that's a good point actually
 

00:19:29.259 --> 00:19:31.080
advisor so that's a good point actually
there's Fred makes is that one of the

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.090
there's Fred makes is that one of the
 

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:32.700
there's Fred makes is that one of the
things that you want to make sure you do

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:32.710
things that you want to make sure you do
 

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.080
things that you want to make sure you do
if you are doing States is have the

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.090
if you are doing States is have the
 

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.279
if you are doing States is have the
focus state so if you're navigating

00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:35.289
focus state so if you're navigating
 

00:19:35.289 --> 00:19:39.930
focus state so if you're navigating
through it using a d-pad or a TV yeah

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:39.940
through it using a d-pad or a TV yeah
 

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.009
through it using a d-pad or a TV yeah
we're vegetarians so there are

00:19:41.009 --> 00:19:41.019
we're vegetarians so there are
 

00:19:41.019 --> 00:19:42.859
we're vegetarians so there are
essentially three states really natural

00:19:42.859 --> 00:19:42.869
essentially three states really natural
 

00:19:42.869 --> 00:19:44.230
essentially three states really natural
normal

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240
normal
 

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.610
normal
going to normal I think so no more

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:45.620
going to normal I think so no more
 

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:50.110
going to normal I think so no more
focused and you know pressed exactly so

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.120
focused and you know pressed exactly so
 

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.340
focused and you know pressed exactly so
make sure you do all of them so that it

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:51.350
make sure you do all of them so that it
 

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.140
make sure you do all of them so that it
and that helps for accessibility as well

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:53.150
and that helps for accessibility as well
 

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.549
and that helps for accessibility as well
so it's really it's really a good idea

00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559
so it's really it's really a good idea
 

00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:57.520
so it's really it's really a good idea
all right so we're in the notes and we

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:57.530
all right so we're in the notes and we
 

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.130
all right so we're in the notes and we
can just start typing so again we're

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:00.140
can just start typing so again we're
 

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:05.590
can just start typing so again we're
using this nice I can't talk and type at

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600
using this nice I can't talk and type at
 

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.160
using this nice I can't talk and type at
the same time all right nice so you can

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:09.170
the same time all right nice so you can
 

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.049
the same time all right nice so you can
see here move this down slightly we're

00:20:11.049 --> 00:20:11.059
see here move this down slightly we're
 

00:20:11.059 --> 00:20:12.730
see here move this down slightly we're
just basically using this this notepad

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:12.740
just basically using this this notepad
 

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.450
just basically using this this notepad
paradigm so things look like a notepad

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:15.460
paradigm so things look like a notepad
 

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.440
paradigm so things look like a notepad
which is interesting I think there's a

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:17.450
which is interesting I think there's a
 

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:18.760
which is interesting I think there's a
lot of debate over whether or not that's

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:18.770
lot of debate over whether or not that's
 

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.860
lot of debate over whether or not that's
sort of the best approach on mobile but

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:20.870
sort of the best approach on mobile but
 

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:22.660
sort of the best approach on mobile but
it's in keeping with the style of the

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:22.670
it's in keeping with the style of the
 

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.370
it's in keeping with the style of the
rest of their app right and it doesn't

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:24.380
rest of their app right and it doesn't
 

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.980
rest of their app right and it doesn't
seem to be slowing things down so I'd

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:26.990
seem to be slowing things down so I'd
 

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.510
seem to be slowing things down so I'd
say that's reasonable again I would say

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:28.520
say that's reasonable again I would say
 

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.360
say that's reasonable again I would say

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:06.730
save button should be redundant so you
should build in something here to make

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:06.740

probably have this as your home screen

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600
probably have this as your home screen
 

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.630
probably have this as your home screen
so I like the idea of the first time you

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640
so I like the idea of the first time you
 

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.390
so I like the idea of the first time you
open it when you have no notes of

open it when you have no notes of
opening it to sort of that screen where

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:31.140
opening it to sort of that screen where
 

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.080
opening it to sort of that screen where
you can start typing straight away once

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:33.090
you can start typing straight away once
 

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:34.730
you can start typing straight away once
you have multiple notes so it would be

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:34.740
you have multiple notes so it would be
 

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.080
you have multiple notes so it would be
nice to be able to return to a home

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:36.090
nice to be able to return to a home
 

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:37.640
nice to be able to return to a home
screen which had that list so that

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:37.650
screen which had that list so that
 

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:39.320

you're able to choose from and for me

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:39.330
you're able to choose from and for me
 

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.390

intuitively hitting back from any

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.830
intuitively hitting back from any
particular note should take you to that

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840
particular note should take you to that
 

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.720

list of yeah definitely now on the

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:44.730
list of yeah definitely now on the
 

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.580

it's appropriate because you have an up

00:32:51.039 --> 00:32:51.049
it's appropriate because you have an up
 

00:32:51.049 --> 00:32:53.870
it's appropriate because you have an up
affordance where you bring it back to

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880
affordance where you bring it back to
 

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.540
affordance where you bring it back to
the sort of but hierarchically this

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:56.550
the sort of but hierarchically this
 

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.940
the sort of but hierarchically this
should be kind of any other way around

00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:58.950
should be kind of any other way around

you go back up

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080
you go back up
 

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.740
you go back up
make sense exactly supposedly this is

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:02.750
make sense exactly supposedly this is
 

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.110
make sense exactly supposedly this is
the topmost level of your application

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120
the topmost level of your application
 

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.240
the topmost level of your application
yeah so indeed so that's what what I

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:07.250
yeah so indeed so that's what what I
 

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:08.440
yeah so indeed so that's what what I
think we would suggest is that you

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:08.450
think we would suggest is that you
 

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:09.940
think we would suggest is that you
switch these around so that when you're

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:09.950
switch these around so that when you're
 

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:11.470
switch these around so that when you're
in a particular note you have the UH

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:11.480
in a particular note you have the UH
 

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.430
in a particular note you have the UH
performance over here and then once you

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440
performance over here and then once you
 

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.080
performance over here and then once you
hit back then you have this which just

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:17.090
hit back then you have this which just
 

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:19.570
hit back then you have this which just
becomes your home screen right so be

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:19.580
becomes your home screen right so be
 

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.159
becomes your home screen right so be
interesting to know you know why you

00:33:21.159 --> 00:33:21.169
interesting to know you know why you
