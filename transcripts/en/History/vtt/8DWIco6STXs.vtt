00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:02.544
- Oh, wait.

00:00:02.544 --> 00:00:03.586
What have you got
right there, Shannon,

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:04.754
on the other side of that truck?

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:06.172
Is that a Firebird?

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:07.173
SHANNON: I can't see.

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:07.757
Let's go see what they got.

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:14.848
Is your dad home?

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.307
Is your dad home?

00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:18.184
- That is a Firebird, huh?
- Yeah.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.728
Look at me, man.

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.980
How are you doing?
Good.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.940
We just wanted to talk
to you about your car.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.400
Is that all right?
I'm Kevin.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.109
Hi, Kevin.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.985
I'm Drew.

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.153
Drew, nice to meet you.

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:28.945
Shannon, nice
to meet you, Drew.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:30.196
Nice to meet you.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:30.947
Have you had this
thing for a while?

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.827
Your dad bought
this brand new in '67?

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.251
Wow.
1967 was a year of firsts.

00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:44.753
The first "Rolling
Stone" magazine

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:47.213
was published, the world's
first heart transplant

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.340
surgery was
performed, and Pontiac

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.092
released the first Firebirds.

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:53.511
It was the beginning
of 35 years of success

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:55.722
for this model, which
sold more than two million

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.223
cars throughout its run.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.767
It looks like
it's in great shape.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:01.770
There's no heavy rust around
the windows or anything.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.021
They're usually tore up.

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.147
- You want to see the engine?
- Sure.

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:05.899
Yeah.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:06.983
I just dumped some money into
the engine, and transmission,

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:08.485
all the power train stuff.

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:10.195
Yeah, you would never
tell by the outside, huh?

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:11.613
Yeah.

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:14.032
It's a wolf in
sheep's clothing.

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:16.201
So what are your plans
on this whole thing?

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:19.287
Next step was going to be all
my interior, weather stripping,

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:20.872
and then all the upholstery.

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.540
But not full
body, rest though?

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.708
I'd like to.

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:24.751
I just don't got
the money for it.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.377
This is in great shape.

00:01:26.377 --> 00:01:29.297
So it's not like you got to
go in and replace panels.

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:30.465
It's been a fun car.

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.091
He handed it to
me when I was 17.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.552
So I've had it since this.

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:36.513
This was my daily driver for--

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:37.680
So you drove this
to high school?

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.182
You must have been the man.

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.392
I was in a lot of trouble.

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:42.811
You never wrecked it?

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:44.187
Never wrecked it.

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:45.939
Wow, beautiful car.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.857
So no way you're
selling it, right?

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:49.734
- No, I don't want to sell it.
- You know what?

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:51.903
If you decide you want
to do the interior work,

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.656
or you want to do any paint
work, that's what we do.

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:55.740
Appreciate it, man.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.992
[interposing voices]

00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:58.952
- Have a good one.
- Thanks.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.161
You guys too.

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:01.079
SHANNON: I can't
stop looking at it.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.789
KEVIN: I know.
I know.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:03.790
You want to be able to show
the boys, look what we found.
