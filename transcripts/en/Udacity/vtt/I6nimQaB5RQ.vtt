00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now in this problem, I want to think of a mass and pulling it back against a spring by a distance Δx.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I've told you what the spring constant is here.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
When I release this mass it's going to go across this friction in this blue area,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
over this rough surface where there is some force of friction (F = 1 N),

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
back towards this friction in this area, up to this curve ramp.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's going to travel up, up, up, up, up, up, up and back down,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
back over the area with friction, it's going to compress the spring, and so on.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The cycle will repeat many times until eventually well the mass will run out of energy

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because every time the mass travels over this area of friction

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
well it's going to lose some of its kinetic energy.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It'll lose all of its kinetic energy. It'll go to 0, and the mass will have stopped somewhere on here.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Your task is to tell me where.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If we defined some coordinate x,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and this x goes from 0 at the beginning of this area with friction all the way to—

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
well the length is 0.8, so where's the mass when the motion stops?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And another interesting thing to think about, what's the maximum height that the mass ever reaches

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
when it launches off this ramp?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The point of this question is to get you thinking and talking about energy transitions

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and what happens with friction.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
There's no solution video, and I'm not even going to have you answer the question here.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
What I want you to do is to see the thread in the link below this video,

00:01:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and go there and talk about this question. Share you answers. Talk about your approach.
