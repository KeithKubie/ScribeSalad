00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.870
Developer is not only to code.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.480
It's about inventing and creating new things.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.589
You need to put something
of you,

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.640
make it personal and I think that this is a form of art.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.250
I am Vincento Colucci, I am
twenty-five years old.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.630
and I'm a developer here in Manfredonia, Italy.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.270
Being a developer gives you the same
power

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.829
of an inventor, and my dad always taught me that

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.710
if you need something, you can build it.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.620
This is what I'm trying to do as a developer but with different tools.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.410
I realized for the first time that developing for Android could be a real job

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.240
when I produced my first app, Scratch Card.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.990
 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.480
 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.860
 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.260
 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.339
 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.420
 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.670
Then some days after, I check on my AdMob Console and I saw my first five dollars.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.880
It was incredible. It was
like I'm going to be rich!

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.110
With the money I made, I could pay my studies

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.869
and this was a huge goal for me.

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.820
Then I created Smart Launcher, that was a new UI for Android devices.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.970
That has a very clean

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.229
home screen to focus your attention over the

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.820
main feature of your phone. And the other apps

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.400
are automatically organized in categories

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.220
The only platform that could fit for me would be Android because 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.960
Android is the only platform in which you can really do whatever you want.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.970
I can work from another city, I can work on a cruise ship

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.659
but I decided to stay here in Manfredonia because here

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:57.790
I have my friends

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.690
I have my family, I have my girlfriend. I can work from here I

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.299
just need a laptop and internet
connection.

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.130
When I was going to publish my brother Daniele said

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.720
it's going to be your biggest failure. It's funny because if you saw the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.739
number now

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.269
I think no one would say that. Now I have
more than

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.019
15 million downloads for the free version

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.540
and 200 thousand for the pro version.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.260
My app is downloaded all around the world. It's really popular

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.370
It's really popular in India, in America, and also in Japan.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.519
I think Smart Launcher is actually the product of Manfredoniamost exported in the world

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.569
 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.350
 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.230
Growing was something that was not expected.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.250
Now I work with other people, and this is very exciting because now I can think to other products.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.590
I think the future will be very exciting.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.590
Success for me is doing what you want with your life.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.360
For me it's living in my city with my parents

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.900
with my girlfriend, and being happy.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.890
And I can do that, by being a developer.
