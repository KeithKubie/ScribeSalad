So a few weeks ago I posted this photo with the caption,

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.140
"When you have five cats to feed."

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.320
And everyone went insane.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.200
[siren sounds]

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.860
So a few of you guys are aware, my cat Ghost went missing last October.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.660
And unfortunately, no, she has not come back.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.980
I have accumulated a lot of tips and tricks

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.340
over the last five months in trying to find her and get her back to my home

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.880
So I figured it would be great to make a video about that where all of that information is consolidated

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.900
just in case you're missing a fur baby yourself.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.400
Now, Ghost was a kitty who would wait by the front door and, like, any time it opened she would just dash out.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.260
So I have used a lot of these tips to bring her back again and again

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.560
But, unfortunately, when I left for Peru last October she just like never came back.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.980
That said, if you're in the area of your missing kitty

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.980
you can still use these to try to bring them home.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.980
One: First things first, put clean water and food right outside of your door.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.880
As well as a shelter box, especially if you live in an area that's very cold or rainy.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.104
And in that shelter box you'll want to put a dirty piece of laundry or their favorite blanket

00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:02.140
Because cats are very scent oriented, if they've lost their way

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.320
hopefully they'll pick up that scent and be able to find their way home.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.720
Two:  Walk the perimeter of your neighborhood with some dirty laundry.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.220
Because cats are so scent oriented this will help them find their way back home

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.320
If they have a favorite toy that makes a noise or a treat bag, shake that as well

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.539
When I used to do my perimeter walks

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.300
I would actually put up missing posters

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.820
just in case some of my neighbors saw her while she was roaming.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.680
Make sure to also alert places like Nextdoor, which is Facebook for your neighborhood,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.580
local shelters, vets, hospitals, and also your microchipping company.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.089
And if your cat is not microchipped,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.259
please, please, please do this as soon as possible when you find them.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.600
Often when a cat is caught and brought to a shelter or the pound,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.440
people will immediately scan them to see who they belong to.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.254
and if your cat isn't microchipped, that could be all the difference in finding him or her.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.600
And finally, don't lose hope.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.000
Some people have had their cat show up years after they went missing

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.675
Sometimes your cat is just off having an adventure

00:01:54.675 --> 00:01:56.510
and doesn't want to come home just yet.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.800
And if you've seen my cat by chance,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.900
please, please hit me up and let me know

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.260
because I miss her very much.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.220
Thank you so much to Simon's Cat for collaborating on today's video

And I know for cat ladies like myself and cat daddies like you out there

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.560
It is something that brightens my day.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.420
All right, I'm Anna Akana

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.860
Goodbye.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.540
(forever)
