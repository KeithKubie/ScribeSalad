00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.990
We last went to the moon in 1972, except for
that rover China sent two years ago… It's

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:12.210
still up there. (look up) Right now.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.359
moonpies
Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17 all landed

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:23.460
on our moon. Astronauts collected and returned
2,200 separate samples totalling 382 kilograms

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.939
(842 lbs). Three Soviet Luna missions also
returned about 300 grams (¾ lb) of lunar

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.430
material too. They get a participation award.
While it may sound like it, that's not a lot

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.400
of moon to study.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.690
That last Soviet was back in 1976. So, when
China landed on the moon in 2013, it should

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.260
have been pretty huge news! The moon had been
abandoned for almost 40 years. China's Chang'e

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.170
3 launched in 2013, making China the third
country to land a wheeled vehicle on the moon's

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.489
surface, and the first in the 21st century.
The Chang’E-3 craft has a nuclear-powered

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.039
lander and a small rover named Yutu, or "jade
rabbit." Yutu's complement is classified by

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.640
China, but we know it has cameras, lunar-penetrating
radar which can look 400 meters below the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.610
surface, and two spectrometers for analyzing
the lunar rocks and soil (called regolith).

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.229
I know what you're thinking, 'MERCIA DID IT
FIRST CHAANA. You know what, you're right.

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.600
We landed humans there first. And the U.S.S.R.
landed a rover too, but there's SO MUCH MORE

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.770
to learn about the Moon. For example, Apollo
only dug 3 meters into the lunar surface,

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.750
that's not a lot. But, in March of 2015, Chinese
researchers published a paper in the journal

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.721
Science announcing that Yutu’s lunar-penetrating
radar had found NINE subsurface layers! This

00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:43.619
suggests that geological activity had occurred
on the moon since the Imbrian period which

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.189
ended 3.2 billion years ago. Lunar geologists
believe "eruptions filled the [basin where

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.200
Yutu is sitting] at least five times." Scientists
didn't think the moon had been active at all

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.950
in that period, so now more research is needed.
For example, some scientists think the youngest

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.880
volcanic flows may be only a billion years
old, others think maybe 100 million, but,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.250
really, they have no idea, because they've
never gotten to test them up close!

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.700
Another study published in December 2015's
Nature Communication used data from Yutu's

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.050
instruments and announced the discovery of
a whole new type of moon rock! The basalt

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.360
rocks that Yutu is exploring with her spectrometers
are completely different from samples brought

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.400
back by the Apollo and Luna missions. Lunar
geologists think: 1. this means there was

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.590
explosive activity in the region. Which counters
other theories. 2. that we still know almost

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.900
nothing about the moon.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.400
As NASA put it, exploring the moon creates
opportunities for international cooperation

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.120
and economic expansion; plus it pushes the
boundaries of our civilization. Yutu is the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.180
latest in a long line of exploration of our
solar system, and though mechanical problems

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.790
rendered it immobile, and crippled, the Chinese
rover broke the record for the longest-operating

00:02:50.790 --> 00:03:12.629
mission on 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:22.389
the moon.
