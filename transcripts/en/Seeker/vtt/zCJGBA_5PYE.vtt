00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:15.989
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:17.939
Temperature is a measure of energy.

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.119
How fast the molecules in something like an
ice cube are moving.

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.699
But how does the brain read that information?

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.650
For scientists, it’s been a bit of mystery.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.820
But new research published in the journal
Nature sheds a little light.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.360
The research looked at fruit fly brains to
see how it responded to temperature.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.370
They identified three types of neurons that
reacted.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.880
Two sets were what the researchers called
“narrowly tuned”, they could detect either

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.320
hot OR cold.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.600
One set of neurons let us know very quickly
whether something was becoming hot or cold.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.350
Another set was a little slower, but traded
accuracy for speed.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.300
These neurons could report temperature better.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.920
But in a surprise to the researchers there
was a third set of neurons that was fast and

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.460
“broadly tuned”, it responded quickly
and could sense both hot and cold, possibly

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.880
as a ‘mayday’ kind of signal.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.490
So that’s an idea of what might be going
on in the brain.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.010
But how does the feeling get there?

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.140
Well in humans, we take in a lot of our information
through our somatosensory system.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.140
This is made up of things like nerve endings,
touch receptors and receptors for temperature

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.800
called Thermoreceptors which lie just under
our skin.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.420
It’s thought that the mammalian nervous
system has separate thermoreceptors in our

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.500
skin for either warmth or cold.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.640
There are far more cold receptors beneath
the skin than warm ones, and are more concentrated

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.531
in areas like the nose and ears and the signals
from cold receptors actually travel to the

00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:33.670
brain up to ten times faster than signals
from warm receptors which is why those spots

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.270
get so chilly so quickly.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.530
But some cold receptors respond when we touch
something really hot, like over 113 degrees.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.590
Which is why sometimes the hot water in your
show feels icy cold.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.510
This phenomenon, is called paradoxical cold.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.520
And scientists aren’t sure why, exactly.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.540
Weird, right?

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.670
Anyways, these thermoreceptors on our skin
send this information to our nerve cells in

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.870
our spine, and this is where things get interesting.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.500
The membranes surrounding these nerve cells
have proteins that open and close in response

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.810
to different temperatures.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.340
This allows charged particles to move from
cell to cell, sending information up into

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.380
our brains.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.509
Our body has dozens of these proteins, called
Ion channels, allowing us to experience a

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.219
wide range of temperatures.

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:15.129
These channels can sometimes respond to things
other than temperature, like food, pain or

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.129
acidity.

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:21.069
One of the channels called TRPV1, reacts to
hot temperatures—about 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.060
But it also responds to capsaicin, the thing
that makes chili peppers so spicy, which is

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.400
why our body tastes chili but senses heat.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.169
Another of these channels, TRPM8, is sensitive
to cold.

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:32.700
And guess what this channel also responds
to?

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.560
Yeah you guessed it menthol, which is the
thing that makes mint seem cool.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.219
Speaking of hot and cold, have you ever wondered
what your life would look like in thermal?

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:44.329
our very good friends over at buzzfeedblue
recently looked at some everyday situations

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.079
as scene through a thermal camera!

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.569
It was really weird and really beautiful.
