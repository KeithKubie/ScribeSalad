1
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,320
All right people,
this is it.

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,560
I feel like this is a lifetime coming.
Uh,

3
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,620
we are going to be deleting our
patrion page during this live stream.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,210
Uh, for those of you that
don't know, Patrion, uh,

5
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:34,480
has been the number one source of funding
for us since we went independent back

6
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:39,340
in June of 2016. That's when I started
my independent production company.

7
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,090
Uh, that's when we fully took the
reigns of this company in this show.

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,160
I have no boss.
I am my boss.

9
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:48,130
I guess I am the boss around
here for better or worse. Uh,

10
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,700
we've built a great little production
company. We've got full timers,

11
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:55,540
we've got part timers, we
pay for everyone's insurance
and dental and blah, blah,

12
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,520
blah.
We treat all of our employees great.

13
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,490
I think we've built a
really great show here. Uh,

14
00:01:00,491 --> 00:01:05,380
I think fan funding was the key to
making this thing truly successful. Uh,

15
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,980
the fact that I can make whatever decision
I think is right for the show and the

16
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:12,340
business, the fact that I've
been able to take sort of my,

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,380
my small government principles and my,
my refound let's say belief in,

18
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,050
in capitalism and business,
uh,

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,140
and apply it to the things that I'm
doing behind the scenes as well as the

20
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:25,960
issues that I'm talking about
on air in front of you guys.

21
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,040
The last couple years have
just been amazing. We've,

22
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,280
the show is just absolutely blown up.

23
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:34,510
We're about to cross a million subscribers
on youtube despite often people being

24
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,900
unsubscribed from the youtube channel.
Uh,

25
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,810
the audio podcast is basically bigger
than the youtube channel at this point.

26
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,720
I think the things that we've been talking
about over the last couple of years

27
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:47,650
have been incredibly relevant
and seemingly every day
now become more relevant.

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,431
Uh,
I mean,

29
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:53,380
even the fact that this is all going
down on patrion related to freedom of

30
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:53,920
speech,

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,900
and it was because of them kicking off
Carl Benjamin Sargon and for cod who's

32
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:01,720
been in this very studio that we built.

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,070
And I bought this house because of Patrion
or because of in large part because

34
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:09,130
of the donations you guys have been
making on Patrion over the last couple of

35
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,190
years. Um, it seems so fitting that
we're going to finally do this.

36
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:15,310
So I know there's a lot of eyeballs on
this and I know there's a lot of eyeballs

37
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:19,360
in the media on this. I know
their employees at patrion
watching this right now.

38
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:20,530
How are you guys?
Uh,

39
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,280
I know there's big shots at Google and
Facebook watching and the rest of it and

40
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:28,270
I think that, uh, look, Sam Harris
left patrion because of this. Uh,

41
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,450
Jordan is deleting Jordan Peterson is
deleting his patrion account today.

42
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,850
He may have done it already.
He's in Switzerland right now.

43
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:35,140
We spoke on the phone briefly.

44
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,140
We were going to possibly
a Skype him in and on this,

45
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:40,390
I don't think it's going to happen cause
it's like three in the morning there,

46
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:40,901
but who knows,

47
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:45,220
maybe some surprises will happen over
the course of the next two hours. Um,

48
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,450
but this seems like just the next obvious
step in everything that's been going

49
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:49,811
on here.

50
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:54,811
I just think that at some point us the
people have to push back against these

51
00:02:56,081 --> 00:03:01,030
tech companies. You can't keep
infringing on freedom of expression. Yes,

52
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,400
they can do whatever they
want as private companies.

53
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,800
And there's some issue whether these
platforms are now becoming, uh, the,

54
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,230
the true public space of the future.
And does that have,

55
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,620
what's the relationship between,
uh,

56
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,710
that entity as a platform that we can
all communicate on and the government,

57
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:20,110
we can discuss that until the,
the nth degree.

58
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,500
I am trying to apply the same principles
that I apply consistently at everything

59
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:27,500
else here. I didn't ask the government to
come in and demand but gone to for cod,

60
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:29,950
stay on Patrion or on
Twitter or anywhere else.

61
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:34,030
I didn't ask the government
to get involved in and stop
this person from getting

62
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:37,150
banned or that person from getting banned.
I think these Banning's or a problem,

63
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,780
you guys know my policy on gatekeeping.
I'd rather much wider gates,

64
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:41,770
generally speaking,

65
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:44,560
as long as people are following
the laws of the United States.

66
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:48,020
And we don't have hate speech laws and
people are allowed to say mean things and

67
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:49,390
it's scary sometimes,

68
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,790
but I would much rather have that than
have all sorts of voices who are a little

69
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,540
outside of mainstream be shut down.

70
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,360
Especially because in these days it's
not just the really bad voices that,

71
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,180
um,
that maybe shouldn't be ignored.

72
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:07,870
Perhaps it's that it's coming
for sort of everybody. Um,

73
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,780
so I'm going to discuss a
whole bunch of things here. Uh,

74
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:13,750
we are going to be deleting the
Patrion page live. So Aaron,

75
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:17,830
can you throw into the live shot
of the computer that is right here.

76
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,500
Uh,
right now,

77
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,560
despite for the last month mean emailing
all my patrons doing live streams,

78
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:28,570
tweeting the hell out of this thing,
posting it on Facebook,

79
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:31,120
posting it on Instagram,
and God knows what else I've been doing.

80
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,100
As you can see right now,

81
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,580
right now we've got almost 1800 patrons
that still remain in there for about

82
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:43,510
$10,000 a month. Now, I don't
think, all right, aren't you?

83
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,350
Come back to me for a second.

84
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,260
I don't think a normal person
running a business would say, oh,

85
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,470
can I take what was a,

86
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,510
when we started this thing about a month
ago when we started announcing we were

87
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:55,960
going to leave, uh, or at least when
the, when the Carl Benjamin thing popped,

88
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,880
I don't think a normal
businessmen is like, oh,

89
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,180
can I just get rid of 70% of my company's
revenue and we'll see what happens.

90
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,650
But I just felt like it was just enough
and I had faith that you guys were going

91
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:07,720
to come with me on this adventure.
Uh,

92
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,780
so I am thrilled to say that
we have done really nicely,

93
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:13,030
we haven't made up all the Patriot
on money, but we've done really,

94
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:17,950
really nicely@daverubin.com slash donate
so we are going to use this live stream

95
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:22,360
for one more round of fundraising to
really, uh, just blow that thing up.

96
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,360
So it's Dave ruben.com/donate if you
donate while I'm live right now for $5 and

97
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,670
above, uh, are going to
give you a live shout out.

98
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:35,290
And I've got a trusty iPad here and a team
of dedicated professionals in the, uh,

99
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:39,220
in the control room over there. If
you donate via paypal, via stripe,

100
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,280
whatever it is at Dave Rubin
dotcoms there's no way I'm
going to give you a live

101
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:46,480
shout out.
If you donate $25 or more per month,

102
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,820
you're gonna get the
Rubin report select shirt.

103
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,660
Now this is the select shirt that are
only our patrons had certain levels were

104
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:54,520
getting.
These will never be printed again.

105
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,400
We've got a couple boxes on the left
because they were printed patrion only

106
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,290
obviously we're never
going to print them again.

107
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,870
So these are the last
couple that we've got left.

108
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:04,520
I think we've got about
a hundred of them left.

109
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,340
Let's see if we can move some of these.
You will get one of these.

110
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:10,370
You're going to a, you make the
donation, then you send us your size.

111
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,990
We've got your email,
we'll take good carrier.

112
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,000
And if you donate 50 or more monthly,
I am going to sign a Ruben report,

113
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,660
official Mug that will never be printed
again either because it's the select

114
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:23,390
member mug.
I'm going to sign that for you right here,

115
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:26,570
live on air and we're going to send it
to you and you guys will ensure that the

116
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:29,750
show remains completely
independent. And uh, and as I said,

117
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,060
I've had a whole bunch
of offers from networks,

118
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,340
some that I would consider working with.

119
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,950
I've had all sorts of offers
to do more ads on the show.

120
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:40,430
I've had every which way that you
can think of funding something.

121
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:43,640
I've had offers,
we've had other people offer us big money.

122
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,200
I like doing it this way. I
think it's great. I'm psyched.
I'm happy. I'm content.

123
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,580
I want to keep growing.

124
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,970
There's so many good things happening
over the course of the next year. Uh,

125
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:56,420
in terms of we're continuing the tour
with Jordan Peterson in May and June.

126
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:59,660
We're going to hit all sorts of
countries in Europe and do that again in

127
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:03,200
February for a couple of weeks. I'll be
in Australia. We're bouncing all over the,

128
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,110
all over the country.
Uh,

129
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,230
in April we're considering I have an
offer to do a full month of Reuben reports

130
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:10,880
on the road all over the United States.

131
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:13,940
I have to make sure that I actually can
do it because the other thing is that

132
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:14,990
I'm writing a book right now,

133
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:19,970
which I've been writing forever and my
due date to have the book done is uh,

134
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:21,140
August 1st.
So I got a,

135
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,020
I got a lot going on and I'm also
supposed to do a show and I've been doing

136
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:28,790
standup again and all that good stuff.
Um, so, uh, there's a lot happening here,

137
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,040
but I want to keep this momentum going.
Also,

138
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:35,900
the key to this whole thing is that
Jordan and I also are working on a new

139
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:36,734
platform.

140
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,190
So there's a limit to the amount that
I can talk about this specifically for

141
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,390
legal reasons and,

142
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,960
and I can't give away all the secrets
and the keys to the kingdom just yet.

143
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,750
We're working on another platform.
There are huge,

144
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:52,400
huge questions related to how do we want
this platform to function and should

145
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:55,370
this be all, you know, should
it be monetized through Crypto,

146
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:59,990
should we be doing torrent video streaming
and how do we fully protect it so

147
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:02,990
that not so that we can't, we don't
have to worry about payment processors,

148
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:06,530
we don't have to worry about a tech
companies taking us down and all of those

149
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:10,610
things. As crazy as that is, right? All
I'm doing here is exercising free speech.

150
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:15,070
I like interviewing people and now and
enjoy having good conversation and all

151
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,000
that stuff, but we do have to
think about all these things.

152
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:20,500
So Jordan and I are working on that.
There is a company formed with,

153
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,850
so there's all sorts of legal things
that have to be dealt with in the rest of

154
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:25,430
that. We are working on that. This,

155
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:28,880
what I'm doing today is just
step one of all of that.

156
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:33,881
So step one for me was let's
get off patrion and let's
move everybody so that we

157
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,460
can fund everybody on our site. Whatever
we do after this. By the way, if you're,

158
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:39,180
if you're going to jump over today,

159
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:43,490
ruben.com/donate and you do the monthly
credit card thing over there and paypal,

160
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,860
we're gonna be able to fold that into the
new thing because we don't want people

161
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:48,410
to have to sign up for a zillion things
and cancel a zillion things and all that.

162
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,160
Because as you can see by the 2000 people
that haven't cancelled patrion and yet

163
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:53,720
people forget to do things right.

164
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,060
So it's like I could just not delete
patrion right now and just keep cashing in

165
00:08:57,061 --> 00:09:00,840
on these people, but I'm
obviously not gonna do that.
Um, so okay, here we go. Oh,

166
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:04,230
by the way. So I'm going to be answering
questions so you can answer questions.

167
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,810
You can ask questions in super chat. I'm
happy to take some questions there. Uh,

168
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,830
I'm obviously going to be given some
prime real estate right now to people that

169
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:15,270
are the current patrons who are asking
questions and I just want to say beyond

170
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:19,920
anything else. And then I'll tell you
some other fun stuff. I am beyond, beyond,

171
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:22,860
beyond humbled and honored.
And

172
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,410
I,
uh,

173
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,170
I'm a better person because of
this whole adventure. It is.

174
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,530
I can't describe to you what it is like
to have people all over the world just

175
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:37,490
believe in you doing something.
And I'm just doing what I think is right.

176
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,280
That really is it.
I'm some guy doing what I think is right.

177
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,550
It's not any more magical than that.
And for whatever reason,

178
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:46,760
we live in a weird time,
especially in the west,

179
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:48,520
or especially let's say in
the United States where we,

180
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,640
we are in the freest country,
in the history of the world right now.

181
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,450
This evil patriarchy that we
live in is the freest place ever.

182
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,430
And people are afraid
to say what they think.

183
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:02,750
They're afraid to stand up and fight for
what they believe in and all this stuff.

184
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:06,320
And I just, I don't know what's wrong
with me, but I just can't not do it. So,

185
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:09,300
so here I am,
I'm just drawn a line in the sand and I'm,

186
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:12,470
I'm doing what I think is right and I'm,
and I'm reaping the rewards for it.

187
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,400
And I'm incredibly humbled by that. So
I thank you guys. Truly. So again, okay,

188
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:20,990
just one more, uh, one more
reset on the radio here. Uh,

189
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,820
if you, if you donate $5 and
above, uh, during this live stream,

190
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:28,820
I'm going to give you a live shout
out 25 bucks or above monthly.

191
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:32,690
You're getting the Rubin report shirt
that will never be printed again. People,

192
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,290
the select members shirt that'll
never be printed again. $50 or above.

193
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,240
You're going to get the shirt
and you're going to get the mug.

194
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,050
And I'm going to sign the Mug for you
right here. I've got a trustee sharpie.

195
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,020
Okay. And now, just to sweeten the deal,

196
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,620
I sent out one of the Rubin report team
members to pick up an unopened bottle of

197
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,360
patroned. Okay. We just
pick this thing up.

198
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:59,350
I am opening it for the first time and
I don't know exactly what we're going to

199
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:02,160
do with this. When we
originally launched on, uh,

200
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,870
on Patrion back in 2016,

201
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,350
we were trying to figure
out fun ways to raise funds.

202
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,530
And one of the things I did was I think
for every thousand bucks we raised

203
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:15,520
during a live stream, I did a
shot. And if I'm not mistaken,

204
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:18,910
within like an hour and a half, I had
done like five shots. I was wasted.

205
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,460
I think I ended up doing something
like seven shots. It was not pretty,

206
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:22,294
it was not good.

207
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,570
And I'm older now and I'm wiser and
I don't think I can do that level,

208
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,680
but I've got an unopened bottle of patrol
and as you can see here are and go to

209
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:33,880
the other screen so I can show them this
thing is unaltered, untouched, okay.

210
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,810
And uh, and I've got a trustee shot
glass, this shot glass, by the way,

211
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,820
you can't see anything on it right now.
Unfortunately.

212
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,180
I got this at universal studios.
It used to have a decepticon logo on it,

213
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:45,820
which I really loved and I don't know
what happened to the decepticon let it go.

214
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,920
But I will do a shot in
honor of sound waves.

215
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:51,580
So I don't know exactly what
I'm going to make the, the, uh,

216
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,130
the marks for when going to do
shots. But impress me, you know,

217
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,050
do throw out something good
on just on superchat we are,

218
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,150
we're trying to raise some funds here
and then we're going to delete this thing

219
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,890
at the end. And I hear, I
haven't, I'm going to have some
chili for dinner, so. Okay.

220
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,400
So let me ask some questions or a couple
shout outs. Quick to Devin, Andrew, Eric,

221
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:13,840
Jeff and Travis. Thank
you guys. Uh, okay. Uh,

222
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:16,840
on superchat go. Reuben, go.
I'll do it. All right. Thank you.

223
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:19,630
Good luck Dave and team wishing you
the best day of here's to the future.

224
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,850
We're here to support you.
A CBD American Shaman of San Antonio.

225
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,190
I do, you know, every now
and again I'll do a little,

226
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,170
a little if I got like
an ache or something.

227
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,590
I think I mentioned this the other day.
Take a little CBD cream and a,

228
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:36,790
I do like the CBD. Dave, thanks for
all the great videos. I'm a size large.

229
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,790
Um, I'll debate tomorrow
about the government shut.

230
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,920
I'm in a debate tomorrow about the
government shutdown. Wish me luck.

231
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:46,750
Good luck to Ya. Um, let's
see, uh, for free speech.

232
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:51,130
What is your opinion on the daily
wire and do you wish to join? Um,

233
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,500
well first off, I think the
daily wire is doing great stuff.

234
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,080
I obviously have some disagreements
with the Conservatives on a couple of

235
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:58,500
different things. Uh, I have
some disagreements with band.

236
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,740
I've discussed those disagreements right
here related to to some gay issues and

237
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,530
to abortion and to death penalty
and a bunch of other things.

238
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,700
But I think Ben is a decent guy and
I think despite our differences,

239
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:11,290
we want to live in the
same country together.

240
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:15,040
We've had a good time on stage together
last month at one of the Jordan Peterson

241
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,580
events here in la, I brought Ben out
on stage. The crowd went bananas.

242
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:20,590
He brought me, you know, there
we have this gay cake debate.

243
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,340
So he brought me a little
cupcake. Everyone went crazy
and it was just wonderful.

244
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:27,250
Thousands of people screaming
and it's like, you know,

245
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:30,830
then I look on Twitter and it's like the
usual is the tolerant, Progressive Joe.

246
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,320
Look at the homophobic gay
guy on spirits together.

247
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,830
It's like grow up you children. What
planets do you want to live on? Um, okay,

248
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:43,150
so, uh, go Reuben, go. We
did that one. Uh, hey Dave,

249
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:46,060
I just want to say thank you for standing
on principle, no matter the cost.

250
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:49,480
You've inspired my own channel from the
start and I'm grateful. That's awesome.

251
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,060
I want a zillion people to do
this. I don't need to, you know,

252
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,800
I'm doing interviews,
a lot of people do interviews,

253
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:56,680
but it's like more and more and more.
Let's get a little braver here.

254
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:58,420
Let's keep telling people what we think.

255
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,260
We got a lot of bad people right now
that are willing to shout everybody down

256
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:05,050
and d platform everybody and,
and scream,

257
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,450
you're racist and you're a bigot
and all this other nonsense.

258
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:08,830
They're very brave right now.

259
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:11,560
And I see a lot of good
people that are not brave and,

260
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:15,820
and that's part of the problem at the
moment. And uh, we were going to fix that.

261
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,590
Uh, so reminder, we're just raising some
funds right now here. You know what if a,

262
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,690
I'll do a shot for eh, at the net
when we hit 500 bucks on super chat.

263
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,080
I'll do a shot. How about something
like that or a, you know, let's get,

264
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:32,290
we really want to get people over to
[inaudible] dot com slash donate though

265
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:32,891
because we're trying to,

266
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:36,160
we just want to make sure we have a good
monthly budget so we can grow the show.

267
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:38,920
We can continue to do the things
that we're doing and all that.

268
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:42,580
So the more of you that jump
over there, the better. Um, guys,

269
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,130
if we're getting shout outs and mugs,
I'm not seeing it on here,

270
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:48,550
so maybe we're not live on here. I'm
not sure if anything's not being edited.

271
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,980
So let, so let me know
about that guys. Um,

272
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,280
on Patrion I'm behind free speech end you,
Dave and Jordan,

273
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:59,270
thank you for all your hard work on
behalf of free people everywhere on my way

274
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:02,330
over to Dave's new site to donate
there in place of Patrion much love and

275
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:06,890
success to you both in 2019. Thank you
very much. Uh, another one on page on out,

276
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:09,110
on Patrion on as a direct owner.
Thanks a lot.

277
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,410
You know, the other part
of this is, um, you know,

278
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:15,930
nobody from Patriot has reached out to me.
Uh,

279
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,770
Jack Conti who sat in that chair and
said that you wouldn't get kicked off

280
00:15:19,771 --> 00:15:21,300
Patrion for speech.

281
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:25,020
You would only get kicked off for
manifest the observable behavior,

282
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,790
which is a term that I think he made up,

283
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:30,060
which has the acronym mob mob
manifest observable behaviors.

284
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:32,550
So only a mob could kick you off
cause you can't make shit up.

285
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:34,830
I mean that's completely bananas.
Um,

286
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,640
I just realized that I just don't
trust them. I, and it's like, look,

287
00:15:38,641 --> 00:15:41,430
do I trust Google? Do I trust youtube
to, do we trust any of these things?

288
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,241
Not really.

289
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:46,050
But I think that the experiment of
Patrion was sort of small enough that I

290
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:49,250
wanted to make a move on this. And as I've
said in some of the other livestreams,

291
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,070
look,

292
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,750
I have friends and people that I have
nothing but total respect for like Bret

293
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,900
Weinstein and column Moriarty who
are staying on Patrion right now.

294
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,320
And maybe they'll be able to fight on
the inside and get them to change their

295
00:16:01,321 --> 00:16:02,154
terms of service.

296
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,280
Even though they didn't even follow
their own terms of service because in the

297
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,110
Patriot, in terms of service, they said,

298
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,800
these are the things you're not
allowed to say on our platform. Uh,

299
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,280
Carl Benjamin did not say the n
word on their platform. He said it,

300
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,020
he didn't even say it on
his own youtube channel.

301
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,040
He said it on someone else's
youtube channel 10 months ago. Um,

302
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,190
and he didn't even use the n word
as a racially pejorative term.

303
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,740
He used it because he
was using the language,

304
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,730
perhaps slightly sloppily of the alt
right against them. That's the point.

305
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:32,250
This guy debates all right people,
he is not a racist.

306
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,770
And I also think it's
sort of fitting that, um,

307
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,530
that this all sort of boils down to to
Carl. Not to make it too much about him,

308
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,630
but when I was having my wake up when I
was a full on lefty and I was on TYT and

309
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:48,630
I don't know, I guess I had a
lobectomy, you're saying, um,

310
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,430
when I was part of that thing,

311
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,640
when I started waking up to what was
going on related to free speech and the

312
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:58,020
authoritarianism that had
permeated throughout the
left and, and this, this, uh,

313
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,000
this really awful social justice monster
that I think now everybody obviously

314
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,970
sees. And I guess I happened to be one
of the first people that were seeing it.

315
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,430
When, when I started talking
about everybody said,

316
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:11,450
you got to talk to Carl Benjamin, you
gotta talk to this Guy Sargon of Akkad.

317
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,030
So it seems sort of fitting that the first
guy that I talked to online about all

318
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:18,240
this was the one who got booted.
That's now causing me to leave this.

319
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:19,590
And we're just taking control of our desks

320
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:24,110
any and all that good stuff. Shout outs
to Kyle, to Joshua, to Nolan, to Noah,

321
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,130
and to call. And thank you. Uh,

322
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:30,290
one small step for intellectual is one
giant leap for the intellectual dark web.

323
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,420
Hashtag shots of freedom,
uh,

324
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:35,510
watching you at Jordan at the Tabernacle
here in Atlanta. You guys were awesome.

325
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:36,840
Keep it up. Love you buddy. That

326
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,950
was actually one of my favorite shows,
uh,

327
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,840
because it was Jordan's birthday and uh,
the crowd is just fantastic.

328
00:17:42,841 --> 00:17:47,070
People spontaneously sung happy birthday
to him. We brought him out, you know,

329
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:50,010
he won't eat cake. Um,
so we brought him out

330
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,410
a raw steak with the, with
the candle in it. It was,

331
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,110
it was just a blast though and the crowd
was just great and we had to just a

332
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:58,080
great city, a way to stand up
for your principles. Thank you.

333
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,820
Thanks for standing up for liberty.
Dave.

334
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:02,620
Look forward to seeing you
and Jordan in New Zealand. Um,

335
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,930
I am not going to be in New Zealand.
I can't do the New Zealand leg.

336
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:10,530
I'm going to leave Australia a little
bit early. I got one week of the year.

337
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:14,280
My family, everybody, folks, brother,
sister, nieces, nephews, everybody.

338
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:17,400
We all get together for one
week in an undisclosed location.

339
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,040
And that's the one week we do it.
And,

340
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,060
and for all the goodness
that's going on and at,

341
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:22,380
for as much as I would love to be in,

342
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:25,830
in New Zealand and eat some of
that good New Zealand lamb, uh,

343
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,560
I'm not going to be, I'm not going to
be there for that. I'm sorry about that.

344
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:31,530
But I, I promise I will get back there
at some point. Trust me, it sucks.

345
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,660
It's one of the places
that I haven't been,

346
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:35,970
that I would love to get to and
I will get there at some point.

347
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:39,570
I promise you that.
Shout out to Patrick and a reminder guys,

348
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,780
you can get shirts 25 bucks monthly.
Uh,

349
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:44,610
you're getting a shirt
or Ruben report shirt.

350
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,170
It is a select member shirt by the way,
that we'll never be printed again.

351
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,730
50 bucks. I'm signing mugs. People don't
make me leave these mugs in this room.

352
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:56,880
I've got to get rid of, I got to move
product. You know what I'm saying? Uh,

353
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,660
let's see.

354
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,200
Why have you not had Michael mcwhorter
mcwhorter or Glenn Lowry on the show?

355
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:04,440
I don't know why it's happening. I think
we'd been in touch with Lowery at least.

356
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,340
Um, let me, let me look into that.
Thanks for standing up for free speech.

357
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:11,680
Good luck Dave. Okay, so here
we go. I am going to, uh,

358
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:16,110
first I'm going to open up the patrol. So
make me an offer I can't refuse. I mean,

359
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:16,651
that's what I'm saying.

360
00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:20,610
People go over to Dave rubin.com/and
it make me an offer I can't refuse.

361
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:25,470
I'll do a shot at patroned in
honor of leaving Patrion Foria. Uh,

362
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,870
by the way, I'm having a
crazy day over here, uh,

363
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,120
not only just with the energy
around this thing. Um, but I, uh,

364
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:36,870
I've shot three shows already today, which
were, which were really something. Um,

365
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,460
I don't even want to give everything away,

366
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,210
so we've got a great show tomorrow that
I taped the first thing this morning. Uh,

367
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:44,280
I'll leave it up to,
to mystery at the moment,

368
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:48,540
but I'd really take three great
shows today. Um, and uh, all right,

369
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:52,680
so I am opening this bad boy.
It is now open.

370
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,200
There we go. Smells like Tequila.
Oh Man, I don't have any,

371
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,310
I don't have any lime or salt or anything.
We'll figure that out. Uh, hey Dave,

372
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:04,740
this is a very brave move on your part.
Kudos.

373
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,620
Have you heard about the SJW nonsense?
I don't remember.

374
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,110
I don't even care about those guys. Does
it really just honestly, doesn't matter.

375
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,860
Uh, Viva La free speech. Good luck
Dave. Fuck you patriot and all right,

376
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:21,720
I'm reading these live, uh,
take a shot for me. Keep up
the amazing work. Good luck,

377
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,250
Dave.
Thanks for standing up to free speech.

378
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:27,420
Shout out to Carlos and to John
and to Michael. All right. Um,

379
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,620
okay. So here's what we're going to
do. I will pour a first shot, uh,

380
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,110
just to get this thing going here.

381
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,320
This is what the Internet
is really about people.

382
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,980
It's about people getting
drunk on Youtube, apparently.

383
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:42,060
I guess that's a big thing,
right?

384
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:44,080
Don't people get drunk and
cook or their estimates?

385
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:48,070
How can people get drunk and do a
little fundraising? Um, okay, let's see.

386
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:48,840
Um,

387
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,480
so we're going to do eat patrion I
don't know how long we're gonna do this.

388
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:55,410
I think we're gonna probably go
till about seven o'clock Pacific,

389
00:20:55,411 --> 00:20:58,290
probably about two hours.
I'm just shooting the shit
with you guys. I'm happy to,

390
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,590
to, to answer any questions
and just talk whatever.

391
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,500
Um, and uh, shout out to
Nathan, shout out to Kendra,

392
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:10,790
shout out to Michael. Thank
you guys. Um, and yeah,

393
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,811
and then after that.

394
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:15,260
So let me just plot out a little bit
of sort of the way I see the future.

395
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,440
So look, we're, we're going to move
everybody to my website were read.

396
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,670
My website's actually pretty cool.

397
00:21:19,671 --> 00:21:21,950
If you haven't been to Dave ruben.com
even if you don't want to donate,

398
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:23,810
I think we've done a nice job over there.
Uh,

399
00:21:23,811 --> 00:21:27,830
you can see upcoming events that I have
and, and you know, the rest of it, um,

400
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,870
we are completely redoing
my website though,

401
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,640
when we're going to make it
much more of a destination.

402
00:21:31,641 --> 00:21:35,510
So we're going to be hosting our own
videos. They're making sure that, uh,

403
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:37,090
that nothing can be taken down.
We're,

404
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:40,070
we're looking at all the pressure points
online of how you would take something

405
00:21:40,071 --> 00:21:41,960
down.
How would you demonetize something?

406
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:43,670
How would you stop somebody
from posting video?

407
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,380
We're taking care of all of those things.

408
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:49,610
These are all also obviously within the
discussions that I'm having with Jordan

409
00:21:49,611 --> 00:21:53,270
about, uh, the upcoming platform.
There's also a series of other things.

410
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:55,790
I don't want to make this seem like
this is only Jordan and I are working on

411
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,800
this.
Many of the players that you know,

412
00:21:57,801 --> 00:22:01,070
whose names I need not mention at the
moment are working on all sorts of

413
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:03,830
different solutions to
this problem and who knows,

414
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,280
who knows what will be the right
solution to these problems.

415
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,310
But I'm also very enthused that I,
I've mentioned this before,

416
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,180
I'm getting a ton of,
um,

417
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,520
people from big tech companies,

418
00:22:16,521 --> 00:22:19,790
from Google and Facebook and a whole bunch
of others that are reaching out to me

419
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:23,000
that are working at these companies
that are going on at the same, right?

420
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,280
What's going on here and we've
got to fight this monster. So I'm,

421
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:28,670
I'm very enthused about
that and we'll see if we can

422
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,750
grab some of these guys.
Um, all right guys.

423
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:34,810
I don't think that the mugs line at
the Mug tee shirt line I don't think is

424
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,450
loading right now.
Shout outs to William and to Jackson.

425
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,790
When are you coming to New England,

426
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:43,160
Dave? Um, I don't know that
we have any new England plans
at the moment. I will be,

427
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,570
I have a couple of Cali things coming up,

428
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:49,130
so I'm going to be in San Jose
and San Diego and Riverside,

429
00:22:49,131 --> 00:22:53,510
California next week with Jordan Peterson.
And then uh,

430
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,660
I will be,
uh,

431
00:22:54,661 --> 00:22:58,620
at the Irvine Improv in Orange
County on January 30th doing standup.

432
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,120
I do about an hour of standup. I bring
one of the ITW guys on stage. It's a,

433
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,450
it's an absolute blast. I
was in Ontario, California,

434
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:08,000
which I didn't realize was the place
and we had a lot of people in Ontario,

435
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:11,930
Canada, because both are ca that I think
showed up to the Improv over there,

436
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:15,240
but we had just a freaking, I
just crushed it for an hour. It's,

437
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,530
it's stand up like you've never seen
before. I'm barely telling jokes.

438
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:20,600
I go up there. I have a good
time. It's politically incorrect.

439
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:24,140
I get everybody involved. We do Q and.
A. I mess around with the crowd. It's,

440
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:26,660
it's fun. It's fun. Um,
so I hope you guys like

441
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,580
come out to that. Um, okay. Um,
let's see. Speaking of drinking,

442
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:35,480
will you have Michael Malice on the show
again, or when his new book comes out?

443
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,340
Is He an alcoholic or something?
I don't see the connection to drinking,

444
00:23:38,341 --> 00:23:42,360
but I'd love to have Michael Analysis on.
Again, Michael is a, is a brilliant guy.

445
00:23:42,361 --> 00:23:43,920
He's a really brilliant political thinker.

446
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:45,800
If you haven't seen my interview
with you should check it out.

447
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,810
I consider him the Willy Wonka of
politics. He's kind of Willy Wonka Ish.

448
00:23:49,811 --> 00:23:52,980
Watched the interview, you'll see it.
It's also how he dresses. Uh, but he's,

449
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,570
he's a great political thinker. He's
more on sort of the AMCAP side of things.

450
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,270
Sort of like an extreme
libertarian view of freedom,

451
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,670
which I certainly love
exploring those ideas.

452
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,540
I think he's just got good energy and he's
good. Uh, Patrick, I'm signing your mug.

453
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:09,430
I guess the Mug thing just kicked in. All
right, Patrick, I'm signing a Mug for Ya.

454
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:14,540
Welcome on board. We've got about 50
mugs left. We're moving mugs people.

455
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:17,840
Patrick, you're getting the
first one. There you go, my
friend. Thank you very much.

456
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,020
Let's see. Uh, thank you, Mr Ruben.

457
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:24,110
I appreciate all your hard work and
you've truly opened my eyes to different

458
00:24:24,111 --> 00:24:27,740
points and views. Try to get Dr.
Peterson to come down to Louisiana.

459
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,140
I don't think we did a show in Louisiana.

460
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:34,220
I'm pretty sure that after we do these
three in California that that'll be it

461
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:37,280
for this year. Jordan's writing a
new book and I'm writing a book.

462
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,360
Maybe Jordan will be opening for me on my
book tour. We shall see about that. Uh,

463
00:24:41,361 --> 00:24:43,960
so there will be more tours obviously
in the United States. We're,

464
00:24:43,961 --> 00:24:45,810
we're trying to think about some other,
uh,

465
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,680
touring ideas with some of the ITW crew.
As I mentioned,

466
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,620
I have this offer on the
table for all of April, uh,

467
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:54,650
all over the United States to take the
Rubin Report on the road and do pretty

468
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:59,150
big theaters like thousand thousand
to like 1500 seats per, uh,

469
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,770
per venue. So we're,
we're thinking about it.

470
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:04,250
I just got to figure out if I have
enough time to write. Um, so we're gonna,

471
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,460
we're gonna work on that, uh,
shout outs to Torbin and to Mike.

472
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:09,680
Welcome on board guys.
Thank you Dave.

473
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:11,870
Please try to get Dan
Crenshaw on your show.

474
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:13,700
He would be an interesting
guest in a rising star.

475
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:17,710
I completely agree and I'm happy to report
because we dropped live news on live

476
00:25:17,711 --> 00:25:20,230
streams, uh, that I've
been in touch with Dan. Uh,

477
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:24,410
he is the new congressmen down in Texas.
Um, he is going to come on the show.

478
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:26,900
He's a fan of the show. He,
uh, he's happy to do it.

479
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:30,470
We're just trying to arrange it
during a trip that he has to, uh, la.

480
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,190
And by the way, since I will have a
freshman, like a freshman congressman,

481
00:25:34,191 --> 00:25:35,150
like Dan Crunch on the show,

482
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:39,590
I will gladly have Alexandria Cortez or,
uh,

483
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,550
Omar Ilan or align Omar or whatever her
name is or a to lead or any of these

484
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:47,840
people that want to come in. I will
gladly talk to any of them. Uh, Dan is,

485
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:51,680
Dan is already a offered to come on,
so that'll be great. Uh, how about, uh,

486
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:55,040
Ruben report APP? We're in
discussions on many fronts. Uh,

487
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:58,820
I have a proposal sitting in my email
from a company that does pretty slick apps

488
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:02,330
and we're trying to, we're basically
just trying to streamline all of this.

489
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:07,331
I really think that the Internet is
changing right in front of us right now.

490
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:08,324
Like we've had,

491
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,160
I think we had like the first 10 years
of social media that were sort of the

492
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,800
glory years where everybody was meeting
everybody and people liked being on

493
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:19,640
Facebook and liked connecting with
people on Twitter and you could meet, um,

494
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:23,420
heroes of yours or athletes that you like
or authors and people were connecting

495
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:25,340
and it was all great.
Then in the last couple years,

496
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:28,700
the Internet started eating itself in
a way and the trolls took over and the

497
00:26:28,701 --> 00:26:31,280
hate and all that stuff. Now
again, I say this meeting,

498
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:35,150
despite the fact that I would say 90%
despite I have an extremely dedicated

499
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:38,330
group of loser trolls that are always
following me and I just mute them.

500
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:41,150
Who Cares? Um, but, uh,

501
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:45,630
90% of what I see is positive.
So I think most of it's still positive.

502
00:26:45,631 --> 00:26:49,080
But I think the, generally it's just
something to do with the human condition.

503
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:51,690
People focus on the negative more,
they focus on the positive.

504
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:55,680
So I think people think it's all horrible
even though it really isn't that bad.

505
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:58,170
But that's the other reason why being
on the tour has been so great because I

506
00:26:58,171 --> 00:27:02,220
get to see actual people in real life
and they're often quite pleasant, uh,

507
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:07,170
as opposed to how they are online.
A shout out to Shamari and two mark.

508
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:11,220
Thank you guys. A super chat. I'm with
your brother. All right. Right on.

509
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:14,910
And keep up the great fight for free
speech. I have nothing better to do.

510
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,760
I mean really I was thinking
about it the other day,

511
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:21,090
like it was kind of big thing. Like some
of this can be a little a bit annoying.

512
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:23,100
Like I am sort of spread
thin in a certain way.

513
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:26,040
Like I'm trying to do my interview show,
I'm trying to do stand up,

514
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:30,150
I got a business to run and like I'm on
tour a whole bunch of other things and

515
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:33,900
now I'm sort of like half leading
a tech company. Uh, you know,

516
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:38,400
my weekends of just kind of
disappeared. Um, and, but it's like,

517
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,800
I don't know what else do I better
do? And it's, and it's more,

518
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:44,100
it's more fun to be spread thin
then when you're just like,

519
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,970
you have nothing to do. So life's
an adventure. I guess you guys are,

520
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,590
you guys are seeing my adventure. Um, all
right. Here's what we're gonna do. Uh,

521
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,000
if we got 100 bucks on a, on super chat,
the next hundred bucks on super chat,

522
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,030
I will take a, a shot of
Petrolia. There's a big shot too.

523
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:03,450
I should not have poured that,
that much of it in there. That was,

524
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,080
that was a mistake. Um, you're the
man. Ruben. Thank you very much.

525
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,150
I appreciate that. What the
hell are we doing here, people?

526
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:12,720
I am deleting Patrion all alive today.
Aaron,

527
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:15,540
let's go to the, uh, the video there.

528
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:19,350
So I'm gonna I just learned that you can
refresh your page on the computer there

529
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,520
if you press command are, that's very
fancy. So I'm refreshing the page.

530
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:24,540
I think I'm refreshing.

531
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:29,250
Did I refresh the page
command are maybe all right.

532
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:32,310
I'm going to refresh the old way,
the way I know how old school.

533
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:37,290
I'm refreshing the page. How are
we doing? Did we drop it all?

534
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,440
So we still have 1,777
people donating 9,000,

535
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:47,670
$911. I people please
cancel. Stop paying me there.

536
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:51,360
What are you doing? I don't know
what else to tell you guys. Please.

537
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:54,060
You've got to stop doing
it. You're, you're a,

538
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:58,170
I appreciate the sticktuitiveness
and the dedication, but I, you know,

539
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:01,680
join me over at the website,
Dave Rubin dotcom slash donate or don't,

540
00:29:01,681 --> 00:29:04,800
but let's get you off paid round. Let's
save a couple bucks then for yourself.

541
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,940
Okay. What else is going on here? Uh, um,

542
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,620
okay. This iPad is going a
little slow right now. Um, okay.

543
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,740
Next hundred bucks on super
chat. I'm taking the shot. Um,

544
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,920
so what else is happening at
the moment? Um, you know what?

545
00:29:19,921 --> 00:29:23,840
I'm going to tell you who we,
uh, who we interviewed today,
uh, because it was real,

546
00:29:23,841 --> 00:29:24,840
it was really,
really,

547
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:28,410
really interesting day that I think is
sort of sums up so much of what's going

548
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:31,110
on here. And I think why you
guys, why you guys dig this thing.

549
00:29:31,111 --> 00:29:33,720
So we started the day
with Dr. Everett Piper,

550
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:36,900
who is the president of
Oklahoma Wesleyan University,

551
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,800
which is a small college about
1500 students. He is a staunch,

552
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:44,800
staunch defender of intellectual freedom
and he's written several books on it

553
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:48,730
and why, why were, were coddling these
young people and why it's terrible. Uh,

554
00:29:48,731 --> 00:29:51,480
he comes from a, a, it's
a Christian university,

555
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,990
comes from a Christian perspective.

556
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,390
And we talked a lot about
ethics and we talked about, uh,

557
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,670
living with honor and where to rights
come from and a lot of my wheelhouse

558
00:29:59,750 --> 00:29:59,991
things.

559
00:29:59,991 --> 00:30:02,620
What with a little bit of a religious
perspective that we've done a little bit

560
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:05,530
before. W fascinating guy. Like I just,

561
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,490
one of the things that I like most is when
I get a guest who really you can tell,

562
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,310
really knows their ideas in and out,
uh,

563
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,310
and can tackle them in all
sorts of different ways. Uh,

564
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:18,270
I just loved that and he was
truly a master of his idea.

565
00:30:18,271 --> 00:30:22,370
So we're posting in that one tomorrow.
We're doing it in one piece. Uh, then, uh,

566
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:27,330
we took about a half hour break,
had lunch, had a salad and a,

567
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:30,760
then I interviewed Heather McDonald
from the Manhattan Institute.

568
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:33,460
And I'm sure most of you know
Heather McDonald. Uh, she's,

569
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,750
she's a really fascinating public
figure who's taken some pretty,

570
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:41,950
um, politically incorrect positions
on welfare, on black lives matter,

571
00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:43,420
on the me too movement.
Uh,

572
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,810
she writes extensively about sort of
third wave feminism and how it's gone

573
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,700
haywire and the assault on men,

574
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:50,890
which is obviously becoming more
and more relevant to you guys.

575
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:55,380
See this idiotic Gillette Promo
that they put up yesterday. Um,

576
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,070
it's just embarrassing like this,

577
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,850
this need for these companies
to embrace social justice,

578
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,620
which is such a Brott. It's intellectual
rot and these companies just go for it.

579
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,880
Hook, line and sinker. Uh, it's
just pathetic and awful. Um,

580
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:13,330
let's see. So, uh, so I had Heather
on, it was great discussion.

581
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,660
Unfortunately had to cut, cut it kind
of quick cause she was in a rush. Uh,

582
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:18,190
so we only did about 50 minutes or so.

583
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:22,510
And then my third one was
really interesting conversation
with the guide by the

584
00:31:22,511 --> 00:31:27,511
name of Tall Keenan and he is an American
Israeli who's written sort of a book

585
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:33,670
about sort of what he thinks the history
of the Jews or the future of the Jews

586
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:36,460
is going to be. Which I thought was sort
of interesting because we've done a lot,

587
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,650
um,
I've done more on,

588
00:31:38,651 --> 00:31:42,040
especially on theology and religion
related to people when it's come to

589
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,840
Christianity who haven't
done that much on Judaism,

590
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:46,540
although I've had rabbi Wolpe
on a couple of times. Um,

591
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:48,160
so it was really just an
really interesting day.

592
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,010
And what was particularly
interesting about it was, um,

593
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,910
that my day started talking to a guy who,

594
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,990
who talks about things from
a Christian perspective. Um,

595
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,650
Heather considers herself
a secular conservative,

596
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,050
which we talked about because
people don't think that that exists.

597
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,650
People seem to think that to be a true
conservative, you have to be religious.

598
00:32:05,651 --> 00:32:07,930
Well, she makes a great point
that you do not in fact,

599
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:10,960
and you'll hear more about that in the
interview. And then it ended up talking,

600
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,840
um, with somebody talking about the
future of Judaism. So I thought, wow,

601
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:17,850
this is what I mean. You want
to talk about diversity? Uh,

602
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,660
now they all happen to be white, although
tall was, was more brown I suppose. Um,

603
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,830
but uh,

604
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,250
this was diversity of thought and that
is the diversity of matter that matters.

605
00:32:27,251 --> 00:32:31,480
Did you know that Jake John
and Joe three is in a row?

606
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:35,530
Thank you guys. Uh, okay. Super
Cha. All right, here we go.

607
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,040
I'm a man of my word
getting too old for this.

608
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,680
42 years old to 42 year olds
do shot. Is that a thing? Um,

609
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,690
well a 42 year olds about,
oh, and they brought,

610
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,240
I've got an all star team here.
Let me,

611
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,870
let me put this in front of the
computer for a second. I've got a,

612
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:58,820
let's put that in front of the computer.
I've got Lyme, I've got salt. Oh God.

613
00:32:58,821 --> 00:33:02,780
That's the screenshot right there.
Uh, all right, I'm going to do it.

614
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,310
All right. Oh, but another one, take
the shot. All right, here we go.

615
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,560
Uh, it's been a long time
coming. So little salt.

616
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:18,620
Here we go. Got Salt, got
Tequila. They had a little salt.

617
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,590
There's a little tequila.

618
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:31,520
I do like lime. I've always
liked lime. I like sprite.

619
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,880
You're not supposed to drink it.
I don't really drink it that often.

620
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,210
A sprite zero every now
and again, although that'll
kill you too. But I do like,

621
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,870
I like lemon lime. I like
citrus. All right, there you go.

622
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,800
So I hope you're happy person who did
that. Thank you very much. Oh man,

623
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,180
I really haven't eaten today. I had a
salad and I had two glasses, a bone bra.

624
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:53,030
This could be very messy.
People. What am I doing?

625
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,620
I'm deleting Patrion and taking
shots of patron and we're,

626
00:33:56,621 --> 00:34:01,100
we're fundraising to keep the show fully
independent. Look, I'm not going to,

627
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:03,270
I don't intend on doing fundraisers
a lot throughout the year. We,

628
00:34:03,271 --> 00:34:06,710
we've done a nice job. We've transitioned
a whole good portion of people.

629
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,180
The business is going to continue,

630
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:10,940
I promise you that we're trying to just
get to the same levels that we were at

631
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:14,060
before. Uh, so, so I don't know.

632
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,300
My guys were saying we should be trying
to get to a specific number right now or

633
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:19,970
we should try to raise a certain amount
over the course of this two hours or

634
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:22,940
something like that. Um, I dunno, we're,

635
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,500
we're just kind of playing it by ear and
then I will click on patrion and delete

636
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:31,280
it. Let me see. Did anyone drop? Aaron
jump back over there. Has anyone dropped?

637
00:34:31,281 --> 00:34:35,660
I'm trying to get these people to
drop. We'll anyone drop. Did we? Yes.

638
00:34:35,661 --> 00:34:38,600
We lost six people.
That's what I'm talking about.

639
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:42,710
We lost six people on Patrion and we
dropped out of the, I didn't see it,

640
00:34:42,711 --> 00:34:45,410
the amount of money on that,
but I am thrilled to report people.

641
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,320
We are slowly dropping patrons.
I can do this.

642
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:51,410
I can do a 24 hour stream and just wait
for these because some of these people

643
00:34:51,411 --> 00:34:54,350
could be dead for all I know. I don't
know what's going on here. All right,

644
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,090
let's see. Time to take the shot. Bring
out Joe Rogan. This is the second person.

645
00:34:59,091 --> 00:35:01,820
Another shot. No, I think what we're
going to have to do, it will be insane.

646
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:03,710
If I do this for every hundred dollars,
then I do a shout.

647
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:08,270
I will be dead before I'm able to
press delete on this thing. So, uh,

648
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,020
I don't know. The next shot has to be
500 bucks. That sounds crazy. But like,

649
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:15,950
I don't know. It's the Internet. People
do crazy things. Um, but I, I will,

650
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:18,800
I'll do a couple more. We'll figure
it out. All right. Good luck brother.

651
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:22,640
Patrion is a joke anyway. Are you going
to ever get norm Mcdonald on? Yeah.

652
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:24,470
You know,
I met norm at a,

653
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:28,700
at Aura TV when I was over there with
Larry King and chatted with him in the

654
00:35:28,701 --> 00:35:31,250
green room. He said he'd do it. We
haven't just been able to connect,

655
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:32,720
but I would love to have him on.
Sometimes people say,

656
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:37,590
I sound like Norm Macdonald. Um, I
love norm McDonald from weekend update.

657
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:38,040
That

658
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,870
was basically the last time I
watched Saturday night live.

659
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:43,290
Does anyone watch that crap anymore?
I would love to know that in the comments.

660
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,940
Like, does anyone watch television
anymore at all? Um, I don't,

661
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,320
I watch on Sundays,

662
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:53,550
TV land does like 8:00 AM to
4:00 PM Golden Girls Marathon.

663
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,300
And I kind of have that on the background
when I'm doing other stuff in the

664
00:35:57,301 --> 00:36:00,030
house or just like laying there with
my dog or whatever. But I don't,

665
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:02,190
I don't watch any television.
I haven't watched,

666
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:06,030
we'll certainly s cable news or CNN
or anything like that. And forever.

667
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,120
I watch ancient aliens every now and
again. And you like the ancient aliens.

668
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:14,250
I like them, you know, ancient
alien theorists theorize
that canceling Patrion. Uh,

669
00:36:14,251 --> 00:36:18,150
and going over to Dave rubin.com/donate
is one of the best things that you can

670
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:22,950
do. A, okay, good luck brother
Bill. I just did that one. Um,

671
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,220
Dave, good luck with all the
avenues you're pursuing in 2019.

672
00:36:26,221 --> 00:36:29,460
What are your predictions for
Democratic candidates in 2020?

673
00:36:29,461 --> 00:36:34,100
Will they fracture similar
to the Republicans in 2016
or the establishment will

674
00:36:34,101 --> 00:36:37,400
be establishment back one candidate?
I'm,

675
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,120
I'm a little hesitant
to say this because a,

676
00:36:40,121 --> 00:36:43,750
I'm so frustrated with what's happening
on the left and the Democrats and the

677
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:46,630
progressives that I don't want to tip
them off to what I think is going to

678
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:50,740
happen. Um, but this is
just between me and you. Um,

679
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:53,590
I think it's going to be
a freaking bloodbath. Uh,

680
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,910
I think that between Elizabeth
Warren, let's say Bernie, uh,

681
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,580
now they've got Tulsi Gabard.
Uh,

682
00:37:00,581 --> 00:37:03,220
there'll be a couple others on the
progressive side. They'll throw, you know,

683
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,680
maybe a Cory booker. They'll throw in
someone who's a little more mainstream.

684
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:10,060
I don't know exactly who that is
because there aren't really mainstream,

685
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,690
there aren't really blue dog,
more centrist Democrats anymore.

686
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:17,260
Say a guy like Jim Webb who was in one
debate last time and he looked like he

687
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:20,830
was on the wrong stage. Those people
don't really exist. So what we're, we're,

688
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,020
I think you're going to happen is,
uh,

689
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:25,720
if further splintering of the
progressive thing and the,

690
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,940
the Kamala Harris people let's say,

691
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,630
are going to call the Bernie supporters
racist because he's white and they're

692
00:37:31,631 --> 00:37:34,660
going to call them this because
they're this. And you know,

693
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:38,530
and also you're seeing these people try
to pretend that they're human. I mean,

694
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:43,090
watching you guys saw that video where
Elizabeth Warren drank the beer with her

695
00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:46,300
husband and he just happened
to be standing there and
they try to pretend that

696
00:37:46,301 --> 00:37:46,901
they're normal,

697
00:37:46,901 --> 00:37:50,680
average people or Kamala Harris did the
video with the music that she likes and

698
00:37:50,681 --> 00:37:52,000
they're just robots.

699
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,900
It's like Trump standing in the White
House surrounded by 10,000 burgers is more

700
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:59,260
of a human than what these people are.
So in a weird way,

701
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,060
as much as I would love,

702
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:05,890
and I want to be clear about this as much
as I would love for a decent Democrat

703
00:38:05,891 --> 00:38:09,100
to return a good liberal, uh, JFK liberal,

704
00:38:09,101 --> 00:38:13,600
a Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Ed Kotch
and old school liberal to return from the

705
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:17,050
ashes of this lunacy, it's going
to get worse before it gets better.

706
00:38:17,051 --> 00:38:21,090
And that that person, I don't know where
the hell that that person is. Uh, I,

707
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,820
it doesn't seem to me that anyone
can tell me who that person is. Um,

708
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,040
even though you know that person,
who would that be?

709
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:30,760
Maybe that's a Joe Biden of 20 years ago,
who was more of a mainstream democrat.

710
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:35,850
But if the future of, of the Democrats
is Joe Biden who is what, 70, 74,

711
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,330
something like that, then they're in
a lot of trouble anyway. And, and I,

712
00:38:38,331 --> 00:38:40,600
that is not to say anything
about the Republicans. I'm,

713
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:42,420
I'm happy to answer questions
about the Republican's. Yep.

714
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,840
You got them. Um, but
yes, let's see. Okay.

715
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:51,700
Um, let's see, uh, shout
outs to Martha and to Nathan.

716
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:56,770
Let's see. A super superchat subbed
for $50 on your site 30 minutes ago,

717
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,340
long until you sign my mug.
Uh,

718
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:02,890
I'm not sure what you're
saying exactly there.

719
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,980
My guys are telling me the mug thing,
but my iPads loading a little slow.

720
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:10,750
So here we're going to do for ya
imaginary person, I believe you.

721
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:13,810
So I'm signing a Mug for you. I'm going
to put this one aside and let guys,

722
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:17,160
let's track that super chat and
figure out what's going on here. Uh,

723
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,250
Mahalo Day for all things free speech
is lucky to have you as a close friend.

724
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:25,360
Keep up all of the awesome
Mahalo, my friend, uh,

725
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,220
ch Viva free speech indeed. Um, hey Dave,

726
00:39:30,221 --> 00:39:30,941
thanks for all you do.

727
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:34,390
You should have met Fred on to discuss
his work on pornography and its effect on

728
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:34,990
culture.

729
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,870
You know, a few people have mentioned him
before. I actually have his book here.

730
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,990
Uh, he talks a lot about
people's addiction to
pornography and a bunch of other

731
00:39:40,991 --> 00:39:43,210
things. I actually think it's
a pretty interesting topic.

732
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:46,390
It just hasn't happened yet. Uh,
you know, I will do it. We will

733
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,330
make it happen. Uh, hang
tight. A reminder guys.

734
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:50,680
Uh,

735
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,680
I'm at Irvine Improv with an IDW
guests on January 30th they sold out.

736
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:56,170
So the,

737
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,680
one of the funny things that my stand up
shows that we didn't realize is that we

738
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:01,990
do usually about 50 seats out of,

739
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:05,740
usually clubs have about 300 seats are
saying we do about 50 seats for a meet

740
00:40:05,741 --> 00:40:08,140
and greet and you pay a little bit extra,
you get seated in the front.

741
00:40:08,141 --> 00:40:11,020
And then I meet people and shake hands
and take pictures after and all that.

742
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:14,590
Those are all selling our crazily quickly.
So they sold out immediately.

743
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:17,530
I asked the guys today to release 10 more,

744
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,090
so I'm not sure if
they're still available,

745
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:23,110
but you can check at [inaudible] dot com
slash events you can click over there

746
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,140
and see if there's any more meet
and greets available. Uh, but we'll,

747
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:29,100
we'll make it happen. But you know
what, here's what we'll do. Here's what,

748
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,970
this is going to complicate
things for my guys a little bit,

749
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,170
but anyone that donates,

750
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:37,170
if you donate 25 bucks or more a
month during this live stream, uh,

751
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,270
we'll have your email address and you,

752
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,400
we will email you if you want to come
to any of those shows and you can't get

753
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:44,680
tickets to the,
to the upgrade or you don't even want,

754
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:47,230
you don't even have to upgrade.
If you ended up at the Irvine show,

755
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,000
we'll gladly upgrade you
to the meet and greet.

756
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:53,830
I'll make sure it happens. We will
do that. So, okay, let's move on. Uh,

757
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,820
thanks for the good fight,
Dave. Much respect. I appreciate
it. Look at you. Nice

758
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,960
people will be in good on super chat
every now and again. I glanced, you know,

759
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:01,220
we post the live stream.

760
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,150
This tells you a little bit about
the ecosystem of Youtube, but we, uh,

761
00:41:05,151 --> 00:41:09,020
we post the live stream on youtube and
our glance before we get on there about

762
00:41:09,021 --> 00:41:11,630
what's going on in the comments section
and I don't know what you people are

763
00:41:11,631 --> 00:41:15,290
doing, what are you people do?
You're all fighting with each other,

764
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,060
saying horrible things to each other.

765
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,480
Often the ones that amazed me the
most though, I really mean this,

766
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,740
and I just glanced for literally like
literally 30 seconds and it's like there's

767
00:41:24,741 --> 00:41:29,330
all these people that seemingly don't
like me in this comment section and I

768
00:41:29,331 --> 00:41:30,800
don't care if you don't like me.
I actually don't.

769
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,590
But what I would say to you is
what are you doing your life?

770
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,550
Get off this channel.
What are you doing if you don't like me,

771
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:39,140
go find something to do.
I mean,

772
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:40,730
there's plenty of other things
you could be doing right now.

773
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:44,300
You could take a run, uh, you could play
some video games. You could watch porn.

774
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,880
I mean, there's many other you could
write, I don't know. What do you do?

775
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:50,240
You could make coffee,
you could stare at a fish tank.

776
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:53,690
There's a zillion things you could do
better than just endlessly sit there.

777
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:57,170
They were with [inaudible]. What are
you doing? Tell me what you're doing.

778
00:41:57,171 --> 00:41:58,880
If you're watching this right now,
which I'm sure you are,

779
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,220
what are you doing with your life?
What can we do for you?

780
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:05,390
I would recommend reading 12 rules for
life by Jordan Peterson that might help

781
00:42:05,391 --> 00:42:09,170
clean up your room people. Okay.
Uh, oh by the way. All right,

782
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:11,720
so we should clarify something because
there seems to be a little confusion here.

783
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,190
Uh,
first off,

784
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:16,070
I thank you guys that are all jumping in
on super chat and I know that's a cool

785
00:42:16,071 --> 00:42:18,620
way of getting your voice heard.
And I'm reading them all right here.

786
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:21,050
We're not censoring any of this nonsense.
Um,

787
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:24,530
but the only way we're giving away stuff,
again, the shirts that are right here,

788
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:25,610
which are in limited supply,

789
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:29,270
I would love to get rid of them and I need
some closet space. You know my studio,

790
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,870
this is my garage,
so I don't have a garage anymore.

791
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,980
We built a state of the art studio here.
Uh, and you know what I'll do, we'll do,

792
00:42:36,981 --> 00:42:38,360
I do this for,
for patrons,

793
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:41,210
but I often do videos where I just kind
of wandered around and I show you the

794
00:42:41,211 --> 00:42:43,750
whole thing and it's pretty awesome.
So if you haven't seen what,

795
00:42:43,751 --> 00:42:45,830
what sort of the behind
the scenes of this is,

796
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,430
is you guys on Patrion on that and that
the people that have allowed us to fan

797
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:53,900
fund you guys, you truly, I
mean it's not a, it's not a uh,

798
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,950
it's not hyperbole or a sarcastic remark
to say that you made my dreams come

799
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:59,930
true. I built, I bought
this house cause you guys,

800
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:01,580
I built this studio cause you guys,

801
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:06,020
we built a state of the art studio when
Tucker Carlson walked in here a couple

802
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,010
of weeks ago.
Um,

803
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:10,340
he now think about this talking about
and as the number one show on cable news,

804
00:43:10,341 --> 00:43:13,400
I have no idea how many millions
of dollars a year he's making,

805
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:17,150
but it's millions and millions of dollars
a year. He walks into my garage and he,

806
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,880
he literally, I don't know if he's
going to want me to quote him exactly,

807
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:24,800
but it was something to the effect of
Holy fucking Shit, this is your garage.

808
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:25,850
Like he was,

809
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:30,230
he was actually jealous of this cool
thing that we've been able to build here

810
00:43:30,231 --> 00:43:33,890
and my freedom and all that. And that's
not a knock on Fox by him in any way.

811
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:34,790
He loves what he's doing.

812
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:38,120
I was on his show later that night and
they treat them great and he's, you know,

813
00:43:38,121 --> 00:43:41,690
he's become a huge ally in this space of
related to free speech and the rest of

814
00:43:41,691 --> 00:43:43,520
it.
And you get the guy gets unending hate.

815
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:44,840
I mean for the amount of hate that I get.

816
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:48,680
It's like you attach Fox to your name
and now mainstream is just obsessed with

817
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:51,770
you because they just want the clicks
and views that you're getting. Right.

818
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,020
And that's why the more hate that
I get, the more I'm like, oh,

819
00:43:54,021 --> 00:43:56,360
I guess I am doing something right.
Because people say Nice things to me.

820
00:43:56,361 --> 00:43:59,510
I'm like, all right, well I guess I'm all
right. I am doing what I think is right.

821
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,700
But then all these people
that hate me, I'm like, boy,

822
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:05,720
you're really spending a lot of time
thinking about me. Okay. Um, but anyway,

823
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,940
because of fan funding,
we've been able to do this,

824
00:44:07,941 --> 00:44:09,680
but I don't have a garage anymore.

825
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:11,210
So we don't have a lot of
storage space in this house.

826
00:44:11,211 --> 00:44:14,660
And if I can move some of those
boxes of mugs and tee shirts,

827
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:18,410
that would actually be wonderful.
Shout outs to Chris and Christine.

828
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,610
Are they a couple? I do not
know. We'll find out. Um,

829
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,100
okay, let's see. Uh,

830
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:28,640
gave $50 on your site and no place for
us to enter details on there, right?

831
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:32,310
A heart on my mug. When you sign it, you
glorious gay bastard. Love you. Okay.

832
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:35,430
So have you gave money on the site? So
we'll find out who that last person was.

833
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:37,050
They gave 50.
Um,

834
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,980
we then have your email address and
we will email you with all of the

835
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:42,930
information. So fear not, we'll get you.

836
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,330
So I'm going to sign the
Mug for you right now.

837
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,920
I feel good about that d right there.
That's a good d.

838
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,450
And you want a heart on that thing? You're
gay bastard or right? No, Homo Dude,

839
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,100
you got a heart. You got a heart too.
All right, there you go. Let's see.

840
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:04,510
Okay. Uh, hey Dave,

841
00:45:04,511 --> 00:45:07,930
are you going to do anything on comic
skate and the blacklisting slash doxing of

842
00:45:07,931 --> 00:45:10,740
people in the comics industry? So
this thing keeps popping up. I,

843
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,420
to be totally honest with you,
my bandwidth try, you know,

844
00:45:13,421 --> 00:45:16,980
try to imagine what my bandwidth is
like at the moment to be able to take in

845
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,900
like enough stories that are related to
all of the things that are going on with

846
00:45:19,901 --> 00:45:22,840
this and try to do all the things
I'm trying to do every now and again.

847
00:45:22,841 --> 00:45:26,950
Something that I know should not
get by me does get by me. Um,

848
00:45:26,951 --> 00:45:30,400
so I know I need to pay more attention
to this and also like I come from the

849
00:45:30,401 --> 00:45:33,010
world of comic books. I love, you
know, in our green room here and I'll,

850
00:45:33,011 --> 00:45:37,360
I'll post some videos of this also
soon and I've done it before for,

851
00:45:37,361 --> 00:45:38,740
for the behind the
scenes Patriot on thing.

852
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:43,130
That's what I was trying to
get you earlier. Um, I love
comics. I love comics. I,

853
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,140
I've some of my old comic collection
posted in the green room right over there.

854
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:49,020
Um,
so I know I need to know more about this.

855
00:45:49,021 --> 00:45:52,020
I know there's been some like
SJW madness related to comics.

856
00:45:52,021 --> 00:45:55,770
I know it's leaking into the video
game world. And in into everywhere. Oh,

857
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:00,150
I had a question for you. So this
past weekend on a, on Sunday,

858
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,150
I took a couple of meetings in the
morning. I try not to work on the weekend,

859
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:04,740
but it never works.
I always had to doing it,

860
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,250
but I had a couple hours in the afternoon
and it was pouring rain here in La and

861
00:46:08,251 --> 00:46:12,030
it never rains and I had a couple of
hours in the afternoon to like do nothing.

862
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,570
And I was actually like, Holy Shit, I
could actually do nothing right now.

863
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,580
Watched a couple episodes
of the golden girls.

864
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,700
Then I go into the green room here.
So we,

865
00:46:20,701 --> 00:46:24,630
one of the bedrooms in my house is the
green room and a for those of you that

866
00:46:24,631 --> 00:46:27,450
are on Patrion, you've seen,
we have a great green room,

867
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,250
like it's totally comfortable
for all the guests.

868
00:46:29,251 --> 00:46:32,550
We got an espresso machine in there and
we got a a fully stocked fridge with

869
00:46:32,551 --> 00:46:34,380
whatever they want and there
we've got snacks in there.

870
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,270
I've also got all my video
game systems in there.

871
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:39,570
So I've got my old school a bit
and ies, Nintendo. I got contrary.

872
00:46:39,571 --> 00:46:43,800
I got Super Mario, I got the original
baseball, I got bases loaded, I got, uh,

873
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:48,060
what else do I got? I got, I got a
pro wrestling, a lot of the classics.

874
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,640
I've got a sega genesis in there,
um,

875
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:54,570
with altered beast and goals and
ghosts and NBA live and all that stuff.

876
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,770
I've got a playstation four. The
calamari already got me. I've got a,

877
00:46:58,771 --> 00:47:02,880
a Nintendo switch that a fan got me
and I think that's it on the video game

878
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:05,760
department. Anyway, so I was like, I'm
going to play some video games. Uh,

879
00:47:05,761 --> 00:47:10,470
so first I played my brother in law in no,
first I played my nephew in,

880
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:14,610
uh, NBA Two k 19. Um, and
I was thinking, you know,

881
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:17,310
maybe one of the rewards for
people that are high tier donors.

882
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,020
Maybe I would start giving out my,

883
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,560
my handle on playstation four and every
now and again I'd play people in Nba

884
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:26,760
live or NBA Two k, whatever it is, or
in some other co op gains. I really,

885
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:28,740
I like co op games where
we're working together.

886
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:32,470
I don't need to fight you and blow your
brains out and spit your guts all over

887
00:47:32,471 --> 00:47:35,740
the place or punch a hooker if we
can work together to fix the world.

888
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:40,360
That that's more my thing. Um, so if you
can think of, so my question is this.

889
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:45,010
So first off, my, my, uh, that
that patrolling works, um, my,

890
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:46,720
uh, nephew, my nine year old,

891
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:51,330
every first I have to kicked my ass
in Nba two k was pathetic. It was,

892
00:47:51,331 --> 00:47:53,740
but he used the warriors.
Now of course you're using the warriors.

893
00:47:53,741 --> 00:47:58,240
You got Thompson, you got, you got, uh,
you got curry. Okay. I get it. You know,

894
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:02,800
you got, uh, uh, Jesus Christ. Oh my God,

895
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:05,740
Duran, uh, you know, they're,
they're unstoppable. Basically.

896
00:48:05,741 --> 00:48:08,770
I was using the 91 trailblazers,
which is probably my,

897
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,030
it's my second favorite basketball team
of all time except for the 95 rockets.

898
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,400
And he just mocked me.

899
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:17,910
I like to be beaten by 30 points
by a nine year old is pathetic. Uh,

900
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,340
then I played my brother
in law. He crushed me. He,
although he was the 93 bolts,

901
00:48:21,341 --> 00:48:25,270
which you know, you're using Jordan in
his prime and then a, and then I was like,

902
00:48:25,271 --> 00:48:28,960
all right, I'm going to play by myself.
Like what can I play and everything.

903
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:32,410
I don't want to run all over the place
and have to spend all this mental energy

904
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:33,610
on a world that I don't live in.

905
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:37,090
I spend a lot of mental energy on this
world here that I seem to be living in,

906
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,580
so I couldn't.
I ended up playing PAC man.

907
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:43,180
I literally ended up playing PAC man on
playstation four because I couldn't find

908
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:46,990
something sort of mindless and simple.
So if you've got a simple mindless game,

909
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:50,260
that would be great. I also like,
I like just bullet hell shooters,

910
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:51,480
so if you've got a couple of good ones,

911
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:53,890
I was playing our type and Rezo
gun and a couple of others.

912
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:55,690
I don't really have time for any of this,
frankly,

913
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:00,670
but if you've got some good ideas, let
me know. All right guys. Uh, here we go.

914
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,260
My team wants me to do
a little reset here.

915
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:04,660
I'm giving shout outs for
anyone that donates at all.

916
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:06,760
If you donate five bucks in above,
it doesn't matter.

917
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:10,120
I've given live shoutouts
Dave rubin.com/donate.

918
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:15,160
If you donate $25 or above monthly,
you're going to get a limited edition.

919
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:17,830
Ruben reports, select members, sure
that we'll never be printed again.

920
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,440
I think we've about a hundred of
them left, probably less than that.

921
00:49:20,441 --> 00:49:23,560
Maybe about 80 of them left. Uh, and you'd
be cleaning out closets space for me,

922
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:26,290
which would really be great cause I don't
have a garage anymore so we don't have

923
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:28,330
a lot of rumor out here.
Uh, that will be great.

924
00:49:28,331 --> 00:49:32,080
We'll give you a tee shirt and
for 50 bucks a month or more,

925
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:35,090
you're going to get the t shirt and
you're going to get a mug and I'm going to

926
00:49:35,091 --> 00:49:37,720
sign it for you and we're going
to send it out to you this week.

927
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:42,730
So do let me know what's going
on over there. Canada loves you,

928
00:49:42,731 --> 00:49:45,940
Dave. Thank you. I love Canada.
I get a ton of email from Canada.

929
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:50,460
I did about 10 Canadian stops
with JP and Canada and, uh,

930
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:54,280
I think Canada there, there's
an interesting resurgence
of liberty in Canada,

931
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:57,520
which is really interesting that you
actually, we're going to have libertarian,

932
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:01,740
a prime minister, candidate,
prime ministerial candidate. Uh,

933
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,540
Maxine Bernay is going to be on the show.
We were going to do it via Skype,

934
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:06,490
but I just got an email this morning.
He's coming here,

935
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,750
come in directly to the
studio. Maxine Bernay, uh,

936
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,090
will be here within the next week or
so. So we'll do that one. You know what?

937
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:17,770
Let's jump over to the, uh, to
the computer monitor as it were.

938
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:19,450
I'm going to hit refresh.
Let's see.

939
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:22,450
Please tell me that you people have
canceled this thing. You killing me?

940
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,080
You're killing me. Stop giving
me money here. All right.

941
00:50:26,081 --> 00:50:27,830
We dropped 14 people.

942
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:33,010
We're down to 1,757 people
still around $10,000.

943
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,240
I don't know.

944
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,210
No. What I can do. What are you
doing? Cancel this. Whoa. Stop please.

945
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:43,030
People, you don't have to donate anymore.
Even on my website if you don't want,

946
00:50:43,031 --> 00:50:45,160
but, but please, let's end this thing.

947
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:49,700
Why are we giving these people money?
All right, let's see. Uh, okay.

948
00:50:49,701 --> 00:50:52,700
Shout out to James.
Thank you very much. Uh,

949
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:56,030
I'm a college student who goes to a
campus that is extremely liberal and I'm

950
00:50:56,031 --> 00:50:59,090
somewhat of a libertarian.
Any advice for me not to get killed,

951
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:00,163
but still at the bank?

952
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,560
Free speech. Well, that's
the state of affairs.

953
00:51:02,561 --> 00:51:05,350
If you believe in liberty and freedom
and you don't want to bother anybody and

954
00:51:05,351 --> 00:51:08,290
you don't want to take their shit, but
you don't want them to take your shit, uh,

955
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:12,130
you don't, you might be getting killed.
Um, my advice would be this, which is,

956
00:51:12,131 --> 00:51:15,490
this is the exact same advice that I
give every college kid when I go to every

957
00:51:15,491 --> 00:51:18,400
college,
a speaking gig that I do,

958
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:23,050
which is be brave. Now. That's it.

959
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,760
You must be brave now. You will
not get out of college. Really,

960
00:51:27,761 --> 00:51:31,270
really hear this. I think this is the
most true thing that I can possibly say.

961
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:34,630
If you're in college right now and
you're afraid to say what you think,

962
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,410
do you think that it magically
is gonna get better? Um,

963
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:42,190
if you think things are screwed up and
maybe the generation before you is the

964
00:51:42,191 --> 00:51:43,024
one that screwed him up,

965
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,880
do you think that it will magically
get better by your silence?

966
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:50,080
Do you think that the people who are
allowed right now will eventually give you

967
00:51:50,081 --> 00:51:52,810
an inch because of your
acquiescence? Uh, no.

968
00:51:52,811 --> 00:51:54,700
They will keep taking
and taking and taking.

969
00:51:54,701 --> 00:51:58,870
And that's why what happened to me with
this patriotic thing was, all right,

970
00:51:58,871 --> 00:52:00,940
we could let them,
they booted some people and we,

971
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,970
we maybe dropped the
ball on some are ignored,

972
00:52:03,971 --> 00:52:06,700
some or that person were shady or
I didn't want to make that one.

973
00:52:06,701 --> 00:52:11,410
The exact example of why I would
stand up and defend the line. Um,

974
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,730
but then the line moves,

975
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:15,700
the line moves and if you're afraid
to see what you think, now you're 18,

976
00:52:15,701 --> 00:52:17,740
you're 19 years old.
Uh,

977
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:22,090
and if you think that it will
magically get better, it will not,

978
00:52:22,091 --> 00:52:23,380
it will get worse.

979
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:28,400
We live in the most privileged in
the best sense of it. We're pretty,

980
00:52:28,401 --> 00:52:30,880
if you live in the United State,
you are privileged.

981
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:35,440
You are the freest person in the
freest society that there possibly is.

982
00:52:35,441 --> 00:52:37,900
It doesn't mean you have everything.
It doesn't mean you came from everything.

983
00:52:37,901 --> 00:52:39,370
He doesn't mean you'll attain everything,

984
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,940
but you live in a place that will give
you the opportunity to do all of the

985
00:52:42,941 --> 00:52:45,160
things that you want in your life,
but it's on you to do them.

986
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:46,900
It's on you to do them.

987
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:50,080
So if you're 18 or 19 years old
and you're in college right now,

988
00:52:50,081 --> 00:52:53,020
and you're afraid to say what you think,
if you don't do it now,

989
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,040
it'll never get easier.

990
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:57,550
Do you think when you get out of college
in three years and now you've got a

991
00:52:57,551 --> 00:53:01,030
rent, you gotta Pay Rent, right? Well,
you're going to suddenly be like,

992
00:53:01,031 --> 00:53:02,590
I'm going to tell the world would I think,

993
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:05,110
and then three years later you're
married and you've got a mortgage.

994
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,660
I'm going to tell the world what I think.
You've got car payments and dog.

995
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,390
Now you've got kids. It's three
months later now or three years later.

996
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,590
Now you've got all sorts
of other payments, school
payments and blah, blah, blah.

997
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:16,780
I building for, I'm going to tell the
world what I think. You won't. You won't,

998
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:17,980
it's on you.
Now.

999
00:53:17,981 --> 00:53:21,340
There's no better moment than right this
moment to start saying what you think.

1000
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,680
And part of the reason
that this SJW lunacy,

1001
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:30,690
um, is, is spreading is because they're
allowed and they call everyone racist.

1002
00:53:30,691 --> 00:53:34,440
So they've silenced good people.
There is an, I assure you guys, look,

1003
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:36,510
I'm doing the best I can.
I'm just doing what I think is right.

1004
00:53:36,511 --> 00:53:40,680
I say that all the time. I am just one
person. And guess what? I'm still here.

1005
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,450
And Douglas Murray,
Douglas Murray,

1006
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:45,180
who I think is one of the greatest
modern thinkers that we have,

1007
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:47,400
who I've had in the studio. If you
haven't seen our interviews, watch it.

1008
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,760
And Douglas Murray talks about
extremely controversial talk topics.

1009
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:53,820
He talks about radical Islam.
He talks about immigration,
a whole bunch of things.

1010
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:58,290
Um, and he's gay and
conservative in, in the UK.

1011
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,400
Um, I asked him, well,
what makes you so brave?

1012
00:54:02,401 --> 00:54:05,580
Why are you willing to talk about
these things? What you meeting?

1013
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:06,990
You have this person in front of me.

1014
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:08,610
Why are you willing to
talk about these things?

1015
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,500
And he said in a wonderful British
accent that I can't quite do.

1016
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,940
But he said, you know, Dave,
when you get in the pool,

1017
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,540
you might find out that
the water is not that cold.

1018
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:26,010
I wish I could done that with a little
more of a Cockney Downton Abbey accident.

1019
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,320
But the point is that if you guys jump in,

1020
00:54:28,321 --> 00:54:33,030
you might find out that all of the
things that you fear are not as terrible.

1021
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:35,270
The monster isn't as terrible.
And I'm just,

1022
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,620
I'm not saying the monster doesn't
exist because it does exist,

1023
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,610
but we got to start fighting
back together. And if you
think at 18, if you stop,

1024
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:44,250
if you're thinking about these things
now, you know what, let's try it this way.

1025
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:47,910
Imagine if my advice was, you
know, what, suck it up. Suck
it up. Get Out of college.

1026
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:52,110
Does that seem like the right advice?
And I don't think so. We'll see.

1027
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,200
Let's see.
Um,

1028
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:58,350
always enjoy your perspective on
what's going on in this crazy world.

1029
00:54:58,351 --> 00:55:01,690
Come to Oklahoma City. We're
figuring out the standup tour. Uh,

1030
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:03,390
so hang tight on Oklahoma City.

1031
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:05,940
Looking forward to seeing
you in San Jose next weekend.

1032
00:55:05,941 --> 00:55:08,760
Thanks for the meet and greet comps.
I guess I gave you meet, greet comps.

1033
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:11,220
My pleasure.
You said before that you're a Sinatra Fan.

1034
00:55:11,221 --> 00:55:13,950
What's your favorite song or album
by Frank? I love the question.

1035
00:55:13,951 --> 00:55:15,840
I love not getting always
political questions.

1036
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:18,180
If you guys want to ask me anything else,
there's not political,

1037
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:21,120
that'd be great too. Oh, quick shout
outs to marry to Kelly to fill up.

1038
00:55:21,121 --> 00:55:25,980
Thank you guys. Um, Dave rubin.com/donate.
Let me give you a shirt and a mug.

1039
00:55:25,981 --> 00:55:29,070
People, um, I'm moving product
and we're officially deleting.

1040
00:55:29,071 --> 00:55:32,490
Patrion we'll delete in a, it looks
like it's going to be about an hour.

1041
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:35,430
We're going to delete this thing or unless
I just magically do it at a nowhere.

1042
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,290
I could just get sick of this
and just be like, you know,

1043
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:40,230
I'm hungry and I got to go.
But we are deleting patrion live.

1044
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,230
I love the fact that like there
are these like silicon valley,

1045
00:55:43,231 --> 00:55:46,680
like people watching like, oh my
God, it's he it there. All right.

1046
00:55:46,681 --> 00:55:50,880
When's he going to do it? Why does
this mean? It's like, it's so boring.

1047
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:54,990
The group think thing. It's just so
boring. My favorite Sinatra Song by far,

1048
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:57,360
by far my way by far,

1049
00:55:57,361 --> 00:56:01,590
every word of that song is something that
I try to live up to. It's just, I'm not,

1050
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,240
I'm not going to sing
it for you right now,

1051
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,390
but open up another youtube tab and
listened to my way. And that is,

1052
00:56:06,391 --> 00:56:10,630
that is how I try to live my life,
that I don't always succeed at it. Um,

1053
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,070
but it's just great. Let's do the line
about regrets. Regrets. I've had a few,

1054
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:17,580
I mean, just, just listen. It's just,
it's just perfection. But you know,

1055
00:56:17,581 --> 00:56:20,790
believe it or not,
I actually think pound for pound.

1056
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,830
If I could only listen

1057
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:28,180
to Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin,

1058
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:33,040
if I had to choose between one of the
two, I might go dean Martin. I really,

1059
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:36,940
really love Dean Martin, especially
when, uh, when David's cooking Italian,

1060
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:40,450
I can listen to Dean Martin all the time.
Dean Martin's a little lighter.

1061
00:56:40,451 --> 00:56:42,940
There's like a little more play in
d more in than there isn't Sinatra.

1062
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:47,760
And I, I really do love that. Uh, oh,
okay. Sorry. Mary Kelly and Philip.

1063
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:51,110
I didn't, uh, I didn't realize
you guys were mugs. Sorry.

1064
00:56:51,111 --> 00:56:55,970
I'm going to sign your mugs. What I do
with the pen. All right, here we go. Mary,

1065
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,540
you're getting a Mug by the way guys,
do not,

1066
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:02,870
I've been warned about this.
If you put this mug

1067
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:07,720
with the signature in the, uh, in
the dishwasher, it will rub off.

1068
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:10,570
So either hand wash it or I
was told if you bake them,

1069
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:14,230
but I don't want to be held legally
responsible for this. If you bake the Mug,

1070
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:15,020
that somehow

1071
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:19,190
the ink like gets into the Mug and
you'll be okay. So that is Mary,

1072
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:24,260
that is Kelly and fill up and you
guys are all getting t shirts as well.

1073
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:29,280
Thank you guys. All
right, there we go. Um,

1074
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,850
all right. You know what I
said? I said 500 for a shot.

1075
00:57:31,851 --> 00:57:35,930
We'll do 200 for a shot on a on super
chat. Go for it. Shout out to you all.

1076
00:57:35,931 --> 00:57:40,630
Thank you very much.
Uh, let's see. Um, do,

1077
00:57:40,631 --> 00:57:44,570
do, do, do, uh, if he ever
gets out of the embassy,

1078
00:57:44,571 --> 00:57:46,240
Julian Assange would be a great guest.
Yeah.

1079
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,980
Yeah. I'd be happy to talk to them. I
wonder if we could do that via Skype.

1080
00:57:48,981 --> 00:57:50,540
He's done a couple interviews.
I think

1081
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:55,880
I would obviously be more than
happy to do that. Um, hey Dave,

1082
00:57:55,881 --> 00:57:59,990
I'm doing $50 a month. Have you had a
chance to look at Christina Bichons work?

1083
00:57:59,991 --> 00:58:03,580
She's a professor at Oxford and wrote
a book about political civility. I,

1084
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:07,000
the name actually does not ring a bell.
I will tell you this. I went to, uh,

1085
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,390
well first of all guys, can we add, add

1086
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:12,010
her name to the list
beyond bi. J. O. N. M.

1087
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:17,200
I went to Oxford twice in the last
year. Um, I spoke at Oxford Union,

1088
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:19,630
which the video is on youtube
on their youtube channel.

1089
00:58:19,631 --> 00:58:21,790
It was one of the greatest
honors that I've, well,

1090
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,830
it might be the greatest
professional honor that I've had.

1091
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,830
It was just an incredible place to
be. I mean, if you go to Oxford,

1092
00:58:26,831 --> 00:58:29,320
if you haven't been there, it looks like
it's right out of Harry Potter. It's,

1093
00:58:29,321 --> 00:58:31,660
it's just incredible.
And they, they, you know,

1094
00:58:31,661 --> 00:58:36,040
they have these small schools everywhere
and there's such a respect for learning

1095
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:40,030
and knowledge and the libraries are
incredible and there's just young people

1096
00:58:40,031 --> 00:58:44,650
everywhere who are interested
in knowledge. It's actually
amazing. Um, I had, uh,

1097
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:47,110
what I think was one of
my best public talks.

1098
00:58:47,111 --> 00:58:49,720
He was extremely intimate
and really lovely.

1099
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:52,150
I got asked some really
challenging questions at the end,

1100
00:58:52,151 --> 00:58:54,700
some really interesting stuff. And
it was, it was a pleasure to do that.

1101
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:59,350
And then I went back again with Jordan a
couple months ago and it's just a great

1102
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:03,340
place. And you know, I've mentioned
this before, but going around the world,

1103
00:59:03,341 --> 00:59:06,710
you know, in the last couple months
I was in awe. I was in Norway.

1104
00:59:06,711 --> 00:59:08,980
I'll just mention the countries, not
all the cities, but I was in Ireland,

1105
00:59:08,981 --> 00:59:12,820
I was in Norway, I was in Sweden,
I was in Denmark. I was in,

1106
00:59:12,821 --> 00:59:16,270
did I say Ireland already? I was in the
UK. Uh, obviously we're in the states.

1107
00:59:16,271 --> 00:59:17,200
We were in Canada,

1108
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,980
we're going to be doing France and Germany
and we're trying to get to the Middle

1109
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,340
East and a whole bunch of other places

1110
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,353
in the next couple of months.

1111
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:27,950
But seeing that these ideas permeate
around the world and that people, I mean,

1112
00:59:27,951 --> 00:59:30,470
trying to think how cool it
is that somebody, right now,

1113
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:32,180
there's somebody in Brazil watching this,

1114
00:59:32,181 --> 00:59:35,900
thinking a similar thought as someone in
Iceland who's thinking of some similar

1115
00:59:35,901 --> 00:59:39,380
thoughts as someone who's in Jordan,
as someone in Russia. I mean that,

1116
00:59:39,381 --> 00:59:42,410
that's actually incredible and that's
a really beautiful thing and that's why

1117
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:45,920
the Internet has to be
protected. And that's why we
have to protect free thought.

1118
00:59:45,921 --> 00:59:48,920
And it's why we have to
protect our ability to
communicate each other with each

1119
00:59:48,921 --> 00:59:52,940
other. So let's keep doing that. Kyle,
you're getting a mug. All right, let's go.

1120
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:57,260
Um, keep fighting the good fight,
Dave. All right. That's the plan.

1121
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:03,380
That is the plan. Kyle, you are getting
a mug. Okay. Thank you very much. Uh,

1122
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,840
all right, quick reset. Since
we're about an hour and, or,
you know, let's go to the,

1123
01:00:06,841 --> 01:00:10,050
uh, let's go to the computer.
Over here. We are on the computer.

1124
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,450
Now please tell me that we
lost at least a hundred people.

1125
01:00:12,451 --> 01:00:17,430
I don't know what to do here to
get rid of you people. Uh, 1757.

1126
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:21,940
We are down to
1756.

1127
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:23,440
That's right people.

1128
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:31,410
And the 20 minutes since I did that,
we lost one person and I thank you.

1129
01:00:31,411 --> 01:00:33,860
Whoever that is. You know what? I
want to send that person a month.

1130
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,840
We'll send that person a mug.
If we can find out who that person is.

1131
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:39,980
I want to send them a mug and a tee
shirt if you just canceled on Patrion.

1132
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:42,270
Thank you.
I don't know what I can do for you guys.

1133
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:43,590
So I have to send you guys money.

1134
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:47,040
Maybe I should start a Kickstarter to
raise money to give money to you people to

1135
01:00:47,041 --> 01:00:51,960
cancel the patrion thing. Uh,
Lordy, Lordy, a Mug for Carrie.

1136
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:58,380
You're getting a Mug, sister. Thank you
for support. Uh, it's much appreciated.

1137
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:01,610
All right people,
I'm ready to do another shot at patrol.

1138
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,980
I don't know what's happened here.
Let's, uh, let's make it happen.

1139
01:01:04,981 --> 01:01:08,340
200 on super chat or a,
or you know what,

1140
01:01:08,341 --> 01:01:11,610
a hundred monthly on Dave Rubin. Dot.
Conversation donate. We'll make it happen.

1141
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,840
I don't know, I'm just having fun
here. Like let's just keep rolling. Um,

1142
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:20,580
you're a legend Dave. Keep up the good
work. Can't wait to see you in Australia.

1143
01:01:20,581 --> 01:01:24,240
I really can't wait to go to Australia.
I get a ton of email from Australia.

1144
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,970
Australia I think is our fourth
most listened to country.

1145
01:01:26,971 --> 01:01:31,140
Usually it's the United
States, Canada, UK and then,

1146
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:34,500
and then I think Australia and Germany
or sometimes Australia and Sweden.

1147
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,950
Flip on that on the next most followed.

1148
01:01:36,951 --> 01:01:39,120
Now Sweden's a particularly interesting
case because there's only about 10

1149
01:01:39,121 --> 01:01:40,530
people that live there.
And I think,

1150
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:43,620
I think I met everybody at
the two shows with Jordan,

1151
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:46,500
the second show that I did
with Jordan in Stockholm,

1152
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:49,290
which was an amazing theater and
they were two of my favorite shows.

1153
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:52,020
I really loved all the Nordic
countries actually. Um,

1154
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:56,700
but the day before we did the
second show with Jordan, um,

1155
01:01:56,730 --> 01:02:00,930
the Swedish foreign minister whose
name is escaping me at the moment,

1156
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:04,980
might be Kiersten something.
Kristin, Kristin something. Uh,

1157
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:08,640
she said that she wishes the Jordan
Peterson would crawl back under the rock.

1158
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:13,641
He came from off the foreign minister
of a Western country was upset that a

1159
01:02:14,161 --> 01:02:16,830
clinical psychologist who
talks about free speech and,

1160
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:20,130
and personal responsibility
and the rights of the and and

1161
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:23,670
defending the,
the values of Western society.

1162
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:26,040
She wants him to crawl back
under the rock he's came from.

1163
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:28,170
I mean that's how stupid
everything has gotten.

1164
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:31,050
A though I do have to thank her because
I got a lot of good laughs at her

1165
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:35,160
expense. A super chat. Thank you for
doing what you do Dave. You got it.

1166
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:39,690
Hey, I signed up for 50 hours a month. I
was wondering what your favorite car was.

1167
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:43,800
Um, man, these Teslas right now,
have you guys been in these Teslas?

1168
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:46,380
They are UN freaking believable.

1169
01:02:46,381 --> 01:02:50,190
Like driving a Tesla and
then driving any other car,

1170
01:02:50,191 --> 01:02:54,210
the newest anything and you will be
like, wow, what a jump in technology.

1171
01:02:54,211 --> 01:02:57,420
I mean they are smooth and clean.
There's no buttons.

1172
01:02:57,421 --> 01:03:01,380
It's all on that huge screen there.
There are self driving, you know,

1173
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:06,120
the model x has the Delorean style wings.
Um,

1174
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:11,070
they're just absolutely like
sick and cool. There's a
ton of them here in La. Uh,

1175
01:03:11,071 --> 01:03:13,710
and on top of the fact that they're fully
electric obviously and everything else

1176
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:16,870
and a lot of must shot went into space
just because he could, I mean that,

1177
01:03:16,871 --> 01:03:21,871
that's something I'm the minister of
foreign affairs in Sweden is Margo

1178
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,550
Walstrom. That's right. Margo
Walstrom. She is not Kiersten anything.

1179
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:30,540
I made that up. Uh, let's see. Um,

1180
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:34,230
when you interview Maxine,
Bernie asked him about the dairy industry.

1181
01:03:34,231 --> 01:03:36,350
He says he wants to follow
in Australia path. However,

1182
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:40,290
Australian farmers killed themselves
in shop in shocking numbers when they

1183
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:42,960
eliminated quotas.
I will be totally honest with you.

1184
01:03:42,961 --> 01:03:45,210
I don't know anything about that.
Let me do a little research.

1185
01:03:45,211 --> 01:03:49,320
I'll try to make it happen. Okay. Um,

1186
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:54,090
nonpolitical question, ginger or
Maryanne, oh, sorry, I forgot.

1187
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:59,070
Geo Gilligan or skipper,

1188
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:03,830
what's wrong with you people?
You know, like really why,

1189
01:04:03,831 --> 01:04:07,290
what kind of question is
that? Skipper, obviously, but
what, what's wrong with you?

1190
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:11,700
You know, it's an odd question.
Why are you asking that?
Uh, Shah Mug for Christian.

1191
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:16,260
All right, here you go, Christian.
Thank you guys. You know,

1192
01:04:16,261 --> 01:04:18,570
one of the things that you're
also doing in the meantime,

1193
01:04:18,571 --> 01:04:20,460
so we are building out this platform.
As I said,

1194
01:04:20,461 --> 01:04:23,610
we're trying to figure out ways
to secure the monetization.

1195
01:04:23,611 --> 01:04:27,270
We're trying to figure out ways to
secure the video hosting to secure, uh,

1196
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,950
not only that, but the, the web hosting,

1197
01:04:28,951 --> 01:04:31,360
there's ways to decentralize
that even we're,

1198
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:34,410
we're trying to figure out all of the
pressure points and how do we deal with

1199
01:04:34,411 --> 01:04:37,710
them systematically and make sure that
we're taken care of on all fronts.

1200
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:41,400
We're trying to figure out what it,
what does a terms of service in 2019,

1201
01:04:41,401 --> 01:04:45,660
what does a true terms of service
look like? Should it be as simple as,

1202
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:49,770
it's just you have to follow the laws of
the United States where we have no hate

1203
01:04:49,771 --> 01:04:51,150
speech laws, but you can't, you know,

1204
01:04:51,151 --> 01:04:54,090
make a terrorist threat or yell fire in
a crowded theater or a criminal threat

1205
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:57,240
or direct violence, things like
that. Could it be that, well,

1206
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:01,110
there's an argument that that could be it.
And I think that's a legit argument.

1207
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:03,810
But then what happens the
day we opened this platform,

1208
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:08,870
all of the racists and
the white supremacists and
all of these awful people,

1209
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,890
let's say they get on on the site.
Now,

1210
01:05:10,891 --> 01:05:12,840
I'm not against them
expressing their free speech.

1211
01:05:12,841 --> 01:05:16,410
I think you guys obviously know that
even if I find their ideas, I pour in.

1212
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,100
The problem is that,
imagine

1213
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:22,210
now we start this site and out
of the first 2000 accounts,

1214
01:05:22,211 --> 01:05:26,290
1500 of them are these people because
they've been banned off the other sites.

1215
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:29,050
Well now what is the entire media?

1216
01:05:29,051 --> 01:05:31,290
And we know the media is just mostly
a bunch of nonsense anyway, the,

1217
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:34,720
the entire media now
jumps on board and is, Oh,

1218
01:05:34,721 --> 01:05:38,590
you see Reuben and Peterson or running
the outright racist website. And then,

1219
01:05:38,591 --> 01:05:42,010
you know, we uh, we'll hopefully have
investors and board members and all that.

1220
01:05:42,011 --> 01:05:44,380
And then all the pressure is
applied on them. So we have to,

1221
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:49,270
we have to calculating Lee and clearly
think about what does it terms of service

1222
01:05:49,271 --> 01:05:52,390
look like?
How do you launch a launch,

1223
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:55,960
a new platform as a platform and have to
be launched that on day one everyone's

1224
01:05:55,961 --> 01:05:57,190
on it or should it be,

1225
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:01,660
I'm coming around to this idea that it
would be a tiered invitation system.

1226
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:04,480
So let's say we launched
with say 50 people, right?

1227
01:06:04,481 --> 01:06:09,481
So let's say it's like sort of IDW people
in adjacent people and then then that

1228
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:12,130
sort of the Beta test version
of it, right? As the creator.

1229
01:06:12,131 --> 01:06:15,400
But anyone can sign on to follow a
creator, but that's the creator tier.

1230
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:18,190
And then maybe over three months
as we're testing all things out,

1231
01:06:18,191 --> 01:06:22,210
each creator gets five invites to five
other creators and then you exponentially

1232
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:24,640
grow from there. I think something
like that could be interesting.

1233
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:27,940
I also think people are sick of the fact
that anyone can get on anything and do

1234
01:06:27,941 --> 01:06:30,250
whatever they want and the
whole thing's a free for all.

1235
01:06:30,251 --> 01:06:32,290
I think actually people
do like some rules,

1236
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,960
but they liked him to be
actually enforced consistently.

1237
01:06:34,961 --> 01:06:38,530
Not In this crazy way that they're
enforced right now. Shout out to Cody.

1238
01:06:38,531 --> 01:06:42,700
Thank you very much Cody. Uh, if I
remember your, if I remember correctly,

1239
01:06:42,701 --> 01:06:44,080
you were a blazers fan.

1240
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:48,340
I think the Blazers get rid of either
Lillard or McCollum if they don't make a

1241
01:06:48,341 --> 01:06:51,460
deep playoff push.
So I'm an early nineties,

1242
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:55,110
a blazers fan because Clyde
Drexler was my favorite hero. Uh,

1243
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:58,360
if you weren't an NBA fan in
the early nineties, uh, Clyde,

1244
01:06:58,361 --> 01:07:02,200
the glide was basically the number two
shooting guard to Jordan for all of those

1245
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,240
years. And I just liked
the guy. He was smooth.

1246
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,690
He didn't make a big stink about
everything. He was in a showboater.

1247
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:11,810
He got his teams to the NBA finals
twice in 90 against the Pistons in

1248
01:07:11,811 --> 01:07:15,430
[inaudible] 92 against, uh, the
bowls. And then in [inaudible] 91,

1249
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:17,590
they made it to the western
conference finals against the Lakers.

1250
01:07:17,591 --> 01:07:19,810
He lost a couple of championships
and by the time he was,

1251
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,740
he was really an old guy.
Uh, 32 years old. In 95,

1252
01:07:23,741 --> 01:07:27,520
he was traded to the Houston Rockets where
he had played for the Houston cougars

1253
01:07:27,521 --> 01:07:30,040
by Slamma Jamma with the Chemo Olajuwon.
Uh,

1254
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:32,530
he was traded to Houston
and he won a championship.

1255
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:35,260
That's my favorite team of all time.
Um,

1256
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:37,870
so I don't know exactly how much is
going on with the blazers right now.

1257
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:42,220
I don't want Lillard tall to overtake
Clyde though in all time. Blazers scoring.

1258
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:46,420
So I'm hoping that's not going
to happen. Okay, there we go. Um,

1259
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:48,940
I'm dying to take you and
Jordan out for a beer.

1260
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:51,340
Let me know when you're going to be
in Vegas. I do a show on the strip.

1261
01:07:51,341 --> 01:07:54,640
I'd love to drink my crown
royal from your autograph Mug.

1262
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:59,470
The autograph monk does go well with Crown
Royal. Um, we didn't make it to Vegas.

1263
01:07:59,471 --> 01:08:00,460
I don't know.
You know,

1264
01:08:00,461 --> 01:08:03,010
there's a couple of cities that people
have asked about that I'm not totally

1265
01:08:03,011 --> 01:08:05,230
sure why this or that didn't happen.
You know,

1266
01:08:05,231 --> 01:08:08,350
there's all sorts of considerations on
a tour that they try to figure out and I

1267
01:08:08,351 --> 01:08:12,670
don't know exactly what, uh, the answer,
but that was all right. Here we go.

1268
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:15,890
I'm going to jump back to the, uh, to
the computer screen. We are trying to

1269
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:20,360
get you people off. Patrion so
I'm going to hit refresh. Come on,

1270
01:08:20,361 --> 01:08:25,361
people tell me you dropped on Patrion
I don't want money on patrion 1756 and

1271
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,860
1755.
This is going to be the longest.

1272
01:08:30,861 --> 01:08:33,590
This is going to be the live
stream from hell. People. Uh,

1273
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:37,130
I'm trying to get you people to cancel.
I don't know what I can do.

1274
01:08:37,131 --> 01:08:40,880
I'm deleting it either way. So no matter
what happens at seven o'clock tonight,

1275
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:45,230
a couple of minutes before seven,
I'll do it. Uh, you know, look,

1276
01:08:45,231 --> 01:08:48,020
I could leave this thing up and just
cash in on that and I could probably cash

1277
01:08:48,021 --> 01:08:50,480
in on it for a long time because
people sign up for things and forget.

1278
01:08:50,481 --> 01:08:51,950
I'm obviously not going to do that,

1279
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:55,430
but I would love to see more
people cancel this thing at least.

1280
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:59,040
But in the meantime, as we roll out
a whole bunch of this stuff, uh,

1281
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:03,290
we are moving people over to my website.
So if you donate five bucks or more,

1282
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:04,610
I'm giving you a shout out right now.

1283
01:09:04,611 --> 01:09:08,480
It's Dave ruby.com/donate 25 bucks or
more a month. You're getting a tee shirt,

1284
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:13,460
50 bucks or more a month. You're
getting a signed autograph Mug and uh,

1285
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:17,360
and yeah, let, let's do another shot of
petroleum. I'm feeling it at this point.

1286
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:20,750
Let's make it happen. Let's
see. Uh, I just got here.

1287
01:09:20,751 --> 01:09:24,290
Are you aware of Youtube or laws,
FTC complaint,

1288
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:28,250
he's working against Patrion and paypal.
Would you have them on your channel?

1289
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:31,880
So I, I know of this video
and I've heard about this guy.

1290
01:09:31,881 --> 01:09:33,680
I actually haven't watched it yet.
Uh,

1291
01:09:33,681 --> 01:09:37,700
but it sounds like there might be some
legal issue related to collusion or

1292
01:09:37,701 --> 01:09:38,990
something like that.
Uh,

1293
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,050
I need to know a little bit more about
it before I specifically comment on

1294
01:09:42,051 --> 01:09:42,801
anything.
Look,

1295
01:09:42,801 --> 01:09:46,880
my preference on all of these things
would not go be going through legal roots,

1296
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:49,730
although sometimes there's
a need to do it. Uh, and,

1297
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:52,410
and going through governmental force,
uh,

1298
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:54,740
although I guess sometimes
perhaps there's a need to do it.

1299
01:09:54,741 --> 01:09:58,040
I know that sets bells off with
the libertarian set. Uh, my,

1300
01:09:58,041 --> 01:10:01,840
my preference would be that
human ingenuity and, and, uh,

1301
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:05,810
creativity and the human
mind will resolve problems.

1302
01:10:05,811 --> 01:10:08,690
I think that's the way it's always been
done in the best ways and human history.

1303
01:10:08,691 --> 01:10:12,770
And I think that's what can
be done here. A mug time. Jim,

1304
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:17,600
you're getting a mug. There you
go, Jim. Thank you very much.

1305
01:10:17,601 --> 01:10:22,550
Welcome to the team and a shout
out to Nicole. Thank you very much.

1306
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:27,170
Let's see a super chat.
I got called a white supremacist.

1307
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:32,030
All writer today for re tweeting Dave's
tweet about family guy self-censoring

1308
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:35,240
gay jokes due to SJW pressure.
The world is upside down.

1309
01:10:35,241 --> 01:10:37,910
So if you haven't seen this,
I tweeted this yesterday,

1310
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:43,150
there was an article in entertainment
tonight or one of these type of sites that

1311
01:10:43,821 --> 01:10:47,840
the producers of family guy have decided
that they're going to phase out gay

1312
01:10:47,841 --> 01:10:50,630
jokes. Now, uh,

1313
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:54,560
I tweeted about this because I want you
to really think about how bananas is and

1314
01:10:54,561 --> 01:10:55,281
when people say,
oh,

1315
01:10:55,281 --> 01:10:58,400
there's SJW stuff doesn't matter in
this free speech stuff doesn't matter.

1316
01:10:58,401 --> 01:11:02,030
It's just happening on college campuses
and it's just a bunch of kids and all of

1317
01:11:02,031 --> 01:11:05,720
that. It, this is why it is
utter and complete nonsense.

1318
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:09,890
We need humor to laugh at things.
We need the ability to release some steam.

1319
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:13,890
Sometimes we need to be able to make fun
of people and sometimes groups and all

1320
01:11:13,891 --> 01:11:14,070
these

1321
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:18,990
things. So to show that we're all equal,
watch it. Watch don Rickles do in comedy.

1322
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:21,360
Go on Youtube later and
watch don Rickles do comedy.

1323
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:22,620
And he made fun of everybody.

1324
01:11:22,621 --> 01:11:27,621
He made fun of Jews and gays and
Christians and white trash and Asians and

1325
01:11:31,561 --> 01:11:35,010
everybody. And it made everyone
in the audience realize, Whoa,

1326
01:11:35,011 --> 01:11:37,410
we're all part of the American experiment.

1327
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:42,300
But what the left is doing by judging
us so intensely on our immutable

1328
01:11:42,301 --> 01:11:45,570
characteristics is these are the people
who are obsessed with our differences.

1329
01:11:45,571 --> 01:11:48,810
And they want us to be exactly the
same at the same time because they're,

1330
01:11:48,811 --> 01:11:52,020
their ideology has no logic. And that's
why they're so angry all the time.

1331
01:11:52,021 --> 01:11:54,680
And that's why they're so bitter and
resentful. And that's why they're,

1332
01:11:54,681 --> 01:11:58,440
they're always trying to d platform
people because they don't want to debate

1333
01:11:58,441 --> 01:11:59,274
ideas.

1334
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:03,540
So the problem with this family
guy thing is that first off,

1335
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:05,930
let's just put aside whether
family guys funny or any anymore.

1336
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:09,750
It had a couple of good years for sure.
I really respect Seth Macfarlane.

1337
01:12:09,751 --> 01:12:12,810
Basically, I like the guy, I
think he's probably a decent guy.

1338
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:16,590
He has made millions and millions,
maybe hundreds of millions of dollars.

1339
01:12:16,591 --> 01:12:20,130
I have no idea on being politically
incorrect. Think about the characters,

1340
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:24,700
the old gay child molester that always
wants to molest Chris. Uh, more,

1341
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:29,780
more. Goldman is the worst
Jewish stereotype you can
possibly imagine. Uh, the, uh,

1342
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:33,810
the other two gay guys in the show, the
episode where Peter Becomes Gay. Um,

1343
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:37,890
everything in everything in the show is a,
is an awful stereotype,

1344
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,360
but it's, it's either funny
or it's not funny, but you,

1345
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:44,760
that's up for you to decide
for them to say, ah, we've now,

1346
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:47,310
and I'm not saying Seth made this
decision specifically and by the way,

1347
01:12:47,311 --> 01:12:49,560
I've invited him on the show many times.
I would love to sit them down,

1348
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:53,860
sit down with him and I'm not judging
him specifically for this, but the, the,

1349
01:12:53,861 --> 01:12:57,570
the machine of family guy made a ton of
money being offensive to all sorts of

1350
01:12:57,571 --> 01:13:00,750
people and now you know,
we're in our twilight,

1351
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,460
nobody really cares about us anymore.
No,

1352
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:04,050
we're going to turn
against what we've done.

1353
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:07,530
This is like when you see Sarah
Silverman now chide comedians for being

1354
01:13:07,531 --> 01:13:11,040
politically incorrect or I remember
when Milo's book was coming out,

1355
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:14,520
she was a tweeting about that Simon and
Schuster should drop the books and now

1356
01:13:14,521 --> 01:13:17,820
we have comedians for getting
rid of books. That's pretty
close to book burning.

1357
01:13:17,821 --> 01:13:20,130
That's the modern sense of book burning
that has nothing to do with anyone's

1358
01:13:20,131 --> 01:13:23,990
feelings about Milo. Um, these
people have become hysterical and,

1359
01:13:23,991 --> 01:13:26,310
and the hectoring things that
they should be making fun of.

1360
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:27,930
If George Carlin was alive today,

1361
01:13:27,931 --> 01:13:30,270
what do you think George Carlin
would be doing about that? Ideas?

1362
01:13:30,271 --> 01:13:31,200
He'd be mocking them.

1363
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:34,410
Not demanding that we don't tell jokes
about certain things or we don't let

1364
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:36,110
certain people publish books now.

1365
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:37,990
That's the whole reason
I got back into stand up,

1366
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:39,780
even though it was like the
last thing that I wanted to do.

1367
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:42,570
I want people to see that you can laugh
about these things and guess what?

1368
01:13:42,571 --> 01:13:45,840
I go up there and I look around the crowd
and they make fun of everybody and in

1369
01:13:45,841 --> 01:13:48,570
that includes myself.
So I think we can fix this stuff.

1370
01:13:48,571 --> 01:13:52,140
But I think we can fix it through,
through comedy mostly. Um,

1371
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:53,730
so come out to one of my stand up shows.

1372
01:13:53,731 --> 01:13:58,530
January 30th I'll be at the Irvine Improv,
a Dave ruby.com/events uh,

1373
01:13:58,531 --> 01:14:02,790
shout out to Jason. Thank you
very much. Um, uh, super chat.

1374
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:07,020
Your biggest issue will be that
paypal, visa and mastercard. Uh,

1375
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:10,560
sorry, I want to read this correctly.
Your biggest issue will be paypal,

1376
01:14:10,561 --> 01:14:11,980
visa and mastercard that force you

1377
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,480
to shut down, not the backlash.
If you go 100% free speech,

1378
01:14:16,481 --> 01:14:19,530
no one can pay you then and that's
how you shut you down. So I,

1379
01:14:19,531 --> 01:14:20,590
I may have missed a word in there.

1380
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:23,020
Um, okay, so this is an issue, right?

1381
01:14:23,021 --> 01:14:27,340
So if right now at [inaudible] dot com
slash donate, if you use your credit card,

1382
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,610
you can donate through stripe,
which you, which is paypal,

1383
01:14:30,611 --> 01:14:32,740
you know it's credit card so you
can donate there. Any credit card.

1384
01:14:32,741 --> 01:14:34,810
It's a payment processor.
Um,

1385
01:14:34,811 --> 01:14:37,390
I have no reason to think that
stripe is going to get rid of me,

1386
01:14:37,391 --> 01:14:39,160
although they have gotten
rid of some other people.

1387
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:40,870
But I have no reason to think
that's gonna happen to me.

1388
01:14:40,871 --> 01:14:43,610
But this isn't just
about me, obviously. Um,

1389
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:46,360
I have no reason to think that paypal
is going to get rid of me. And again,

1390
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:48,520
if just think about this for a second,

1391
01:14:48,521 --> 01:14:52,960
let's pretend you're right and you might
be right. If we're really worried that,

1392
01:14:52,961 --> 01:14:54,340
that someone like me,
let's say,

1393
01:14:54,341 --> 01:14:58,300
could actually potentially be stopped
from making financial transactions in the

1394
01:14:58,301 --> 01:14:58,811
United States,

1395
01:14:58,811 --> 01:15:01,840
then then think about the level of
tyranny we're really talking about.

1396
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,060
And if you're saying that's here now,
well then again,

1397
01:15:04,061 --> 01:15:07,810
we better start talking about
this shit and fast. So, um,

1398
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,960
I do think the answer is
partly lies within crypto.

1399
01:15:10,961 --> 01:15:14,850
We are now taking bitcoin on
right there below, uh, paypal and,

1400
01:15:14,851 --> 01:15:18,670
and the credit card thing. You can see
our bitcoin wallet, it's on there. Uh,

1401
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:19,750
and as I said, we're, we're,

1402
01:15:19,751 --> 01:15:22,720
I'm also talking to a whole bunch of
other payment processors. There's ways,

1403
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:27,610
there's creative ways people have figured
out to do all sorts of commerce online

1404
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:30,280
and we're exploring all of those options.
So hang tight.

1405
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:33,760
But if you are right and
if you're watching this and
you think that that guy's

1406
01:15:33,761 --> 01:15:37,850
comment might be right then man, we better
fix this quick. Otherwise we're, we're

1407
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:41,470
really, we're far more screwed
than you might think. Uh, okay.

1408
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:46,750
Um, I donated $5 a month and I
didn't get a shout out. I'm sad now.

1409
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:50,620
Anyway. Best shooter ever is radiant
silver gun. It was a Saturn game.

1410
01:15:50,621 --> 01:15:54,880
I missed the Sega Saturn. Um, we
were doing shout outs. If you do it,

1411
01:15:54,881 --> 01:15:56,410
I'd Dave rubin.com/donate.

1412
01:15:56,411 --> 01:15:58,960
So you might've done it on super chat
cause that's where I just saw that.

1413
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:02,590
So I don't, unfortunately,
I don't know your name. He
didn't say it there. Uh, okay.

1414
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:06,730
Let's see. Let's see. Any News
on the Patriot and replacement?

1415
01:16:06,731 --> 01:16:08,200
My whole platoon at Fort Bliss,

1416
01:16:08,201 --> 01:16:12,340
Texas is wondering when you will
be in Texas next. Well, first off,

1417
01:16:12,341 --> 01:16:14,240
thank you guys for your service.
Most importantly,

1418
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:18,770
um, did a whole bunch of shows what
you are in in Texas. Um, we did Dallas,

1419
01:16:18,771 --> 01:16:21,320
we did San Antonio, which I loved.
I had never been there before.

1420
01:16:21,321 --> 01:16:24,440
I've been to Dallas a bunch
of times. Um, we did Houston,

1421
01:16:24,441 --> 01:16:27,020
which was really cool to be,
and it was humid as fuck.

1422
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:31,790
There it is hot in the summer in Houston.
Um, I will definitely be back there.

1423
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:34,850
I think I'm going to do a public event
with a, with Glenn Beck at some point,

1424
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:38,570
probably in the Dallas area, and I
should look into doing some standup in a,

1425
01:16:38,571 --> 01:16:43,010
in Texas. So hang tight on that. Uh,
okay. Let's see. Where are we at?

1426
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:47,000
Please tell me we dropped at least two
people. You're killing me here. People.

1427
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:48,260
What do we got on Patrion?

1428
01:16:48,261 --> 01:16:53,261
Right now we're at one seven
1,755 I'm clicking refresh.

1429
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:58,210
All right. That's what I'm
talking about. Dropped six people,

1430
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:01,540
but our money went up.
Our money went up.

1431
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,350
Am I correct?
I am correct.

1432
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:09,270
What was our money up before? And we
just went up like 1000 bucks on Patrion.

1433
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,153
What the,

1434
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:14,810
this is the Internet. This is as
internally as it gets. This is,

1435
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:15,800
this is the Internet.

1436
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:20,690
I am trying to lose money on Patriot
and our money on Patrion is going up.

1437
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,033
Hmm.

1438
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:32,790
You're funny. Whoever you did, whoever
you are, and I'm assuming it's one person

1439
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:38,890
points for you. You know what?
You know what? This is messed up.

1440
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:40,060
I don't want to do this,

1441
01:17:40,061 --> 01:17:42,730
but just because the person's
that's a high level of troll.

1442
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:46,060
Who puts their money where their
mouth is. We, we know who it is.

1443
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:48,730
We'll figure it out because you donate
it on Patrion so we get an email.

1444
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:53,320
I'm giving you a mug even though that's
really messed up. You're getting a mug.

1445
01:17:53,321 --> 01:17:56,560
You're motherfucker. All right.
There you go. You're getting a mug.

1446
01:17:56,590 --> 01:18:00,640
The money's going up. The
ridiculous. All right guys.

1447
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:04,360
We've got about 40 minutes left
I a little bit before seven.

1448
01:18:04,361 --> 01:18:08,260
I will delete Patriot and no
matter I can be a $25,000 a month.

1449
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,600
We're going to delete this thing.
Uh,

1450
01:18:10,601 --> 01:18:14,800
I do not know what to say to
people like you. Um, let's see.

1451
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:18,580
Uh,
th the book,

1452
01:18:18,581 --> 01:18:20,530
the coddling of the American
mind is an amazing book.

1453
01:18:20,531 --> 01:18:23,170
It's a must read during these
times. While I've had a, Oh,

1454
01:18:23,171 --> 01:18:25,150
that's Jonathan Haidt who I've
had on the show years ago.

1455
01:18:25,151 --> 01:18:27,400
We almost had them back on two weeks ago.
He was in la,

1456
01:18:27,401 --> 01:18:30,430
but we couldn't quite work it out.
I will definitely get him back on.

1457
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:35,370
Hang on that, uh, March in. Thank you.
Is that my old friend marching from,

1458
01:18:35,371 --> 01:18:37,450
from New York. Could that
be, could that be him?

1459
01:18:37,451 --> 01:18:42,190
I used to have an old buddy marching,
m a R C I n in New York. Is that him?

1460
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:46,270
Could that be you? You gotta sign Mug my
friend. Oh, I think you just did a shadow,

1461
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:49,010
but you know what? You're
probably getting a mug. Uh,

1462
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:53,800
cause I read that off the wrong
thing. Uh, okay. Let's see.

1463
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:58,660
Um, uh, $99 and 99 cents.

1464
01:18:58,661 --> 01:19:03,490
Take a shot. Love you Dave. Mad
respect. You know what? For doing 99, 99

1465
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:11,240
shot a patroned for you. There
you go. We don't mess around here.

1466
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:16,160
This is a pretty big shot. Glass to a. All
right, we're going to get a little salt.

1467
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:19,280
Here we go.
All right.

1468
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,560
Little Salt. Oh, patrol.

1469
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:36,720
I like Tequila. I do like Tequila. I'm a,

1470
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:41,130
I'm a red wine drinker. As most of you
guys really know. I like Napa reds mostly.

1471
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:45,740
Um, or northern calorie reds. Um, oh,

1472
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:48,480
I really like Italian reds lately,
so I really only drink wine,

1473
01:19:48,481 --> 01:19:52,440
but I do like Tequila when
it, when it comes around. Um,

1474
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:53,880
I think it's a different Martin,

1475
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:57,060
he was known as Martin even
though it was Marson or marching,

1476
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:01,590
but I believe it's a different
marching. But hello march.
And how are you? Um, okay.

1477
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:06,320
Uh, bad boys. Pistons versus up and
coming Bowles was my favorite NBA time.

1478
01:20:06,321 --> 01:20:08,550
Made you laugh?
The Ginger Mary

1479
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:12,960
a question. That was the point. All
right. There you go. Uh, yeah. You know,

1480
01:20:12,961 --> 01:20:16,260
I hated those pistons. The
bad boys Pistons. They to
me, that was in basketball.

1481
01:20:16,261 --> 01:20:19,710
I hated bill Laimbeer.
They also beat my blazers in 1990,

1482
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:21,300
which was a very underrated series.

1483
01:20:21,301 --> 01:20:24,180
All the games were within two or
three points. And one of the Games,

1484
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:29,100
I think it was game three, the
game three, it was game mode.

1485
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:30,510
I think it was game four or five.

1486
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:34,800
Danny young who is a scrub backup on the
blazers. He hit a shot at half court,

1487
01:20:34,801 --> 01:20:39,020
that would've got the game into overtime.
That A, they waved off at the Buzzer. Uh,

1488
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:43,110
but it was a, it was a great
series. Um, shout out to Ricardo.

1489
01:20:43,111 --> 01:20:47,910
Welcome on board Ricardo. Um, let's see.

1490
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:50,430
Uh,
is Ian McGilchrist on your radar yet?

1491
01:20:50,431 --> 01:20:53,640
His book is enlightening in the way it
explores how we're divided brain alters

1492
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:58,050
behavior, culture and society. Given
the name sounds vaguely familiar. Um,

1493
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:02,490
but I can't say he fully has. Guys, can
we put Ian Mcgilchrist on the list? Um,

1494
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:07,440
100 bucks. This is the weirdest
pledge drive I've ever seen. Lol.

1495
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:13,830
This is, I'm trying to lose money
in effect at some level, I suppose.

1496
01:21:13,831 --> 01:21:16,590
And we're gaining, if I press this right
now and there's more money in there,

1497
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,780
I'm actually going to punch the camera.
Here we go.

1498
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:25,230
We have 1,749 patrons,
$10,620.

1499
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,740
All right, let's see it
drop. Let's see it drop.

1500
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:34,350
Wait a minute. What happened
there? We lost five.

1501
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:39,150
We lost $5 people. That's what
I'm talking about. Lost $5.

1502
01:21:39,151 --> 01:21:43,770
How many people did we lose their
couple of people. We lost $5.

1503
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:46,440
Whatever you do please,
people,

1504
01:21:46,441 --> 01:21:50,280
I implore you for the sake of free speech
in America for the future of the First

1505
01:21:50,281 --> 01:21:53,640
Amendment, do not donate a
patrion.com/ruben report. I'm deleting it.

1506
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:57,960
Don't go there. Go there to delete,
but don't go there for anything else.

1507
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:02,100
We got in this thing. It's a nightmare.
A shout out to Kim. Thank you very much,

1508
01:22:02,101 --> 01:22:03,990
Kim.
Uh,

1509
01:22:03,991 --> 01:22:07,890
I'm starting to wish you chose January
for your annual social media blackout.

1510
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:11,130
That's funny. That's funny. I do
August off the grid. You know,

1511
01:22:11,131 --> 01:22:13,380
I'm going to really push
I think this year, uh,

1512
01:22:13,381 --> 01:22:18,360
as many people as possible to join me
on this thing. I do a 30 day cleanse.

1513
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:21,780
I mean, that's the only way I can describe
it. Completely off the grid. No phone.

1514
01:22:21,781 --> 01:22:26,070
I locked my phone in a safe, which I
don't know the code to a no television,

1515
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:28,140
which it's almost impossible
to avoid television.

1516
01:22:28,141 --> 01:22:30,180
It's really hard to avoid news because,
hey,

1517
01:22:30,181 --> 01:22:32,310
you got to tell everybody that
you're not listening to the news.

1518
01:22:32,311 --> 01:22:35,190
Because I try not to get anything
in my brain during that, you know,

1519
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,091
I'm doing other things,

1520
01:22:36,091 --> 01:22:39,180
but I try not to get the day to day
news in my brain because it's just,

1521
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:42,030
we're just endlessly hit with information.

1522
01:22:42,031 --> 01:22:45,840
I don't think this is the way we were
always wired to be. Maybe it's the future,

1523
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:47,460
it's the next evolution of being a human.

1524
01:22:47,461 --> 01:22:50,340
But I don't think it's supposed
to be like this all the time. Um,

1525
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:53,820
but I realized the hardest part of being
off the grid is that everywhere that

1526
01:22:53,821 --> 01:22:58,470
there is a muted television,
there is CNN, every airport,

1527
01:22:58,471 --> 01:23:02,850
muted television, CNN, every burger,
joint, muted television, CNN,

1528
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,260
you go to the gym, you did
television, CNN, if you will.

1529
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:09,850
I don't know that anyone's listening
to CNN with the words, which would be,

1530
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:14,440
it's hilarious if you
do. Um, but, uh, yeah,

1531
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,450
I highly recommend doing a
little off the grid thing.

1532
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:19,900
I try to do it on the weekends too,
to the best degree that I can. Not as,

1533
01:23:19,901 --> 01:23:22,660
not as strictly as I did in, in
August, but this, this August.

1534
01:23:22,661 --> 01:23:25,300
I think I'm going to try to get as
many people as possible to do it.

1535
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:29,090
A shout out to Keith. What are we
doing here guys? Quick reset. Uh,

1536
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:31,840
we're moving everybody off patrion
and we're trying to get people to Dave

1537
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:36,520
rubin.com/donate it is the first of
about five steps over the next couple of

1538
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,660
months that I'm doing.

1539
01:23:37,661 --> 01:23:41,440
Two just to get true independence to
have true sort of ownership over our

1540
01:23:41,441 --> 01:23:43,540
content and audience and the rest of it,

1541
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:47,020
we're going to remain fully funded
by you guys, which is fantastic.

1542
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:51,250
I have no boss, no one has ever told
me anything to do or say on this show.

1543
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:53,470
We do what we want.
I do what I think is right for,

1544
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:56,230
for all the positives and
negatives of all of that.

1545
01:23:56,380 --> 01:24:00,250
So we are doing a little fundraising
here today and then deleting Patrion 25

1546
01:24:00,251 --> 01:24:02,890
bucks. You're getting the last
remaining Ruben report. Uh,

1547
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:05,380
Patriot on select tee shirts and a,

1548
01:24:05,381 --> 01:24:09,580
I'm going to sign a Mug for
ya for $50 or more. A month.

1549
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:13,560
Shout out to Raymond. Thank
you very much. Hey Dave,

1550
01:24:13,561 --> 01:24:15,520
is Gillette the best a man can get?

1551
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:20,230
I mean Juliette's like I've just had it
with you people. You know what I mean?

1552
01:24:20,231 --> 01:24:24,370
It's like you don't have to turn on half
the people to bow to the social justice

1553
01:24:24,371 --> 01:24:28,000
God.
You don't have to make men look toxic and,

1554
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:31,720
and it's just ridiculous.
Pandering idiocy. And you know,

1555
01:24:31,721 --> 01:24:34,240
it's interesting there's
this meme of go get woke,

1556
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:36,730
go broke implying that the companies
are going to fail because of this.

1557
01:24:36,731 --> 01:24:38,140
I don't know that that's actually true.

1558
01:24:38,141 --> 01:24:40,030
Maybe they are making more
money because of this,

1559
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:42,340
but it's not good and it's not right.
And guess what?

1560
01:24:42,341 --> 01:24:46,930
I don't give a shit about the politics
of the company. I get my razors from,

1561
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:50,260
although I can tell you that going forward
I would go out of my way not to buy a

1562
01:24:50,261 --> 01:24:54,250
Gillette product for sure. It's
like Ben and Jerry's did that, uh,

1563
01:24:54,251 --> 01:24:58,330
resist ice cream. I don't even think Ben
and Jerry's is that good anymore. Um,

1564
01:24:58,331 --> 01:25:00,450
I really like McConnell's ice cream,
which is a,

1565
01:25:00,451 --> 01:25:04,170
a creamery in Santa Barbara up here. I
don't know that they're all over. They're,

1566
01:25:04,171 --> 01:25:04,901
they're nationwide,

1567
01:25:04,901 --> 01:25:09,610
but if you live in the California area
and probably west coast Mcconnell's ice

1568
01:25:09,611 --> 01:25:10,660
cream is awesome.
They got a,

1569
01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:14,560
they got a cookies and cream
that is fantastic and a sea
salt something or other.

1570
01:25:14,561 --> 01:25:17,290
That is amazing. But anyway,
it's like, all right,

1571
01:25:17,291 --> 01:25:20,170
if you guys are putting all in that
we're going in Hashtag resist. It's like,

1572
01:25:20,171 --> 01:25:22,660
I just don't want to give you my money.
And then people will say, well Dave,

1573
01:25:22,661 --> 01:25:24,920
you're a hypocrite because
you still eat a chick filet.

1574
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:27,790
It was like Chick-fil-a isn't putting,
we're four.

1575
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:29,950
We're against gay marriage
on their chicken sandwiches.

1576
01:25:29,951 --> 01:25:34,090
The owner once gave a couple of hundred
bucks to some anti gay marriage thing or

1577
01:25:34,091 --> 01:25:36,400
something to that effect.
It's like, who cares?

1578
01:25:36,401 --> 01:25:39,790
People are allowed to do private things
in their private lives and it's like you

1579
01:25:39,791 --> 01:25:43,780
guys think that if you could only control
the way everybody thinks and the way

1580
01:25:43,781 --> 01:25:44,591
everyone behaves,

1581
01:25:44,591 --> 01:25:47,350
that the world would be better and I
think the world would actually be much

1582
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:47,920
worse.

1583
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:51,700
I don't care what anyone does or thinks
as long as they don't do it to me or on

1584
01:25:51,701 --> 01:25:54,160
my property, just don't touch
me. That's really all I ask.

1585
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:59,340
Let's go to Patrion and watch this thing
dump out because I know you people are

1586
01:25:59,561 --> 01:26:00,550
canceling for me.

1587
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:05,120
So right now we're at
1,747 were at $10,615

1588
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,740
please have dropped.

1589
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:10,240
We're up $52

1590
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:13,473
look,

1591
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:18,530
I get what the Internet is. You
know I get it. You're funny.

1592
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:24,200
You're funny people having a good time.
You know watching the livestream,

1593
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:28,130
you know watching the youtube or
do youtube, you're killing me.

1594
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:32,000
I have to leave this thing.
I have to go.

1595
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:36,410
Please stop putting money there. You
think this is funny. This is funny.

1596
01:26:36,411 --> 01:26:37,250
This is my life.

1597
01:26:40,130 --> 01:26:44,510
50 bucks on super chat. Signed
the Mug to my wife. Just fee fee.

1598
01:26:44,511 --> 01:26:48,230
So you in Orlando and loved it and Doby
was slammed that Tequila like we do in

1599
01:26:48,231 --> 01:26:51,740
Texas.
All right fee you're getting a mug fees.

1600
01:26:51,741 --> 01:26:54,910
Getting a mug fee is a great lady fee.

1601
01:26:55,690 --> 01:26:58,780
F E and I'm putting an
exclamation point for her.

1602
01:26:58,781 --> 01:27:02,380
Cause I feel good about fee
and I'm signing in the Mug. Uh,

1603
01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:05,410
that Orlando show was one of my favorite
shows. I, I say it, all of that.

1604
01:27:05,410 --> 01:27:07,900
A lot of the shows that I use,
and I do mean it when I say it,

1605
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:11,650
that Orlando show is fantastic.
That theater was gorgeous.
I think those Disney,

1606
01:27:11,651 --> 01:27:13,120
it was like the Disney something theater.

1607
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:16,600
I think the Disney people are going
to be okay financially by the way. Um,

1608
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:18,820
that was a great, great,
great, great show.

1609
01:27:18,821 --> 01:27:21,130
We did four shows in four
nights in Florida and that,

1610
01:27:21,131 --> 01:27:24,640
that Orlando one has stuck the
ones that really stuck out with me.

1611
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:29,020
The Atlanta one, cause it was Jordan's
birthday. Uh, Orlando was amazing.

1612
01:27:29,290 --> 01:27:32,160
Grand rapids, Michigan I think might've
been the best show we did. And,

1613
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:36,100
and the first time we were in Calgary
we blew the roof off the place.

1614
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:40,330
It was actually legitimately crazy.
It was, it was bananas. Mockers.

1615
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:44,470
Shout out terrain, man. Thank
you very much. Okay. Um,

1616
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:49,210
thanks for standing on principle
Dave. Yeah, my pleasure.

1617
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:53,440
Um, do you think there is hope to
end this far left path that we're on?

1618
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:56,800
First of all, I got to take
some water. I'm choking so

1619
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:02,960
I cannot believe people are still
donating to patriot. This is like,

1620
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:06,260
I feel like I'm in green. I'm going to
actually you an episode of Black Mirror.

1621
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,530
This is black mirror. This is it.
We're in Bandersnatch right now.

1622
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:13,730
You guys are picking my future. You know
what I mean? Like we're, this is bananas.

1623
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:18,860
Um, the question was, um,

1624
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:22,760
what the hell was the question?
Oh, there was a question there.

1625
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,640
What,
what?

1626
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:32,440
It's there. Ah, do you think there's,

1627
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,300
there's an end to the far
left path where I look,

1628
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:38,800
this thing has to implode
one way or another.

1629
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:42,190
The question is how bad will it get
before it implodes and how much power it

1630
01:28:42,191 --> 01:28:46,900
will attain before it implodes. The that
is, that is the true question here. When,

1631
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:51,950
when Cortez or some of these people talk
about 70% marginal tax rate and then

1632
01:28:52,001 --> 01:28:55,150
people scream all that, they should
have it and your role, they don't,

1633
01:28:55,151 --> 01:28:58,000
they're not going to take 70% of your
money. They mean above $10 million. Now,

1634
01:28:58,001 --> 01:29:02,070
let's pretend now I don't
make $10 million. I don't
make $1 million a year. Let's

1635
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:06,540
pretend for a second that, um,
that you made $10 million a year.

1636
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,420
Let's pretend you made $20 million
person watching this right now.

1637
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:13,050
You figured out how to do something.
You created something of value,

1638
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:17,940
something you made up a product. You made
a candy bar, you made a video game, you,

1639
01:29:17,941 --> 01:29:21,600
you sold a wine. You are an
incredibly successful locksmith.

1640
01:29:21,601 --> 01:29:25,110
Whatever the hell you are,
you're not making $15 million a year.

1641
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:28,770
Now basically the federal government,
when you're making that much money,

1642
01:29:28,771 --> 01:29:32,370
you're in the top 1%. Let's say, um,
I'm just doing rough numbers here.

1643
01:29:32,371 --> 01:29:36,960
The government is going to tax you at
basically 37% right now at that point.

1644
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:39,180
Now, if you own your own business,
you can write off some stuff.

1645
01:29:39,181 --> 01:29:42,510
And let's say you can get that down to
about 30% what she's proposing is that

1646
01:29:42,511 --> 01:29:47,511
over $10 million that you take in the
government should take 70% of that now for

1647
01:29:48,901 --> 01:29:53,730
young people and the Socialists crew
of America, that all sounds good.

1648
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:58,470
You don't need that money. You don't
deserve that money. You didn't build that.

1649
01:29:58,471 --> 01:30:03,210
All of those things and it just
sounds right. It sounds right,

1650
01:30:03,211 --> 01:30:06,900
like you should give back more.
Why do you need that much money?

1651
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:11,730
Except that has nothing to do
with truth or what's right.

1652
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:15,660
What right does someone
have because they feel,

1653
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:20,370
because some government bureaucrat
feels that they should take from you who

1654
01:30:20,371 --> 01:30:24,840
created to give to someone who did not
create, even if their intentions are good,

1655
01:30:24,990 --> 01:30:28,380
what gives them the right to do it?
I would say they have no right to do it,

1656
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:33,590
but this is the new left and some would
argue this is the old left like some old

1657
01:30:33,631 --> 01:30:36,570
school gave me. I think if Prager was
sitting here or Shapiro, they'd say,

1658
01:30:36,571 --> 01:30:37,860
this is what it always was.

1659
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:40,980
I don't know that it always was this
way because I think there used to be a

1660
01:30:40,981 --> 01:30:44,430
decent left. And I think it's important
that we have a decent left once again.

1661
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:50,370
Um, this is a horrible set of ideas and
that's not just the only part of this,

1662
01:30:50,371 --> 01:30:53,700
that's a horrible set of ideas. The
fact that Tamika allow, uh, Mallory,

1663
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:57,090
who was one of the leaders of the
women's March, was on the view yesterday,

1664
01:30:57,100 --> 01:31:00,720
the day before and couldn't
condemn outright. Louis Farrakhan,

1665
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:05,010
who calls Jews cockroaches and a zillion
other things. And he's also met with,

1666
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,760
um, what's her name up in California. Um,

1667
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:13,100
the other Congress woman, I'm blanking
on her name for a second. Um, and all,

1668
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:17,310
all of these people, they're in
bed with a lot of bad people. Um,

1669
01:31:17,311 --> 01:31:21,900
and you can see this thing coming in a
judges us all in our worst ways and it,

1670
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:25,530
and it believes, it believes that
the state is the ultimate power.

1671
01:31:25,531 --> 01:31:29,320
And think of the irony of this. Trump
is in charge. These are the pain,

1672
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:32,880
the same people who think that
Trump is a Russian asset and that,

1673
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:35,070
and if you agree that
Trump is a Russian asset,

1674
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:37,440
and I say this as someone that
did not even vote for Trump,

1675
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:39,780
but if you believe that
Trump is a Russian asset,

1676
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,600
you actually think were
world war three right now.

1677
01:31:42,601 --> 01:31:46,200
What could be a higher declaration
of war than having the,

1678
01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:48,930
having installed the president
of the United States?

1679
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:52,770
So if you think it's a good idea that
we should impeach the president or

1680
01:31:52,771 --> 01:31:53,820
something to that effect,

1681
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:57,450
or if you think really that Russia
installed the president of United States,

1682
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,840
then understand what the pat, what you
believe is the path to world war three.

1683
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:05,710
Now, if they did install the
president then all right,

1684
01:32:05,711 --> 01:32:09,040
I guess we're on path to world war
three or could this just be a bunch of

1685
01:32:09,041 --> 01:32:12,190
paranoid lunacy for a bunch of people
who were in power, in lost power.

1686
01:32:12,430 --> 01:32:17,410
And that's why I would say that the best
answer to any of this is limited power

1687
01:32:17,710 --> 01:32:21,070
limit power. And that what that
means is that when your guys empower,

1688
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:25,870
not that much will change, but guess what?
It's pretty damn good in America. Yeah,

1689
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:26,823
it is.

1690
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:29,790
And then what that also means is when
the guy that you don't like is empowered,

1691
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:32,740
not that much bad can change. And guess
what? It's pretty good in America.

1692
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:36,970
So that's the negotiation to live
in a free, stable Western society.

1693
01:32:36,971 --> 01:32:40,720
You can move on the margins. But when,
when Cortez gets out there and says,

1694
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:44,760
I'm going to tax these people at 70%
and says to Joe Lieberman, who this,

1695
01:32:44,770 --> 01:32:46,780
you're the future.
You're the past.

1696
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:52,170
It's like you think that basically a
bartender thinks that she knows how to run

1697
01:32:53,741 --> 01:32:54,970
the world.
And by the way,

1698
01:32:54,971 --> 01:32:58,000
if you think that she's the one really
tweeting all of this stuff or that there

1699
01:32:58,001 --> 01:33:01,450
isn't a whole congregation of people
that decide what she can tweet,

1700
01:33:01,451 --> 01:33:03,130
I think you're sorely mistaken.
But again,

1701
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:07,780
I will 100% be glad to interview her and
treat her with the exact same respect I

1702
01:33:07,781 --> 01:33:11,620
would treat any other guests. We will air
it live. I won't even do use questions.

1703
01:33:11,621 --> 01:33:14,470
I will sit here with nothing and
other than myself and talk to her.

1704
01:33:14,471 --> 01:33:15,700
I would be happy to do that.
Okay,

1705
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:18,730
let's go back to the patriarchy
thing and please, for God's sakes,

1706
01:33:18,731 --> 01:33:22,210
people please tell me there's no more
money there. This is a nightmare.

1707
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:23,440
We're in black mirror.

1708
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:28,590
We have 1,740 by below 10,666 $7

1709
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:34,000
oh, you mother fuckers. This
is fucked up. All right. We're,

1710
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:36,840
we're entering a fucked up bays.
Okay. That's where we're at.

1711
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:40,890
We're getting to a place where this is
not good and nobody's happy about this,

1712
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:48,370
Huh? Huh, Huh? Uh, it's
not good. It's not. What?

1713
01:33:48,371 --> 01:33:51,410
Why are you doing this?
This is the Internet.

1714
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:56,030
This is the Internet. We're here.
We're on the Internet. We're doing it.

1715
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:59,960
I'm trying to cancel this thing.
I don't like this company.

1716
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:02,120
I don't want them to
have any more success.

1717
01:34:02,330 --> 01:34:05,810
I'm trying to stick a line in the sand
and you people think it's hilarious.

1718
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:11,180
You people, well, Juliette, you're
getting a mug. Thank you very much,

1719
01:34:11,181 --> 01:34:16,181
and thank you for donating@daverubin.com
slash donate instead of Patrion.

1720
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:20,360
They're no good.
They don't like free speech.

1721
01:34:20,630 --> 01:34:24,740
They're getting 5% of your money. You
people who are doing this now to be funny,

1722
01:34:25,190 --> 01:34:28,460
we got 24 more minutes and then I'm
pressing delete on this freaking thing.

1723
01:34:29,850 --> 01:34:31,670
Super Chat.
200 bucks.

1724
01:34:31,671 --> 01:34:35,090
They want me to do a shot day by enjoyably
spent hours trying to figure out what

1725
01:34:35,091 --> 01:34:37,970
is going on within each of your
studios. Paintings. I love them.

1726
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:42,740
I love hearing that. So, so all of
my paintings are not all of them,

1727
01:34:42,741 --> 01:34:45,110
but most of the paintings. So this
one right here, which is a great,

1728
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:48,470
it's about three foot by five
foot. Uh, this is an original,

1729
01:34:48,471 --> 01:34:51,080
this is an absolute original.
This is done by Caitlin. Janet.

1730
01:34:51,081 --> 01:34:55,190
You can go to Kaitlyn rose,
Janet see a y l I n rows,

1731
01:34:55,191 --> 01:34:57,980
janet.com.
She's an artist who has

1732
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:00,920
done some amazing stuff, uh, in my house.

1733
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:04,400
Almost everything in my house is from her.
This painting,

1734
01:35:04,401 --> 01:35:09,140
which we commissioned just for,
uh, just for the set obviously, um,

1735
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:13,100
is, Eh, I wish I could explain it in
a proper sense. If you go to her site,

1736
01:35:13,101 --> 01:35:16,520
I think you, she explains the process
there. She knows how much I love coffee.

1737
01:35:16,521 --> 01:35:19,040
So there's actual coffee
grinds in the painting,

1738
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:21,350
which is what's giving it some
of the texture over there.

1739
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:24,020
And I wanted something that
felt a little futuristically.

1740
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:25,970
So that's why you're
getting those stark lines.

1741
01:35:25,971 --> 01:35:29,600
And then I want it to feel like a little
bit less, sort of like the universe and,

1742
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:33,980
and sort of messy and, and interesting.
So, hey, that's her in it. Aaron,

1743
01:35:33,981 --> 01:35:37,950
if we can go to the guests shot right
now, the regular guest shot, uh,

1744
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:39,980
the painting on the other side.
If we can go to that one.

1745
01:35:39,981 --> 01:35:43,970
I'm not sure we can right now. We
can't go to that one right now. Oh,

1746
01:35:43,971 --> 01:35:46,550
we can't write because we moved
the camera. That's right. Um,

1747
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:49,760
she did the one on the other side that
you'd normally see behind the guests head.

1748
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,240
I'm also on her site. You can see
she, we, she did an incredible,

1749
01:35:53,241 --> 01:35:56,420
it's four foot by five foot,
um,

1750
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:59,390
hyperspace so the Millennium
Falcon going into hyperspace,

1751
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:02,540
she did an original forest.
She painted it over days in our house,

1752
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,730
which was a freaking crazy labor of love.

1753
01:36:04,731 --> 01:36:08,500
She had to make a protractor using
a string in a piece of wood. Uh,

1754
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:11,750
she's an incredible, incredible arts and
you get principal all of these on there.

1755
01:36:11,751 --> 01:36:14,780
I don't get a penny for him and she's
just wonderful artists. I, Kaitlyn rose,

1756
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:19,480
jan.com. Okay. Um, you know what you,

1757
01:36:19,490 --> 01:36:22,280
because you asked about the paintings,
he gave 200 bucks. All right,

1758
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:23,240
I'm going to do a shot.

1759
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:28,450
I hope you're happy and please people
stop donating at patrion.com/rubin report.

1760
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:32,570
I've got a life to live. I've got to
end this thing and this nightmare,

1761
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,810
this Bandersnatch now, I
mean a, I mean it's the,

1762
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:36,560
I mean this is what the Internet is.

1763
01:36:36,561 --> 01:36:39,350
I'm in the choose your own adventure
venture of the Internet. All right,

1764
01:36:39,351 --> 01:36:42,620
here we go. All right. You want the
other guy wanted me to do this fast.

1765
01:36:42,621 --> 01:36:46,400
So here we go. Here's this
like we do it in Texas. Is that

1766
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:53,220
there's that.
There's that.

1767
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:55,350
All right.
Love you Dave.

1768
01:36:56,190 --> 01:36:59,040
Super Chat. I love you Daniel.
You're getting a shout out,

mug. Please come back to Atlanta soon.

1770
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:07,800
How'd I do that? That was pretty good.
Hook a brother. He's a B. R. O. T. H. J.

1771
01:37:07,801 --> 01:37:11,850
Hook a brother at the, I'd

studios and things like that.

1775
01:37:19,591 --> 01:37:23,070
We got him here to a super jack. Thanks
for standing on principle, Dave. Yeah.

1776
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:25,080
You know what?
I guess what's cool actually right now,

1777
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,500
despite the fact that people
keep giving me money on Patrion,

1778
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:28,590
even though I asked you not to,

1779
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:32,540
is that I'm standing over
something that I believe in. I'm a,

1780
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:35,760
I'm having a ton of fun right now. This
is kind of fun and I'm a little drunk,

1781
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:40,080
but like beyond all of that, it's
like, guess what? When you stay,

1782
01:37:40,081 --> 01:37:44,220
this is what I quoted Douglas before.
When you dare get in the pool,

1783
01:37:44,221 --> 01:37:48,600
you might find out that the water's not
that cold. And that I think is the truth.

1784
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:50,160
I think what you guys
are seeing right now,

1785
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:55,110
I've got people all over the world in
super chats and kind of unpatriotic you

1786
01:37:55,111 --> 01:37:55,944
motherfuckers and,

1787
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:59,400
and all over the place that are,
that are giving me money, having fun,

1788
01:37:59,401 --> 01:38:02,190
enjoying watching this. And it's just
because I stood up for what I believe.

1789
01:38:02,191 --> 01:38:05,700
And I think you can do it too.
Like maybe the truth does set you free.

1790
01:38:05,701 --> 01:38:09,630
Who somebody must have said that,
right? Somebody said that. Um, Dave,

1791
01:38:09,631 --> 01:38:10,441
serious question.

1792
01:38:10,441 --> 01:38:13,380
Are there any creators on Patrion that
you're disappointed having joined the

1793
01:38:13,381 --> 01:38:17,340
patriarch purge? Um, no,

1794
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:21,690
no. Go the answer to know everyone
has their own considerations.

1795
01:38:21,691 --> 01:38:22,830
I want to be very clear about that.

1796
01:38:22,831 --> 01:38:25,380
Someone tweeted me about this
today and I retweeted with comment.

1797
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:28,050
Someone said something to
the effect of, Oh, you know,

1798
01:38:28,051 --> 01:38:30,930
Sam Harris deleted his
immediately and you and Jordan,

1799
01:38:30,931 --> 01:38:33,120
it's been a couple of weeks and you're
tweeting about it and blah, blah blah.

1800
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:36,990
And it's like I, first off, I think
you guys know my feelings about Sam.

1801
01:38:36,991 --> 01:38:38,040
I have nothing but respect for him.

1802
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:40,680
He's a good friend and I have
admiration and love for the guy.

1803
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:44,550
I don't know exactly what his business
considerations are. So he was able to,

1804
01:38:44,551 --> 01:38:47,970
I don't know what his personal finances
are or anything or anything else. I just,

1805
01:38:47,990 --> 01:38:52,530
I I genuinely don't know for as well as
I know him. He deleted his on principle.

1806
01:38:52,531 --> 01:38:55,050
I have truly nothing but respect for that.

1807
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:59,190
I have a different situation here in that
I have a company that I'm running that

1808
01:38:59,191 --> 01:39:03,120
most of the money of the income from the
company was coming from our fan funding.

1809
01:39:03,150 --> 01:39:05,460
Okay.
So we have different considerations.

1810
01:39:05,461 --> 01:39:07,200
Jordan has different
considerations as well.

1811
01:39:07,201 --> 01:39:10,200
You guys have different feelings about
all of us about where you want to spend

1812
01:39:10,201 --> 01:39:14,040
your hard earned money and I do believe
it is your hard earned money. Um,

1813
01:39:14,041 --> 01:39:15,480
so anyone that's on there,

1814
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:19,470
whether Brett staying on there right
now or Colin staying on their sword and

1815
01:39:19,471 --> 01:39:21,750
scales on their whole bunch of
other people I think are doing,

1816
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:25,110
doing good stuff and trying to fight the
fight the same way that I'm trying to

1817
01:39:25,111 --> 01:39:27,870
fight it for all I know.
Maybe Jordan and I leaving,

1818
01:39:27,871 --> 01:39:29,730
maybe the people at Patriot on right now,
look,

1819
01:39:29,731 --> 01:39:32,910
I know a bunch of cowards and error,
probably looking around going, oh,

1820
01:39:32,911 --> 01:39:34,470
I hope nobody notices that.

1821
01:39:34,471 --> 01:39:39,180
I actually liked Dave and Jordan and I'm
not a programmed robot in an NPC, but,

1822
01:39:39,181 --> 01:39:42,420
but there are people there
that are probably happy that
the headache of Peterson

1823
01:39:42,421 --> 01:39:44,940
and Ruben and Harris has gone.
Um,

1824
01:39:45,330 --> 01:39:49,260
but I don't make my decisions based on
who might think I'm a headache. So, um,

1825
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,460
so that's that.
And as I said,

1826
01:39:50,461 --> 01:39:53,670
maybe those guys will be able to change
things from the inside. You anything,

1827
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:57,150
anything that's a movement
that that matters. Um,

1828
01:39:57,510 --> 01:39:59,070
people do it in different ways.

1829
01:39:59,430 --> 01:40:01,230
People did the civil rights
movement in different ways.

1830
01:40:01,231 --> 01:40:04,620
Some people wanted to do it one way.
Some people want to do another. Any,

1831
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:08,220
anything that matters. And I truly
believe we're in a battle for free speech.

1832
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:11,400
And if some people say you have to
stay inside the institutions and fight,

1833
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,890
some people want to fight from the
outside. It's like, it's all good.

1834
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:16,350
It's all good. These people are
my allies and my friends and,

1835
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:18,330
and I mean allies in the best sense of it.
Not,

1836
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:20,370
I don't mean ally because
they bow to me forever.

1837
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:23,550
If there is more money on Patrion right
now, I'm going to, I'm going to, um,

1838
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:26,370
well it's not going to be pretty people.
Here we go.

1839
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:31,260
I am trying to cancel this thing.
I'm going to 10,000,

1840
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:32,790
$895,

1841
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:37,020
1,745 patrons please for the love of God.

1842
01:40:37,290 --> 01:40:38,850
Let those numbers be going down.

1843
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:41,693
They're up.

1844
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:45,230
They're up again. We went up to
people and we went up about 20 bucks.

1845
01:40:45,530 --> 01:40:46,363
Is that right?

1846
01:40:51,490 --> 01:40:52,323
I hope you're happy.

1847
01:40:55,310 --> 01:40:59,390
Uh, okay. Can't afford 50 bucks because
I'm saving for a psychology Grad school.

1848
01:40:59,391 --> 01:41:01,230
After discovering my
interest through Jordan.

1849
01:41:01,231 --> 01:41:04,580
And any chance I could get a
leftover mug if there is one, uh,

1850
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:06,950
Star Wars episode nine. No hope.
All right, let's first of all,

1851
01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:08,750
let's give this guy a mug.
I'll sign it right now.

1852
01:41:08,990 --> 01:41:11,390
Can we get any know we have to
figure out how to get your email.

1853
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:14,340
So hopefully that can be tied
into your, uh, your super dress.

1854
01:41:14,570 --> 01:41:18,290
I will gladly give you a mug. No
problem. Uh, episode nine. No, no hope.

1855
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,900
So I'm glad you asked this question
because let's talk about something else

1856
01:41:20,901 --> 01:41:21,560
besides,

1857
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:26,450
um, free speech and the rest of it
for just a sec. So, so, uh, so David,

1858
01:41:26,451 --> 01:41:30,650
my husband had a little, a, a minor
surgery over the last couple of days,

1859
01:41:30,651 --> 01:41:32,900
which on top of it, as busy as
we've been about a zillion things,

1860
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:36,440
I've also had his brother and sister in
law here and his mom here and everyone's

1861
01:41:36,441 --> 01:41:38,930
been taking care of him and I've been
trying to do the best that I can do two

1862
01:41:38,931 --> 01:41:41,480
and, and everything else.
He's completely fine.

1863
01:41:41,481 --> 01:41:44,840
He's going through a little recovery
right now. It's all good. Um,

1864
01:41:44,870 --> 01:41:48,290
but he had a little time to watch TV.
We watched the prequels.

1865
01:41:48,530 --> 01:41:51,560
Now I've been saying for a couple of
years now that I think years from now the

1866
01:41:51,561 --> 01:41:53,930
prequels are going to be
looked at very fondly,

1867
01:41:53,931 --> 01:41:57,590
very differently than their looked
at. Now. Is the acting bad? Yes.

1868
01:41:57,620 --> 01:41:59,150
Is the script stiff?
Yes,

1869
01:41:59,151 --> 01:42:04,151
but is the story of those prequels of
what the accumulation of power and then

1870
01:42:04,281 --> 01:42:06,830
the flipping of power because
that's really what it's about.

1871
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:10,550
It's an incredible personal story of
the development of Vatican Skywalker,

1872
01:42:10,551 --> 01:42:15,551
but what it's really about is that the
emperor Palpatine was accumulating,

1873
01:42:15,711 --> 01:42:16,221
accumulating,

1874
01:42:16,221 --> 01:42:20,250
accumulating power through political
processes through creating crisises that

1875
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:23,930
then at the last moment, I mean this is
what revenge of the system SIF is about.

1876
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:26,810
He then a Qa has enough power
to get rid of the opposition.

1877
01:42:26,811 --> 01:42:29,000
That's sort of what we're
dealing with right now.

1878
01:42:29,030 --> 01:42:32,540
It's an incredible political story
at the, uh, what's his name? Hey,

1879
01:42:32,541 --> 01:42:33,980
in Christian's a horrible actor.

1880
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:37,100
Natalie Portman is a terror is
absolutely terrible in this.

1881
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:39,590
I'm not a big fan of hers anymore
for a couple of political reasons,

1882
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:41,720
but I grew up in the same
town as her actually,

1883
01:42:41,721 --> 01:42:45,170
and we went to the same high school.
Um, I'm sure she's a lovely woman,

1884
01:42:45,470 --> 01:42:48,860
but I'm not, not a huge fan of the
moment. Um, but anyway, I think people,

1885
01:42:48,950 --> 01:42:51,680
if you look at the, the prequels
and they're missing little moments,

1886
01:42:51,681 --> 01:42:53,910
like we needed to know who count
dookoo was a little bit more,

1887
01:42:53,950 --> 01:42:58,950
they needed to tell us a little bit more
about [inaudible] and why he went to

1888
01:42:59,091 --> 01:43:00,890
the cloners originally.
A couple little things,

1889
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:04,430
but if you remove some of that stuff,
the stories are actually great.

1890
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:07,280
Force awakens I think
is a fantastic movie.

1891
01:43:07,281 --> 01:43:11,450
I think Jj Abrams did an incredible
lift of resetting the entire thing and,

1892
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:14,710
and last Jedi is just horrendous. It's
horrendous at every level. Purple hair.

1893
01:43:14,711 --> 01:43:18,020
And Laura Dern, why wasn't that Admiral
Ackbar at his last moment of glory?

1894
01:43:18,021 --> 01:43:20,810
Instead you killed him off camera layer.
There's no force in space.

1895
01:43:20,811 --> 01:43:24,710
Who the hell smoke now? Ray has
no parents. What's his name? Uh,

1896
01:43:24,711 --> 01:43:27,740
fn two eight one seven.
Finn has no point in the whole movie,

1897
01:43:27,741 --> 01:43:31,460
his whole adventure that he goes
on at the casino with the SJW girl,

1898
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:33,940
they have no point in the movie.
They fail and then it just,

1899
01:43:33,950 --> 01:43:36,680
they just end up back there with dementia
and then the movie is absolute crap.

1900
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:38,180
Luke is a grumpy old fool.

1901
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:42,560
Why at that point is he force project
himself there instead of showing up to the

1902
01:43:42,561 --> 01:43:45,440
final battle if he was going to die either
right and let the guy freaking die in

1903
01:43:45,441 --> 01:43:48,170
a blaze of glory. The whole
thing was lazy. It was a resume.

1904
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:51,530
I think Ryan Johnson basically
is resentful of wars.

1905
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:56,600
All that being said, uh, I think JJ can
fix it for episode nine and I really,

1906
01:43:56,840 --> 01:44:00,440
I really, really, really, really,
really, really, really hope that he does.

1907
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:04,550
We shall see. Uh, all right, I can do
it. I think I can do two more shots.

1908
01:44:05,570 --> 01:44:08,000
We got 15 minutes.
I think I can do two more shots.

1909
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:12,110
So it's going to have to be
200 bucks on a, on any format.

1910
01:44:12,111 --> 01:44:16,730
So whether it's a patrion no, not
patriotic. CanNot be patriotic.

1911
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:20,780
No patriotic people are not
new. A patriot. Okay. Uh,

1912
01:44:20,781 --> 01:44:23,810
I can do two more shots, but you have
to do in a Dave rubin.com/donate.

1913
01:44:23,811 --> 01:44:26,560
You can do it on paypal. You do it
on credit card. You do it on bitcoin.

1914
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:29,660
I don't care at this point.
Please do not do it on Patriot.

1915
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:33,380
A shout outs to Herschel shout
outs to Bannon and a Mug for Jacob.

1916
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:38,780
Herschel Bannon. Jacob, we
just went to a shtetl in a,

1917
01:44:38,781 --> 01:44:43,310
in Poland in 1860. All
right, there you go brother.

1918
01:44:43,311 --> 01:44:46,010
I signed that one on the front
for you. That's a rare one. Jacob,

1919
01:44:46,011 --> 01:44:51,000
you're getting one on the front. Uh,
exasperated. Reuben is the best. Reuben,

1920
01:44:51,010 --> 01:44:52,630
I love you man. Okay. Uh,

1921
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:56,330
donating 10 bucks towards having Matt
Christiansen on the Ruben where we will do

1922
01:44:56,331 --> 01:45:01,220
that. A bunch of you have asked. We
will do that for sure. Um, let's see.

1923
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:01,581
Dave,

1924
01:45:01,581 --> 01:45:04,580
please briefly remind the newly joined
viewers how they can support you since

1925
01:45:04,581 --> 01:45:07,370
you're moving away from patron. I think
I've been trying to do that. Dave,

1926
01:45:07,371 --> 01:45:11,360
room and.com/donate.
We are building out several things.

1927
01:45:11,361 --> 01:45:12,770
We are rebuilding my website,

1928
01:45:12,771 --> 01:45:17,000
it is going to be completely insulated
from censorship on the video hosting

1929
01:45:17,001 --> 01:45:20,270
front on the platform hosting
front on the monetization front.

1930
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:24,710
That is just one step of getting away
from Patriot on these third party people

1931
01:45:24,711 --> 01:45:27,080
who don't live up to the
ideals that I live up to.

1932
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:30,470
I am not asking the government
to get involved. Um,

1933
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:34,220
and that is one step onto building a
platform and then several other steps down

1934
01:45:34,221 --> 01:45:37,040
the road. I promise you, this is just
the beginning of several markers.

1935
01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:40,310
We're going to do something cool here.
Like why not right? Like I'm alive.

1936
01:45:40,311 --> 01:45:45,200
You're alive. Let's do it. Okay. Uh,
200 bucks. No comment with donation,

1937
01:45:45,201 --> 01:45:46,850
but time for another shot.

1938
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:52,700
You all right?
Here we go.

1939
01:45:54,650 --> 01:45:55,483
Yeah,

1940
01:45:57,450 --> 01:46:00,450
getting too old for this shit.
You know what I mean? Here we go.

1941
01:46:01,170 --> 01:46:04,050
Patroned for Patriot.

1942
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:10,373
Woo.

1943
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:16,910
And now wait a little jelly spoons.

1944
01:46:16,911 --> 01:46:21,020
I'm going to click
refresh on the page here.

1945
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:22,790
Here we go.

1946
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:28,360
Right now we have 1,747 people
were getting $10,904 please,

1947
01:46:31,641 --> 01:46:35,390
if there is a god in the universe,
let that number go down.

1948
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:39,470
We went up $4.

1949
01:46:41,890 --> 01:46:46,280
Are you happy for a dollar per person?
You know what I mean?

1950
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:47,633
Okay.

1951
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:58,510
Oh God, another 200 no, that
house. All right, hold on.

1952
01:46:58,511 --> 01:47:03,340
I, I literally can't do another shot
right now. Um, I'm a red wine drinker too,

1953
01:47:03,341 --> 01:47:06,220
and I'd love to do a celebrative shy
with you. Keep up all the great work.

1954
01:47:06,221 --> 01:47:07,420
Cheers to beautiful future.

1955
01:47:07,730 --> 01:47:12,240
I'll display by bug one shelf higher
than my Michael knolls sign leftist tear

1956
01:47:12,241 --> 01:47:12,900
your mug

1957
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:14,610
tumbler. I appreciate that. Very nice.

1958
01:47:14,611 --> 01:47:19,470
Stick it to that Knowles guy
that rightwing maniac that.
All right, maniac. Yeah.

1959
01:47:19,530 --> 01:47:20,310
Talk about you.

1960
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:24,960
No holes. Uh, $50 in Canadian dollars.

1961
01:47:24,961 --> 01:47:26,040
Can I get a mug?
I mean,

1962
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:30,540
what is 50 Canadian dollars worth in
American [inaudible] what are we six,

1963
01:47:30,541 --> 01:47:34,230
seven bucks? I don't know what I
can do for that guy. Um, 20 bucks.

1964
01:47:34,231 --> 01:47:38,910
Let's get Dave over $11,000
on Patriot and no, no,

1965
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:41,340
you're not good.
You're not a good person.

1966
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:43,220
What's your thought on
the Captain Marvel movie?

1967
01:47:43,410 --> 01:47:45,870
I haven't tracked this thing at all,
but I know what's her name's in it.

1968
01:47:45,871 --> 01:47:49,260
Brie Larson. I think
she's a good actress. Um,

1969
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,390
but is it connected to Avengers?
It is.

1970
01:47:51,391 --> 01:47:53,310
Right then she's going to have
some big role in Avengers.

1971
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:55,590
Infinity war by the way,
was phenomenal.

1972
01:47:55,591 --> 01:47:58,230
I have been on a lot of planes in the
last couple months. I've seen infinity.

1973
01:47:58,290 --> 01:48:01,350
It's about 20 times.
And I,

1974
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:06,600
Eh, Eh, there is perfect. It's pretty
much perfect as a superhero movie. Um,

1975
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:10,470
it's so worth donating to your telephone
to watch you load up on Tequila,

1976
01:48:10,471 --> 01:48:13,440
love you and your spirit on spirits.
Way To upstage,

1977
01:48:13,441 --> 01:48:17,820
poke in a hockey puck in hockey,
love from Jamie and Janine,

1978
01:48:18,450 --> 01:48:21,120
Po poke in a Honky poky and hockey,

1979
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:23,580
whatever it is that you wrote there.

1980
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:26,250
I feel like it was something that I
should have understood and I probably just

1981
01:48:26,251 --> 01:48:29,040
said it wrong, but I
thank you for that. Um,

1982
01:48:29,370 --> 01:48:30,990
when the Patriot and replacement is up,

1983
01:48:30,991 --> 01:48:34,770
will it be announced on the subscribed
star site or we'll be at via mass social

1984
01:48:34,771 --> 01:48:38,140
media explosion. And what do you think
about the women's March controversy?

1985
01:48:38,141 --> 01:48:39,300
All right.
The women's March thing,

1986
01:48:39,470 --> 01:48:43,760
I think it's pretty obvious. Look, the
intersectional oppression Olympics thing,

1987
01:48:43,761 --> 01:48:46,460
it's crumbling because they
literally are like, wait a minute.

1988
01:48:46,461 --> 01:48:50,570
How can we treat Jews? Sure. They've
been programmed in Holocaust,

1989
01:48:50,571 --> 01:48:54,860
did and, and, and been
in the other, in the,

1990
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:56,870
in the law for the longest
history of anything.

1991
01:48:57,080 --> 01:49:00,680
But now they're kind of successful over
the last 50 years, especially in America.

1992
01:49:00,890 --> 01:49:03,440
How should we treat them despite
the fact there might be Brown?

1993
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:08,300
My brother in law happens to be a brown
Jew. Um, how should we treat these people?

1994
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:12,470
This is the essence of what
collectivism is. It is the new racism,

1995
01:49:12,471 --> 01:49:15,800
progressives or the new races races.
If you want to see something incredible.

1996
01:49:15,801 --> 01:49:19,850
By the way, look at my Twitter from
about, I think three or four tweets ago.

1997
01:49:20,870 --> 01:49:25,610
Uh, David Webb, who is a conservative
who happens to be black, was not doing,

1998
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:29,540
I'm doing his, uh, Fox nation
show, I think a on Thursday.

1999
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:34,700
He was on, uh, he was doing, it
was either he show or another show.

2000
01:49:34,701 --> 01:49:37,400
I'm actually not sure, uh,
because I had such a crazy day.

2001
01:49:37,401 --> 01:49:40,440
I was just catching these little clips
he was on with the Rebbe Martin or read

2002
01:49:40,441 --> 01:49:42,590
Martin. Happens to be a lovely
woman who's also a black,

2003
01:49:42,591 --> 01:49:44,930
she's been on my show years ago.
She's a progressive.

2004
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,980
They get on the show together.
They're doing so she doesn't know.

2005
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:50,530
She apparently she didn't know
who he was or anything about him.

2006
01:49:50,950 --> 01:49:52,990
He goes on and on about something
and then she goes, well,

2007
01:49:52,991 --> 01:49:54,430
you're showing your white privilege.

2008
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:58,210
This literally happened today and David
Webb, who is a black conservative,

2009
01:49:58,211 --> 01:50:02,140
who is a really great guy who I've
drank a lot of freaking bourbon with,

2010
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:06,880
that he usually pays for it. That's
extremely expensive. He goes, well,

2011
01:50:06,930 --> 01:50:08,170
a river.
Do you know that I'm black?

2012
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:09,940
And then you gotta listen
to the rest of this.

2013
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:14,710
It's incredible because
progressivism is the new racism.

2014
01:50:14,770 --> 01:50:18,550
Understand this. If you understand
this, you will almost be able,

2015
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:19,600
that is almost the key.

2016
01:50:19,601 --> 01:50:22,120
You need to unlock almost everything
that's happening in America,

2017
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:26,860
the people that are peddling racism that
we'll want to institutionalize racism,

2018
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:32,110
who want white people to bow to them and
who hate Christianity and all and who

2019
01:50:32,111 --> 01:50:34,540
hate anything that's remotely
traditional or conservative.

2020
01:50:34,541 --> 01:50:36,850
And I save this as a gauge.
You, you know what I mean?

2021
01:50:36,851 --> 01:50:39,220
I don't say this as one of these people
that are trying to push anyone to

2022
01:50:39,221 --> 01:50:43,450
believe anything. Um, this is what
this thing has become and it's,

2023
01:50:43,451 --> 01:50:46,060
and it's seriously dangerous and crazy.
It is six 50

2024
01:50:46,070 --> 01:50:46,631
the two.

2025
01:50:46,631 --> 01:50:51,631
I am going to check this thing and I
don't like anyone that has gone on to this

2026
01:50:52,961 --> 01:50:56,650
freaking thing or we're getting into
dangerous territory. Where's my mouse?

2027
01:50:58,180 --> 01:51:02,950
Mouse is a mouse actually technically
is this thing of mouse. All right.

2028
01:51:03,670 --> 01:51:08,670
1,749 people right now have
donated $10,900 a month.

2029
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:13,360
That is used to be around 35,000 and a
lot of you have quit and I thank you for

2030
01:51:13,361 --> 01:51:16,150
that. Thank you for stop giving
me money. I appreciate it.

2031
01:51:16,930 --> 01:51:20,350
I'm going to hit refresh on this and I
hope that that number has gone down and

2032
01:51:20,351 --> 01:51:24,070
if it hasn't gone down, you've put me
in some sort of foster and bargain.

2033
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:24,933
Here we go.

2034
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:30,950
I don't think I pressed it properly.

2035
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:39,000
Oh my God. It went up
again, didn't it? What?

2036
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:42,870
We went down,
we went down to $18

2037
01:51:48,350 --> 01:51:49,183
thank you.

2038
01:51:51,450 --> 01:51:52,350
Thank you,
Internet.

2039
01:51:53,190 --> 01:51:58,190
We went down to $18 I've been talking
for two hours and finally after imploring

2040
01:51:59,221 --> 01:52:01,980
people to stop giving
me over $10,000 a month,

2041
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:07,350
we lost $9 $18 we lost $80.

2042
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:12,390
That's incredible. Shout outs to
Andrew and Theresa and to Sam.

2043
01:52:12,391 --> 01:52:17,310
I appreciate it. Jim. You're
getting a Mug, brother. All right,

2044
01:52:17,311 --> 01:52:21,780
Jim, you're a good man, guys.
Would it be completely insane?

2045
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:25,950
I'm tempted to do this just
because I cannot believe this,

2046
01:52:26,650 --> 01:52:28,260
but I want to get the
thumbs up from my team.

2047
01:52:28,261 --> 01:52:30,720
I'm looking through the window here.
Uh,

2048
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:35,800
would it be insane to extend this for
a half hour? It would not be insane.

2049
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:40,380
I've been given the thumbs up. Yeah,
everyone's confirming this. All right,

2050
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:42,830
here's the deal. I'm going to
continue this for a half hour. I,

2051
01:52:42,831 --> 01:52:47,720
I genuinely cannot believe
this is happening. Please.
People, Internet people.

2052
01:52:47,721 --> 01:52:51,110
Why? But this is true. This is real.

2053
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:56,300
You freaks. Uh, Oh God. Another 200 bucks.

2054
01:52:56,690 --> 01:53:01,690
Drink Canada 50 is $37 and 68 cents
in the u s can I get a Canadian mug?

2055
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:05,720
Oh No. Can I get a can of Canadian
and got a bug? That's very different.

2056
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:10,100
Can I get a Canadian mug? That's
more, what is it? Canadian mug.

2057
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:13,280
How is that different than an American
Mug? Can the Canadian get a Mug?

2058
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:17,510
No, you got to do it monthly.
You can't do it on super chat.

2059
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:22,670
You're taking advantage of the
situation person, Canadian person, uh,

2060
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:27,470
$50. Should we be supporting Dave
mugging people? Good question. Uh,

2061
01:53:27,530 --> 01:53:29,900
what percentage of your listeners
do you speculate or women?

2062
01:53:29,930 --> 01:53:31,280
So it's actually interesting.

2063
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:36,200
So I don't know the total answer to
this because when you do audio podcasts,

2064
01:53:36,201 --> 01:53:39,890
which actually our audio
podcast is actually,

2065
01:53:39,891 --> 01:53:44,150
I think almost more popular than
the youtube show at this point. Um,

2066
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:46,610
which is bizarre because
no one sees those numbers.

2067
01:53:46,610 --> 01:53:50,810
So it's a weird thing cause you
sort of judged the popularity, uh,

2068
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:54,890
in terms of, uh, in terms
of the youtube numbers. Um,

2069
01:53:56,270 --> 01:53:59,000
last I saw our, our,
so politics in general,

2070
01:53:59,001 --> 01:54:01,490
if you talking about anything
political excuse mail,

2071
01:54:02,010 --> 01:54:04,670
now I know that the social justice
warriors, we'd love it to have to be 50,

2072
01:54:04,671 --> 01:54:07,970
50 men and women should care about the
exact same things at the exact same time

2073
01:54:07,971 --> 01:54:12,020
no matter what. Let's put that
aside for just a second. Um,

2074
01:54:12,260 --> 01:54:14,840
generally politics skews
heavily now. I mean, it's crazy.

2075
01:54:14,841 --> 01:54:18,290
It's something like 90 10.
Our channel is mostly politics,

2076
01:54:18,291 --> 01:54:22,640
obviously are mostly culture, cultural
related to politics, let's say.

2077
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:27,380
Um, I think we're at about 75, 25,
so I think it's about 75% male,

2078
01:54:27,381 --> 01:54:28,220
25% female,

2079
01:54:28,221 --> 01:54:33,200
which is pretty evenly
distributed relative to the
topics we're talking about.

2080
01:54:33,201 --> 01:54:36,020
So it's a little hard to say.
Uh,

2081
01:54:36,050 --> 01:54:38,820
someone just donated
50 bucks on super chat.

2082
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,450
Neither Reuben Mug to sit
next to my left is tear monks.

2083
01:54:41,630 --> 01:54:45,170
But you got to go to Dave
rubin.com/donate. We're not
doing that for super shy.

2084
01:54:45,171 --> 01:54:47,120
You got to do it.
You got to do it monthly.

2085
01:54:47,121 --> 01:54:50,120
It's just one of the things we had to do.
I appreciate it. Thank you. All right.

2086
01:54:50,121 --> 01:54:52,130
You know what, we'll do it
for that guy, but I cannot,

2087
01:54:52,131 --> 01:54:55,160
we can't do it for anyone else.
So if we can get that guy's email address,

2088
01:54:55,161 --> 01:54:57,440
if we can possibly get it.
Um,

2089
01:54:58,130 --> 01:55:02,960
$42,000 for 42,000 coast guard
members still required to work,

2090
01:55:02,961 --> 01:55:06,320
did not get a paycheck for the first
time in us history that the military were

2091
01:55:06,321 --> 01:55:08,260
not paid. Where your,
your opinion. All right,

2092
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:12,320
this will be a lot to get into
at this at this moment. Um,

2093
01:55:12,590 --> 01:55:15,710
what I would say is this,
is that first off it sounds like,

2094
01:55:15,711 --> 01:55:18,350
and I think this is a bipartisan thing,
which is bizarre these days.

2095
01:55:18,650 --> 01:55:20,510
It sounds like everyone
that's furloughed right now,

2096
01:55:20,511 --> 01:55:22,430
we're not getting paid right now.
That works for the government.

2097
01:55:22,431 --> 01:55:25,010
We'll get back pay. So that's
one thing. Now of course,

2098
01:55:25,011 --> 01:55:28,340
that doesn't deal with your
immediate bills. Now, if
you work for the government,

2099
01:55:28,341 --> 01:55:31,280
shouldn't you be living in a
situation where your week to week?

2100
01:55:31,281 --> 01:55:32,620
Probably not and maybe,

2101
01:55:32,670 --> 01:55:35,400
maybe you have to figure out a few
things for your own life. But we,

2102
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:38,870
we've all done that. When I was a
struggling comic, I swear on my life,

2103
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:41,960
I remember a day when I, I, first of all,

2104
01:55:41,961 --> 01:55:46,170
I was late on rent and I was
barely making anything. And I had,

2105
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:50,670
I had quit several jobs and I had done
for attending and I had done promotions

2106
01:55:50,671 --> 01:55:53,310
and I had handed out shit on the streets
and I've done all sorts of things.

2107
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:56,700
And I remember, and this is, I was
already in my mid twenties or something,

2108
01:55:56,701 --> 01:55:59,640
like I was way past this point
and I moved in. I didn't,

2109
01:55:59,641 --> 01:56:02,850
I couldn't even afford an apartment
anymore. And I moved in, uh,

2110
01:56:03,330 --> 01:56:04,830
three guys who were great guys,

2111
01:56:04,831 --> 01:56:07,470
I'll give him a shadow is
Mike and Chris and Adam,

2112
01:56:07,890 --> 01:56:09,780
they didn't even have an
extra room in their apartment.

2113
01:56:10,110 --> 01:56:15,110
They had a basically a whole way with a
cot and they let me stay there for like,

2114
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:22,560
I think it was like 50 bucks a month to
live in New York City and I remember one

2115
01:56:22,561 --> 01:56:24,060
day I had no cash.

2116
01:56:24,090 --> 01:56:28,920
Like I literally had no cash and I did
not know what to do and I was struggling

2117
01:56:28,921 --> 01:56:31,110
comic and the whole thing and blah
blah blah. I'm not even saying this,

2118
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:35,700
cry me a river. I went into Mike's room.
Mike is still a good buddy of mine. Mike,

2119
01:56:35,701 --> 01:56:38,280
if you're watching this and there's a good
chance you are and I love you brother,

2120
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:40,200
I guess is a good time to tell Ya.

2121
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:44,700
I took 75 cents from your change jar.

2122
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:46,380
Chock full of nuts change here.

2123
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:49,350
You had an old chocolate nuts
like metal coffee can dare.

2124
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:54,380
I took 75 cents and maybe I took
95 cents and I went to Zabar's.

2125
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:56,400
We lived on the upper west side.
I went to Zabar's,

2126
01:56:56,401 --> 01:56:59,580
which everyone that's been to New York
City knows about gay bars and then I got

2127
01:56:59,581 --> 01:57:01,590
a cup of coffee and I
stole change for you.

2128
01:57:01,610 --> 01:57:05,340
I felt so freaking guilty for doing that.
Um,

2129
01:57:06,510 --> 01:57:10,650
so the struggle is real,
I guess is the point of that.

2130
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:14,240
What was the point of that? I don't really
remember. Okay. Different marching, uh,

2131
01:57:14,290 --> 01:57:16,860
seeing you in the UK during June.
Jordan Peters has talk.

2132
01:57:16,861 --> 01:57:20,910
Hope to see you again here soon. Good luck
outside. Patrion right on brother. Um,

2133
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:22,950
longtime fan.
Just want to say you're awesome.

2134
01:57:22,951 --> 01:57:25,050
Pledging to you and Jordan on payday.

2135
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:29,550
Ever need to design writing worker
or a VA work. Uh, I'm your Gal.

2136
01:57:29,551 --> 01:57:32,850
Much love why I appreciate it
and walked back out. Yeah. Yeah.

2137
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:35,820
We've had so many people offer to work
for us for free and offer to donate

2138
01:57:35,821 --> 01:57:38,280
skills and this or that.
We're trying. I have a,

2139
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:41,490
what I do is every time I get an email
where someone else is offering us

2140
01:57:41,491 --> 01:57:45,810
something or some skillset or something,
I forwarded to Helen who's my assistant,

2141
01:57:45,811 --> 01:57:49,740
who is an incredible actually and has
been a godsend in this operation who we

2142
01:57:49,741 --> 01:57:54,120
hired back in September. Who, by the
way, I think I'm allowed to say this.

2143
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:58,890
Uh, she over the last eight or 10 years
of his life was Hugh Hefner's assistance.

2144
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:00,000
So that's actually pretty cool.

2145
01:58:00,001 --> 01:58:01,920
My assistant right now is
you have nursing assistant.

2146
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:05,760
So if I start wandering around in robes
with a lot of hot chicks around me,

2147
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:08,250
you'll know why, uh, in any event, uh,

2148
01:58:08,251 --> 01:58:10,980
I forward everything over to her and
she's compiling a list of all of these

2149
01:58:10,981 --> 01:58:14,280
things. So we'll try to figure out a lot
of this, uh, what to do going forward.

2150
01:58:14,570 --> 01:58:17,680
All right, we got, we got
a half hour left, so with,

2151
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:22,500
and I'm not extending it after that. This
is ridiculous and I hate all of you. Uh,

2152
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:27,560
I'm going to press refresh here
and I just want to say please,

2153
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:34,470
for the love of God,
we want to end this thing tonight.

2154
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:40,920
1,749 of you for some reason have
refused to cancel your patriotic gowns.

2155
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:46,420
$10,000, 800, 10,000, $890 or
sitting in there. Here we go.

2156
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:52,900
Yeah, we lost, we lost
about a thousand bucks.

2157
01:58:56,430 --> 01:59:01,290
Goodnight everybody.
Thank you.

2158
01:59:01,350 --> 01:59:05,970
Thank you for deleting $1,000 of
patronage. I couldn't be happier.

2159
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:10,760
Thank you so much. You are great
people. You are great. Great people. Uh,

2160
01:59:10,950 --> 01:59:14,670
I was so close to signing up for your
Patriot on recently, but lol. Not Anymore.

2161
01:59:14,671 --> 01:59:19,230
It goes Solo. You have immense support.
Thank you very much. Um, let's see.

2162
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:23,430
Um, why didn't I get my $25 shadow
for my Dave Rubin monthly pudge?

2163
01:59:23,431 --> 01:59:27,780
If I go to Patrion a shout out to die
standing. You got a shout out right there.

2164
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:31,920
How much is a shot? How much is a double
shot? You gave five bucks to ask that.

2165
01:59:32,070 --> 01:59:35,460
I'll do the next shot at 200. I can't,
I can't, I mean, what am I done now?

2166
01:59:35,461 --> 01:59:37,440
Three so far I haven't eaten all day.
I had,

2167
01:59:37,710 --> 01:59:42,060
I had a little salad and two
cups of bone broth. A Dave,

2168
01:59:42,061 --> 01:59:45,250
thanks for the amazing shout out sense.
Spend some time in po,

2169
01:59:45,780 --> 01:59:47,700
spent some time in Poland.
It was amazing.

2170
01:59:47,790 --> 01:59:51,660
I think Poland is actually going to be
on the next, uh, the next tour stops,

2171
01:59:51,661 --> 01:59:56,340
so hang tight on that. All right,
lots going on here. Um, guys,

2172
01:59:56,341 --> 01:59:59,100
I see a 200 sitting in here for drink.
Is that a new one?

2173
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:01,573
Ah,

2174
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:10,600
can I answer another question first?
Is there another? All right here.

2175
02:00:10,630 --> 02:00:12,460
Let me have a little water.
A little water.

2176
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:17,790
How many of you watch Bandersnatch
by the way, if you guys,

2177
02:00:17,820 --> 02:00:21,040
did you guys watch a Netflix Black Mirror?
Bandersnatch statuary.

2178
02:00:21,070 --> 02:00:22,650
It's a choose your own adventure TV show.

2179
02:00:22,651 --> 02:00:24,480
I actually do feel like
we're kind of in that,

2180
02:00:24,780 --> 02:00:28,680
which is, which is pretty
freaking cool. Uh, Kevin Johnson,

2181
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:32,070
were you a point guard on the
Phoenix Suns in the early 1990s?

2182
02:00:32,100 --> 02:00:35,400
Cause that's pretty awesome. If you
were also former mayor of Sacramento,

2183
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:38,000
take a sip of water.
Dave, you're crazy high.

2184
02:00:38,010 --> 02:00:40,620
If you could please sign my mug before
they run out, went to the website.

2185
02:00:40,621 --> 02:00:42,660
It's properly swamped.
Best of luck with this.

2186
02:00:42,690 --> 02:00:45,900
It's just the site down
is a site down right now.

2187
02:00:46,150 --> 02:00:50,670
[inaudible] dot com slash
donate I hope not. Uh, 20 bucks.

2188
02:00:50,700 --> 02:00:53,340
You're not drunk. If you
can say brewery, tour,

2189
02:00:54,810 --> 02:00:57,540
brewery tour. You know, it's a tough one
to say. I want you to say this out loud.

2190
02:00:57,541 --> 02:01:01,170
If you're watching this Irish wristwatch,

2191
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:06,840
can you say that? Play along
with me people. Irish wristwatch.

2192
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:09,150
That's a tough one to say.
And if you could say that,

2193
02:01:09,450 --> 02:01:10,950
then you're really not drunk.
All right,

2194
02:01:10,951 --> 02:01:14,400
so apparently there's 200 bucks in here
saying drink. I need just a second.

2195
02:01:14,670 --> 02:01:17,490
What are we doing here? People?
I'm just raising funds. We're,

2196
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:20,800
we're not going to do these fundraisers.
We will. I promise you. At least we will.

2197
02:01:20,801 --> 02:01:23,070
I, I said in the last thing, we're
not going to do them all year,

2198
02:01:23,071 --> 02:01:25,830
but I think we should probably do maybe,
maybe twice a year.

2199
02:01:26,010 --> 02:01:28,950
So I promise you we won't do one to
let's say June or July or summer or

2200
02:01:28,951 --> 02:01:32,440
something like that. Maybe the last
thing I do before I go off the grid, uh,

2201
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:34,780
but we're just moving people
over from Patriot over today.

2202
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:38,850
ruben.com/donate and you guys are
bored. We're, we're, we're going to be,

2203
02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:40,130
we're going to move forward.

2204
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:41,900
We're going to keep building.
Things were all good,

2205
02:01:42,170 --> 02:01:44,090
but we're completely independent.
Thanks to you guys.

2206
02:01:44,091 --> 02:01:45,230
I don't have to join the network.

2207
02:01:45,231 --> 02:01:48,470
I don't have to do any of these other
crazy things. And I thank you for that.

2208
02:01:48,471 --> 02:01:52,340
And it's awesome. It's real.
This is seriously freaking
real. What can I tell ya?

2209
02:01:52,730 --> 02:01:54,740
Um,
I'm monthly on paypal,

2210
02:01:54,741 --> 02:01:59,741
but this stream is lit as fuck a f that's
how the kid say as fuck these days.

2211
02:02:00,531 --> 02:02:03,590
By the way. A good to know. Uh, um,

2212
02:02:03,710 --> 02:02:06,650
I know you're somewhat at least at
least somewhat interested in comics.

2213
02:02:06,890 --> 02:02:11,090
Are you familiar with the sun? So Neetu
series, remember to stay hydrated.

2214
02:02:11,300 --> 02:02:12,830
I don't know this the need two people.

2215
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:20,120
How's my gulp sound on that?
Every now and again,

2216
02:02:20,121 --> 02:02:22,970
I have a drink on the show and people
say, Dave, you're allowed goalkeeper.

2217
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:26,050
So I'm gonna just drink casually.
Let's just pretend.

2218
02:02:26,090 --> 02:02:30,060
I'll just pretend nobody's watching
and I'm going to drink casually.

2219
02:02:34,970 --> 02:02:39,170
How was that? Let me know in the comments
right down below. Okay, here we go.

2220
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:43,520
I'm Dave, you've upstaged,
Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren.

2221
02:02:43,521 --> 02:02:44,960
She drank a beer in her video.

2222
02:02:44,961 --> 02:02:48,620
I think that was what the earlier
comment are meant to say. Yeah, I mean,

2223
02:02:48,950 --> 02:02:51,950
but that's like,
that's how stupid this thing is.

2224
02:02:51,951 --> 02:02:56,300
These people are trying to pretend to be
human. I drink a beer with my husband,

2225
02:02:56,301 --> 02:02:58,420
so I'm a real person. Look, oh my home,

2226
02:02:58,421 --> 02:03:01,670
and just happens to be here with my
laptop in the kitchen and he didn't know I

2227
02:03:01,671 --> 02:03:04,830
was going to live stream to millions
of people. It's like they're,

2228
02:03:04,831 --> 02:03:08,270
they're all just bullshit artists than
buffoons and stop paying attention to

2229
02:03:08,271 --> 02:03:10,760
them. But at the other level, you have
to be independent because it's your life.

2230
02:03:10,761 --> 02:03:14,480
So it's a little bit tough because these
people have on real ugly power on your

2231
02:03:14,481 --> 02:03:18,470
life, which is a problem late. A little
jellies, spoons. We have 25 minutes left.

2232
02:03:18,740 --> 02:03:20,250
Go to Dave Rubin dot compensation on it.

2233
02:03:20,330 --> 02:03:23,450
I got to get rid of some
of these freaking shirts.

2234
02:03:23,510 --> 02:03:25,940
I can't deal with the shirts anymore.
I have too many of them.

2235
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:29,150
They're causing problems. Okay?
They're courting marital problems.

2236
02:03:29,151 --> 02:03:30,500
I need closet space people,

2237
02:03:30,830 --> 02:03:33,680
Dave rubin.com/donate 25 bucks a
month that you're getting a shirt,

2238
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:36,350
50 bucks monthly. You're getting
the shirt, you're getting a mug.

2239
02:03:36,351 --> 02:03:38,150
I'm going to sign it for you
right now and then we're deleting.

2240
02:03:38,151 --> 02:03:41,660
Patrion I'm not extending this thing
after that. I promise you we're done.

2241
02:03:41,661 --> 02:03:45,440
I know there's 200 bucks sitting there
and super chat about the, about the shot.

2242
02:03:45,441 --> 02:03:47,570
All right, the next hundred.
If we got a hundred after this,

2243
02:03:48,020 --> 02:03:51,830
I'll do the freaking shot. I hope you're
happy. Let's go to the video tape.

2244
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:54,310
Yeah.

2245
02:03:54,310 --> 02:03:58,600
Right now we have 1,745
I would say heathens,

2246
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:03,840
ungodly heathens who have decided that
they do not want to stop paying us here

2247
02:04:04,481 --> 02:04:05,830
even though I don't want them to.

2248
02:04:06,160 --> 02:04:09,370
And I've sent several emails and I've
done live streams and tweeted about it and

2249
02:04:09,371 --> 02:04:12,730
the money keeps going up. I think we
went down to $9 last time. That was nice.

2250
02:04:12,910 --> 02:04:17,140
And here we go.
Jesus.

2251
02:04:17,141 --> 02:04:20,140
Fuck we did.
We just go up $1,500

2252
02:04:22,170 --> 02:04:23,610
we just went up $900

2253
02:04:37,770 --> 02:04:38,130
I can't

2254
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:41,130
quit. You know

2255
02:04:43,790 --> 02:04:44,571
Dave,
Chris here,

2256
02:04:44,571 --> 02:04:48,200
just wanting to let you know that sword
and scale is donated about 500 on this

2257
02:04:48,201 --> 02:04:52,400
stream and you're awesome. And if you
need a product manager for me to platform,

2258
02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:56,630
Helen has my CV. Holla. Alright.
So, so Helen does have these things.

2259
02:04:56,631 --> 02:05:00,080
I'm not making it up. We do categorize
all of these things. A sword and scale.

2260
02:05:00,081 --> 02:05:04,640
I did not know, uh, about the podcast
before this, but I do know about it now.

2261
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:09,710
He's been a huge supporter in, uh, in,
in getting the word out about Patrion.

2262
02:05:09,711 --> 02:05:13,210
I think he's the fifth
highest creator on Patrion.

2263
02:05:13,220 --> 02:05:18,080
He's planning on leaving quite patriotic.
Um, I don't, I don't know him personally.

2264
02:05:18,081 --> 02:05:20,570
I don't know. We've traded
a couple of messages. Um,

2265
02:05:20,571 --> 02:05:22,280
I don't know what he's
financial considerations are,

2266
02:05:22,281 --> 02:05:26,180
but people are trying to do what they
can and it is pretty freaking awesome. I,

2267
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:29,750
I appreciate the support
brother and let's,

2268
02:05:29,780 --> 02:05:31,970
let's just keep trying to do what we can.
Uh,

2269
02:05:31,971 --> 02:05:35,420
I kept my patriot accounts simply because
I wanted to see what happens on the

2270
02:05:35,421 --> 02:05:40,090
patrion end when the accountant
we patronize is deleted or not.

2271
02:05:40,190 --> 02:05:42,560
That's fair.
Thank you for not giving me more money.

2272
02:05:42,561 --> 02:05:44,480
I think that's what you're saying.
But that's where you,

2273
02:05:44,481 --> 02:05:46,730
if you haven't deleted because
you want to just see what happens.

2274
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:51,320
The moment I delete via the insider
thing that is happening on Patrion.

2275
02:05:51,590 --> 02:05:53,930
I do appreciate that. All
right. I'm giving shout outs.

2276
02:05:53,931 --> 02:05:58,931
Five bucks above on Dave ruby.com/donate
shirts 25 bucks above monthly and uh,

2277
02:05:59,001 --> 02:06:00,320
and uh,
mugs on that.

2278
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:03,740
I will do another shot at 100 bucks
on super chat because you people are

2279
02:06:03,741 --> 02:06:07,750
seriously twisted. We just
went up $900 on patriot. I, I,

2280
02:06:08,290 --> 02:06:11,150
I don't know what to tell ya
there then. I can't, you know,

2281
02:06:11,151 --> 02:06:16,151
you've got to stop giving us money there
and this is not right or this is injust

2282
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:19,280
I'm impressed.
I'm impressed.

2283
02:06:19,670 --> 02:06:23,120
I keep asking people to not do something
and they keep doing it. This is,

2284
02:06:23,150 --> 02:06:27,440
this is depression is the oppression
of the sith. It is back. Uh, all right,

2285
02:06:27,470 --> 02:06:28,880
I will be in Irvine,

2286
02:06:28,881 --> 02:06:32,450
California January 30th with a member
of the ITW at the Irvine Improv.

2287
02:06:32,451 --> 02:06:36,830
You can check Dave Ruby dot calculation
beds to check out that in case you can't

2288
02:06:36,831 --> 02:06:40,540
tell. I used to be on the radio. So I've
done a little bit of a, a little of this,

2289
02:06:40,541 --> 02:06:42,980
a little of that over
the years. Uh, all right,

2290
02:06:42,981 --> 02:06:44,840
who's jumping in on
superchat hundred bucks?

2291
02:06:44,841 --> 02:06:47,180
I'm going to do another shot at this
point. It's like, let's just do it.

2292
02:06:47,210 --> 02:06:49,430
You know what I mean?
Like let's just go down with the ship.

2293
02:06:49,431 --> 02:06:53,900
I'm going to end up with $4 billion on
Patrion. I'll be drunk as hell. I mean,

2294
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:58,320
let's just roll with it. Um, okay. Um,

2295
02:06:59,380 --> 02:07:03,770
a lot of things here. Shout
out to John, Mike and Chrissie.

2296
02:07:04,280 --> 02:07:07,970
Thank you guys. I appreciate it. All
right, we got, it's seven Oh eight.

2297
02:07:09,770 --> 02:07:12,710
We got 22 minutes left.
I'm going to,

2298
02:07:12,711 --> 02:07:15,020
I'm going to click that
thing and if it's higher,

2299
02:07:16,470 --> 02:07:17,303
hmm.

2300
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:22,450
I'm going to have to really
evaluate things. Aaron,

2301
02:07:25,730 --> 02:07:30,200
1,743 people have donated $10,853.

2302
02:07:31,450 --> 02:07:32,350
This is wrong.

2303
02:07:33,820 --> 02:07:34,653
This is not good.

2304
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:40,630
We've got a $14 people.

2305
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:47,490
I get it. I get it. It's all a joke.

2306
02:07:50,210 --> 02:07:54,500
Do all the joke to you people as I sit
here trying to delete this thing and you

2307
02:07:54,501 --> 02:07:58,340
give me your hard earned dollars just
to stick it to the man or something like

2308
02:07:58,341 --> 02:08:02,480
that. Um, I mean this is actually
hilarious. This is actually hilarious.

2309
02:08:02,481 --> 02:08:05,420
Like I give anyone that's given
any money on, they're like, we'll,

2310
02:08:05,421 --> 02:08:08,360
we'll clear out the account
before we delete, but like

2311
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:13,820
legitimately hilarious. Like I, this
is not what I would've expected. Okay,

2312
02:08:13,821 --> 02:08:16,310
here we go.
FYI,

2313
02:08:16,370 --> 02:08:21,230
Jordan Peterson has deleted
his patrion page, but Bam,

2314
02:08:21,590 --> 02:08:24,430
22 minutes left people now.
20 minutes left. I have,

2315
02:08:24,510 --> 02:08:27,650
I can confirm we are
the people in the booth.

2316
02:08:27,950 --> 02:08:30,140
Jordan B.

2317
02:08:30,140 --> 02:08:34,910
Peterson of Canada has deleted
his patrion page. All right.

2318
02:08:34,970 --> 02:08:38,240
It's over. It's gone. It's done.
He's in Switzerland right now.

2319
02:08:38,241 --> 02:08:41,450
He deleted it from Switzerland.
Okay.

2320
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:45,950
Try to grasp the gravity of the situation.
Shout out to Rory. Thank you right now.

2321
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:50,210
Super Chat. You missed my shout
out for joining your side.

2322
02:08:50,211 --> 02:08:55,130
Punishment is another shot. You
sick? Twisted bastard. All right,

2323
02:08:55,131 --> 02:08:56,000
here we go.

2324
02:08:58,170 --> 02:08:59,170
Lord,

2325
02:09:00,390 --> 02:09:05,320
may the Lord have mercy.
I know all of us.

2326
02:09:06,890 --> 02:09:08,200
You don't know what's
wrong with you people

2327
02:09:14,470 --> 02:09:15,840
who,
Huh?

2328
02:09:19,220 --> 02:09:20,520
All right.

2329
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:29,050
It's good to be here.
We're on Patrion.

2330
02:09:29,290 --> 02:09:33,730
I'd like to announce today that we're
rebooting our patrion on page and we want

2331
02:09:33,731 --> 02:09:35,590
to take as many donations
there as possible.

2332
02:09:36,010 --> 02:09:38,080
I feel like that's the
future of the Rubin report.

2333
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:42,520
Joining third party sites that don't
care about free speech and seeing what

2334
02:09:42,521 --> 02:09:46,240
happens. Let's take a role in it. Ice, um,

2335
02:09:47,110 --> 02:09:51,550
thoughts on your comedian Buddy Owen,
Benjamin and him shitting on everyone.

2336
02:09:51,551 --> 02:09:53,710
Is He for real or he is just
part of the new comedy routine?

2337
02:09:54,340 --> 02:09:55,930
I honestly have no idea
what's going on with him.

2338
02:09:55,931 --> 02:09:59,160
I truly can't answer that in
any, in any sensible way. Uh,

2339
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:04,060
we got 19 minutes left.
I can confirm that from Switzerland.

2340
02:10:04,690 --> 02:10:07,300
Jordan Peterson has deleted
his patriotic count.

2341
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:12,520
I've taken I think five shots of
patrolling. I'm 42 years old people,

2342
02:10:12,790 --> 02:10:16,580
no 42 year olds should be drinking
five shots in neutron. Um,

2343
02:10:17,780 --> 02:10:18,613
okay.

2344
02:10:18,680 --> 02:10:23,680
I did three shows today before this
and the Internet has screwed me by

2345
02:10:23,991 --> 02:10:27,920
continually donating to the Patriot
account that I will be deleting in moment.

2346
02:10:28,460 --> 02:10:31,250
And a, I guess it's just the
sign of the Times. This is,

2347
02:10:31,270 --> 02:10:34,040
this is what it's all about.
We who

2348
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:37,550
live in the Internet on this tube,
this youtube,

2349
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:39,733
we're but

2350
02:10:40,750 --> 02:10:41,550
yeah.

2351
02:10:41,550 --> 02:10:43,560
Humble servants to you people.
But,

2352
02:10:43,600 --> 02:10:45,510
but really this is like a
choose your own adventure.

2353
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:48,630
You're watching this right now
or controlling my destiny. It's,

2354
02:10:48,640 --> 02:10:51,780
it's extremely bizarre.
I'll try just realize what's very bizarre.

2355
02:10:51,781 --> 02:10:54,440
It's only seven 12 in the evening here.
I A,

2356
02:10:54,450 --> 02:10:58,440
I haven't had dinner but re but be in
18 minutes when I end this thing after I

2357
02:10:58,441 --> 02:10:59,730
clicked delete,
I'm going to be drunk.

2358
02:10:59,970 --> 02:11:02,490
I have several employees
and family members here.

2359
02:11:02,670 --> 02:11:07,590
None of them are going to be drunk cause
anyone drunk in there? Not yet. Not yet.

2360
02:11:07,591 --> 02:11:12,060
All right. They're not drunk
people. Very bizarre. Uh, okay.

2361
02:11:12,210 --> 02:11:15,540
Subscribe for 25 but change it
to 50 I didn't get another email.

2362
02:11:15,541 --> 02:11:17,520
Will I still be able to get a
mug? Keep up the good work. Yeah,

2363
02:11:17,521 --> 02:11:21,120
we'll make sure we'll see to
your name twice in there. Helen,

2364
02:11:21,121 --> 02:11:24,300
can you make sure we take care of
that for sure. We will deal with that.

2365
02:11:24,301 --> 02:11:26,520
All right. Ask me anything. People

2366
02:11:28,620 --> 02:11:32,580
ask me anything. We are deleting
patriot. All right, let's go. Here we go.

2367
02:11:33,480 --> 02:11:35,760
Let's do it right now.

2368
02:11:35,761 --> 02:11:40,761
We have 1,744 patrons despite at least
five emails despite three livestreams,

2369
02:11:43,860 --> 02:11:47,700
despite at least 20 tweets,
Instagram posts, everything.

2370
02:11:47,701 --> 02:11:50,100
Please stop giving me money.
Delete your page, your on account.

2371
02:11:50,101 --> 02:11:54,710
I don't want anything to do with
you people. Despite all of that. Uh,

2372
02:11:54,780 --> 02:11:59,680
we still have 1700 people
left and we have $10,957.

2373
02:11:59,681 --> 02:12:00,514
Here we go.

2374
02:12:04,370 --> 02:12:08,920
What do we, I think, ah, we went up.

2375
02:12:09,290 --> 02:12:10,123
Yeah,

2376
02:12:10,650 --> 02:12:15,180
we went down almost $900.
That's what I'm talking about.

2377
02:12:15,181 --> 02:12:19,410
People purge the money.
Let's get it out of Patrion.

2378
02:12:19,710 --> 02:12:23,280
They don't want our money.
They've got silicon valley
money. They've got VC money.

2379
02:12:23,281 --> 02:12:24,210
They don't need our buddy.

2380
02:12:24,540 --> 02:12:27,480
I love the fact that people at at paid
two and are watching this right now.

2381
02:12:27,570 --> 02:12:30,750
Like that's actually
pretty hilarious. Um, that,

2382
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:32,010
that's the other thing about the internet.

2383
02:12:32,011 --> 02:12:35,490
The Internet is so stupid these days
that you have silicon valley people who

2384
02:12:35,491 --> 02:12:38,550
these people, all these social justice
warriors or or more so you have,

2385
02:12:38,700 --> 02:12:40,170
most of them are libertarians.
Actually,

2386
02:12:40,171 --> 02:12:42,840
I mean the secret of Silicon Valley
is that most of these people are

2387
02:12:42,841 --> 02:12:46,410
Libertarians because they believe that
they have ideas to create and that that

2388
02:12:46,411 --> 02:12:49,350
would give you a very liberty
minded view of the world.

2389
02:12:49,530 --> 02:12:54,060
They've become hostages to the SJW thing.
And because of that,

2390
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:56,730
then there are around a bunch of
people who they actually don't like.

2391
02:12:56,730 --> 02:12:59,280
And I'm talking to all of these silicon
valley people that I know are watching

2392
02:12:59,281 --> 02:13:03,300
this right now. They become hostages to
all of these people. And then they're all,

2393
02:13:03,330 --> 02:13:05,650
they're all just a bunch of
sort of cowards, right? Know,

2394
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:07,610
with all the soil and everything else.
They're there.

2395
02:13:07,630 --> 02:13:09,210
They can't really stand up for themselves.

2396
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:14,540
So what happens is it just becomes a
self fulfilling prophecy that no one will

2397
02:13:14,731 --> 02:13:15,780
stand up for what they believe in.

2398
02:13:15,781 --> 02:13:19,890
So I have no doubt that there are plenty
of people at Patrion that completely

2399
02:13:19,891 --> 02:13:23,280
support what I'm doing here and, and
whatever. But it's like the fact,

2400
02:13:23,281 --> 02:13:27,060
think about it. Think about this. So
I joined Patriot in, in uh, Julie.

2401
02:13:27,061 --> 02:13:27,990
It was either June or May,

2402
02:13:27,991 --> 02:13:31,800
I think it was June of 2016 we've been
on there for two a half plus years.

2403
02:13:31,801 --> 02:13:34,820
We were basically making about 30 grand
a month there that the funded this whole

2404
02:13:35,010 --> 02:13:37,800
basically funded this entire company.
Um,

2405
02:13:37,801 --> 02:13:41,130
so you'd have to do the math on that two
and a half years of 30 grand a month.

2406
02:13:41,131 --> 02:13:43,500
Can someone do the math
on that 300, 600? I mean,

2407
02:13:43,501 --> 02:13:46,260
that's almost a million bucks over the
course of three years to find a Kokanee.

2408
02:13:46,261 --> 02:13:47,220
Now that sounds like a lot of money,

2409
02:13:47,221 --> 02:13:49,140
but when you're running a company
and paying a lot of people,

2410
02:13:49,290 --> 02:13:51,390
it's not a ton of money, but
think about like I've, I've been,

2411
02:13:51,450 --> 02:13:52,920
I've put a lot of money into this company.

2412
02:13:52,921 --> 02:13:54,570
Sam Harris put a lot of
money into this company,

2413
02:13:54,571 --> 02:13:57,300
Jordan Peters and put a lot of
money, this company, the fact that,

2414
02:13:57,330 --> 02:13:58,860
that nobody reached out to us,

2415
02:13:58,890 --> 02:14:02,910
you'd think that some
low level nobody would.

2416
02:14:02,970 --> 02:14:06,090
You would reach out and say, guys, we're,
we're having this little issue here,

2417
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:09,420
but that's what, that's what's become
a problem with these companies now,

2418
02:14:09,450 --> 02:14:12,610
interestingly, I know that
the lefties will say, ah,

2419
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:16,320
because you don't want regulation of
these companies and you think they can do

2420
02:14:16,321 --> 02:14:20,880
whatever they want to do. Yes, I do think
they can do whatever they want to do.

2421
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,790
They can do whatever they want to do
and I can do whatever I want to do.

2422
02:14:23,791 --> 02:14:25,800
Freedom is messy,
but freedom is good.

2423
02:14:26,350 --> 02:14:30,640
Shout out to Ethan. Thank you
very much. $69 curious number.

2424
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:33,450
I think you're onto something with this
whole. Pay me and I'll take a shot.

2425
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:37,090
Fundraising. I like try it and see if
it works when you're not famous. Lol.

2426
02:14:38,380 --> 02:14:39,810
My famous,
I guess I'm famous.

2427
02:14:39,850 --> 02:14:43,750
It's weird that that's also a weird
thing because I'd had an od level of fame

2428
02:14:43,751 --> 02:14:47,770
where like clearly I guess
I'm famous at some level,

2429
02:14:48,430 --> 02:14:52,210
but like I go to whole
foods or I go like anywhere,

2430
02:14:52,540 --> 02:14:56,980
like I go to like the bowling alley or
like wherever it is that I go or I go to

2431
02:14:56,981 --> 02:15:00,270
like Petco or like people
recognize you are often,

2432
02:15:00,271 --> 02:15:03,460
I'll see people looking at me
and I'm like, ah, they'd like me.

2433
02:15:03,461 --> 02:15:05,590
I don't know if they or do they
think I'm a white supremacist.

2434
02:15:05,740 --> 02:15:09,760
So most of my day is wandering around
strange stores picking up food for my dog

2435
02:15:09,761 --> 02:15:12,190
going, ah, do they think
I'm a white supremacist?

2436
02:15:12,191 --> 02:15:15,100
Which should think how stupid this thing
all the whole thing is become. Yeah.

2437
02:15:15,210 --> 02:15:17,580
Um, next time you take a
shot, I'll make a PSAT,

2438
02:15:17,610 --> 02:15:20,670
make us sound like Anderson Cooper
and I'll donate $100. All right.

2439
02:15:21,550 --> 02:15:23,590
That's funny.
That's funny.

2440
02:15:23,591 --> 02:15:25,380
That might be the funniest thing
that's happened this whole time.

2441
02:15:25,580 --> 02:15:28,550
So if nobody watched
CNN on New Year's Eve,

2442
02:15:28,630 --> 02:15:32,890
like what kind of life do you have that
you'd watch CNN on New Year's Eve? Um,

2443
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:33,640
but,

2444
02:15:33,640 --> 02:15:37,000
but you might've watched a clip of it
on Twitter and I saw a five second clip

2445
02:15:37,180 --> 02:15:42,160
where him and Andy Cohen, uh, and as a
Kubernetes going, they're taking shots.

2446
02:15:42,161 --> 02:15:42,521
And it's like,

2447
02:15:42,521 --> 02:15:46,300
that's the one night of the year that the
CNN people act get to act like humans,

2448
02:15:46,480 --> 02:15:49,510
but they can't really act like humans
because they've spent a year not acting

2449
02:15:49,511 --> 02:15:52,810
like a human. So how can they act like a
human on one night? That's a tough gig.

2450
02:15:53,240 --> 02:15:57,370
Uh, but so Anderson take a shot. He's
like, oh my God, it's so, all right.

2451
02:15:57,371 --> 02:16:01,030
You know what? Here's
what we'll do. 500 bucks.

2452
02:16:01,090 --> 02:16:05,800
I will do an Anderson Cooper impression
while taking a shot. It's gotta be 509.

2453
02:16:05,950 --> 02:16:08,400
I'm sorry,
the money's going up on Pedro.

2454
02:16:08,401 --> 02:16:09,620
And despite the fact
that I wanted to go down,

2455
02:16:09,640 --> 02:16:12,520
so here the rubber meets the road people.

2456
02:16:12,640 --> 02:16:14,350
I will do an impression
of Anderson Cooper.

2457
02:16:15,310 --> 02:16:18,850
Hey David, keep up the good work. I came
to America to be around people like you.

2458
02:16:18,851 --> 02:16:20,530
Instead I found free speech police,

2459
02:16:20,531 --> 02:16:22,450
hopefully people like you
help turn things around.

2460
02:16:23,050 --> 02:16:24,940
I'd love to know where you're from.
Uh,

2461
02:16:25,660 --> 02:16:28,360
can you do something that we can
figure out where this person is from?

2462
02:16:28,540 --> 02:16:30,100
I love story.
That's the other

2463
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:33,100
thing. When I go into Uber's and cabs
and all these places that I go to,

2464
02:16:33,101 --> 02:16:35,860
whether it's in the states or not,
it was like everyone that I've met,

2465
02:16:35,890 --> 02:16:39,670
it's like everyone loves to be in
the West. They love to be in Canada.

2466
02:16:39,671 --> 02:16:42,370
They loved to be in the UK. They love
to be in America. It ain't that bad.

2467
02:16:42,760 --> 02:16:47,200
How much for a six shot daily,
you donate $5 and 69 cents.

2468
02:16:47,290 --> 02:16:49,420
Another interesting number.
Um,

2469
02:16:49,450 --> 02:16:52,870
I remember the time before you
had a patriot right after the ad.

2470
02:16:52,871 --> 02:16:56,260
Pocalypse it won't be that bad. We're
going to be all right here, right Jesse,

2471
02:16:56,261 --> 02:17:00,610
you're getting a Mug,
brother or sister Jessie could be a guy,

2472
02:17:00,620 --> 02:17:01,453
could be a girl,

2473
02:17:03,370 --> 02:17:07,090
but who am I to assign a gender to Jesse?
You know what I mean?

2474
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:10,033
Huh.

2475
02:17:11,550 --> 02:17:15,840
Uh, and, and again, Jesse,
whatever gender you are,

2476
02:17:15,841 --> 02:17:19,980
I just want you to know, I think
you're great gender. You know, like

2477
02:17:21,930 --> 02:17:26,160
you're really a great guy or Gal,
you know Jesse,

2478
02:17:26,820 --> 02:17:30,930
great gal, great guy or Gal. Okay, here we
go. We've got 13 minutes left. By the way.

2479
02:17:30,931 --> 02:17:34,050
My phone is exploding right now.
I don't want to show all the,

2480
02:17:34,051 --> 02:17:37,770
the names of the people. Um,
but my phone is exploding,

2481
02:17:37,771 --> 02:17:41,640
which either means that I've ruined my
career tonight or we got some good shit

2482
02:17:41,641 --> 02:17:45,270
going on. I suspect it's the latter,
but you never know. Here we go.

2483
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:49,110
We're going to hit refresh.
We have 1,444 people.

2484
02:17:49,111 --> 02:17:52,140
We've got 11 minutes remaining.

2485
02:17:52,360 --> 02:17:55,740
Clis if there is a lord in the university,

2486
02:17:55,741 --> 02:17:57,540
if any of this means anything,

2487
02:17:57,840 --> 02:18:00,840
let the number 10,079 go down.

2488
02:18:06,400 --> 02:18:08,110
We went up $900.

2489
02:18:17,660 --> 02:18:18,493
Huh?

2490
02:18:28,870 --> 02:18:31,430
All right.
You know what I love?

2491
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:37,840
There is a set of a anonymous Twitter
accounts that are run by a journalist.

2492
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:41,830
There's about, there's about
10 influential lefty, um,

2493
02:18:41,900 --> 02:18:45,130
anonymous accounts on Twitter that are
run by journalists and they think they're

2494
02:18:45,140 --> 02:18:48,800
really clever and I know they're watching
this waiting for me to say anything

2495
02:18:48,801 --> 02:18:51,830
off script or whatever.
Even though there's no script here,

2496
02:18:51,831 --> 02:18:53,900
they're waiting for me to just
say anything. That's anything.

2497
02:18:54,290 --> 02:18:56,210
And what they do is
they're anonymous Twitter.

2498
02:18:56,240 --> 02:18:57,950
There are journalists are
friends of journalists,

2499
02:18:57,951 --> 02:19:01,430
and what they do is they wait to clip
one thing and then they magically get

2500
02:19:01,431 --> 02:19:03,200
Huffpo or buzzfeed or vox,

2501
02:19:03,201 --> 02:19:07,100
which is the worst or any of these things
to quote what I say and say Ruben was

2502
02:19:07,101 --> 02:19:09,470
drunk and morale. I said
this. And it's like,

2503
02:19:09,471 --> 02:19:12,590
I know they're just sitting there
watching this and they couldn't get,

2504
02:19:12,710 --> 02:19:16,700
they couldn't get anyone to give them a
buck. And I'm literally asking people's,

2505
02:19:16,701 --> 02:19:18,710
you know,
giving me money right now.

2506
02:19:20,630 --> 02:19:21,463
Ah,

2507
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:26,730
Oh, here we go. I can afford a
couple of months at 50 right now,

2508
02:19:26,731 --> 02:19:28,190
I hope gets me a cool sign

2509
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:32,330
mug. Jesse is with Jesse
without the eye is male.

2510
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:36,210
Now stop flirting with me. Oh,
Jessie, welcome back. All right,

2511
02:19:36,230 --> 02:19:37,100
so Jessie's going to get

2512
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:41,200
the mug. Um, and you're
right. So it was j e s, s, e,

2513
02:19:41,201 --> 02:19:42,730
which I assumed was a male.

2514
02:19:42,910 --> 02:19:47,770
But these days with the way gender is so
fluid and the way just because you have

2515
02:19:47,771 --> 02:19:52,320
a penis, you might be uh, you know, you
can be a woman, you can be a decepticon,

2516
02:19:52,660 --> 02:19:56,560
whatever it is, sith Lord doesn't
matter. The point is, uh, you know,

2517
02:19:56,561 --> 02:19:57,750
we're just doing the best we can.
Okay.

2518
02:19:57,820 --> 02:19:59,380
Ladles and jellies boots.
We have s

2519
02:19:59,530 --> 02:20:02,990
we have nine minutes left.
We went up 900 bucks.

2520
02:20:04,780 --> 02:20:05,613
Huh?

2521
02:20:06,550 --> 02:20:08,410
The best part of this is,
so we really had,

2522
02:20:08,470 --> 02:20:10,600
the last couple days here
really have been insane.

2523
02:20:10,601 --> 02:20:14,140
So David had surgery as I mentioned
before. So David's not even part of this.

2524
02:20:14,141 --> 02:20:17,530
David's the executive producer of
the show who has run, if anything,

2525
02:20:17,531 --> 02:20:20,830
I do look remotely professional or
anything. Maybe, maybe not today,

2526
02:20:21,100 --> 02:20:25,600
but generally speaking, David has done
this. This is, this is him. He is,

2527
02:20:25,850 --> 02:20:28,810
he, he learned this from
scratch and has become,

2528
02:20:28,811 --> 02:20:33,420
I would say the best executive producer
probably in the business. And he,

2529
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:36,550
he could not work these last couple
of days because he had, it was,

2530
02:20:36,551 --> 02:20:40,870
it was a minor sinus related surgery
but like he was knocked out on pain meds

2531
02:20:40,871 --> 02:20:44,320
and all sorts of stuff the last
couple of days. So we've, our, our,

2532
02:20:44,350 --> 02:20:46,180
my whole team is completely stepped up.
We,

2533
02:20:46,190 --> 02:20:48,940
we brought in some other people in my
brother and sister alive helped in a whole

2534
02:20:48,941 --> 02:20:53,200
bunch of people and uh,
the fact that we,

2535
02:20:53,201 --> 02:20:55,570
here we are this morning, I
said to David, I was like,

2536
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:59,020
I hope that by the end of this like I
don't know how to get to these Patriot on

2537
02:20:59,021 --> 02:20:59,940
people.
I got it.

2538
02:20:59,980 --> 02:21:03,100
It's actually incredible and it's a little
sign of the times you're saying that

2539
02:21:03,101 --> 02:21:05,380
a certain amount of people just
donate to things and forget about it.

2540
02:21:05,770 --> 02:21:08,530
And I mean that, I don't mean that
judging them in a negative way.

2541
02:21:08,531 --> 02:21:09,221
I mean that is like,

2542
02:21:09,221 --> 02:21:12,130
it's actually kind of cool
if like someone's got a
couple of bucks and it's like

2543
02:21:12,131 --> 02:21:14,770
you fall, you get to something you
believe in and you just forget about it.

2544
02:21:14,771 --> 02:21:18,340
It's like, what are, what a luxury that
is. What a great thing that is. Um,

2545
02:21:19,480 --> 02:21:20,740
but I was like at the end of this,

2546
02:21:20,741 --> 02:21:24,940
like it would be so cool if the entire
livestream two hours we could watch this

2547
02:21:24,941 --> 02:21:26,950
number, drop, drop, drop, drop,
drop, drop, drop, drop, drop.

2548
02:21:28,210 --> 02:21:31,750
And we have not had that
happen. All right. 150

2549
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:32,211
the bugs.

2550
02:21:32,211 --> 02:21:35,150
I think what you're doing is great and
I fully support your willingness to take

2551
02:21:35,151 --> 02:21:36,450
a stand and have the conversation

2552
02:21:36,530 --> 02:21:38,750
nobody else will have.
Thank you. You know what,

2553
02:21:38,810 --> 02:21:43,310
you didn't even ask me to take a shot,
but I'm feeling the flow. It's seven 23

2554
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:50,040
this is patrolling ladles and jellies,
moons, ladles and jellies. Moons.

2555
02:21:50,041 --> 02:21:51,750
I want to give a shout out.
I hope my buddy.

2556
02:21:52,260 --> 02:21:55,200
So when I did stand up in New York for
12 years and I hope you guys will come

2557
02:21:55,201 --> 02:21:57,250
out and see me do stand up in the future,
um,

2558
02:21:57,270 --> 02:22:00,840
because people don't know that
part of me, uh, until they see it.

2559
02:22:00,841 --> 02:22:03,690
And then people are like, Holy Shit,
you're actually good at this. But,

2560
02:22:03,691 --> 02:22:06,300
which is actually more of a fun thing
cause people don't even pay to come to the

2561
02:22:06,301 --> 02:22:07,560
show and they don't even
know what to expect.

2562
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:10,440
But there were two comics who I knew
that were great that I'm going to give a

2563
02:22:10,441 --> 02:22:13,530
public shout out to now that I don't even
know that you can find anything about

2564
02:22:13,531 --> 02:22:16,620
them online. The two best comics
that I ever knew in 12 years,

2565
02:22:16,621 --> 02:22:20,190
a standup in New York were
Bob Jergens and Mike Singer.

2566
02:22:20,250 --> 02:22:22,710
And I don't know that you can find
anything about them. Bobbed an actor now.

2567
02:22:22,711 --> 02:22:24,150
So I hope you can at
least find out about him.

2568
02:22:24,151 --> 02:22:26,070
I don't know what
happened to Mike. Um, but

2569
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:29,190
Bob used to always get on stage and if
he was really struggling and he'd ham it

2570
02:22:29,191 --> 02:22:31,470
up and go come out ladles
and jellies spoons.

2571
02:22:31,471 --> 02:22:35,510
And I just thought it was the funniest
thing. So here we go. Yeah. Uh,

2572
02:22:35,650 --> 02:22:38,520
Bob and the old timers,

2573
02:22:42,550 --> 02:22:43,383
why,

2574
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:46,550
why or not?

2575
02:22:50,820 --> 02:22:55,170
I look forward to the Huffington
post piece on this. Uh,

2576
02:22:55,230 --> 02:22:58,230
will you drink the whole bottle
if the number goes down to zero?

2577
02:22:59,790 --> 02:23:01,800
I mean that would genuinely
be the end of my life.

2578
02:23:02,610 --> 02:23:04,350
Which you sort of had this all should end,
right?

2579
02:23:04,351 --> 02:23:08,760
Like it should all end on a live stream.
Yeah. Alright. I, here's what I do.

2580
02:23:09,140 --> 02:23:09,440
It's,

2581
02:23:09,440 --> 02:23:14,440
it's seven 24 I'm going to do one check
right now and then at exactly seven 30

2582
02:23:14,701 --> 02:23:18,660
we're deleting this
motherfucker regardless of
what you sons of bitches have

2583
02:23:18,661 --> 02:23:21,180
done.
Here we go.

2584
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:25,590
It's seven 25 I am clicking refresh

2585
02:23:33,310 --> 02:23:37,380
were taken. It's taken some
time. There was no change.

2586
02:23:38,610 --> 02:23:42,210
It did not change. Thank
you. That's all I ask.

2587
02:23:43,610 --> 02:23:45,750
It doesn't have to go down,
although I'd like it to go down,

2588
02:23:45,751 --> 02:23:47,790
but if we refer not to go. All
right, so that's where we're at.

2589
02:23:47,791 --> 02:23:50,960
That's the official number. Aaron, can
you throw back to that thing, Arthur,

2590
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:55,860
this is the final official number.
I have 1,744 patrons.

2591
02:23:56,250 --> 02:24:00,810
Better donating $10,987 a month. I am.
I am. We'll come back here for a sec.

2592
02:24:01,230 --> 02:24:06,230
I am 100% joking aside and completely
acknowledging that the humor and the

2593
02:24:08,160 --> 02:24:11,460
trollish nature of the people
who have donated and last hour,

2594
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:15,660
I am completely appreciative of all the
people that have done this and it's sort

2595
02:24:15,661 --> 02:24:18,780
of hilarious and many of them maybe will
see this video in a week or something.

2596
02:24:18,781 --> 02:24:21,090
People have lives too.
Um,

2597
02:24:21,300 --> 02:24:24,090
so I'm completely appreciative of anyone
that's been part of this thing and a

2598
02:24:24,091 --> 02:24:26,550
shout out to Patrick
and to Mike Right now.

2599
02:24:26,580 --> 02:24:31,530
I'm so appreciative of all that.

2600
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:33,840
We're going to donate this
thing in five minutes.

2601
02:24:33,841 --> 02:24:37,020
And so let me get serious
for just a moment and then a,

2602
02:24:37,021 --> 02:24:39,660
and then we're going to lead this
thing or here. You know what?

2603
02:24:39,661 --> 02:24:43,130
I'll do these two quick questions. Come
on please give Anderson Cooper, c'mon,

2604
02:24:43,160 --> 02:24:44,880
please give.
And the Anderson Cooper and pressure.

2605
02:24:44,890 --> 02:24:48,600
And I was supposed to use the hundred
dollars to surprise to subscribe to Ben

2606
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:52,200
Shapiro, but here I am. And
that's your bureau by the
way. It's his birthday today.

2607
02:24:52,650 --> 02:24:56,130
And because he would not bake me a
gay cake, I did not send him a cake.

2608
02:24:56,131 --> 02:24:58,410
I wanted to send them a cupcake,
but you know,

2609
02:24:58,411 --> 02:25:00,660
if you're not going to bake
me a cake for my gay wedding,

2610
02:25:00,870 --> 02:25:03,870
I'm not going to send you a birthday
cake so you get nothing. Shapiro.

2611
02:25:04,590 --> 02:25:05,940
I left patron as a support,

2612
02:25:05,941 --> 02:25:09,330
the first amendment and they silence
quite a few people. How do I attain a Mug?

2613
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:14,070
You can get a mug if you
go to Dave ruben.com/donate
and you donate $50 a month

2614
02:25:14,400 --> 02:25:17,370
and you can cancel whenever you want,
but if you donate $50 a month to start,

2615
02:25:17,371 --> 02:25:19,710
we'll send you a mug. I shouldn't
have said that because you know,

2616
02:25:19,711 --> 02:25:22,950
we want you to obviously keep donating,
but it is what it is.

2617
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:27,070
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
three minutes left. Love drunk.

2618
02:25:27,071 --> 02:25:30,430
Dave can't believe you didn't get
sick on camera. You're a trooper

2619
02:25:32,220 --> 02:25:33,690
old school.
You know what I'm saying?

2620
02:25:36,930 --> 02:25:39,150
Old School. All right,
we got two minutes left.

2621
02:25:39,180 --> 02:25:41,520
I just want to say really
this has been a pleasure.

2622
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:45,930
There's a huge part of me that wants
to keep this going right now. Um,

2623
02:25:47,010 --> 02:25:49,880
but I know I probably should
not. And I know that, that my,

2624
02:25:49,950 --> 02:25:53,430
my dedicated staff has lives.

2625
02:25:54,210 --> 02:25:58,440
Some of them might want
to get laid tonight or do
whatever they do in their own

2626
02:25:58,441 --> 02:25:59,100
lives.

2627
02:25:59,100 --> 02:26:03,480
So for me to sit here and
continue this insanity would be,

2628
02:26:03,520 --> 02:26:05,430
would be selfish and I
don't want to do that.

2629
02:26:05,431 --> 02:26:07,860
So I've got about two minutes
left more than anything else.

2630
02:26:07,861 --> 02:26:11,390
I genuinely want to thank you guys.
Anyone that forget anyone that's donated,

2631
02:26:11,400 --> 02:26:14,280
knew for a second for any of you that
have donated over the last two and a half

2632
02:26:14,281 --> 02:26:18,780
years. The day that we
started the patriotic thing
and I, and I quit my job at,

2633
02:26:18,781 --> 02:26:23,781
or a TV and my executive producer and
my director quit with me on a lark.

2634
02:26:23,850 --> 02:26:26,880
It truly was a lark.
We did not know what was going to happen.

2635
02:26:27,780 --> 02:26:30,120
And I said to them the
night before, I said, I,

2636
02:26:30,121 --> 02:26:32,130
if I may have screwed up all of our lives,

2637
02:26:32,131 --> 02:26:35,760
like I had worked so hard to get
something and I quitted network so that we

2638
02:26:35,761 --> 02:26:37,680
could do something.
Um,

2639
02:26:38,940 --> 02:26:40,940
we didn't know what was going to
happen in the next morning within it,

2640
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:41,791
within a half hour.

2641
02:26:41,791 --> 02:26:44,490
We knew we were going to be okay
and we've been okay ever since then.

2642
02:26:44,820 --> 02:26:46,230
And there has been ups,
there have been downs,

2643
02:26:46,231 --> 02:26:50,250
the twists and turns that come
along the way. Um, but I've really,

2644
02:26:50,251 --> 02:26:54,690
I truly, I have genuinely tried to do the
best thing that I could along the road.

2645
02:26:54,691 --> 02:26:57,510
I've made mistakes.
I'm not perfect.

2646
02:26:57,530 --> 02:27:02,130
I am open to the same criticism that
Edinburgh, everyone else is open to.

2647
02:27:02,460 --> 02:27:04,890
Um, but I promised you guys,
this is just the beginning.

2648
02:27:05,250 --> 02:27:06,420
It's just the beginning again,

2649
02:27:06,421 --> 02:27:10,380
which is weird that there's something
about life in that at the beginning can

2650
02:27:10,381 --> 02:27:14,040
keep happening if you keep doing
something real. I, I dunno what that is,

2651
02:27:14,310 --> 02:27:17,580
but I actually think it is something
and I'll keep trying to do it the best I

2652
02:27:17,581 --> 02:27:22,560
can. Um, so I thank you guys
for that. Um, well let's see.

2653
02:27:22,830 --> 02:27:23,460
I will ask,

2654
02:27:23,460 --> 02:27:27,120
I will answer one more question and then
it's seven 29 and we're going to delete

2655
02:27:27,570 --> 02:27:31,800
this bitch ass motherfucker
tag team wrestling match,

2656
02:27:32,510 --> 02:27:33,343
Huh?

2657
02:27:34,300 --> 02:27:35,870
Uh Huh.
Uh Huh.

2658
02:27:37,060 --> 02:27:38,440
Tag team wrestling match.

2659
02:27:38,441 --> 02:27:42,640
Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson,

2660
02:27:42,820 --> 02:27:46,000
verse Dave Rubin and Eric
Weinstein who would win.

2661
02:27:46,690 --> 02:27:47,523
Okay.

2662
02:27:48,600 --> 02:27:49,920
I run,
I think this one through.

2663
02:27:49,921 --> 02:27:53,130
And I love the fact that this is the
last thing then I'm going to do before I

2664
02:27:53,131 --> 02:27:55,260
cancel this thing and a shout
out to Michael Real quick.

2665
02:27:57,480 --> 02:28:00,980
Shapiro and Peters and now Dan Shapiro.
[inaudible] Shapiro,

2666
02:28:01,010 --> 02:28:03,660
small by Shapiro.
Fast.

2667
02:28:05,560 --> 02:28:06,710
He'll get you.
Okay,

2668
02:28:07,210 --> 02:28:10,510
now Peterson's got that long
reach and he's got quick hands.

2669
02:28:11,380 --> 02:28:15,010
So you've got quick hands and you got
somebody quick. So this is the last speed.

2670
02:28:16,510 --> 02:28:20,080
Dave Rubin and Eric Lyons name.
I'll do Ruben last.

2671
02:28:20,260 --> 02:28:23,840
That guy's good Weinstein.
Now he can think it through.

2672
02:28:24,710 --> 02:28:28,970
He can think of through and he's got
big hair so he could use his hair as a

2673
02:28:28,971 --> 02:28:33,850
weapon. So now you're looking
at our hair weapons situation.

2674
02:28:34,060 --> 02:28:38,980
I could also envision a situation
where Eric's just gonna plow through a

2675
02:28:38,981 --> 02:28:40,090
Weinstein.
You know what I mean?

2676
02:28:40,091 --> 02:28:43,810
Like they're going to get face to face
and Shapiro was going to be moving fast,

2677
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:47,200
but Eric's just gonna plow
through. Now. You got Ruben?

2678
02:28:48,360 --> 02:28:48,700
Yeah,

2679
02:28:48,700 --> 02:28:50,680
I, I, you know, he's the
most fit of the group.

2680
02:29:05,440 --> 02:29:09,820
Ladies and gentleman,
I'm going to delete Patriot right now.

2681
02:29:11,110 --> 02:29:13,540
I'm going to leave that
decision of that question,

2682
02:29:13,541 --> 02:29:15,160
which is an extremely important question,

2683
02:29:15,250 --> 02:29:19,480
which is about the battle of ideas
and the regressive left and all of it.

2684
02:29:19,570 --> 02:29:22,190
I'm going to leave that, I'm going to
set that down and I'm going to delete.

2685
02:29:22,220 --> 02:29:24,070
Patria my phone is exploding.

2686
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:30,160
My phone is on fire.
I can't show you all of this.

2687
02:29:30,880 --> 02:29:33,640
My phone is actually melting
through the table right now.

2688
02:29:33,790 --> 02:29:38,020
I have a time bomb sitting with
me. It's time to delete. Patrion

2689
02:29:39,550 --> 02:29:43,480
um, in case it's not clear. Thank you
guys. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

2690
02:29:43,481 --> 02:29:44,770
Thank you. Thank you. Whether you,

2691
02:29:44,830 --> 02:29:48,280
whether you donate it on Patrion I in
the past or that you donate now and even

2692
02:29:48,281 --> 02:29:52,780
if you didn't donate, if you, I don't
care. Truly we're going to be okay.

2693
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:56,860
And if you were any part of this part
of the silliness that we've done for the

2694
02:29:56,861 --> 02:29:59,200
last two and a half hours,
um,

2695
02:30:01,670 --> 02:30:02,710
this is as good as it gets.

2696
02:30:02,860 --> 02:30:06,950
This really is as good as you get as far
as anything I know on this universe is

2697
02:30:06,960 --> 02:30:07,793
as good as it gets.

2698
02:30:08,080 --> 02:30:10,440
So I'm going to hit refresh on this thing
one more time and then you're going to

2699
02:30:10,441 --> 02:30:15,340
watch me delete this. So here we go. So
right now after two and a half hours,

2700
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:20,470
we have more money than we started with
and I think more patrons. No, no, no.

2701
02:30:20,471 --> 02:30:23,620
Maybe we lost patrons, but we have more
money. But here we go. I'm refreshing.

2702
02:30:26,130 --> 02:30:30,540
Okay, so we did actually go down to our
and throw to me one more time. Okay.

2703
02:30:30,541 --> 02:30:32,460
So we did actually go down.
So thank you.

2704
02:30:33,630 --> 02:30:35,850
I don't know what happened
here and I don't know why.

2705
02:30:35,880 --> 02:30:38,730
I guess all of these people like it
just is what it is. It is what it is.

2706
02:30:38,820 --> 02:30:41,160
It's all good guys. Thank
you. Really, really,

2707
02:30:41,161 --> 02:30:44,940
I wish I could say this in a way that
could possibly be more genuinely felt that

2708
02:30:44,941 --> 02:30:49,530
I'm possibly saying it right now with
genuinely, genuinely, genuinely thank you.

2709
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:52,130
That is all I can say.
And uh,

2710
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:57,840
this is just the beginning.
So now I'm going to click delete.

2711
02:31:00,420 --> 02:31:04,680
Uh, so I think there's a delete here
somewhere. So I'm going to click settings.

2712
02:31:06,450 --> 02:31:10,580
We're doing it live. Fuck
it. We're doing alive.

2713
02:31:11,720 --> 02:31:14,850
I'm clicking account.
Nope.

2714
02:31:14,890 --> 02:31:19,500
Now I may have to move here for it just
to say it physically because I got to

2715
02:31:19,501 --> 02:31:22,800
scroll. I know there's a way to scroll
without doing it the way I do it.

2716
02:31:22,801 --> 02:31:27,450
Old School. But I do it. Old
School disabled my account.

2717
02:31:28,680 --> 02:31:31,410
Here we go guys. This is it. Careful.

2718
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:33,930
This will permanently
disable your account.

2719
02:31:34,260 --> 02:31:36,960
You won't be able to log in again and
after you do this, oh wait a minute.

2720
02:31:36,961 --> 02:31:37,590
Wait a minute.

2721
02:31:37,590 --> 02:31:41,700
Actually I should do one thing just to
be clear in case that's actually true.

2722
02:31:41,701 --> 02:31:44,520
I don't want them stealing the
money that you guys donated,

2723
02:31:44,521 --> 02:31:47,220
even though I didn't want you
to donate money. So let's do it.

2724
02:31:47,250 --> 02:31:50,130
Let's just knock that out real quick.
Um,

2725
02:31:51,120 --> 02:31:53,340
payout preferences.
So

2726
02:31:57,390 --> 02:32:01,260
in the course of the last two and a half
hours where I've tried to lose money on

2727
02:32:01,261 --> 02:32:02,094
this thing,

2728
02:32:02,250 --> 02:32:06,930
you guys donated $1,452 and 89 cents.

2729
02:32:07,350 --> 02:32:11,760
So thank you. You freaks. So
we're going to send that, oops.

2730
02:32:11,790 --> 02:32:15,960
Don't look at that, Huh?
That's my old Gmail.

2731
02:32:16,380 --> 02:32:20,100
Don't want to see that. Okay. All right,

2732
02:32:20,101 --> 02:32:22,290
so I have nothing in
my patriotic right now.

2733
02:32:23,940 --> 02:32:28,830
And now I'm going to click settings.
Please don't email me.

2734
02:32:29,160 --> 02:32:34,140
I have, you know, other things
going on. Um, okay, so setting

2735
02:32:36,500 --> 02:32:39,690
FedEx. All right. All right. Settle
down. Oop, I, quick messages. No,

2736
02:32:39,691 --> 02:32:42,720
we don't want to see that.
Okay. Ignore that. Sorry.

2737
02:32:44,110 --> 02:32:45,010
Oh Lord.

2738
02:32:46,510 --> 02:32:50,320
Settings. No. Ow. Cricket counts. W what?

2739
02:32:51,540 --> 02:32:56,170
The right
account on the left

2740
02:32:59,350 --> 02:33:03,480
to the right to the right. Oh, God isn't
not a song. Doesn't Beyonce do that? Oh,

2741
02:33:03,481 --> 02:33:04,350
that's to the left.

2742
02:33:05,870 --> 02:33:06,703
What?

2743
02:33:07,960 --> 02:33:12,460
Oh, account. There we
go. All right. All right.

2744
02:33:12,461 --> 02:33:15,130
Here we go.
This is it ladies and gentlemen.

2745
02:33:16,330 --> 02:33:18,040
Drum roll please.

2746
02:33:19,090 --> 02:33:23,860
[inaudible]

2747
02:33:25,790 --> 02:33:29,840
Oh God, please enter your password. Wait,

2748
02:33:30,780 --> 02:33:32,570
I don't know the password.

2749
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:34,570
Okay.

2750
02:33:34,570 --> 02:33:35,403
Yeah.

2751
02:33:37,830 --> 02:33:40,190
Do if someone's going to get
the password. All right, Aaron,

2752
02:33:40,250 --> 02:33:45,170
please come back to camera one.
I'm going to Mosey on in.

2753
02:33:51,820 --> 02:33:52,690
I don't know the password.

2754
02:33:55,370 --> 02:33:59,190
It could be anything for two nine one six,
eight,

2755
02:33:59,191 --> 02:34:03,360
four a, B, c, d, e, f, g,
some combination thereof.

2756
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:07,380
No idea. Uh, I guess
I'll, in the moment we're,

2757
02:34:07,381 --> 02:34:10,580
we're looking for the password and we
have it in a very secure place. Oh,

2758
02:34:10,620 --> 02:34:11,820
I've got a team member.

2759
02:34:12,400 --> 02:34:14,650
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What
are you stupid and you can't say.

2760
02:34:15,750 --> 02:34:16,583
Yeah.

2761
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:22,900
That was literally the dumbest thing
that has ever happened in the history of

2762
02:34:22,901 --> 02:34:26,160
the Internet.
You got to write it down.

2763
02:34:27,450 --> 02:34:28,283
You idiot.

2764
02:34:30,360 --> 02:34:33,840
Can you tell me the password
that was, that was, that was,

2765
02:34:35,460 --> 02:34:37,500
that was the beautiful ending
to this whole thing. All right.

2766
02:34:38,790 --> 02:34:41,730
Now I'm going to have to go back
to this thing. We got the password.

2767
02:34:42,330 --> 02:34:47,130
This is true lunacy. I guess I could
do another shot. Oh, I'm waiting.

2768
02:34:52,730 --> 02:34:53,563
Hmm.

2769
02:34:54,360 --> 02:34:58,530
Oh, it's being written down. All right.
I'm being handed the piece of paper

2770
02:35:01,440 --> 02:35:05,490
off camera. Thank you.
I've been handed the paper,

2771
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:11,280
but damn, that's the password.
Little Shit. Alright,

2772
02:35:13,590 --> 02:35:18,180
here we go. Enter Password.
Submit. Oh, password.

2773
02:35:18,720 --> 02:35:20,730
Okay, good. Here's what
I'm gonna do for a second.

2774
02:35:20,731 --> 02:35:23,250
I'm just going to get in front of the
camera so I can just knock this thing out.

2775
02:35:23,850 --> 02:35:24,810
So here we go.

2776
02:35:33,770 --> 02:35:38,360
Okay.
I have placed the password in the Patrion.

2777
02:35:38,570 --> 02:35:40,580
I am deleting and I remember guys,

2778
02:35:40,581 --> 02:35:44,780
I have about 10,000 bucks a month that
I could just repeat and it clearly

2779
02:35:44,781 --> 02:35:48,890
wouldn't go anywhere and I keep getting
this money. Zippity damn do. Here we go.

2780
02:35:48,950 --> 02:35:49,783
Submit.

2781
02:35:50,890 --> 02:35:51,723
Okay.

2782
02:35:52,560 --> 02:35:55,740
To keep your scarf for God's sakes.
There's my email address again,

2783
02:35:55,741 --> 02:36:00,240
my private one to keep your account safe.
We've sent you an email at blah, blah,

2784
02:36:00,241 --> 02:36:05,140
Blah with the linkedin. Disable
your account. Okay. Hold
that thought. Guys. This is,

2785
02:36:05,170 --> 02:36:09,980
we've entered, we've entered. True.
Yeah. Something or other. Aaron,

2786
02:36:09,981 --> 02:36:12,500
maybe you want to go to the other
camera is my head even in the camera.

2787
02:36:12,580 --> 02:36:14,390
All right. Hey everybody. How are you?

2788
02:36:14,750 --> 02:36:18,180
Dave Rubin trying to delete
my patriotic camp. Okay.

2789
02:36:19,590 --> 02:36:22,950
Okay. We're sorry. We're all
right. Aaron. Here we go.

2790
02:36:24,480 --> 02:36:25,830
We're sorry to see it go.

2791
02:36:25,831 --> 02:36:29,730
You're receiving this email because
you've requested disable your account in

2792
02:36:29,731 --> 02:36:31,680
account settings.
If you didn't request this,

2793
02:36:31,681 --> 02:36:34,890
please contact patriots support to
ensure the security of their can.

2794
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:38,130
I would email them and ask them their
thoughts about a freedom of speech,

2795
02:36:38,131 --> 02:36:41,520
but it's a little late for that. If
you do want a date, sable your account,

2796
02:36:41,521 --> 02:36:42,930
simply click on the disabled.

2797
02:36:42,931 --> 02:36:46,020
My account button below your account will
be permanently disabled and you won't

2798
02:36:46,021 --> 02:36:49,070
be able to log into your patron
account using this user name password.

2799
02:36:49,080 --> 02:36:51,360
It's up to you with the account.
Thanks for checking out.

2800
02:36:51,370 --> 02:36:55,830
Patrion you will be missed in a five four,

2801
02:36:56,040 --> 02:36:58,080
three,
two.

2802
02:37:01,550 --> 02:37:04,160
Oh, for God's sakes, there's
another freaking button.

2803
02:37:06,560 --> 02:37:08,780
Are you sure you want to
disable your patrion account?

2804
02:37:08,781 --> 02:37:13,460
This action cannot be reversed. Let's
keep it going for six more hours. No,

2805
02:37:13,700 --> 02:37:14,533
here we go.

2806
02:37:19,330 --> 02:37:23,320
Oh, you've got to be fucking
kidding me. There was a problem.

2807
02:37:23,321 --> 02:37:26,020
Disabling your account.
You disabled link may have expired.

2808
02:37:26,021 --> 02:37:29,380
Please visit your account
settings and try. Unbelievable.

2809
02:37:31,820 --> 02:37:34,730
Unbelievable. You gotta be kidding
me. You gotta be kidding me.

2810
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:39,110
Busy your account settings. All right,
hang tight. People go to account settings.

2811
02:37:40,730 --> 02:37:44,500
Let's try that again.
You gotta be kidding me?

2812
02:37:46,970 --> 02:37:50,960
Disabled my account.
I'm putting the password in again.

2813
02:37:51,770 --> 02:37:52,910
Jesus Christ.

2814
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:00,140
Hold on.
Hold on.

2815
02:38:07,910 --> 02:38:11,750
We sent your email. All right, well now
that you all have my private emails it,

2816
02:38:11,780 --> 02:38:13,880
that's wonderful.
We'll be changing that one soon.

2817
02:38:13,881 --> 02:38:17,170
Enough confirmation needed.

2818
02:38:18,500 --> 02:38:20,120
Got It.
Zero minutes ago.

2819
02:38:20,121 --> 02:38:24,680
We're sorry to see you
go disabled my account.

2820
02:38:26,430 --> 02:38:28,380
Yes.
Disabled my account.

2821
02:38:35,810 --> 02:38:39,230
Aaron,
come back to the one shot.

2822
02:38:45,420 --> 02:38:46,253
Okay.

2823
02:38:49,620 --> 02:38:50,453
Okay.

2824
02:38:52,300 --> 02:38:53,133
Yeah,

2825
02:38:55,980 --> 02:39:00,330
I'll be on patrion forever.
All right.

2826
02:39:00,390 --> 02:39:02,130
I don't know what the
hell is going on here.

2827
02:39:02,270 --> 02:39:03,110
Uh,

2828
02:39:03,990 --> 02:39:08,850
I promise you I will delete this
fucking thing whenever I can.

2829
02:39:09,360 --> 02:39:12,810
This is, this is actually a perfect
ending to this whole story, right?

2830
02:39:13,290 --> 02:39:16,080
Like this is the way these companies
operate. If I emailed this,

2831
02:39:16,081 --> 02:39:18,630
these people tomorrow,
they would not respond to me.

2832
02:39:18,840 --> 02:39:22,380
I'd have to publicly shame them on Twitter
like I do with youtube all the time.

2833
02:39:22,381 --> 02:39:26,520
I wouldn't be able to get in touch with
the person, all of these stupid things.

2834
02:39:26,790 --> 02:39:30,780
Um, all right, let's not worry about it.
I think you guys got the point. I mean,

2835
02:39:31,490 --> 02:39:36,490
what are ridiculously anticlimactic yet
totally fitting ending to all of this.

2836
02:39:37,680 --> 02:39:42,630
Um, I would try one more time, but I think
you guys, we illustrated the point here,

2837
02:39:42,631 --> 02:39:45,750
so is what it is.
Um,

2838
02:39:47,550 --> 02:39:51,450
so on that moat, uh, on that note, um,

2839
02:39:53,560 --> 02:39:55,840
I genuinely have nothing but
thanks for you guys. That's it.

2840
02:39:56,320 --> 02:39:59,470
I got nothing but thanks. Thank you
guys. Thank you for my team that,

2841
02:39:59,950 --> 02:40:02,790
that helped me make this
whole thing happen today. And,

2842
02:40:02,860 --> 02:40:05,690
and since we started this whole operation,
uh,

2843
02:40:05,700 --> 02:40:09,160
I thank everybody that was
part of this craziness today,

2844
02:40:09,161 --> 02:40:12,880
whether it was on super chat or
Patrion or wherever it was. Um,

2845
02:40:14,470 --> 02:40:15,303
yeah,
I got,

2846
02:40:15,310 --> 02:40:19,840
I got a bottle of Patrona and a patriotic
count I can't get rid of and there in

2847
02:40:19,841 --> 02:40:22,950
lies and incredible story,
uh,

2848
02:40:23,020 --> 02:40:26,350
which will probably make it into my
book that I'm writing right now. So, uh,

2849
02:40:26,890 --> 02:40:30,930
you guys saw it happen live so,
so genuinely thank you and

2850
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:31,913
Yah,

2851
02:40:33,870 --> 02:40:37,170
wait a minute. We will wait.
Jordan deleted his account

2852
02:40:39,230 --> 02:40:42,980
so Jordan was able to lead an
account and I can delete my account.

2853
02:40:50,010 --> 02:40:53,190
Yeah. Alright. Alright,
I'm deleting this account.

2854
02:40:53,191 --> 02:40:57,450
Please never come back to the
patrion.com/rubin report page. Um,

2855
02:40:57,510 --> 02:41:00,480
fight for what you believe in, even if
it's not the things that I believe in,

2856
02:41:00,481 --> 02:41:03,240
but fight for them honestly
and forthrightly. Fourth,

2857
02:41:03,480 --> 02:41:07,500
rightly and uh,
and decently,

2858
02:41:07,501 --> 02:41:10,530
and understand that you're supposed
to live in a country with people that

2859
02:41:10,531 --> 02:41:13,060
disagree with you.
We'll keep having these conversations.

2860
02:41:13,110 --> 02:41:14,280
This really is just the beginning.

2861
02:41:14,281 --> 02:41:15,900
Jordan and I are going
to build something great.

2862
02:41:16,170 --> 02:41:19,530
There's all sorts of steps in the,
along the road to make this happen.

2863
02:41:19,740 --> 02:41:24,090
I think you got the point already
and, and thank you. And uh,

2864
02:41:24,180 --> 02:41:25,020
I have to pee

2865
02:41:25,430 --> 02:41:25,920
good night.
