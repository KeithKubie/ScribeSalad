00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The φ(831) equals 552.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We can calculate this by seeing that

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
831 = 277  3

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and 277 and 3 are both prime.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We showed in lecture the φ(pq) = (p - 1)(q - 1).

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And so the totient of 831 = 276  2

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which equals 552.
