00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the correct answer, if you remember this from the browser question,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is none of them.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Databases are very similar to browsers in that there are many of them,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and they all behave a little bit differently, and they all have their place

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
for solving different types of problems.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's not uncommon for large websites to actually use multiple websites.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We'll be using the Google App Engine Datastore for most of our stuff,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but using Google App Engine doesn't limit you to this.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I think they also even provide some sort of MySQL interface,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
if that's what you prefer to use.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The answer is there is no best database.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
There is certainly the most popular database,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
which is probably MySQL, of this list,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but there's definitely no best.
