1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,290
This is introduction to New
Testament history and literature.

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:09,090
My name is Dale Martin. I've been
teaching here at Yale for 10 years now.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,020
I also was a Grad student here in the
80s in the religious studies department.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,460
I then left taught one year at
Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,140
Then I taught 11 years at Duke and got
in love with their basketball team,

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,530
but then I came to Yale in 1999 this is
a course that introduces you to the New

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,030
Testament literature,

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,410
but also the history of other material
from the very first 100 years or so of

9
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:35,250
early Christianity.

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,730
The first question you need to ask
yourself is why do you want or why you

11
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:45,510
thinking about taking this course? Why is
do you want to study the New Testament?

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,270
What is the New Testament
and why should you study it?

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,920
The first obvious answer there are a lot
of people would give is because I'm a

14
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:56,430
Christian or I believe that New Testament
scripture and therefore I'm here to

15
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,910
learn more about this document.
That is scripture for me in my church.

16
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,500
The problem with that answer is
before you say something is scripture.

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,900
You have to say,
why is it scripture?

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,700
For whom is it scripture and what
does that mean? And in Christianity,

19
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,500
when you call the Bible scripture,

20
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:16,650
what that means is that you're going
to listen to it for the word of God.

21
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:21,450
You're expecting somehow the holy spirit
or God to communicate to you and to

22
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:23,790
your church,
into your community through this document.

23
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,590
But script the text of the
Bible isn't scripture in itself.

24
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,950
It's only scripture to a community
of people who take it as scripture.

25
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,760
The text itself,
any text is not itself holy writing.

26
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,740
That's what scripture means towards.

27
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:40,770
It actually just means
written stuff from the Latin.

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,320
But we take it to mean holy writings,
sacred writing,

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,610
but the writing itself is not holy. It's
only holy to people who take it as holy.

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,170
Now, the problem is we're at Yale
College. This is not a holy place.

31
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,550
I know they might've told you that when
you came, but you've learned differently,

32
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:59,370
haven't you? Uh, this
is also not a church.

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,970
So what does it mean to read the New
Testament as scripture is not something

34
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:06,450
we're going to really pursue in this
class because this is not a religious

35
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:07,284
community.

36
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,260
So one of the things that if you're
here to learn about the new testament

37
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:14,160
because it's scripture, the class may
disappoint you from that point of view.

38
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,010
Somebody else might say,
uh Oh,

39
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:21,750
I'm here because this is a foundational
document for Western civilization and I

40
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:23,280
want to know something about the Bible.

41
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,430
There are probably some more seats over
here are some of you need to can go sit

42
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:29,220
on the steps over there if you
need to make your way around,

43
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,530
can they get behind you? But
what does that mean? Also,

44
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:38,010
if you say that the Bible
is a foundational document
for Western civilization,

45
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,180
does that mean you can't really get
along in Western civilization unless you

46
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:47,181
know something about the Bible and think
about that isn't a knowledge of lots of

47
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:52,080
other things, much more important for how
you get along in Western civilization.

48
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,510
Then knowing that the new testament,
for example,

49
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,460
it's much more important
to know about cars.

50
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,010
It'd be actually much more valuable for
you to know how to fix your car than it

51
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:01,480
is to know about the New Testament,
right?

52
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,690
If you're going to getting
along in Western civilization
or how to use computers

53
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,710
or sexual technique or how
to speak other languages,

54
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,970
there are all kinds of things that it
might be very useful for you to know as an

55
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:16,570
inhabitant of Western civilization and
the New Testament you might find out

56
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:21,460
would rank kind of down on the list of
those kinds of things. Besides that,

57
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,630
okay, let's take a quiz first. Got a
piece of paper. This is your first exam.

58
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:27,940
This will determine your grade
for the rest of the semester.

59
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,110
Tell me if this is in the new testament
is in the Bible or is not in the Bible.

60
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,920
All right. Just a yes or no question
you. All you need is 10 places to write,

61
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:43,090
yes or no. You could even
abbreviate and put wire in first.

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,170
Which of these things are in the Bible?
The Immaculate Conception,

63
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,450
the Immaculate Conception. Now, you
may not know anything about the Bible.

64
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,840
If you don't know, just kind
of guess. Just make a guess,

65
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,800
but I'm not actually going to grade.
These is the immaculate conception,

66
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:03,400
something that's in the
Bible to this quotation.

67
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,960
Love bears. All things, believes
all things, hopes all things,

68
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,770
endures all things is that
quotation in the Bible.

69
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,000
Love bears all things, believes
all things, hopes all things,

70
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,110
endures all things.
Three at Jesus's birth,

71
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,230
three wise men or three
kings visited the baby.

72
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,450
Jesus is that in the Bible

73
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,100
for this quotation from each according
to his ability to each according to his

74
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:34,454
need,

75
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,640
from each according to his ability
to each according to his need. Fifth,

76
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,570
the doctrine of the
trinity is in the Bible.

77
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,750
Sixth this quotation, you are Peter, and
upon this rock I will build my church.

78
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,420
Seven Peter founded the church in
Rome and the Bible not in the Bible.

79
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,320
Peter founded the church in Rome.
Make a guess. Eight after his death,

80
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:09,170
Jesus appeared to his disciples in
Jerusalem. Is that in the Bible?

81
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,680
After his death, Jesus appeared
to his disciples in Jerusalem.

82
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,920
No talking with your neighbor
night after his death,

83
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,230
Jesus appeared to his disciples
in Galilee. After his death,

84
00:05:24,231 --> 00:05:29,070
Jesus appeared to his disciples
in Galilee, 10th and last.

85
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,150
Okay. Peter was martyred by
being crucified upside down.

86
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,610
Oh, hard one. Okay, let's go back.

87
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:43,240
Number one is the macula conception in
the Bible. How many people think so? Yes.

88
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,050
How many people say no,
it's not in the Bible.

89
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,660
Somebody tell me what the immaculate
conception is. You might know.

90
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,590
Yes. Mary's conception, Mary's conception.

91
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,510
It doesn't refer to the
miraculous conception of Jesus.

92
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,450
That's what often people think. C,
one of the things about these courses,

93
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,160
you'll learn a lot about
the Bible and Christianity,

94
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:07,520
but the most important thing is you
learn cocktail party conversation tips.

95
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,960
So think about, you know, you really
want to impress that girl you're with,

96
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:12,561
you know,
hey,

97
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:15,530
did you know that a lot of people think
that the immaculate conception refers to

98
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:18,080
the conception of Jesus?
It doesn't.

99
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,070
There are firstly the conception of
Mary as being without original sin.

100
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,840
Immaculate means without stain.
So at first, the conception
of Mary by her mother,

101
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:30,020
Anna. Uh, without that,
the according to tradition,

102
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,310
without being Trent, without original
sin being transferred to marry.

103
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,590
And that's because according
to Roman Catholic tradition,

104
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,190
then she could transmit the birth
of Jesus without original sin. Also.

105
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,300
Now that's not actually in the Bible
is part of Roman Catholic doctrine.

106
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:45,740
It's something that
Protestants don't accept,

107
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,130
but a lot of people think it's one in
the d in the Bible or a lot of people

108
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:52,130
confuse it with the morass,
miraculous conception of Jesus,

109
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,970
which is in the Bible and the Gospel of
Luke and the Gospel of Matthew Second,

110
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,210
uh, love bears all things believes
all things, hopes all things,

111
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,950
endures all things.
How many people say it's in the Bible?

112
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,270
Can anybody tell me where? Come on.
There's got be some funds in here.

113
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,370
First Corinthians 13, good Sunday
school of Education. Three,

114
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,180
three wise men are kings, visited
the baby, Jesus and the Bible,

115
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,110
not in the Bible.
How many people say it's not in the Bible?

116
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,130
You say it's not in the Bible.
Why? I guess you have no idea.

117
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,710
It's not in the Bible.

118
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,570
It's true that Wiseman or kings did visit
Jesus in the Gospel of Eh, of Gospel,

119
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:33,080
of Matthew. But it's only tradition
that says that it's three of them.

120
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,360
Why was the tradition developed that there
were three kings have visited the, uh,

121
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,200
the manger of Jesus? Yes. Yes.
The gifts. There are three gifts,

122
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:44,870
gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
And so tradition just said, well,

123
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:47,840
if there are three gifts, there must be
three kings. So that's why we have that.

124
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:48,680
But it's not in the Bible.

125
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,270
This quotation from each according to
his ability to each according to his need

126
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:57,500
in the Bible. Raise your hand, not
in the Bible. Raise your hand. Ah,

127
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:02,420
couldn't trick you. Does anybody know
where it is from? Yes. Yes. Marks.

128
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,521
It's from marks,

129
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:06,710
but a lot of people will hear that
and I think that's from the Bible.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,320
The doctrine of the trinity in the Bible,
not in the Bible.

131
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,290
Okay. Why are all you people saying the
doctor's attorneys not in the Bible?

132
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,240
That's usually a real good one.
Somebody explaining why the doctrine,

133
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:21,050
the trinity is not in the Bible.
You're right. It's not in the Bible.

134
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,550
I thought it was thought up by
the church to explain the paradox.

135
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,541
Exactly.

136
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:30,080
The doctrine of the trinity is a doctrine
that developed post New Testament

137
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,320
Times to explain why Christians
were worshiping Jesus.

138
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:36,110
And the Holy Spirit also is
divine. So they, the doctor,

139
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,690
the trinity developed in the
later centuries afternoon tea.

140
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,860
Now some people will say,

141
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,060
at least the doctrine of the trinity
has hinted at in the Bible and that the

142
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:47,540
later church was correct to read the
New Testament too, to support it.

143
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,220
And that may be,
I'll be right theologically,

144
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,060
but red historically it's not in the
Bible. Uh, you are my, you are Peter.

145
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:56,040
And upon this rock, I will build my
church. How people say it's in the Bible.

146
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,140
How many people say it's not in the Bible?

147
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,520
It's in the Bible says in Matthew 16,

148
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,700
seven Peter founded the church in Rome
is in the Bible. Y'All are insurance.

149
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:11,910
Is it not in the Bible? Uh, more people
say it's not in the Bible. You're right,

150
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,950
is not in the Bible.
It's part of tradition.

151
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,400
And it's very strong part of Christian
tradition. But it's not in the Bible.

152
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,120
After his death, Jesus appeared to his
disciples in Jerusalem, in the Bible.

153
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,770
Raise your hand. A few people,
not in the Bible. You're wrong.

154
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:30,750
It is in the Bible. It's in the gospel
of Luke and acts. After his death,

155
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:34,110
Jesus appeared to his disciples in
Galilee. Is that in the Bible? Yes.

156
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:35,640
Some of you say yes.
Not In the Bible.

157
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,760
Anybody brave enough to say it's not
in the Bible. It is in the Bible.

158
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,830
It's in the Bible Incident,
the gospel of Matthew,

159
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,770
but now notice the gospel of
Matthew is we'll talk about later.

160
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,190
Has Jesus appears to his
disciples only in Galilee,

161
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,150
not in Judea and the
gospel of Luke and acts.

162
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,010
Have Jesus appeared to his disciples
only in Judea but not in Galilee.

163
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,560
Ah,
that's an interesting problem.

164
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,620
We will have to get to at
some point 10th and last.

165
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,300
Peter was martyred by being crucified
upside down in the Bible are not in the

166
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:10,500
Bible, in the Bible, not in the
Bible. The Not in the Bible is habit.

167
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,680
It's not in the Bible, but it's a very
important part of Christian tradition.

168
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,020
Now that I did a little quiz.

169
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,350
These are all things that a lot of
people out there would say, oh yeah,

170
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:21,870
that's in the Bible or it sounds like
something that should be in the Bible,

171
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,300
right?
Most of them aren't.

172
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,540
Or about half of them I think are
not in the Bible and yet they're very

173
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,060
important for the history
of Western civilization.

174
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:31,740
They're important for
people's conceptions.

175
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,480
They're important for the history of art.

176
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,250
How many paintings are there of Peter
Crucified upside down or depictions in

177
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:39,084
western art.

178
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,990
So it's very important for someone to
know that there is an important tradition

179
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:44,910
about Peter being crucified upside down,

180
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,140
but it's not a part of the new testament.
It illustrates again, uh, this,

181
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:54,141
this idea that how much of this ancient
text is an important for you to know on

182
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:56,190
its own terms,

183
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:59,850
in its historical context in the first
century or how it was important for you

184
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:03,000
to know in the way it's been
interpreted for the last 2000 years.

185
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,140
And what I am telling you
is kind of contrary to the
way I'm going to teach this

186
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:07,974
course.

187
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,370
I'm actually advertising against myself
and there'll be fewer of you here next

188
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,890
time. Right. Contrary to
way outreach discourse,

189
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:17,280
which is more on the history of the
first century of these documents and how

190
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:19,110
they,
what they meant in the first century.

191
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,980
The sometimes the most important thing
about the Bible is its impact on the

192
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:26,540
later history and that's something that
we'll talk about from time to time in

193
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,100
the class, but it's something
you'd get more out of. For example,

194
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:31,830
if you studied art history class,

195
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:35,790
if you studied literature class that
talked about some of these issues in later

196
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:39,540
European times, we could, I could
illustrate with a lot more other things.

197
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,500
For example,
if I said,

198
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,790
what do most people about believe about
what happens to you after you're dead

199
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,220
and you'd get lots of different
ads or you're dead like rover,

200
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:49,800
you're dead all over.
Some people say you go to heaven.

201
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:52,440
Some people have all kinds of
different things. Most if I said,

202
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,340
what do you think Christian religious
people believe about what happens to you

203
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,850
after you're dead? In other words
where his aunt Martha at the funeral,

204
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,690
while she's up with the arms of
Jesus, she's safe in heaven. She,

205
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,590
her soul is there.

206
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,370
Most people would say that Christians
are religious people believe in the

207
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:13,690
immortality of the soul and that is part
of a good bit of Christian doctrine.

208
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,980
That again is not something that's
in the Bible really. Uh, so,

209
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:22,150
and it's not even the best interpretation
of official Christian Orthodoxy

210
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,400
according to official Christian Orthodoxy,
the form of,

211
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,590
of your afterlife existence is
the resurrection of the body.

212
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,410
That's what the new testament talks about.

213
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:34,540
Either the resurrection of the flesh
or the resurrection of the body.

214
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,500
That's contrary to what most people
kind of assume is what people believe.

215
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,770
The point about this and where do they
get the idea of the immortality of the

216
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:45,550
soul, much more from Plato.
So again, it raises the issue.

217
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,520
If you want to know more about the
most influential aspects for Western

218
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,593
civilization,

219
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:55,180
would it be better for you to take an
entire semester on Plato than it would on

220
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,720
the New Testament?
I'm saying it might actually,

221
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,920
the ironic fact is because the new
testament is considered more important by

222
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:03,430
people.

223
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,060
There are a whole lot more people who
take my new testament classes then go over

224
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:08,980
to the classics department
and take a course in Plato.

225
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,610
I'm not sure that's the way it should be,
but that's the way it is.

226
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,970
What this does is it brings up
this issue of why are you here?

227
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:20,170
What do you hope to get out of this
course and I want you to understand the

228
00:13:20,171 --> 00:13:22,030
method that will pursue in the course.

229
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:27,790
My point is to get you to see that
when we study this text in this class,

230
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,110
we're not going to be
studying it necessarily as
scripture as the word of God.

231
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,620
We're not going to be studying it
necessarily for how important it was for

232
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:38,140
medieval and early modern literature.
For example.

233
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,710
We're going to look at what it
meant in the first century. In fact,

234
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:45,040
what I'm going to try to do is get you
to come at the new testament from the

235
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:45,874
outside.

236
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,440
I've been teaching this stuff for 20
years and I think I tend to find two basic

237
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:55,240
kinds of students who shot my classes for
the new testament introduction course.

238
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,560
One of them are the kinds of students
who grew up in a religious household.

239
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:00,490
They went to church.

240
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,060
They may have even taken a lot of Sunday
school and so they feel like they know

241
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:07,420
these texts for at least a Sunday
school at Church kind of point of view.

242
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,670
And some ways they kind of feel like,
okay,

243
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:13,300
I know what the New Testament is and I
already know sort of what I think about

244
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:13,930
it.

245
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,080
There are other people who come to these
classes who grew up in a nonreligious,

246
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,500
uh, uh, context. They know nothing about
this. They've never read the Bible.

247
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,000
And they come in and they think,
well,

248
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:24,940
I'm taking it because I don't know
anything about it. But oddly enough,

249
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,220
because they've been
raised in our society,

250
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,330
they still actually come at this text
with some kind of pre knowledge of the

251
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:35,560
text. They have a conception of what the
Bible is. They have a conception of what,

252
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:37,270
who Jesus is,
who Paul is.

253
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:42,570
And so they're coming at the text already
with some kind of familiarity with the

254
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:45,640
topic,
at least in there in a popular conception.

255
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,540
Now the reason that is true is because
we live in a post Christian culture and

256
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:55,310
both aspects of that
termers are important.

257
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,810
It's post Christian in the sense that you,

258
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,190
it's hard to live in America without
having some kind of exposure to

259
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:05,750
Christianity and without seeing its
influence on our society, on our politics,

260
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,940
on our culture and our art
and that sort of thing.

261
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,240
But it's also post Christian because you
can no longer assume in this culture,

262
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:15,440
especially in a multi valence
poly, uh, Ho polyethylene,

263
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:20,270
poly ethnic, ethnic, poly,
ethnic, uh, situation like Yale,

264
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,310
that everybody here is
going to be Christian.

265
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,700
So we were in this kind of situation where
we have the hangovers of Christianity

266
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,930
still occupying the culture without
necessarily knowing a lot about it.

267
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,760
So I'm going to ask you to come at the
new testament though from the outside.

268
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,530
If you feel like you
know something about it,

269
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,440
put those aside for the moment
because when, when we do,

270
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,070
the class will be trying to get you to
see this document as if for the first

271
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:49,310
time to see early Christianity
completely as if for the first time.

272
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,020
So let's do a little practice run
through this for come with me now.

273
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,750
Open up your new testament is you're just
going to look at it and we're going to

274
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:59,480
go through a rush little survey
through the New Testament.

275
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,550
How would it strike you if
you knew nothing about it,

276
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,020
if you'd never heard of it before?

277
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,270
If you open up the covers of
this book for the first time,

278
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,530
the very beginning is the gospel
of Matthew and it starts like this.

279
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,950
The book of the origin or the genesis
is the Greek word of Jesus Christ,

280
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,950
son of David, son of Abraham.
Abraham had a son named Isaac.

281
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,850
Isaac had a son named Jacob.
Jacob had Judah and his brothers.

282
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,930
Judah had fairies and Zara from Tamar.
And you know how this goes, right?

283
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:33,620
This is the begats. The famous begets
that. Start the the gospel of Matthew.

284
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,360
So and so begat so and so begat so and so.

285
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:39,470
And it goes on like this for sentences
and sentences. And as a modern person,

286
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:43,340
you're going, what is this? What,
what, what's going on with this?

287
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,400
And then you get to the
birth narratives in Matthew,

288
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,230
the stories of the baby Jesus. If you
lived during the time of Matthew himself,

289
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,740
all of this stuff would seem fairly
familiar to the idea that famous,

290
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,320
that kings would come from
far off and see a star.

291
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,690
And that meant that the birth
of someone great had been born.

292
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,360
This is actually part of propaganda
culture of the ancient world.

293
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,820
If you are an ancient person and you
picked up the gospel of Matthew and you

294
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:08,330
heard these stories about these kings
from the east following a star and

295
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:12,200
arriving and finding this baby, uh,
that would sound, oh, you know, okay,

296
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:15,620
this is gonna be somebody great. This is
telling you that this is him, his self,

297
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:18,210
a king or somebody. Great.
So it would, it would be,

298
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:20,240
it would sound familiar to
you in the ancient world.

299
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,730
Then you'd go on and read the
rest of the gospel of Matthew.

300
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,660
It's a story of a man who
travels around giving speeches,

301
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:31,190
sometimes talking to people or teaching.
He's exercising demons,

302
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,930
performance, a few miracles.
He heals people. And again,

303
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,750
to us in the modern world,
if you didn't already had some,

304
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,950
some exposure to religious narratives
like this, that would sound odd.

305
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,450
In the ancient world,

306
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:48,050
actually it would've sounded familiar
because there were other stories of other

307
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:52,980
kinds of teachers who'd healed and
exercise demons and perform miracles.

308
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,490
That was not an uncommon way to talk about
someone who was supposed to be great,

309
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,500
but then you get to the next book in the
New Testament, the gospel of mark. Well,

310
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:05,550
it's kind of the same story. It's shorter.
There's less, fewer teachings in it,

311
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,360
but so why do you have the second
chapter of this book retail?

312
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:12,890
The same story that the first chapter of
the book told the Gospel of [inaudible].

313
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,550
Same thing. You get to the gospel
of John. John's kind of different,

314
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,710
it sounds different. There's
a different style, but again,

315
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:21,570
it's the same story of this same guy.

316
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:25,890
Why do you have four different chapters
of this book? All telling the same story.

317
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,240
That's odd in itself from our point
of view or it should look odd to us.

318
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,800
Then you get to the acts of the apostles.
Now we're back on more familiar ground.

319
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,060
It starts off like the gospel of Luke
is because it's written by the same guy

320
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:42,750
who wrote the gospel of Luke and in
fact it starts off with a paragraph that

321
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:45,750
kind of encapsulates the way it was,
how the gospel of Luke ended,

322
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,500
you know like TV shows last time on er,

323
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,980
and this is the way the acts of the
apostle begin last time and Luke it into

324
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:56,730
this way. Now we're going to take
up our heroes at their next point.

325
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,010
Then it starts sounding like a Greco
Roman novel and I have to tell you

326
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:05,190
something about novels. In the ancient
world, there were Greek and Latin novels,

327
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,700
Greek novels.
Usually we're about a man and a woman,

328
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,620
young rich who see each other and fall
madly in love and passionately wanted one

329
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:15,810
another and they might get married to,
they might not get married,

330
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:19,170
but they don't get to consummate
their [inaudible]. Instead,

331
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,930
one of them gets kidnapped
or has to go off to war,

332
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,310
are captured by pirates and she's taken
over by pirates and sold into slavery

333
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:29,310
and she goes all the way
around the Mediterranean and
the young man follows her

334
00:19:29,311 --> 00:19:31,650
around the Mediterranean and
chapter after chapter after chapter.

335
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,100
They always almost connect
and almost get to have sex.

336
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,820
And then no there she's bought by somebody
else and taken it into another slave

337
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:40,860
job or he's captured by pirates.

338
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:44,730
And so the whole novel is them chasing
each other around the Mediterranean with

339
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:49,731
shipwrecks and battles and miracles
and God's intervening and all kinds of

340
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:53,640
stuff. And that's what the acts of
the apostle kinds of looks like.

341
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:55,500
It looks like an ancient Greek novel,

342
00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:00,590
except it lacks the one thing
every good Greek novel had sex.

343
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,030
The acts of the apostles doesn't have sex.
You might be disappointed there,

344
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,690
but you also have other things that
the novels don't have such as the Holy

345
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,250
Spirit being the main
actor for the whole thing.

346
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,640
But notice that would look kind of
familiar to you in the ancient world.

347
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,660
It definitely looks odd to you in the
modern world if you don't read it as the

348
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:20,490
Bible and if you just
read it as literature,

349
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,390
and we also realized that the
acts of the apostles is ms titled,

350
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,160
it's not the acts of the apostles is
the axe basically a Paul and Paul is not

351
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,370
considered an apostle by the guy
who wrote the acts of the apostles.

352
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,530
This is another little clue here.

353
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:38,820
We will learn this semester the titles of
most of the books in the New Testament.

354
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,860
We're not put there by their authors.

355
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,580
They were put there by later Christian
scribes. This will be very important.

356
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,460
Then you get to the letters of,
and it's,

357
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:51,730
is it strange that most of the New
Testament are actually letters?

358
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,530
They're not like modern letters. There
are quite a bit like ancient letters.

359
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,920
They're usually addressed to groups
of people and they deal with sort of

360
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:04,030
philosophical sounding issues and
they'd give advice on group problems.

361
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,130
Then you get to the epistle to the Hebrews
or in what a better translation would

362
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:10,990
be the letter to the Jews.

363
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,650
What's odd about it is as you
read this epistle to the Hebrews,

364
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,600
you realize two things. Number one, it's
not a letter, it's actually a sermon.

365
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,490
In fact,
it doesn't even claim to be a letter.

366
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,440
It looks just like a sermon and you
realize this is not really addressed to

367
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:27,240
Jews.
It's,

368
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,930
it seems to be addressed to gentile
Christians to convince them that Jesus

369
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:35,500
provides for them a liturgy
that is superior to Judaism.

370
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,830
It's actually neither a letter
nor is it addressed to Jews.

371
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,660
This leads to an insight though by this
time when you're surveying your New

372
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:48,280
Testament, these letters seem
to be meant to be read out loud,

373
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,700
so what we'll, we'll ask this over
and over again in the semester.

374
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:55,330
What would it mean to re read this
letter out loud in a community,

375
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,110
not alone in your dorm room or
just by yourself in the library.

376
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,250
Then you get to first Peter.
It's written not to one place,

377
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,950
but it's a circular letter
meant to be circulated around.

378
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,270
Then you get to second and third John
Two letters that are written to the

379
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:13,690
elected lady and her children.
What does that mean?

380
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,100
Then finally you get to the
revelation of John the apocalypse.

381
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,060
The word revelation is just the Latinized
English version of the Greek word

382
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:26,350
apocalypse and the apocalypse
just means opening up revelation.

383
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,140
This document is really bizarre.

384
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,620
It's not like anything you've
confronted so far in the New Testament.

385
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,570
It starts off with a narrative about
a vision. This guy named John says,

386
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:42,040
I was on the island of Patmos.
I was in the Lord's Day.

387
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,590
I started having this vision and this
angel should've been. This all happened.

388
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,550
Then it has several letters,
seven different letters,

389
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,690
very short letters addressed to several
to seven different Christian churches

390
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:57,070
and then it goes into
this wild video game,

391
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,650
MTV style narrative of a heavenly
journey of this Guy John.

392
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:05,950
He goes up into the heavens. He
sees the Throne Room of God. He's,

393
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,940
he's weird kinds of beasts and animals
that have like their bodies of lambs,

394
00:23:09,941 --> 00:23:12,700
but they've got horns and they're
bleeding all over the place.

395
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,710
It's a story of catastrophes.

396
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,080
It's a story of a cosmic battle between
forces of good and forces of evil is

397
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:23,590
like several installments of Star
Wars and finally it ends up with the

398
00:23:23,591 --> 00:23:26,680
establishment of a new
world and a new city of God.

399
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,800
Now that's a long way.
That's the end of the New Testament.

400
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,870
That's a long way from the little baby
Jesus and the three kings in Matthew,

401
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:39,610
isn't it? But the new testament includes
all that kind of diverse literature,

402
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,240
27 different books written anywhere from
the year 50 to the year one 50 so a 100

403
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:51,410
year period of time that these
books were probably written in.

404
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:56,150
They have different points of
view, different situations,
different theologies,

405
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:00,500
different genres.
They use confusing inhouse language.

406
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,190
I'll point out that in house language
throughout the semester and we'll talk

407
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:07,460
about how to be,
how it should be interpreted and these,

408
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:12,461
these texts almost defy interpretation
by a modern person unless you have

409
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:16,210
guidance from a historian
and expert like Moi,

410
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,570
let's do this little trick again instead
of looking at the documents from the

411
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:21,180
outside,

412
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,890
let's look at what would
an early Christian Church
look like if you would just

413
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:27,440
stumble upon them.
Little imagination.

414
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,350
Let's pretend that you're a seamstress.

415
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,980
You work in a clothing shop in the city
of Corinth in Greece in the year 56 a

416
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:42,941
guy next door to you named Fred and
works in a leather factory next door.

417
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:49,040
He has just joined a new club and he's
going to tell you all about it. First,

418
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,080
they don't meet in the daytime.

419
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,590
They meet either early before light
in da at dawn or after dark at night.

420
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:02,060
There's only enough of them to
fill a decent size dining room,

421
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,450
but they call themselves the town meeting.

422
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,510
You're not sure what they
do at these meetings.

423
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,870
They don't appear to worship any
God or goddess that you can see.

424
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,290
They use the term God sometimes,

425
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,300
but this God doesn't have a name.
And that's very bizarre to you.

426
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,680
Remember you're pretending you're a
Greek person living in the year 56 in

427
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:28,670
Corinth. In fact, these people don't
look like they believe in gods at all.

428
00:25:28,671 --> 00:25:29,870
They looked like atheists.

429
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:36,530
They have a very high respect
for a criminal Jew who
led some kind of guerrilla

430
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:40,100
war and was executed along
ago somewhere in Syria.

431
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:46,100
Fred says though,
that this Jew is still alive somewhere.

432
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:50,270
In fact, Fred says that, that
you bought him though he didn't.

433
00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:52,400
You didn't know that Fred was
even ever a slave. In fact,

434
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:53,930
you're pretty sure the
slave wasn't a slave.

435
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:57,650
So what does it mean that this guy
bought him at these town meetings?

436
00:25:57,651 --> 00:26:01,640
They eat meals, which is not unusual since
most clubs in your society eat meals,

437
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,370
but they call them meals, the bosses
dinner, or sometimes the thank you.

438
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,350
Some people say they eat
human flesh at these dinners,

439
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,670
but you doubt that because for some
reason they seem to be all vegetarians.

440
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,760
You kinda doubt where the
vegetarians we eat human flesh.

441
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,440
Fred says that to get to initiate
new members into their Club,

442
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,640
they dip them naked and
then they get healthy.

443
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,920
Once you're in the club that called you
comrade and you have sex with anyone and

444
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:36,920
everyone because it doesn't matter
anymore whether you're a man or a woman.

445
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,950
In fact, they kind of figure
you're neither or both.

446
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,530
That's this new group.
Now,

447
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:48,270
I constructed that little picture out of
actual data from the New Testament and

448
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:51,330
what we have from writings about
ancient Christians. This was the way,

449
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,560
at least a good many number of ancient
people saw early Christian groups.

450
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,110
Every one of the little
details there I gave,

451
00:26:58,111 --> 00:27:00,930
I won't unpack them off for
you now because it would
just be boring and we need

452
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:01,680
to move along,

453
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,190
but every one of those details comes
from some interpretation of a particular

454
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:09,060
Greek term that Christians used. For
example, I said this meal they have,

455
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:12,420
it's called the bosses dinner.
We call it the Lord's supper,

456
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,510
but the lord doesn't mean God necessarily.
It means your boss.

457
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,160
So the Lord's supper put back into normal
Greek language would be something like

458
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:25,190
the bosses dinner or I said they caught
the thank you Episcopalians call the

459
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,810
communion when they take it on Sunday,
the Eucharist,

460
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,800
which is just from the Greek word meaning
thanks. So all of these different,

461
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,930
the part about it doesn't matter
whether you're a man and woman.

462
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:38,070
Christians went around saying things like
in Christ there is no male and female,

463
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,310
what?
No male and female.

464
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,710
And some outsiders did interpret that
as meaning that these Christians seem to

465
00:27:46,711 --> 00:27:50,520
kind of have sex with each other.
They call each other brother and sister.

466
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:52,290
And yet they're all talking
about love all the time.

467
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,190
They have meetings at night in the dark.
Yeah.

468
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:59,460
So there were all these rumors about
early Christian groups like this.

469
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:03,030
So a lot of these things that
I said they call you comrade.

470
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,820
Well Christians called each
other brother and sister.

471
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,360
But that wouldn't have been sort of normal
everyday way to talk about a stranger

472
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:12,384
in the ancient world.

473
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:15,420
It would sound somewhat odd like our
thinking that it would be somewhat,

474
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,560
you know, odd or communist or
something to call somebody comrade.

475
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,810
So the language that different early
Christians used about each other and for

476
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:25,470
themselves was sometimes
very common Greek language,

477
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:29,580
but sometimes it would have also sounded
strange and kind of in house to other

478
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:31,590
people.
In other words,

479
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,860
the Bible presents us with a very strange
world if we approach it without our

480
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:42,360
normal preconceptions, if we approach
it fresh and from the outside,

481
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,220
this is an ancient collection of
documents. It wasn't all put together. Uh,

482
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,050
right when they were,
when a written,

483
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,070
next time I'm going to actually talk
about how did these 27 different diverse

484
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:56,850
documents come to be included
in the New Testament?

485
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,060
That's the whole history of the Canon
and I'll talk about that in my next

486
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:01,620
section.
In fact,

487
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,330
a good bit of the history of Kush early
Christianity and the new testament

488
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:11,331
itself was to take what was a diverse
group of different people all somehow

489
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:15,000
being loyal to this guy.
They call Jesus,

490
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:19,080
but they weren't all the same and they
were in different geographical situations.

491
00:29:19,081 --> 00:29:22,950
They had different beliefs and early
Christianity was an attempt to pull all

492
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:25,650
these things into one unified movement.

493
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,830
Some way to get some kind of
uniformity of belief and practice,

494
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:35,510
so this course is actually going to run
counter to that historical tendency to

495
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:37,500
make unity out of diversity.

496
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,260
What we're going to do is we're going to
take the new testament and we're going

497
00:29:40,261 --> 00:29:43,400
to take the different writings and we're
going to take them apart and what were

498
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:48,010
the, one of the major themes of the
course will be the diversity of early

499
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:49,270
Christianity.
In fact,

500
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,240
the diversity of early Christianity's
is one of the ways I put it on the

501
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:53,074
syllabus.

502
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,980
We will look at all the different ways
Jesus was thought of to be either divine

503
00:29:56,981 --> 00:29:58,720
or human or some combination of both.

504
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:02,380
We'll look at different ways that early
Christians dealt with the fact that this

505
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:06,340
movement seemed to come out of Judaism.
What does that mean? Where Jews, if not,

506
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:09,480
what does it mean? We are, we'll look
at all the different diversities,

507
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,150
how they treated women,
different ways that women, uh,

508
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,240
could take a place in this movement are
different ways that they treated slaves

509
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:19,380
and, and others, uh, servants
in their households. How,

510
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,860
how did they react to the politics?

511
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,260
How did they react to the
powerful Roman Empire?

512
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,470
We'll take all these different topics
at different points in the course and

513
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:30,520
we'll talk about the diverse ways that
early Christians reacted to these social

514
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:33,430
and cultural issues. And we'll read
the New Testament in light of that.

515
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,760
So what's going on is taking what is a
unity and pulling apart that unity to see

516
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:45,010
the diversity of this early Christian
movement and these documents.

517
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,810
And I'm going to pause for a minute and
let you ask questions or make comments

518
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,420
or throw things or whatever.

519
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,690
Don't be shy.
Yeah.

520
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,740
You get to talk at all about sort of
how the decisions were made to what

521
00:31:00,741 --> 00:31:02,840
documents to include or
what documents do exclude.

522
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:03,811
Yes.

523
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:07,830
He's had asked if I was in talking about
how decisions were made about what to

524
00:31:07,831 --> 00:31:08,790
include in the New Testament,

525
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:10,710
what not to include the basement
and we'll talk about that.

526
00:31:10,711 --> 00:31:13,410
Actually the next lecture when I
talk about the history of the cannon,

527
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,850
why were some books,

528
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,540
there were a lot more early Christian
pieces of literature that we know of some

529
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:20,490
we're discovering all the
time the Gospel of Judas,

530
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,360
you may have read in the newspapers and
magazines that a new gospel of Judas has

531
00:31:24,361 --> 00:31:26,280
just been published that uh,

532
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:29,280
some of them people at Yale actually
knew 20 years ago existed cause there was

533
00:31:29,281 --> 00:31:32,320
shown to some people here but most
people didn't know about it and it was,

534
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:34,110
it's just been published
in English translation.

535
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,900
Why did the Gospel of Judas
not make it into the cannon?

536
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,840
We'll talk about those issues next time.
Yes sir.

537
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:41,723
Okay.

538
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,880
Are we going to go over the different
translations in which one's best?

539
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,010
We will raise the issue of translation
periodically. For example, uh,

540
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,550
when I talk about the
syllabus in just a moment,

541
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:56,690
I'm going to talk about what Bible you
should bring to class. And I recommend,

542
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,110
I did recommend one particular
study Bible to the bookstore to buy,

543
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:04,370
but I'm sort of hoping that not everybody
will bring that same translation of

544
00:32:04,371 --> 00:32:06,770
the new testament because
sometimes I'll say, well,

545
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,680
this translation says this in the English.

546
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,020
Does anyone have a different translation?

547
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,830
And it particular points when there's
something important to about the different

548
00:32:15,831 --> 00:32:19,600
translations, I'll bring that up and
I'll explain of everyone's thought.

549
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,770
That won't be sort of a major
lecture in its own right.

550
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,450
It's something that will
come up over and over again.

551
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,770
How does translation happen? How to
debates about translation get resolved?

552
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,530
Yes.
The Old Testament at all.

553
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,320
Either sort of how it really
Christians regarded or appropriate.

554
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,350
Am I going to talk about the Old
Testament all I will when it's relevant.

555
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:40,220
So for example,

556
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:45,230
a next time I will also talk a bit about
the Canon of the Old Testament and how

557
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,300
there are different decisions
about that from the New Testament.

558
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,450
I'll talk about how that,

559
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,800
why the Jewish Bible is different
from the Roman Catholic Bible,

560
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,160
even with regard to what they
consider the old testament. Um,

561
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:59,930
when we talk about Apocalyptic Cism
and the gospel of Mark and Judaism,

562
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,180
I'm actually gonna you have to read,
uh,

563
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,160
at least the last half of the book
of Daniel a from the old testament.

564
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:12,370
And the reason is because Daniel is an
older apocalyptic prophetic text that was

565
00:33:12,561 --> 00:33:14,600
heavily influenced on
early Christian literature.

566
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,670
So there and I will give a lecture,
uh,

567
00:33:16,671 --> 00:33:21,671
in about two more times on the history
of Judaism in this second temple period.

568
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,000
That is what Judaism look like
at the time of Jesus and Paul.

569
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,000
And that will necessitate
referring to the Hebrew Bible some.

570
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,390
So I will every once in a while, but
I'm not, I'm not going to know. I will,

571
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:33,050
for example,

572
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:37,870
talk about why did the gospel of Matthew
take this particular Hebrew Bible text

573
00:33:37,871 --> 00:33:39,260
to be a prophecy about Jesus.

574
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,160
And we'll look back maybe and see how
that Biblical text would have looked in

575
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:46,460
its original context. But
so when, when it's relevant,

576
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:49,790
I will refer back to the Hebrew
Bible or the Old Testament.

577
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,490
And for those of you who are not aware,
uh,

578
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,180
what Christians call the Old Testament is
simply what Jews call the Hebrew Bible.

579
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,010
That basically refers
to the same document.

580
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,310
We just use different terms because
for the Jews, of course Hebrew.

581
00:34:01,311 --> 00:34:04,640
Scripture is not old in the sense of past.

582
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,550
Say any other questions?

583
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,253
Yes.

584
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,850
We'll be talking some more legacies
of Bible on the later layers here.

585
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,120
Well, we were talking about the legacies
of the Bible in later literature,

586
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,630
not as much as I should and that's why
we at the very beginning of this lecture,

587
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,910
you may have come in a little bit late.
I said,

588
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,900
this course will concentrate on the
meaning of these texts in their early

589
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,770
historical context. Every once in a
while we'll bring up an issue of, well,

590
00:34:34,771 --> 00:34:36,990
how has this been interpreted
over the centuries?

591
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,100
The one time you'll get this very
strongly is the one time where you go with

592
00:34:41,101 --> 00:34:43,710
your discussion section. I'll talk about
the discussion sections in a moment.

593
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:48,090
You're expected to all go to the Yale Art
Gallery and go through the art gallery

594
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,110
with your discussion leader.

595
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:54,380
And then you'll do a lot of looking
at how our biblical themes and issues

596
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:58,800
portrayed in later art. And that may
bring up chances to talk about literature.

597
00:34:58,801 --> 00:35:02,550
Also, if you want to bring up those
kinds of issues, pope feel free to,

598
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:06,300
but I'm going to concentrate in this
course on the meaning of these texts in

599
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:07,410
their earliest context.

600
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,333
Okay?

601
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:13,870
Anybody else? Questions?
Okay, look at your syllabus.

602
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:19,180
If you don't have a syllabus, um, are
there any extras back there? Okay,

603
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:21,470
well there you can find the
syllabus if you want to,

604
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,180
are some more right here
if anybody needs one. Um,

605
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:29,260
if you are a friend of yours wants to
see the syllabus after the class and you

606
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:30,070
don't have one,

607
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:34,570
it's on the Classes v two server so you
can go online and get the syllabus and

608
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,030
download it and print it.
Um,

609
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,850
one of the things I want to emphasize
that I'm not in size already is attendance

610
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:44,370
here in the lectures
is very much required.

611
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,830
You will be expected to
come to the lectures.

612
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:49,260
Just because this is a large electric
course doesn't mean you can skip the

613
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:52,050
lectures. Even if you're doing
the readings from the textbook,

614
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,720
you'll get stuff from my lectures
that you won't get elsewhere,

615
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,160
so you are required to come to the
lectures. The section leaders will,

616
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,030
once they get to know you,

617
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:03,390
they'll actually be looking to see
whether the people in their section are

618
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:05,850
missing a bunch of lectures and
I've asked them to take notes.

619
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,090
If you're missing a lot of lectures,
it could of it could affect your grade,

620
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,910
so please come to the lectures.

621
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:16,740
There are only three assignments to six
page papers that I'll explain how to do.

622
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,320
One is the next Jesus paper and you'll,

623
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,320
we'll spend a whole section discussion
talking about what we mean by exit Jesus

624
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:23,220
and teaching you how to do it.

625
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:27,240
Another paper will be a thematic paper
on some aspect of conflict among early

626
00:36:27,241 --> 00:36:29,880
Christians such as Jews.
In the law are women,

627
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,640
our politics and in the
final there will not be,

628
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,860
there will never be a
sit down final in class.

629
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,720
Your final exam will be basically
one or two questions, uh,

630
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,290
that I'll give to you ahead of time.

631
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,620
You take it home and you write basically
like an eight page double spaced paper

632
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,900
on the question,
not doing research.

633
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:48,690
We don't want you to go run outside and
do research using the material you've

634
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:49,524
learned in class.

635
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,680
You'll be expected to answer some big
questions for the an eight page final

636
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:58,800
paper that you'll turn in at a date to
be assigned procedures for evaluation.

637
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:02,730
Important to make an a paper in my class,
like an a on a paper.

638
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,910
Not only does the paper have to be,

639
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,260
have the right answers and
fulfill the assignment,

640
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,470
it has to be written
elegantly and excellently.

641
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,360
Every Yale student has access
to free writing tutors.

642
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,020
I don't know if you realize
how rare that is in a college.

643
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,870
It certainly wasn't available to
me or most people of my generation,

644
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,300
but I know you have
access to writing tutors.

645
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:28,830
You can make an a in this class by writing
your papers far enough ahead of time

646
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:31,890
that you can take it to a writing tutor
and get the writing tutor to help you

647
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,800
get the style better and
then turn that version in.

648
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,740
That'll be much more
likely to give you an a.

649
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,670
If you write a paper that says all the
right things does all the right things,

650
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,840
and yet it's not well written,
it gets a B. If it's a c,

651
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:50,841
that means it's even worse written and
these and s or I mean you didn't really

652
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:55,440
fulfill the assignment. The texts
that I've ordered from the bookstore,

653
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,200
I'm fortunately there, I
just, I order them late,

654
00:37:58,201 --> 00:38:02,580
but the labyrinth bookstore will
have the textbook by Bart Ehrman, uh,

655
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:05,070
that you can also go online
and just order it yourself.

656
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,420
The information is here on the syllabus.

657
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,950
I've ordered the Oxford annotated version
of the new revised standard version of

658
00:38:10,951 --> 00:38:12,210
the Bible,
but like I say,

659
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:15,090
you're welcome to bring your up and
bring other translation, other versions.

660
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,930
When we use the term version of a Bible
that just means a different translation

661
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,340
of the Bible into English. So, uh,

662
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,570
if you want to use a revised standard
version that is other than the new revised

663
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:27,730
standards and that's fine, the
new International Bible, uh,

664
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,050
there are several other bibles,
translations that are acceptable.

665
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:36,140
I don't want you to use
the old translation such as
the King James version or

666
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,160
the Catholic.
Do a version.

667
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,190
Those have too many inaccuracies
because they're just too old.

668
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,810
I also would you rather than not,

669
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:47,440
you not use the sort of paraphrases
like the Living Bible, uh,

670
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:50,230
but if you want to use other
translations, that's fine. In fact,

671
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:52,870
sometimes that'll help us because
we'll compare translations.

672
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,250
Don't worry about, um,
discussion sections yet.

673
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,550
I'm not sure whether we'll use the
classes server to have you sign up for

674
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:06,970
discussion sections online or whether
we will do it the old fashioned way and

675
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:09,730
have you sign up, uh, on forms
that will give you here in class.

676
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:11,860
But we will organize you
into discussion sections.

677
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,930
There'll be a variety
of times you can choose.

678
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:16,510
So be there'll be options about when
your discussion section, we'll meet,

679
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,080
we'll try to make sure
everybody's scheduled was
accommodated and you'll either

680
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:24,520
meet on Thursdays or Fridays in discussion
sections and we'll organize those

681
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:28,270
sections closer to the end of the shopping
period when we have a better idea who

682
00:39:28,271 --> 00:39:31,870
will be in here. As I said though,
the rest of the organization,

683
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:33,820
the class I think is
pretty well self evident.

684
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:37,840
The class is organized first to teach you
the methods of the historical critical

685
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:41,230
approach to the New Testament and
help you learn how to do those through

686
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,410
[inaudible] and historical study.
And then the second half of the class,

687
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,870
we turn our attentions to
more of these issues of,

688
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:51,040
of disagreement and debate within early
Christianity around issues such as

689
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,390
Judaism in the law, uh,
women's positions, politics,

690
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,890
and the interpretation of scripture.
So that's basically the semester.

691
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,980
Any other questions, comments, outbursts,

692
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,350
last chance? All right. If
you decide to take the course,

693
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:10,900
I will see you same place,
same time on Wednesday.
