00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Our second guest is Tina Eliassi-Rad, a computer science professor

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
at Rutger's University.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
She studies data mining and machine learning with a special emphasis

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
on the data that comes up in network science.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
There's been an explosion in interest in studying networks and network science.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If you could comment a little bit about where Big Data is coming from.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
[Tina Eliassi-Rad, Associate Professers, Rutgers University] Big Data is being generated by us.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We go on Twitter and we tweet away.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We go on Facebook, and we post photos and we post status updates.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
That's actually where a lot of the Big Data nowadays is coming from.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Also, the other aspects, if you think about healthcare--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
all the MRI imaging and all these other kinds of tasks that now are done with computers,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that's where Big Data is coming from.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
In particular, because the idea is that if you analyze the data,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that data will tell you something about your customers

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and then you can better serve your customers and then your profits will go higher.
