sort of less concerned about what are

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890
sort of less concerned about what are

the top 10 things that every person
 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.050
the top 10 things that every person
needs to know about DNA or that they

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
needs to know about DNA or that they
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.299
needs to know about DNA or that they
should be able to pronounce

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309
should be able to pronounce
 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.200
should be able to pronounce
deoxyribonucleic acid or they should be

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210
deoxyribonucleic acid or they should be
 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.880
deoxyribonucleic acid or they should be
able to list the planet so they should

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
able to list the planet so they should
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.770
able to list the planet so they should
be able to tell you what a stem cell is

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780
be able to tell you what a stem cell is
 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.389

although all those things are valuable

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399

going to Wikipedia and checking what it
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.080
going to Wikipedia and checking what it
is but you can go and you can go to

is but you can go and you can go to
 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.000
is but you can go and you can go to
google and check what it is and there's

google and check what it is and there's
 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.200
google and check what it is and there's
a great plethora of information that

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210
a great plethora of information that
 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.500
a great plethora of information that
will you know satisfy that objective so

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
will you know satisfy that objective so
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.569
will you know satisfy that objective so
I'm kind of less concerned about the

I'm kind of less concerned about the
 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.090
I'm kind of less concerned about the
data points I don't know what the data

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
data points I don't know what the data
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.520
data points I don't know what the data
point should be that to me is a tertiary

out the bigger issues now which is what

out the bigger issues now which is what
 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.160
out the bigger issues now which is what
should people be thinking about science

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
should people be thinking about science
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.450

and that to me is truly what science is
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.670
and that to me is truly what science is
we need a much better understanding what

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680
we need a much better understanding what
 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.130
we need a much better understanding what
science is and why science works the way

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330
many different forces acting on science
 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.660
many different forces acting on science
that are disrupting it that we need to

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670
that are disrupting it that we need to
 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.870
that are disrupting it that we need to
come back to redefining what science

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880
come back to redefining what science
 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.910
come back to redefining what science
what we want signs to be what science is

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920
what we want signs to be what science is
 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.400
what we want signs to be what science is
how science works so we all really

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410
how science works so we all really
 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.810
how science works so we all really
genuinely have an understanding i think

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820
genuinely have an understanding i think
 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.790
genuinely have an understanding i think
the next step and it could be five years

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800
the next step and it could be five years
 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.540
the next step and it could be five years
of this is scientific literacy and what

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550
of this is scientific literacy and what
 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.460
of this is scientific literacy and what
everyone should think about about

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470
everyone should think about about
 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.159
everyone should think about about
science is simply what science is more

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169
science is simply what science is more
 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.110
science is simply what science is more
so than any one data point that comes

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120
so than any one data point that comes
 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.660
so than any one data point that comes
out of science
