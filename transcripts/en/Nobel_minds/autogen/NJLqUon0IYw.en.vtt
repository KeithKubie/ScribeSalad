00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
there is a Eureka moment that happened

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550
there is a Eureka moment that happened
 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.539
there is a Eureka moment that happened
early on in in the work that Novick and

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549
early on in in the work that Novick and
 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.970
early on in in the work that Novick and
I were doing he isolated the first

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980
I were doing he isolated the first
 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.749
I were doing he isolated the first
mutant and he could see using simple

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759
mutant and he could see using simple
 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.539
mutant and he could see using simple
assays that the enzymes that normally

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549
assays that the enzymes that normally
 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.060
assays that the enzymes that normally
are secreted outside of the ESL in his

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
are secreted outside of the ESL in his
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.939
are secreted outside of the ESL in his
mutant now build up inside the cell but

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949
mutant now build up inside the cell but
 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.160
mutant now build up inside the cell but
the most dramatic moment came when he

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170
the most dramatic moment came when he
 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.710
the most dramatic moment came when he
looked using the electron microscope at

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720
looked using the electron microscope at
 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.189
looked using the electron microscope at
sections of the cell and he called

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199
sections of the cell and he called
 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.320
sections of the cell and he called
excitedly up to my office from down in

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330
excitedly up to my office from down in
 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.429
excitedly up to my office from down in
the basement where the electron

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439
the basement where the electron
 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.680
the basement where the electron
microscope was and I went down and I had

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
microscope was and I went down and I had
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.660
microscope was and I went down and I had
a look and it was you know revelation to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670
a look and it was you know revelation to
 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.750
a look and it was you know revelation to
see a cell that ordinarily has only a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760
see a cell that ordinarily has only a
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.160
see a cell that ordinarily has only a
sort of sparse collection of organelles

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170
sort of sparse collection of organelles
 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.450
sort of sparse collection of organelles
but which instead in this mutant hat it

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
but which instead in this mutant hat it
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.319
but which instead in this mutant hat it
was just dying of overload of the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329
was just dying of overload of the
 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.729
was just dying of overload of the
vesicles that were being produced but

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739
vesicles that were being produced but
 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.740
vesicles that were being produced but
couldn't be delivered to the cell

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750
couldn't be delivered to the cell
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.660
couldn't be delivered to the cell
surface and so the cell has is just

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670
surface and so the cell has is just
 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.520
surface and so the cell has is just
accumulates with lots of vesicles and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
accumulates with lots of vesicles and
 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.860
accumulates with lots of vesicles and
that was you know that one image stands

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870
that was you know that one image stands
 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.020
that was you know that one image stands
in my mind as that is really the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030
in my mind as that is really the
 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.819
in my mind as that is really the
beginning of my career and I knew from

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829
beginning of my career and I knew from
 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.770
beginning of my career and I knew from
that moment that I would be consumed for

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
that moment that I would be consumed for
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.179
that moment that I would be consumed for
at least the next 20 years trying to

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189
at least the next 20 years trying to
 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.370
at least the next 20 years trying to
figure it all out and so that was really

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
figure it all out and so that was really
 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.250
figure it all out and so that was really
a lucky break
