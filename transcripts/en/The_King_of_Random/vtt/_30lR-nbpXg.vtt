00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
Welcome back guys, today is an excellent

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.520
day because the sun is shining,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.600
you're here and we're melting some metal.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.020
Now, in yesterday's video I showed you how to

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.780
make this thing. This is our trashcan

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.460
metal foundry - this is just lined with kaowool

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.360
and as you might remember it gets

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.309
very very hot. So today we're going to

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.320
put it to good use.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.049
Now I still have

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.520
quite a few of the brass ingots left

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.440
from our brass knuckles project but what

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.080
I am short on right now is aluminium.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.100
You can see from my mini Master Sword and

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.960
my failed Pokeball attempts all of my

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.939
aluminium is used up in failed castings.

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.710
Now I personally love the different

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.900
looks of these metals but it does make

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.580
me wonder: what kind of results they

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.400
would form if we mix the two together?

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.460
So, the first step is to remelt this aluminium,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.380
and cast new mini metal biscuits.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.140
You can't see the flames out here, but

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.920
it's definitely getting hot.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.580
Infrared technology!

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.000
That's way cool...I like that... it's getting toasty!

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.200
That's a big crucible; it takes a while to bring it up to temperature.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.400
Oh yeah, that's starting to melt!

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.960
Our aluminum has melted so let's

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.360
skim the slag off the top and pour it into our muffin tray.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.380
Oh wow. That's gorgeous.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.920
There's a lot of slag on the top there. That all needs to come out...

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.680
That's no good to us any more...

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.340
That's all aluminium oxide.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.420
And everything underneath that is really good molten aluminium.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.900
This might be super hot...

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.020
All right, one successful transfer, going for the pour...ooh, that's hot...

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.820
That really is hot... and... slippery...

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.220
Whoops.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.180
That came out a little quicker... than I was expecting; my glove is starting to burn...

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.760
What happens if we take molten aluminium and pour it into a crucible that's cold?

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.460
Will it crack?

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.140
Here we go...

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.120
Alright, cool; transfer has been made...

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.820
We can take this one...

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.360
...and pour it a little bit more evenly.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.120
That's hot stuff!

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.540
These aluminium muffins are extremely hot right now, so I got a

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.560
little bit of water to cool them down.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.760
Is it possible to liquefy aluminum and

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.680
liquefy brass and mix the two liquids

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.480
together to form a new type of metal?

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.660
I'm no metallurgist but I am interested to

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.810
see what happens so let's fire these

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.080
things up and put them to the test.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.000
I just finished warming up our small crucible

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.600
and we've got our new aluminum muffins ready

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.770
to go so let's go ahead and mix them

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.260
with the brass.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.650
Our first test is one

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.600
aluminum muffin and one equivalent size

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.610
brass muffin. How will these look once

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.900
they're meshed together? Let's go find out.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.700
Our brass has just melted and you can tell that because the zinc is starting to

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.200
oxidize and burn off; that's what the

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.530
yellow is and that's what all these

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.940
vapours are coming out, so it probably

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.560
means it's melted and ready for pouring.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.340
Wow! The zinc is burning, it's on fire! Yikes.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.500
It's actually glowing... ok so our liquid

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.180
is actually burning.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.220
Let's go ahead and take that out...

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.340
Surprisingly, we almost got two biscuits back

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.060
out of it... Amazing...!

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.260
So quick update guys; you might remember that brass is

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.820
actually a mixture of zinc and copper,

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.530
and zinc has a relatively low boiling

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.870
point so this stuff got so hot, the zinc

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.980
started boiling out of the mixture.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.280
It actually gets hot enough that it can

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.150
burn and combines with the oxygen in the air to

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.360
form zinc oxide which is the long stringy stuff,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.060
and it leaves behind this yellow residue.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.780
That's why, in previous projects

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.740
I've used a flux like Ant and Roach Killer

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.700
because that suppresses the

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.820
oxygen and keeps the zinc in the material.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.840
In any case, we got this stuff poured

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.240
did come out with nearly two full muffins which

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.840
should be a near 50:50 ratio of aluminium to brass.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.940
Okay let's knock these things out and give them a bath...

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.380
That one's a little bit hotter than the last...

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.820
Look at that; that's so hot it just cracked the glass and

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.400
the water's leaking out. That's interesting, look at this

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.180
big split on the bottom there as well...

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.920
Okay... well, after all the abuse we've put this through,

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.980
I think this is just about done.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.980
This is kind of interesting; I accidentally dropped one of

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.900
these 50-50 mixes on the concrete and it

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.760
shattered into about 7 different pieces

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.220
This stuff is extremely shiny; it's got

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.100
a really cool metallic tinge to it,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.640
but apparently this stuff's really brittle as well.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.000
Really great for looks; not great for durability!

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.700
Oh wow!

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.040
It shattered everywhere! Better not drop the other one...

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.200
Ooh, that's pretty though... not going to lie, that's gorgeous.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.040
Wow!

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.800
50:50 aluminum and brass... Gorgeous.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.660
That's super cool, super shiny.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.500
But I just broke it! That's beautiful.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.380
Experiment number two: three parts aluminium, one part brass.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.140
Let's go.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.540
Boom.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.220
That looks toasty...

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.680
Hasn't burst into flames yet; that's a good sign...

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.340
Oh! Ha ha! I spoke too soon!

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.140
Wow.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.920
It like, spit out half our mix, all over the place...

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.260
I think that's all we're going to get.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.780
We put in four, we only got out two;

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.340
that's because when I took the lid off and the air

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.870
got to it; it exploded and splattered metal

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.970
everywhere. So, things to watch out for

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.500
when you're casting brass(!)

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.420
The water's hot!

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.180
Dang!

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.620
For our third and final experiment, we've got three parts brass; one part aluminium.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.400
and stand back...!

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.200
Cool... all right, is it going to explode in my face...?

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.260
Hopefully not...

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.960
Cool, we're halfway there.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.900
Four went in, three and a half came out.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:53.940
Not too bad.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.000
Interesting how it changes to different colors up there; kinda like

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.960
purple, magenta tinges on top.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:06.680
We're knocking them out! Oh! Those fell right out!

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.600
Couldn't be easier what do those things are kind of

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.340
Look at those things. They're kinda pretty.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.700
Oh wow, look at the bottom!

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.440
We got teal blue, we got all different colors

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.130
of the rainbow here we got blues, greens,

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.260
a little bit of yellow, some purple,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.660
magenta... Rainbow biscuits, that's pretty cool!

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.620
I probably why the glass cracked it

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.300
cracked from the bottom what happens if

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.500
I drip a little water

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.500
now I'm going to see if we can buff theses things up a little bit

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.440
so guys our castings are complete

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:11.100
we got some really cool different metallic

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.760
colors of the rainbow.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.179
unfortunately I dropped the 50-50 mix on the concrete

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.799
and it shattered into a bazillion pieces,

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.560
showing that this composition is a

00:09:18.569 --> 00:09:19.769
little bit brittle, but if you look

00:09:19.769 --> 00:09:20.879
really close at the crystalline

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.499
structure on the inside it's very very

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.140
shining very pretty, actually its absolutely

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.759
gorgeous the way it is. They're absolutely

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.620
gorgeous.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.440
Now if you look closely at the

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.959
different compositions of the metals

00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:32.519
we've just casted you see a wide array

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:34.230
in the color changes we go from the top

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.879
to the bottom. Starting at the top we've

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:38.369
got one hundred percent brass then 75%

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:40.319
brass twenty-five percent aluminium our

00:09:40.319 --> 00:09:42.149
50-50 mix looks pretty cool but it's in

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:44.129
a bazillion pieces. Down here we've got

00:09:44.129 --> 00:09:45.600
seventy-five percent aluminium with

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.100
twenty-five brass and on the bottom

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.230
one hundred percent aluminum. if you

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.369
weren't aware of this already there's a

00:09:50.369 --> 00:09:52.110
huge weight difference between aluminum

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.759
and brass the brass at about three times

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:56.220
heavier than the aluminum and I compare

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.329
the aluminum discs it with the one

00:09:57.329 --> 00:09:58.259
that's only got twenty five percent

00:09:58.259 --> 00:10:00.540
brass I can already feel and noticeable

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.989
weight difference. Rose gold. Of course

00:10:03.989 --> 00:10:05.610
seventy-five percent brass is even

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.169
heavier but what I love about this is if

00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:08.819
you look at the coloration its almost

00:10:08.819 --> 00:10:11.639
got kind of a rose gold tinge to it. it's

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:13.169
not the bright shiny yellow color where

00:10:13.169 --> 00:10:15.059
you're used to seeing in brass, it's more of a rose

00:10:15.059 --> 00:10:16.860
gold color instead, it's got more of a

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.079
pinkish purple fuchsia hue to it. very cool

00:10:19.079 --> 00:10:20.579
and very pretty and this is probably one

00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:22.199
of my favorites. Now as far as durability

00:10:22.199 --> 00:10:23.879
is concerned we already know that the

00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:26.279
50-50 mix is very very fragile but I

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:27.600
went ahead and smash tested the other

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.900
ones and got some surprising results

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.180
I went through each of these alloys with

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.720
a hammer and smashed him with a good

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.550
amount of power and all of them stayed

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.740
intact except for the rose gold I had a

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.120
little bit of chipping and one of them

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.800
actually did break in half but other

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.810
than that they all held together so it's

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:47.920
kind of interesting to see that a

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.330
hundred percent brass is very very

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.070
resilient but what you start mixing an

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.530
aluminum it becomes very brittle so cool

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:55.030
experiments guide let's quickly recap

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.040
what we just learned here today we took

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.810
nuggets of aluminum and brass and we

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:00.040
melted them down and mix them in a

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.900
fifty-fifty ratio that made a new

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.580
metallic composition that was extremely

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.470
brittle but very very pretty and we were

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.870
able to smash it down into a powder next

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.820
we tried mixing 75% aluminum and

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.350
twenty-five percent copper and we got a

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.790
nugget that was very very similar to the

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.620
aluminum itself just a little darker in

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.120
color and a little bit heavier and

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.580
finally we tried 75% copper and

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.110
twenty-five percent aluminum which gave

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.660
us a really cool rose gold looking nugget

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.440
these are some of my favorites

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.610
because they look really cool but

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.110
there's still a little brittle and I was

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.270
able to smash one in half. We also saw

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.860
the hot molten brass is extremely

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.450
sensitive the air making a burst into

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.430
flame and sometimes explode making a

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.260
mess all over your sidewalk. So what

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.670
happens when you try mixing brass with

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.410
aluminum? You get a wide array of new

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.270
metallic composition each with their own

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.370
personality. Thanks for joining me for

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.510
this video guys I'll be looking for you

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.300
next one talk to you then.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.020
Ooh, that gouged the concrete

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.260
and this thing is still intact

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.780
sweet, lets hit is again.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.540
wow that is hard this one didn't really

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.840
do that.
