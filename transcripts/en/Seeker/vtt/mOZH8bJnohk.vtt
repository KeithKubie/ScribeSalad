00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
Sometimes, they're just not that into you.  Or anyone really.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.280
♪

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.140
Hey everyone, thanks for stopping by DNews today. I am Trace and i'm here with my good friend Cleo Stiller visiting us from Fusion.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:20.840
Hey Cleo! Hey Trace! Not being into others sexually speaking is actually a completely understandable thing.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.800
It could be that you're asexual.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.360
Exactly, approximately one percent of the population identify as asexual and the evidence indicates it is a sexual orientation and

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.090
akin to homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, polysexual, heterosexual, and so on.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.200
just going it to its most basic
definition asexual is to not have sexual feeling

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.040
or desires towards others and
just like other sexual orientations

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.780
it's not a choice or a disfunction.  It's simply how you are born.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.480
At puberty when some children begin to get hair in funny places and start making eyes at each other or whatever

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.620
asexuals commonly describe confusion being bored with the idea of sex

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.800
or simply perplexed and
frustrated.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.820
Now, while asexuality in plants and animals is widely documented, thinking about asexuality in humans is

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.479
a fairly new concept for scientific
research.  At first psychiatrists described

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.270
as a psychological disorder but that's
an old school definition and now the

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.729
thinking is as long as it's not causing
the person distress it's not a problem.

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.540
Asexuality was noted by Kinsey and
acknowledged by other sexual researchers

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.280
in their studies as well but I thought
to study at the US Sheep Experiment

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.060
Station which is a real place in Idaho
was particularly telling. Researchers

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.140
were looking for ways to encourage sheep to bone more efficiently. When they looked

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.680
at their herds more closely though it turned out between five and ten percent of the sheep were gay,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.680
and about two to three percent were asexual.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.200
I wanna be sure to say that you know sheep and
humans are not a direct comparison but

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.159
this does give insight into this not
amounting to cultural shifts or

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.100
changing attitudes but biology.  I know,
it's hard to imagine life without sex

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.259
but asexual people still find value in
physical intimacy. A 2011 study published

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.259
in the Archives of sexual behavior found
that asexual women feel physical pleasure.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
They just don't associate those
feelings with sexual urges.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.379
That's pretty cool and for example they do find that
some asexual people masturbate in

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.719
writings about asexuality people
describe their masturbation not

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.440
as a sexual urge

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.989
but as simply cleaning the pipes.  Now, by
attempting to study those who feel no

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.069
sexual attraction to others we can also
better understand those who do have

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.910
sexual attraction.  The Journal of Sex
Research looked at a huge collection of

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.040
asexuality studies, and part of the
problem science is having is that there's

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.320
no single definition of what asexuality
is.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.860
But just because there's no definition doesn't stop science from exploring.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.420
Cleo reached out to one of the leading experts in asexuality studies, Tony Bogart, and he said his

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.520
findings indicate there may actually be
more asexual women out there than there are men.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.819
He told me yes there are more
women than men and that he speculates

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.090
that women may be biologically more
flexible in their sexuality and thus

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.250
more likely to be influenced by early
learnings and cultural factors.  Now, this in

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.200
turn might make women less interested in
sex or why they have no sexual attraction at all.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.459
This claim is
supported by other recent studies that

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.099
show women tend to be more sexually
fluid throughout their lifetimes as well

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.900
Now, you may think a life without sex
sounds pretty lonely, but many asexual

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.680
folks have fulfilling, romantic
relationships.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.900
There's just a very deep emphasis on
emotional intimacy.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.100
Western culture can feel hyper sexual and at times prudish.  We are constantly bombarded with sexual

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.769
media encouraging us to fulfill our
biological and sociosexual needs,

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.280
but just like some people are tall while
others are short sexuality comes on a

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.470
spectrum and there is room for everyone.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.160
And here is how I've come to think about asexuality: if you think of all the variations there are with sexuality

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.170
monogamy, polygamy, bisexuality, everything
is so individual, so doesn't that also make

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.310
sense that a small portion of the
population sex would just be completely off the table?

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.459
How do you guys feel about asexuality?  Have you ever met someone who

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.559
is openly asexual?  Tell us down in the
comments.
