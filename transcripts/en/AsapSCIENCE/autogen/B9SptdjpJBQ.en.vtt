 This episode is sponsored by Brilliant.org 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.360
 Whether you are returning to school 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.480
 Or want to learn a new skill 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.080
 Such as learning a language or playing a musical instrument 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.700
 Learning new things is great! 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.760
 But is there a better way to learn quickly while retaining that knowledge? 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.660
 The first step is to avoid the laptop. 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.500
 It may be faster to write on a computer 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.120
 But writing a paper and pen is the way you take notes. 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.080
 Not only because of the delights available online, 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.400
 But the researchers found that computer-literate people handle information superficially. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.900
 In contrast to the literal transmission of text, 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.560
 Rewrite information in your own handwriting style 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.980
 Linked to better test performance. 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.620
 In order to maintain these observations: 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.280
 "Study Studying" 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.360
 A French experiment was conducted in two groups 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.280
 They learned the Swahili translation of sixteen French words over two blocks 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.300
 The first group studied in the morning and then got some rest 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.760
 Then I studied again in the evening 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.280
 But the second group studied in the evening and then slept at night and completed the study in the morning 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.580
 Although the interval between the two blocks is equal 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.360
 But the group that slept was able to remember 10 words out of 16 words 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.660
 While the other group managed to remember only seven and a half words! 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.600
 Do you want to learn new motor skills? If you try changing your exercises a bit! 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.520
 A study of 86 healthy volunteers, 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.040
 And asked them to teach computer-based skills during two training sessions. 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.860
 I learned one of the two groups in the second important assignment in a slightly different way, 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.620
 While the other group returned the task in exactly the same way. 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.360
 Who used two different strategies that doubled the speed of the task 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.940
 Compared to the other group. 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.720
 How does it look in the real world? 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.380
 To say that you have evolved from tennis, try to change the weights of your opponents a bit between the pieces 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.280
 However, researchers are advised to avoid making very large changes 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.180
 For example, switching between tennis and badminton 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.000
 There is no progress in playing tennis! 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.320
 Can not focus? Do some exercise! 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.380
 A study showed that people who practice a stationary bike for 15 minutes 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.640
 Then they accomplish a mental task, which they can accomplish faster than the group that did not exercise. 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.360
 Even a quick tour of the park will make your mind clear. 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.800
 Are you trying to save the electromagnetic spectrum in ascending order? Who do we do? 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.700
 Try the "Recollection" method to shorten a sentence such as: 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.880
 "Raging Martians Invaded Venus Using X-ray Guns" Angry Martians raided Venus using radiological guns. 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.840
 This method has been proven in several experiments as a means of storing information in memory, has not it? 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.520
 The theory suggests that adults can save a certain number of proverbs in short-term memory. 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.720
 Collecting elements through "memorization" allows the brain to retain a lot of information. 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.880
 Thus contributing to the creation of long-term memory. 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.080
 Preferably the sentence is strange, the distinctive sentence entrenched in mind more boring. 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.520
 Also read aloud. 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.620
 I give people a list of singles, half of them reading silently and half loudly. 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.360
 They were given a new list asking them to identify the words mentioned in the previous list. 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.600
 They could remember the words they read louder than they read silently. 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.660
 You do not need to think just make sure you are refreshed "Drink plenty of water" 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.180
 In a study the participants held fast and refrained from liquids since the evening of the previous day. 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.460
 And asked them to perform the reaction test. 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.820
 A 500 ml set of water was given before the test unlike the other group. 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.300
 The group that drank the water before the test performed much better 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.300
 This is because water helps improve mental processing and learning. 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.020
 After all that effort reward yourself. 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.320
 A study has shown that equivalency stimulates education. In one study the bonus was cash. 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.860
 Resulting in increased memory configuration which increased by increasing the value of the bonus. 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.720
 This finding highlighted the effect of reward incentive on memory formation, 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.360
 By releasing fewer dopamine in the brain before learning. 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.720

 And that interactive learning is the best and questions that ignite curiosity are very important. 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.420

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.420
