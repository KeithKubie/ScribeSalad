00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.460
Ahhh... sleep!

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.460
You can never have enough of it, it seems...

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.520
In fact, sometimes it literally feels like you aren't getting enough, but what if you stopped sleeping all together?

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.480
Strangely, science understands relatively little about why we sleep or how it evolved in the first place.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.080
After all, laying unconscious and dormant for hours on end, while predators lurk, hardly seems advantageous or smart.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.540
But, we have discovered a few correlations.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.180
For example, adults who sleep between 6 to 8 hours a night tend to live longer.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.660
Excessive sleep, however, can lead to medical problems including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.800
Similarly, chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to aspects of cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression and even brain damage.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.780
But what if you stopped sleeping right now?

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.540
Well, after your first sleepless night, your mesolimbic system becomes stimulated and dopamine runs rampant.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.800
And this may actually trigger some extra energy, motivation, positivity, and even sex drive.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.320
Sounds appealing, but its a slippery slope.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.320
Your brain slowly begins to shut off the regions responsible for planning and evaluating decisions, leading to more impulsive behavior.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.740
Once exhaustion sets in, you'll find yourself with slower reaction times &amp; reduced perceptual and cognitive functions.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
After a day or two of no sleep, the body loses its ability to properly metabolize glucose and the immune system stops working as well.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.260
In some cases, 3 days of no sleep has lead to hallucinations.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.680
Care about how you look?

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.680
Studies have shown a direct correlation between sleep deprivation and a person's perceived beauty.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.640
That is to say, sleep-deprived individuals appeared less healthy and less attractive than when they were well-rested.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.000
The longest scientifically documented case of being awake was 264 hours or 11 days.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:48.120
And while they did develop problems with concentration, perception and irritability, the surprising truth is that they suffered no serious long term health effects.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:55.720
In fact, no individuals under these documented conditions experienced medical, physiological, neurological or psychiatric problems.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.040
But there are limited studies, and this doesn't mean permanent damage couldn't be inflicted with more time.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.200
Sleep deprivation experiments on rats for example, generally lead to death after about 2 weeks.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.160
But, scientists aren't totally sure if there dying from the lack of sleep or from the stress of constantly being woken up.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:23.800
Perhaps you should look at fatal familial insomnia for an answer, a rare genetic disease of the brain which causes progressively worsening insomnia or sleeplessness leading to hallucinations, dementia and ultimately, death.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.840
This disease has only affected around 100 people in the world, but their average survival span was around 18 months.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.320
Over time, the lack of sleep becomes worse and the body's organs begin to shut down.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.040
So, while a lack of sleep won't necessarily kill you quickly, continual sleep deprivation will have a negative effect on your body.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.320
Sleep tight!

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.680
...But not too much!

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.960
