00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.270
...and I ate this burrito and I think I got
food poisoning…

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.879
That sucks, how long was the incubation period?

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:11.530
*confused* what??

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.629
Hey everyone, Trace here for DNews!

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.520
My buddy Jared who runs the DNews social media
pages got food poisoning today, so we thought

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.810
we'd pull back the curtain on foodborne illness.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.430
People CALL it food poisoning, but the medical
community call it foodborne illness, which

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.430
makes sense.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.150
You're not being poisoned by food, but infected
by something that's living on the food.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.800
Commonly, food poisoning is caused by bacteria,
viruses, molds, toxins, parasites or allergens.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.440
They range from the fairly well known, E.
Coli and Salmonella to the far less known

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.050
campylobacter, toxoplasma, listeria and clostridium
perfringens (clostridEum per-fringe-ens).

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.930
According to the FDA, most foodborne illnesses
go away on their own and don't have lasting

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.030
effects -- but there are those, like E. Coli
O157:H7 which can cause kidney failure and

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.299
death if not treated properly.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.130
Not all e.coli is bad, by the way.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.159
Some e.coli is part of your natural gut bacteria!

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.259
A number of things can result in food being
"poisoned" or infected.

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.359
Most often, according to the Mayo Clinic,
food poisoning comes from food that’s mishandled

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:19.619
or not cooked properly.

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.009
Maybe it's left under the warmer too long,
not refrigerated properly, handled by a person

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.020
who didn't wash their hands, or touched a
surface that wasn't recently cleaned.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.149
Every contaminant has an ideal condition,
and they vary from bacteria to virus.

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:34.880
And though you might be thinking, YES!

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.229
I was at that place around the corner and
TOTALLY got it from there, you might be wrong.

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.770
Some of these foodborne illnesses can strike
days or weeks after exposure because it takes

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.829
a while for the organism to replicate in your
body and strike -- this is the incubation

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:51.829
period.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.310
The most common pathogens, C. Perfringens,
Salmonella and the Norovirus have short incubation

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.310
periods ranging from 6-72 hours.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.299
All three cause diarrhea, but while salmonella
and norovirus ALSO cause vomiting, c. perfringens

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.299
doesn't!

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.989
E.coli and campylobacter incubate for several
days before striking and both result in severe

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.970
diarrhea containing blood, and vomiting.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.629
Toxoplasma can incubate for weeks and produce
no symptoms at all, and listeria can live

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.220
in your body from three to SEVENTY DAYS before
showing flu-like symptoms!

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.950
You could eat something two weeks before Halloween
and not feel it til Christmas!

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.030
Some cases of food poisoning or food borne
illness are even mistaken for the flu, because

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.690
people can't remember when they ate at that
dodgy deli.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.590
And again, most of the time, you'll just get
better on your own, thanks to the immune system.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.060
But you won't feel awesome.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.480
These diseases cause diarrhea because they're
inhibiting your body from absorbing nutrients

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.230
and water OR they're causing MORE water to
be added into the bowel.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.310
This means your body has to pass all that
stuff out of your digestive system, and in

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.140
a hurry.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.329
If you're nerds, like us,
you can look up your symptoms on foodsafety.gov

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.829
and know what you got, how long you've had
it, and what probably caused it!

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.189
It's, like, really nerdy.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:16.360
Also -- drink lots of water, but NOT caffeine
or dairy because your stomach is already irritated,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.569
those will make it worse.

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.629
Make sure you consume some broth or electrolyte
drink to keep some nutrients flowing too.

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:27.160
And, speaking of flow, DON'T try and stop
the flow out yer butt with anti-diarrhea meds.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.680
You're body's doing it on purpose, you'll
just get in the way, literally.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.189
If you see blood, call a doctor.

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.550
When was the last time you got food poisoning?

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.550
Where'd you get it?
