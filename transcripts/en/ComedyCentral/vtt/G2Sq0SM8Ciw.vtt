00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.530
FOR ANOTHER MAN'S LIVE CULTURES.

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:30.664
WE ABOUT TO GET IT ON!

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.366
- OKAY, LET'S GO!

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.700

[charming Muzak plays]

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:49.216
WHY DON'T I APOLOGIZE
TO EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.618
FOR WHAT I JUST DID--
TOTALLY UNCALLED FOR.

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:52.920
I'M SORRY, EVERYONE.

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:55.455
- SURE. GREAT.
WHAT ARE YOU?

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.292
- HE'S MY COUSIN!
[laughter]

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:00.360
- OF COURSE HE IS.

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:01.828
- AND SINCE WE'RE HIRING,
I FIGURED HE'D BE

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:04.064
A GREAT MEMBER
OF THE SALES TEAM, RIGHT?

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.934
PLUS, HE'S A LOCAL HERO.
- YEAH. HE SURE IS.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:09.303
JUMPED IN FRONT OF A FIRE TRUCK,
SAVED A LITTLE GIRL'S LIFE.

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:12.239
- MISS, I PROMISE YOU
I WILL GIVE YOU MY BEST,

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:13.607
AND I WILL DELIVER.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.175
- ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER,
BUT YOU THREE

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:16.710
ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR TRAINING HIM.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.346
AND IF HE DOESN'T DELIVER,
IT'S ON YOU.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.381
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
COME ON, LET'S GO!

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:23.917
- HE ATE MY YOGURT.
- TEAM DEMAMP!

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:28.722
