00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What we used to believe for strategy

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is that you start any company with an operating plan and a financial model.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What's an operating plan? Well, it's the business plan.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And the belief was all I need to do is spend a lot of time writing this plan,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and then all I need to do is execute it and somehow magical thinking said if I thought hard enough

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and if I was smart enough to do all the great market research in the library and looking up all the data

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and then put together a forecast the magic 5-year plan in the back of the business plan

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
somehow magically all I needed to do is hire the people to execute that plan.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If that doesn't sound silly to you now, don't worry because it didn't sound silly for 40 years,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but what we now know that's kind of ridiculous.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
What we now know is that no business plan survives first contact with customers.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The first years on a startup is completely unpredictable.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What you think you're doing on Monday turns out to be completely wrong on Tuesday,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and on Wednesday, you discover something new, and on Friday, you're almost out of business,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
but on Monday you gets next Monday you get sold for a billion dollars.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
A startup is an incredible roller coaster unpredictable series of advance

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that there's no way you could put together in a 5-year plan.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Yet somehow investors and educators thought that maybe we could just teach you

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
how to put this all together in a nice spreadsheet.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
No one ever noticed that the only other people to do 5-year plans were these guys,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the Soviet Union, and we kind of know how well that turned out as well.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Though much like the fallacy about business plans and financial forecast that lasted for about 80 years.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The good news is that we now know that business plans and financial forecast

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
first are just as silly as it was in the Soviet Union.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
No business plan survives first contact with customers.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
This doesn't mean we shouldn't have any planning but it actually means

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
what we need is planning before the plan and what that really mean is

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
you need to figure out how to actually do some planning

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and then you get to write the business plan.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So I'll be clear, I'm not suggesting we never want to do an operating plan

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and I'm not suggesting we never want forecast but you need some real facts before you could do that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and one of the ways we're going to organize our facts

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
is with Alexander Oscar Walters' Business Model Canvas.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We'll talk about this canvas in some excruciating detail in the following lectures

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
but you should know we used to canvas for two things.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
One is initially we're going to use it organize our thinking

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
about all the hypothesis about every part of our business.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But second is we're going to get out of the building and actually turn those hypothesis into fact as we'll

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
find out how to do later and then as we turn those hypothesis into facts,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
we'll be updating the canvas on a regular basis and it will become a scorecard--

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
a way to keep score for our progress of how much we've learned.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So what this means is instead of writing the operating plan and financial forecast first,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
we're going to use the Business Model Canvas to actually capture all our hypothesis first.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
For the search for the business model, we're going to start with the model first

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and then after we find the model, we get to write it up.
