We saw that managing cyber
security is a complex undertaking

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.670
because it has technical,
people, and policy dimensions.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.010
We studied the tradeoffs that exist when
we consider various security controls

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.160
in the context of an organization.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.120
Security management covered how

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.770

to manage the cyber risk

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.380
