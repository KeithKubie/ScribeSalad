00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.680
I wanna start in a nice, familiar, comfortable place, Brady.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.180
Which is this series:

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.920
1.. +2 .. +3 ..+4
Oh no! Oh no!

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.700
Alright, all the way up to infinity.
You remember what the answer to that was?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.040
Yeah.
Yeah, what was it?

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.000
it's a, uh, divergent sum.
Yeah, it's -1/12, isn't it?

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.760
Which is totally uncontroversial.

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.340
that's that's not weird at all. so I'm not
actually going to talk about that series

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.000
but I want to talk about something thats
related to that series so I want to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.410
consider what happens when we take the
reciprocal of all these numbers and take

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.770
the sum of those so we take 1 + a
half + a third + a quarter + a fifth.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.250
what would we get if we added all these
numbers together you can look at this

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.800
and you might think even though someone
goes alright there's no way that's -1/12th

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.420
but it'd surely be infinity. you
look at this and you think what is this?

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.750
i mean the numbers are getting... it's
clearly getting bigger but the numbers

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.020
that you're adding again smaller and
smaller and smaller so you might think

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.610
this goes to a finite answer, but
actually it doesn't. this is infinite.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.840
this is called the harmonic series, and it
and it is infinite. it was first shown to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.390
be infinite. and back in.. by a medieval,
french mathematician Nicole Oresme. he

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.840
showed it in quite an elegant way, which
we can go through now, he came up with

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.880
another series in which each element of
the other series was less than the ones

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.960
you've got here and showed that guy was
divergent. the other series that he

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.920
looked at, was the one where you asked
what is the largest power of a half

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.250
that's less than the number you're
interested in. so let me show you that's

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.030
probably easiest way. so 1, well it's less than
or equal to that we're interested in. 1 is is

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.750
already a power of a half so we'll leave
that as one. a half is of course a

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.880
power of a half so we'll leave that
there. a third, well the largest power of

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.760
a half which is less than or equal to a
third, is of course a quarter.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.360
quarter, well we can leave that as a quarter. a
fifth what's the largest power of a half,

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.220
that's uh, that is less than a fifth, well
it's an eighth, which is a half cubed right.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.280
for a sixth that would also be an eighth. for a seventh, that
will also be an eighth. for an eighth.. it's an eighth

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.090
The next one would actually be a sixteenth, and you
would go on like that, right. so this is

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.190
his alternative series, and now you look
at this series and you just see that,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.019
It actually has some nice structure so you got one
plus a half, but then this combination

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:25.439
here gives you another half. these four
here give you another half. there's

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.519
going to be eight of these 16ths, they'll
give you another half, and what you're

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.730
doing is just adding a half loads of
times, so it's pretty clear that this this

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.329
indeed diverges. and so by comparison,
because each element here is larger than

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.040
the element here,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.480
this guy must also diverge as well. So
that's the proof that that this diverges.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.510
now..
but hang on, but each element of what you're doing up here.. *inaudible*
I knew you were going to say that!

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.630
there's this is sort of nice illustrated
way to think about this, this sum and

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.820
how it diverges. We've got a lousy band here right.
That's what we call it in (Liverpool?).

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.510
in order to describe this, it can tell us something
about this this sequence right. so what I

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.110
want you to imagine is, that, imagine this
this lousy band is, is like a meter in

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.610
circumference. I know it's not, but imagine
it is. And imagine we put an ant on him and

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.450
this ant, can travel one centimeter
a second. okay now, after each

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.040
second we're going to stretch the lousy
band, so that it's...

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.960
we add and another meter to it's circumference.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.320
okay, so after the first second, the
ant has moved one centimeter.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.040
We stretch the elastic band by a meter, ok
after the next second, the ants moved

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.520
another centimeter. we stretch the
lousy band by another meter and so on

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.570
and so on and so on.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:54.850
ok, question is, does the ant ever get all
the way around the elastic band?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.200
(Brady) I can't see how it could. 
it seems like you couldn't,
 it couldn't, right. but it can right and

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.640
it's because of this sequence, right. so
let's just see why it can right. so think

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.180
about what happens in in the first
second. think about, think about the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.910
percentage of the elastic band that it
manages to to traverse, okay. well it's

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.410
traveled.. the elastic band is 1 meter around it travels one centimeter that's 1%, right.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.440
in the 1st second
travels 1%. What happens in the 2nd second?

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.060
well in the 2nd second the last band is
now 2 meters long

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.310
it travels another centimeter, so that's
0.5%. in the 3rd second

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.830
the lousy band is now 3 meters long

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.500
it travels 1 centimeter, that's 1/3th
of a percent. their total length of the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.870
lousy band, and so on.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:52.450
ok, the same sequence, but this goes to
infinity. It only has to get to a 100%, never mind infinity right?

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.150
clearly he's going to get all the way
around the lousy band, and actually you

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.810
can work out how long it takes him, right.
it takes him about e^100 seconds,

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.140
which is about 10^50 seconds
which is quite a long time. it's so amusing

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.580
to think what would happen if you start
the experiment now

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.360
and by the time that the ant finished it.
well before we got to the end, you'd have..

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.439
the Sun would have become a red giant
and it's probably swallowed up the earth

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:18.900
(Brady) you're adding one meter every second

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.830
yeah
(Brady) and it's only moving one
centimeter every second

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.100
(Brady) so every second the finish line is
getting further away, every second.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.660
but what it's already.. what was
behind it also gets further away

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.480
so it's this is not just
the distance in front but also the

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.759
distance behind and you can see what's
really important is the percentage that

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:43.500
that it accumulates. and you can
see that it just grows and grows and

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.880
grows and grows and grows. eventually it hits
a 100. but you know after e^100 seconds

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.840
roughly, more or less. it gets it
gets there. but yeah I mean you know, to

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:57.120
be honest, you know, we will even...  by
the time you get to the end of this uhm...

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.580
this game, the universe has entered
a black hole area where all the earth,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.139
matter and stars and  including our
experiment has ended up inside black

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:12.419
holes. so this is a gargantuan time, and
what that illustrates is is really how

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:17.729
slowly this series grows. it grows very very
slowly.. it grows, it grows indefinitely but

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:21.539
it does so very slowly and you can see
that by how long it takes to go all the

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:26.009
way around. it actually grows
logarithmically slowly. and what you can

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:30.449
show is, you can take, you know, this
sequence all the way up to maybe the n'th

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:35.929
form. and you take off log(n)
I'm taking the natural logarithm here,right.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.479
what you get if you look at this guy, so
each stage you take off that... the log.

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:45.960
well you know 1 minus.. you take the first step, 1-log(1)
.. well that's just 1

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:56.969
1+1/2-log(2) is about... 0.8.
1+1/2+1/3-log(3)

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:03.060
that's about 0.7.
 if you carried on ad infinitum, you actually

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:09.029
approach, a finite number. it's called
gamma. it's the Euler-Mascheroni

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:16.769
constant. this is about 0.577, which
is a.. if you take its square it's about 1/3rd

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:22.640
ok but not very much is known
about this number. we know that it exists.

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:25.139
we know it exists, we can prove
it exists.

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:28.560
basically the proof, it relies on the
fact that this sequence is decreasing.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.560
you can show also, that it's bounded
from below.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.399
ok, so it's decreasing and bounded from below.
it's gotta stop somewhere. so you can

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.729
prove it exists but but we know hardly
anything about it.

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:43.011
we don't know if it's a transcendental
we don't even know if it's a rational

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.669
number or not. kinda mad right. we can
describe it in certain number

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:53.900
of digits, and Euler came up with about
15 digits. Mascheroni came up with 90.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.682
He then got the 20th 21st and 22nd one wrong

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:01.139
nowadays we know it's about a hundred billion
digits, but we don't even know if its

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:03.690
rational... if it if it is rational

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:11.490
we know that the denominator is greater
than 10^242080. the denominator

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.550
gotta... that if it's rational, but it might
not even be rational, we don't know.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:20.699
ok, so we know very little about it and
yet this number, it appears all over

00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:24.000
everywhere. all over physics, for example.
this is, I know it from physics right.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.930
when you calculate quantum corrections,
to say, the mass of the electron or

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.649
the mass of the Higgs. or you calculate
contractions to the charge of the

00:08:31.649 --> 00:08:36.300
electron. these sorts of things, this guy
pops out. it always pops out. so it's

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.539
there. it's in nature, it's in physics.
 and yet we don't know very much

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:40.169
about it

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:43.979
it also... if you take e^γ (e^gamma), take e^γ

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:48.259
this knows about products of prime numbers,
which is, what what's that got to do anything?

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.920
so it seems to know about stuff. there's a
connection there, and actually some some

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.279
physicists have actually sort of
said that, there might be something deep

00:08:56.279 --> 00:09:01.350
there. that they're ultimately
cosmology is is gonna be very closely

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.649
related to number theory. it's very
speculative this but, you know, in

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:07.890
the future maybe this is going to be a
direction we're going.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.420
if you're interested in numbers that govern
the universe you might just like this

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.399
book called "Just six numbers" by Martin
Rees. famous astronomer shows how six

00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:20.590
numbers can explain the origins and
behaviours of the entire

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:26.020
universe. as an added bonus the audiobook
is narrated by Lord Rees himself. now

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.800
audible.com, which has supported this
video, is a leading source of spoken

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.760
