00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.060
I've been sent another
maximization or minimization

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.050
problem, and this seemed to be
an interesting twist on what

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.030
we've already done, so
let's do this one.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.290
Let's see.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.190
A rectangular storage container
with an open top is to have

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.450
a volume of 10 meters cubed.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.920
The length of its base
is twice its width.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.103
Let me start drawing
this thing.

00:00:19.103 --> 00:00:22.270
It's a rectangular storage
container with an open top.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.490
So let's see, let me do
it a different color.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.560
OK, so I'll do it over here.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.470
So that's its base.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.000
So let's see.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.830
The length of its base
is twice its width.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.530
So this is the base, and if
I call this the width, so

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.990
this is x, the length is
twice that, this is 2x.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.420
The length of its base is
twice the width, right?

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.560
So this is the length of the
base, this is the width.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.840
OK?

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:09.250
Material and then the height,
for now, is unknown.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.550
I think we should be able to
find a constraint on this,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.790
because we know what the
volume has to be, right?

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.330
It says, materials for
the sides of cost $6

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.320
per square meter.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.490
Find the cost of materials for
the cheapest such container.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.660
OK, so let's do a
couple things.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.700
First, let's figure out what
the height is in terms of x,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.440
and then we can find an
equation for the cost in terms

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.450
of x, and then take the
derivatives, and find the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.090
minimum, et cetera, et cetera.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.230
So what do we know about this?

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.010
What's the volume of this box?

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.020
The volume of this box is
equal to the, what did I

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.480
say, this is the length, but
it doesn't really matter.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.170
Length times the width
times the height.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.110
So it's 2x times x,
2x squared times h.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.120
So it's 2x squared
times h, right?

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.210
Base times height times
width, whatever.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.560
Length times width
times height.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.670
Just the volume of a rectangle.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.930
And they already said that the
volume is 10 meters cubed,

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.380
so that gives us a
good constraint.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.780
So that has to equal 10.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.950
Let's divide both sides by 2x
squared, and so what do we get?

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.540
If we take this equation, we
divide both sides by 2x

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.090
squared, we get h is equal to
10 over 2x squared, which is

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.870
equal to, we could say,
5x to the minus 2 power.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.880
So this is, so we could
write this as 5x to

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.550
the minus 2 power.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.440
That is h.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.240
We have just solved that.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.660
We were able to solve that
because they gave us constraint

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.350
on the volume of the box.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.320
Fair enough.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.560
So now let's see what the cost
of the material, the total cost

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.550
of the material,
is going to be.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.090
So I'll do that in magenta.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.510
The cost of the material.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.680
And I can even say,
as a function of x.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.450
is equal to what?

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.710
OK.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:13.360
Material for the sides
costs $6 per square meter.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.970
So what is the surface
area of the sides?

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.330
Oh no, they tell the material
for the base first.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.720
So material for the base
costs $10 per square meter.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.010
So this base right here,
the material costs

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.800
$10 per square meter.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.185
So what is the
cost of the base?

00:03:31.185 --> 00:03:33.370
It's going to be area
of the base times 10.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.980
So it's 10 times the
area of the base.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.180
What's the area of the base?

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.320
It's 2x times x.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.600
So it's 2x squared.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.080
So this is the cost of the
material on the base.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.330
And now we want to add the cost
of the material on the sides.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.910
So.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.660
And this is where gets a
little bit interesting.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:04:00.580
So there's two sides that
are x, this side and this

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.390
side are the same size.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.510
Right?

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.470
And so what are they?

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.410
What are their areas?

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.810
So it's going to be $6 per
square meter for those

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.040
two sides, right?

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.560
For this green side, and that
one back there, as well.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.180
I don't want to make
this too messy.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.050
So $6.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.900
And what's the area?

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.530
And there's 2 of these
sides, I'm going to

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.750
multiply them by 2.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.040
And so what's the area
of each of these sides?

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.510
It's x times 5x minus 2.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.650
So that's 5x minus 1.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.090
All right?

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.820
So now we have to figure
out this side here and

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.310
that side over there.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.570
And let me do it in
a brown, maybe.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.450
So now we care about this
side up in front, and then

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.120
that side back there.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.420
But that's also going
to cost $6, right?

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.050
So plus $6 per square meter.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.000
And then there's two sides,
and then what is it?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.110
It's 2x times 5x to
the negative 2.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.970
So that's 10, right, 2 times
5 is 10, x times, x to the

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.600
negative 2, x to
the negative 1.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.390
Let's simplify this.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:13.820
So we have the cost, and it
said it was an open top, so

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.960
there's no there's no fabric
we need for the top.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.060
So the cost of putting the
fabric, or the material, on

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:28.330
this on this open rectangle,
is, see, 20x squared plus,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:36.270
what's this, 12 times 5 is 60x
to the minus 1, plus, let's

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.610
see, 12 times 10, 120x to the
minus one, and so we can

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:50.450
further simplify that as 20 x
squared plus 180 x to

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.350
the minus 1 power.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.020
And now we're ready to just
take the derivative and

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.290
find out what the minimum
point is of this curve.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.250
So let's do that.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:06.450
So c prime of x, and this is
a fun, non-hairy derivative.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:14.810
So it's 40, 2 times 20
x and then minus 180

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.890
x to the minus 2.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.800
And the minimum or maximum
point are going to be where

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.110
this is equal to 0, so
let's set that equal to 0.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.280
Let me clear up some space.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.800
I think you understand
all of this, so let

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.910
me get rid of that.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.320
Actually, I like the drawing,
but it's got to go,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.540
because I need the room.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.370
If you need to review it,
just rewind the video.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.640
OK.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.700
So we want to set the
derivative, to find the minimum

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.800
or maximum point, at minimum or
maximum point on the curve, the

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.960
slope is 0, so the
derivative is 0.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.650
So let's figure that out.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:07:05.280
So 40x minus 180 x to the
minus 2 is equal to 0.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.980
And the first thing I would do
is just, you could divide both

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:17.060
sides by 20, and you get 2x
minus 9x minus 2 is equal to

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.320
0 divided by 20, which is 0.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.860
And then, let's
see what you get.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:26.890
If you add 9x to the minus 2 to
both sides, you get 2x is equal

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:32.250
to 9x to the minus 2, or
9 over x squared, right?

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.380
That's the same thing
is 9x to the minus 2.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.570
Now, I don't know, let's
multiply both sides of this

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:49.480
equation by x squared, so you
get 2x to the third is equal to

00:07:49.480 --> 00:08:01.130
9, or x to the third is equal
to 9/2, or x is equal to the

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:06.780
cube root, or we could just
say 9/2 to the 1/3 power,

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.090
whatever that could be.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.020
4.5 to the 1/3 power.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.850
And do we know that this is a
minimum or a maximum point?

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:18.340
Well, we could go and take the
second derivative, and then

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.200
confirm that we're concave
upwards at this point, and then

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.260
we would know that we are at a
minimum point, and this is

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.780
the cheapest such container.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.930
But I'll tell you a
little, you know.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.030
If you see this in a class, or
maybe you want to prove that

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.820
for yourself on a test, but an
easy way to test that is just,

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.590
try some other x, right?

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.460
We have the cost
function right here.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.525
Try some other x.

00:08:37.525 --> 00:08:41.230
And you know that this is
either going to be a maximum or

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.490
a minimum, or at least a local
maximum or minimum, or if you

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.115
try another x and if it's
greater, then you

00:08:45.115 --> 00:08:45.890
have a minimum.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.240
Or the other thing is, well,
you know, if there's only one

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.170
critical point, and they ask
you to find the cheapest

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.480
container, that critical
point is probably going

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.420
to be the minimum point.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:54.750
But anyway.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.860
So just for fun, let's
figure out what that

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:02.790
is actually equal to.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:10.660
I'll actually go to
google.com, and let's see.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.480
We could just say, we want
9/2 to the 1/3 power.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:29.530
So that is 4.5 to the 1
divided by third power.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.350
1.65.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.770
So that's our answer.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:38.210
If x is equal to 1.65, you
know, plus some other points,

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.340
then we have the cheapest
container to produce.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.050
It's 1.65 something something.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.430
And there you have it.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.370
Hopefully you found
that vaguely useful.
