00:00:00.624 --> 00:00:02.391
- [Voiceover] Karunesh is a
gym owner who wants to offer

00:00:02.391 --> 00:00:06.394
a full schedule of yoga and
circuit training classes.

00:00:06.394 --> 00:00:09.644
Yoga classes are each one
and a half hours long,

00:00:09.644 --> 00:00:12.367
while circuit training
classes are only an hour,

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:15.475
and he wants at least 25 hours of classes,

00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:17.284
at least 25 hours of classes,

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:19.092
on the schedule each week.

00:00:19.092 --> 00:00:22.546
All of his instructors
are paid $35 per class,

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:23.591
so it doesn't matter whether it's

00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:24.872
an hour and a half yoga class,

00:00:24.872 --> 00:00:27.432
or a one hour circuit training class.

00:00:27.432 --> 00:00:30.926
But Karunesh doesn't want
to spend more than $1000,

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:35.234
does not want to spend more than $1000

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:36.696
per week on salaries.

00:00:36.696 --> 00:00:37.895
Which of the following falls within

00:00:37.895 --> 00:00:41.369
Karunesh's guidelines
for the weekly schedule?

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:43.156
So we can just go through
these choices and we can say,

00:00:43.156 --> 00:00:46.103
which of these meet the at
least 25 hours of classes,

00:00:46.103 --> 00:00:47.505
but then don't break the bank,

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.638
don't cost more than $1000.

00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:51.040
So this first one right over here is

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.291
three yoga classes, at
an hour and a half each,

00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:57.134
well this is going to be
four point five hours here,

00:00:57.134 --> 00:00:59.425
plus 19 hours,

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:01.442
each circuit training class is an hour,

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:02.702
so plus 19 hours,

00:01:02.702 --> 00:01:05.486
is going to get you to
23 and a half hours.

00:01:05.486 --> 00:01:07.416
So that doesn't get us
to at least 25 hours

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:10.991
of classes, so we can rule that out.

00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:14.242
I'll see ten yoga classes and
12 circuit training classes.

00:01:14.242 --> 00:01:16.374
Ten yoga classes at an
hour and a half each

00:01:16.374 --> 00:01:18.609
is going to be 15 hours,

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:20.275
plus the 12 circuit training classes,

00:01:20.275 --> 00:01:24.156
that does get us to 27 hours.

00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:27.366
So it checks off the
minimum number of hours

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.175
that he wants to get,

00:01:29.175 --> 00:01:31.328
now let's make sure it
doesn't break the bank.

00:01:31.328 --> 00:01:33.300
So the classes are $35 per class

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.656
regardless of whether its an
hour and a half yoga class,

00:01:35.656 --> 00:01:38.378
or it's a one hour circuit training class.

00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:39.475
So right over here

00:01:39.475 --> 00:01:41.975
we're gonna have a total of ten plus 12,

00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:44.291
so this is going to be 22 classes,

00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:48.983
22 classes times $35 per class.

00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:51.726
And what is this going to be?

00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:53.108
Look, I can already tell
it's going to be less

00:01:53.108 --> 00:01:55.221
than a thousand, and if you
were under time pressure

00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:56.907
you could say, Hey, this
is less than a thousand.

00:01:56.907 --> 00:01:59.182
But if you want to verify
that this right over here

00:01:59.182 --> 00:02:00.950
is less than a thousand,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.771
two times 35 is 70.

00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:07.960
And then two times, sorry,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.702
and then 20 times 35 is 700.

00:02:10.702 --> 00:02:14.054
700, so that's going to be $770.

00:02:14.054 --> 00:02:16.513
I know I did this in a
somewhat non-traditional way,

00:02:16.513 --> 00:02:18.444
I could have done it like this,

00:02:18.444 --> 00:02:20.293
35 times 22,

00:02:20.293 --> 00:02:23.747
so two times 35 is 70,

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:26.002
20 times 35 is 700,

00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:26.733
you add them together,

00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:28.175
you get 770.

00:02:28.175 --> 00:02:29.212
But the important point is

00:02:29.212 --> 00:02:31.446
this is less than $1000.

00:02:31.446 --> 00:02:33.235
So this is going to meet our constraints.

00:02:33.235 --> 00:02:34.535
We have enough hours

00:02:34.535 --> 00:02:37.399
but we haven't broken the bank.

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:38.760
Now in these two,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.224
it looks like we have
plenty of hours here,

00:02:40.224 --> 00:02:41.748
in fact, just the yoga class is enough

00:02:41.748 --> 00:02:43.616
to meet our 25 hours

00:02:43.616 --> 00:02:45.078
because 20 yoga classes

00:02:45.078 --> 00:02:48.879
is going to be 30 hours of classes,

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.991
and 25's gonna be even more.

00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:53.694
But I would suspect that these
are gonna break the bank.

00:02:53.694 --> 00:02:56.945
And if you look at this,
this is gonna be 32 classes

00:02:56.945 --> 00:02:59.728
at 35 dollars per class,

00:02:59.728 --> 00:03:02.654
yeah, that's going to be over $1000.

00:03:02.654 --> 00:03:05.274
And this one, I said this was even,

00:03:05.274 --> 00:03:06.919
this was going to be 31 classes,

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:07.854
and so this is probably going to be

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:12.075
over $1000, as well.
