2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.740
<v 1>joining me today is the original king of interviewing,
a friend,
a mentor,</v>

3
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.450
a living legend,
and a man who loves good Brooklyn Water Bagel.

4
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.590
Larry King.
Welcome to the Rubin report.
No one ever I hear legend.

5
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.820
I think one thing old.
Well,

6
00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.740
and every time we've sat down,
I always,

7
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.770
I feel that I have to say living legend at the beginning because who are you are

8
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.650
<v 2>like you are.
One of the best compliments I ever got was Derek Jeter.</v>

9
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.730
Great Yankee.

10
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.600
Now over the Marlins came over to me at the All star game some years ago and

11
00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:44.440
said,
you,
he said there were a lot of phony legends.

12
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.390
You're a true luxury.
Wow.

13
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.450
<v 1>That's pretty good.
Yeah.
That warm my heart.</v>

14
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.120
And that's coming from alleging cause that guy care guys,

15
00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:53.230
the true baseball every too.

16
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.910
Did you ever think that after all your years in radio,

17
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.120
in Cable News now doing the digital thing,

18
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.080
that you'd be sitting in a garage being interviewed like this,

19
00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:07.750
going out to hundreds of thousands and millions of people?

20
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.030
<v 2>Well,
let me tell you the truth.
We're opening,
this is the pinnacle of my career.</v>

21
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.890
If you'd have told me 61 years ago when I started,

22
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.230
61 years from today,
you will be known around the world.

23
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.840
You'll be called an icon,
no living legend.

24
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.660
And at the height of your career,

25
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.840
you'll be in a garage with David Rubin.

26
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.470
It's come full circle.

27
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.850
<v 1>It's come full circle.
You're killing me,
Larry.
David.
But what does that,</v>

28
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:42.680
what does that say about just how everything has changed?
I mean,
the

29
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.940
<v 2>only thing sure is change.
The only thing constant is change.</v>

30
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.370
When I started in radio,
we had land lines.
Uh,

31
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.280
went through a phone line.
I did start in radio,

32
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.370
did local television one year after I started ordering.
Always did both.

33
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.540
Always regarded both equally.
Uh,

34
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.450
I always thought of television as radio with pictures.

35
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.260
We could be on the radio now.
Yeah.
But we released this as an audio.
I know,

36
00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:16.520
but they don't have to see it.
Yeah.
Um,
we could imagine,

37
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:18.500
and he's radio is theater of the mind,

38
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.280
but I always took it as just communicating.

39
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.850
So I started in radio,
then did local television,

40
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.720
then the national radio and satellites.

41
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.430
I was there when satellites were introduced.
I never forgot it.
I'm in Washington.

42
00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:38.600
The guest is in La and it feels like he's right there.
Yeah,

43
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.100
right there.
It was amazing satellite.
And I said satellites.

44
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.020
That's the end that completed.

45
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.760
And Ted Turner hired me through CNN and I'm seeing around the world.

46
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.270
We go up 23,000 miles to go next door and to Moscow.

47
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.370
Try to explain that to Jefferson.
I'm doing that.

48
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.170
And now after 22 almost 26 years at CNN,

49
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.740
61 years in the business,
I thought I could retire.

50
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.680
Carlos slim came along and said,
we gotta do something.

51
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:15.970
So the internet or a TV Hulu.
Who knew from this?
Yeah.

52
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.070
And when you tell me about the Internet,
what bugs me is when hill is it?

53
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.780
Where is the Internet?

54
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:26.270
And people thought about the Internet and I even though just have to accept it

55
00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:30.950
like correct.
I'm a product of all these things,
but basically David,
yeah.

56
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.730
I am doing exactly what I did 61 years ago.
What this,

57
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.140
what we're doing right now is no different.
Yeah,

58
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.000
we're being delivered differently.
But what we're doing,
it's no different.

59
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.750
What does that say about this?
The ability to sit across from somebody,

60
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:51.250
look them in the eye and actually try to understand the human experience.

61
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:53.830
Cause I was saying to you in the green room right before there is a massive

62
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:56.800
renaissance right now because of podcasts,

63
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.240
about long form conversation.
The thing that you've been doing for 60 some odd,

64
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.440
but that's where it's happening in podcasts.
Yeah.

65
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.850
It's not happening on television.
Not even on cable toe.
They used to call,

66
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:11.920
you know MSNBC,

67
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:16.180
CNN and Fox News shuttles.
They're not news channels.

68
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.660
They have trumped channels is pro Trump ones.

69
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:24.460
Anti Trump won sometimes hate Trump and there's pundits.
Yeah,

70
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.110
it's 24 hours a day of punditry.
They do not cover the news.

71
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.390
When the hurricane was hitting Carolina,

72
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.400
it was in a box on the corner of the screen.
While they were talking about Trump.

73
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.670
You saw where the hurricane was.
That's not news.

74
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.240
Do you remember seeing a change on that because you were at CNN?

75
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.350
Do you remember what year you started at the end?
I started,

76
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.323
of course you're well,

77
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.560
1985 and left in 2010 yeah.

78
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.390
Do you remember seeing something changing in the way the news reported and the

79
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:59.800
way they saw it when the other side started?
You know,
we owned it for a while.

80
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:00.720
CNN.
Yeah,

81
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.300
and then it was MSNBC and Fox and we thought they were little invaders.

82
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.590
Ted Turner was a genius.
Yeah,
an office pants.
Genius of the seat of the pants.

83
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.200
He was driving in a car one day and the guy said all news all the time.
He said,

84
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:20.800
why I could not work on television?
Then he puts it up on the big bird.

85
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.263
Look what he,

86
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.010
he is the revolutionary leader of the second half of the 20th century.

87
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.200
Changes the world and look where it's come to that Internet dire everywhere,

88
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.810
you know,
the different side.
There's good and bad to it.

89
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.380
If something happened in the world right now,
David,

90
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.580
everyone knows it in a minute,
in a minute.
The world knows it.

91
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.740
Wow.
Yeah.
What do we do with this?
To end with.

92
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:50.500
Technology is always ahead of the human advance.

93
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.780
So when technology's ahead,
it's how do we grasp using this.

94
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.220
It's a great pie.

95
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.270
Interviewed Steve Jobs when he started apple and I'm wondering if he were here

96
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:07.250
today,
if he would know what an impact that's had in the world.

97
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.120
Cause I've had experts told me that your iPhone will control your life.

98
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.410
Basically is controlling our lives right now.
This is,
that's a perfect segway,

99
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:20.210
my friend.
Can you bust out your phone?

100
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.110
I do not have an iPhone because I don't want to be,

101
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.860
I was addicted to tobacco from age 17 to age 53 when I had a heart attack.

102
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.590
I know what addiction is.

103
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.210
I would wake up in the morning and grabbed the cigarette before I put my glasses

104
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:41.600
on.
Anything.
I see people,
my wife,

105
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:43.910
friends with their cell phones.

106
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.710
I have dinner with a friend I'd ever talked to him.
We sit at then and I mean,

107
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:52.100
and he's,
yeah,
I think they get thumb cancer.

108
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.740
So I have old school.
A flip phone.
His phone.
Yeah.

109
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.290
It's a phone.
Put it to your ear.
You hear the other side?

110
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.010
I don't text.
I hit people.
They call me.

111
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:11.480
I called them normal.
You're the only person that I actually call.

112
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.160
You do realize that I don't call anybody.
I just tech.
Why wouldn't you?

113
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.900
Why you see this hurts me.
You as a broadcaster.

114
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.230
As a communicator.
Yeah.
Why do you text?
Oh,

115
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.930
I can see an emergency.
I'm stuck.
I'll be late.
Yeah,
but come on.

116
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.850
Sometimes Steve got paypal it.
Well look,
you know,
this is what I love to do,

117
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.080
but sometimes just for the sake of ease of just,
you know,

118
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.110
I'm going to be here then or I'll see you there.
You know a lot of that.

119
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:46.730
I try not to have long form discussions about political views,
but yeah,

120
00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:50.600
people are fighting over personal things on there and all of that.
But wait,

121
00:07:50.601 --> 00:07:52.400
I want,
I want it back at the thing you said before because,

122
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:55.130
so when the satellites started and then you've suddenly,

123
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:58.280
we're doing interviews with people where you weren't in the same room,

124
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.880
do you remember that affecting the interview in any way?

125
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:04.610
Cause I always like this.
I don't know.
There's nothing like that.

126
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.460
Nothing beats this.
Yeah.
Nothing.
However,

127
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.170
I always try to treat it as this.
They just weren't there,

128
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.170
so I tried to make eye contact via the satellite.

129
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:21.580
I tried to treat it as if they were there and when I got used to handling well

130
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.120
and enjoyed was when I'd have five different guests in five different places.

131
00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:29.750
Yeah,
and controlling that.
Yeah.
And then I did diplomacy.

132
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:34.751
I had a night where we had a Arafat Rabin

133
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:42.380
and a
king.
The king of Jordan.
Yeah.

134
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.650
Can your dog though his father.
Okay.

135
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.380
All three.
Kissinger told me you're doing diplomacy.
Yeah.

136
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.030
I had Arafat,

137
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:59.940
King of Jordan and the prime minister of Israel
together.

138
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:03.570
Me a little Jewish kid from Brooklyn sitting there by satellite,

139
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.700
but I felt I was with them.
Yeah.
I didn't treat it as them being there.

140
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.830
I treated it as like this.
Yeah.

141
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.280
<v 1>Did you in,
in some of the bigger interviews that you did over the years,
I mean,</v>

142
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:16.650
you've interviewed,
you've truly interviewed everybody.

143
00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:19.010
Is there anyone that you felt like you didn't,
you didn't get that

144
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.140
<v 2>kill Castro?</v>

145
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.560
I went down to Cuba in 19 in 2009 two oh nine I was treated regally.

146
00:09:27.761 --> 00:09:31.360
They all wonderful to me,
but I couldn't nail it.

147
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.010
I couldn't get them to do.

148
00:09:33.011 --> 00:09:38.011
I was fascinated by him because he led his country longer than any leader in

149
00:09:41.111 --> 00:09:45.610
memory.
Somebody had to like them.

150
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.510
Right.
Even if it was only one person,
and then when I went to Havana,

151
00:09:49.511 --> 00:09:52.230
I never saw a happier country.
I was amazed.

152
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.680
The people smiling,
musical hotels,

153
00:09:56.681 --> 00:10:01.240
mobbed,
you know,
from Canadians and Germans and beautiful weather,

154
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.310
beautiful city water.
Havana ought to be open to everybody.

155
00:10:06.311 --> 00:10:10.750
It's beautiful.
The water's up or just,
it's a great city.

156
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.530
<v 1>How aware were you when you're interviewing big timers,</v>

157
00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:18.490
the real movers and shakers that the ravines in our fats that you mentioned,

158
00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:23.530
that something that you ask them could actually turn the course of history?

159
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.090
<v 2>Yeah,
I'm not aware of,
I know a lot of it did.</v>

160
00:10:26.091 --> 00:10:28.540
I know the parole go debate change Nafta.

161
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.360
We Clinton called me up the next day and say you pass enough to,

162
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.440
that was way behind until the goal or pro debate.

163
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:41.930
You try not to read it as a,
but once,
once the light goes on,

164
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.140
that's just the moment I'm in.
You know his eye.

165
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:50.960
If I'm sitting with Jimmy Carter or a ballet dancer,

166
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:56.750
once the light goes on,
I'm in that moment.
I don't think about yesterday.

167
00:10:56.751 --> 00:11:00.740
Can't do anything about it.
Don't think about tomorrow.
That's tomorrow.

168
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.240
So I'm in the now,
so I'm right in this now.

169
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.250
You should be in this now.

170
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:12.560
So if you've got Trump coming tomorrow and you're thinking about that,

171
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.890
then you're losing this moment.
I'm here,
I always treat,
I'm here,

172
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.750
I focused.
Do you,

173
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.620
<v 1>I think that that your curiosity,</v>

174
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.570
do you think you sort of made that for yourself or was it built into you?

175
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.910
Because I've been out with you to lunch or to dinner,
breakfast,
whatever it is,

176
00:11:30.911 --> 00:11:35.620
and I can see you're as curious about the waiter busboy or sometimes when we

177
00:11:35.621 --> 00:11:38.090
were at Ora together and you'd be chatting with,
you know,

178
00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.550
the guy doing the lights or whatever,

179
00:11:39.551 --> 00:11:43.000
that you were actually as interested in them as if was that.

180
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.500
<v 2>Hello David.</v>

181
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:50.300
I remember as a kid getting on a bus kids and asking the bus driver,

182
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.650
why do you want to drive a bus?
I remember we'd go to ballgames,

183
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.810
kid in Brooklyn and go to dodger games.
Go with my friends.

184
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.980
We'd wait outside for the players.
They wanted autographs.

185
00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:09.040
I never wanted an autograph.
Want that?
Ask questions.

186
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.390
I would run along that a player going into his car.
Why did,
why did you bunt?

187
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.190
Why'd you do that?
That I was always a wide person.
Yeah.

188
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.530
I'm the kind of person you don't want to sit next to on an airplane.

189
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:26.330
I I'm in and I don't know where that came from but it's the best gift I got was

190
00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:29.140
security I the gift of curiosity.

191
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:34.090
Anthony Quinn told me that you have the greatest gift ever.
Curiosity.

192
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.200
My friend Herby Cohen who wrote,
you can negotiate anything,

193
00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:42.250
says to me the secret of my success is being stupid.

194
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.420
He didn't mean that demeaning.
Basically what you're doing is saying,

195
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:52.330
help me,
help me with this wind.
You do that.

196
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.420
Someone asked me if you had interviewed Osama bin Laden,

197
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.620
what were your first question?
Had been,
well it would not have been.

198
00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:04.510
Why did you bombed the World Trade Center?
It would have been

199
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:10.090
you grew up in one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia.

200
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.800
Why you leave
now?

201
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.090
He probably hadn't thought of that since he left.
Yeah,

202
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:24.690
but it forces you to think and then I'm going to learn more about him before I

203
00:13:25.781 --> 00:13:30.520
learned about the bombing.
And also you have to understand that nobody,

204
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.040
nobody thinks they're evil.

205
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.390
Hitler did not comb his hair in the morning and say,
I am a bad person.

206
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:43.360
They may be crazy,
but they believe nobody thinks far.
I'm really terrible.

207
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.090
And everyone has an excuse for what they do.

208
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.680
The bankrupt that bank by my father,

209
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:55.681
they charged his checking account that screwed them and the public funding

210
00:13:56.231 --> 00:14:00.520
enough at Myers,
the renegade,
Dylan.

211
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.170
Joe was very popular in America.
Very popular.

212
00:14:05.171 --> 00:14:08.950
He robbed from banks who likes banks.
Right.

213
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.490
So how do you then interview a bad dude?

214
00:14:12.491 --> 00:14:15.700
Someone that's got you curious.
You're curious about a bad dude.

215
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:20.500
I try not to.
It's hard.
Sometimes racist especially.
Yeah,

216
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.520
I had a tough time doing the early George Wallace.

217
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.230
The later George Wallace who was terrific.
The early George was,

218
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:32.170
I had a tough time because I don't understand racism.
I've never understood it.

219
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:32.920
Yeah.

220
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:37.920
I don't have no understanding of why someone would have different pigment.

221
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.010
That's all it is.
Should be treated differently.

222
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.750
You think that comes from just growing up in Brooklyn and everything's,

223
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.350
whenever we set you,
can you,
can you just talk about that a little bit?

224
00:14:47.351 --> 00:14:51.800
Like what that was like growing up?
Oh,
I grew up in a neighborhood of mixed,

225
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.660
you know,
Jews,
Protestants,
Catholics and that's it.
We had some blacks,
not a lot,

226
00:14:56.661 --> 00:15:01.280
but blacks went to school with us.
When I went down to Miami to break into radio,

227
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:07.230
I was 23 and I got off the train and the first thing I saw were two water

228
00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:10.910
fountains,
colored white.

229
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.980
I drank out of the colored.
Yeah.
I never seen anything like that.

230
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.930
You grew up in Brooklyn?
That was beyond me.

231
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:23.300
Then I got on a bus to go over to Miami beach to stay with my uncle and the bus

232
00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:28.301
drivers stops the bus and asked me to move forward because the back is for

233
00:15:28.771 --> 00:15:33.140
blacks
and I said to him,
my father's black,

234
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.620
I'll stay in the back.
So I know I never understood it.

235
00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:38.180
And I've asked this a racist.

236
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.360
I have never understood why a white feels superior to a black.

237
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.220
Lenny Bruce,
who was a great friend of mine,

238
00:15:46.221 --> 00:15:51.221
used to tell me that the human being has to have something to hate that drives

239
00:15:52.731 --> 00:15:55.640
him because they have an inferiority complex.

240
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.530
So they have to feel superior to something.
And he told me 40 years ago,

241
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:05.600
Sunday blacks will get equal rights and we'll have to hate something.

242
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:11.190
I'll tell you what,
we'll hate Eskimos as Zoe is another.

243
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.290
Right?
In other words,
you know,

244
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:16.180
used to check into a hotel and underneath the chair would be assigned,

245
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:21.170
remove under penalty of law.
You know who removes them?
Eskimos,

246
00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:27.520
you know,
and he Eskimo war heroes.
Yeah.
You don't know name one.
I can't.

247
00:16:27.521 --> 00:16:29.600
I'm going to have to go.
I'm going to Google that.

248
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:33.680
Got An Eskimo doctor know that they would look for,

249
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.000
they would just try to find and racism always be fuddle.

250
00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:41.870
I interviewed Dean Rusk,
secretary of State Kennedy years,

251
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.070
and he was a very progressive southerner from Georgia.

252
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:51.470
His daughter married a black man.
He has,
he said,
I have no prejudice.

253
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.350
Themeless they taught me a little about prejudice.

254
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.280
So did Malcolm X.
Dean Rusk said to me,

255
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.460
my daughter married a black man.
I have black grandchildren.

256
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.170
I have no prejudice.
I got on a commercial plane.

257
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.620
The pilot was black and for a minute I was nervous.

258
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.470
That shows you how inbred it can be.
Yeah.
Can he fly the plane?

259
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.190
But I've never,
it boggles me

260
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.830
<v 1>when you win over the years when you've talked to some of these people,
you know,</v>

261
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.850
white supremacists,

262
00:17:23.851 --> 00:17:27.000
they're just some of these people that come from that truly racist place.

263
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:29.000
<v 2>Okay.</v>

264
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.890
<v 1>Did you ever hear them saying anything?</v>

265
00:17:30.891 --> 00:17:34.040
Was it almost like therapy in a way that you felt if you talk to them long

266
00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:36.440
enough,
maybe they could get out of it?
Did you ever sense,

267
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.830
<v 2>I try.
You try you to try to administer.</v>

268
00:17:38.831 --> 00:17:43.831
You can notice some books out by former white supremacists who come full circle.

269
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.090
If of course they raised a lot to do with raising as their major inferiority

270
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.450
complex.
You got to deal with that.

271
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.390
Although someone said it's not a complex tear inferior.

272
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.970
Who are some of the people that you interviewed that uh,

273
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:05.660
that you think either it went the wrong way or any regrets in never sitting down

274
00:18:05.881 --> 00:18:08.040
with somebody to go,
Oh man,
I missed that mall.

275
00:18:08.041 --> 00:18:11.940
I can tell you one is the one trying to remember his name now.

276
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.500
The guy who succeeded Steve Jobs,

277
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.990
they want immediate while Tim Cook now,
but it's not at all.
Yeah,

278
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.830
Steve Jobs hired him.
Oh,
what was his name?

279
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.380
Bright Guy came from Pepsi Cola or I think I'll have my guys go with a little

280
00:18:29.381 --> 00:18:34.110
while and he ran,
he ran and I had them on for two hours.
Yeah.

281
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.070
Great guest now.
And why was it wise?

282
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.850
NIAC is that [inaudible] was with this partner.
Okay.
Oh,
this guy,

283
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.560
we're play a joined the cooperation.
Steve left out,
then came back later.
Okay.

284
00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:50.970
We'll,
we'll grab it.
So I spend two hours interviewing.
This guy was great,

285
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:56.040
all about previous jobs and then I finish and now I go to Kohl's.

286
00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:59.670
I used to do this on my old lady or show two hour interview Lauer calls in an

287
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:03.930
open phone America.
I go to close the first call.
Larry.

288
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.470
Steve jobs fired him.

289
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.630
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

290
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.630
<v 2>he replaced Steve Jobs and then Steve jobs fired him.</v>

291
00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:17.700
You didn't even ask about that
shit or no.
Yeah.

292
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:22.080
It's tough when one gets by it.
Right.
And it haunts you.

293
00:19:22.081 --> 00:19:26.310
Look at out is years ago is still haunts him.
You try to know everything.

294
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.510
You can't,
there's no perfect interview.
You can't know everything.

295
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.820
You do the best she can.

296
00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:37.821
I had a tough time with Ahmadinejad other ran because he would lie.

297
00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.090
Remember he was talking to me.
John Scully I think is the guys.
It John's Scalese.

298
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:48.480
We've got to crack team over.
There you go.
He's still around.
By the way,

299
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.900
when I interviewed,
I'm at dinner,
John,

300
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.650
and we're talking about various things and we're talking about the Holocaust

301
00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:01.500
and he says to me as why you always have to listen when you're doing an

302
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:04.680
interview.
He said,
if there was a holocaust,

303
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.950
why isn't Israel in Poland?

304
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.230
That's where the crime occurred.

305
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.610
Why is the state of Israel 2000 miles away?

306
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.910
There was no crime in Palestine.

307
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.850
The crime was in Poland and Germany.

308
00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:25.410
Why didn't they take that area and give it the Israel?
Right.

309
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.850
It made some sense.
You could argue with logically.
Yeah.

310
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.870
I said to him,
did you say if there was a while ago?

311
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:41.260
Yes.
Right there.
Are you saying if I,
you know,
when we got contentious,

312
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:48.100
you denying the Holocaust?
It was those are,
but look,

313
00:20:48.101 --> 00:20:49.720
I've had so many years doing this,

314
00:20:49.721 --> 00:20:53.890
Dave and I can't explain how I still love it.

315
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:59.420
I love the interplay.
Yeah.
You should love what you do.
Yeah.

316
00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:03.430
Know why you're learning something every day,

317
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.350
every day.

318
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:11.140
So I can't be close minded like I'm a liberal politically,

319
00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.790
certainly in social issues,

320
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:18.760
but I'm not closed minded enough to think that you can have an opposing view.

321
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.330
I liked the argument,
I liked the discussion,
but in interviewing,
I never,

322
00:21:25.331 --> 00:21:26.920
I mean my ego at the door,

323
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:32.670
I try not to use the word I to relevant and I tried to get into walk in

324
00:21:36.221 --> 00:21:40.630
together.
You know Edward Bennett Williams,
a great lawyer,
told me once,
I said,

325
00:21:40.631 --> 00:21:42.970
what is the role of the criminal defense lawyer?

326
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:49.470
He said to get one person on the jury to walk in your client's shoes.

327
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:55.690
If you can get one person to walk in your client's shoes,
got a hung jury.

328
00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.680
All he has to do is say,
I would've done that.
Yeah.

329
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:06.560
<v 1>When you were doing five nights a week and on any good,
I use this example a lot</v>

330
00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.760
because people will say,
oh Dave,
you had this,
you know,

331
00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:14.940
this bad person on or this that.
The other thing I'll say,
you know what?

332
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.800
In Larry King's Day,
let's go 1992 CNN,

333
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.170
you'd have the cast of friends on Monday.

334
00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.740
You'd have an Oj Simpson lawyer on Tuesday,
you'd have,
you know,

335
00:22:24.741 --> 00:22:29.190
an animal guy on Wednesday,
you'd have,
you know,
a doctor on,

336
00:22:29.191 --> 00:22:32.720
on Thursday and then you know,
former secretary of state on Friday.

337
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.330
Was that crazy for you?

338
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.730
<v 2>You just love the bounce or part of my curiosity?
Yeah,
most of the Times.</v>

339
00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:45.020
Most of the Times driving in,
I didn't know I had on that night.
Really?

340
00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.570
I still don't the Laura,
I drive in.
I don't know who's on,

341
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:52.730
unless it were really someone famous,
like we might have the animal guy.

342
00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:56.660
I didn't know it was called until I walk in and see all the animals and because

343
00:22:56.661 --> 00:23:01.190
my curiosity comes from pure curiosity.

344
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.750
<v 1>So where your guy's hands and you know,</v>

345
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:08.100
<v 2>no,
no,
I get a blue car.
Like do you have loom?
I had a blue car.
Facts.
Yeah.</v>

346
00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.940
He was secretary of state from yesteryear that year.

347
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:16.920
He was responsible for the Marshall Plan.
Right.
That's all.

348
00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.660
And then I would do the things that had the Marshall Plan come about.
Yeah.

349
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.140
How we're part of it.
Did you play with George Marshall?

350
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:30.140
Was his plan where you in on the thinking,
you know,
it's all when,

351
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.910
when we have the go for,

352
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.740
I would see other shows in which the guests would come on and be a general or

353
00:23:37.741 --> 00:23:41.580
something and the host would say today and the Gulf War,

354
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.860
1000 people were killed.

355
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:49.010
And the thing that now terrain is here and all I would say is what happened?

356
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.020
What happened today?
Because he has the perspective.

357
00:23:55.010 --> 00:24:00.010
If you have an interview where you turn the TV on and the host is on more than

358
00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:04.030
the guest,
something's wrong.
If you,

359
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:08.240
if it takes you three sentences to ask a question,
something's wrong.

360
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.500
Because a lot of them are show offs.
I'll give you the show off interviewer,

361
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.870
right?
Yeah.
Uh,

362
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.570
I guess today is Dave Ruben.
He's written a new book.
Paul Chicago,

363
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.830
my hometown.

364
00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:26.540
<v 1>Been great to have you here.
Dave.
You know I visited Chicago many times.</v>

365
00:24:26.541 --> 00:24:29.690
Always love going there.
Did you do,
do you write about the,

366
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.130
the stock yard [inaudible] stock.
He has a fascinating,

367
00:24:33.131 --> 00:24:35.900
do you ever go there folks?
In other words,

368
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:40.430
you are a prop for me and that's gone now though.

369
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.210
There aren't even low shows anymore.
Yeah.
What do you make of,

370
00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:45.600
so when you left CNN,
I,

371
00:24:45.601 --> 00:24:50.300
I've said this to you before you left in 2010 it seems to me you can do a pretty

372
00:24:50.301 --> 00:24:52.880
clean line between you leaving CNN.

373
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.520
Obviously the Piers Morgan thing didn't work out.

374
00:24:55.521 --> 00:24:56.870
If you want to comment on that you can,

375
00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.380
but that you were one of the people that people trusted.

376
00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:04.640
There's almost no one in news or on television anymore that people go,
oh,

377
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.960
like no one was walking around.

378
00:25:05.961 --> 00:25:07.940
And even the people that maybe didn't like it that much,

379
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.060
they were going to Larry King's a bad dude.
Larry King's a liar.

380
00:25:11.061 --> 00:25:11.541
You know what I mean?

381
00:25:11.541 --> 00:25:16.541
Nobody was doing that by having one of the main faces who had been there for so

382
00:25:16.911 --> 00:25:17.660
long.

383
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:21.920
I really think it broke something in the continuity of CNN that kind of led us

384
00:25:21.921 --> 00:25:24.140
to where we are now.
Related to all the cable,

385
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:28.340
<v 2>maybe.
Maybe it did.
There were signs,
you know,
Fox News was beating us.</v>

386
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.150
We had one at all those years.
And Fox News,

387
00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:37.610
who speeding is beating CNN the day beating us at night.
That was a sign.

388
00:25:37.611 --> 00:25:39.800
This was a network.
That's not news,

389
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.480
<v 1>but am I making this up?
When you left CNN,
you still at the highest rated show?</v>

390
00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:48.330
<v 2>The second highest we,
we started a fall,
not precipitously,</v>

391
00:25:48.331 --> 00:25:52.820
but we started a fall.
We saw it.
We sort of see and sort from per say,
soda,

392
00:25:52.821 --> 00:25:55.080
you know,
CNN always made a ton of money,

393
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.770
which they would have first and everybody in America had.

394
00:25:58.771 --> 00:26:03.210
CNN paid 50 cents a month.
So Ted,
turn out that in on a genius.

395
00:26:03.211 --> 00:26:05.880
Thinking of this right now,

396
00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:10.980
you and I are paying for CNN.
We're not watching it.

397
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.110
You don't pay for CVS.
You pay him for CNN.

398
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.960
He knew it.
So CNN made money.

399
00:26:18.961 --> 00:26:23.961
If they had no commercials but didn't do anything just beyond public tune,

400
00:26:23.991 --> 00:26:28.620
then
it's a different world now.
I can't,
I don't know.

401
00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:33.630
Maybe it was the cleavage.
You know Jerry Seinfeld said,

402
00:26:33.631 --> 00:26:38.070
my old column I used to do in USA today when I did,
it's my 2 cents.

403
00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:42.330
That was the beginning of Twitter.
Yeah.
Really quick comments.

404
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:46.840
Uh,
but I,
you know,
people call me a pioneer,
so I,

405
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:51.860
all I see myself is I'm a lucky Jewish kid from Brooklyn who was curious and

406
00:26:55.300 --> 00:27:00.300
that curiosity into a career as I was able to take the natural curiosity and

407
00:27:03.901 --> 00:27:04.830
make a career of it.

408
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.730
<v 1>You think we're maybe running out of that?
When you,
when you talk to younger,</v>

409
00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:11.930
you have to be very young sons.
When you talk to young people,

410
00:27:11.931 --> 00:27:13.190
watch how they get the news.

411
00:27:13.191 --> 00:27:16.450
You were telling me about kids with the phones and everything and you've,

412
00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.630
you love the newspaper,
right?
You are

413
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.590
<v 2>the New York Times.
Like I got an Iphone,
they gave me an iPhone,</v>

414
00:27:22.591 --> 00:27:25.330
so I use it to get baseball scores.
Yeah.
That's all.
I don't you,

415
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:29.280
I don't have it with me.
Yeah.
I don't need it.
The games that tonight,
uh,

416
00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.860
<v 1>you go right.
You're,
I mean,
you're a major still a dodger.</v>

417
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:37.100
<v 2>Oh yeah.
I love the game.
I though I'd go to basketball.
I love the game.</v>

418
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:41.960
I love competition.
Your gradient at dodger stadium right now,
I tell you why.

419
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:48.830
I love sports.
Sports is the ones,

420
00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.010
you're not a sports fan.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Okay.

421
00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.030
The best thing about being a sports fan,
it's,

422
00:27:55.031 --> 00:27:57.950
it's the one thing in your life when you get up in the morning,

423
00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:02.660
you know who's going to win,
so you have something to look forward to,

424
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.050
good or bad.
You don't know who's going to win.

425
00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.520
Nobody wakes up at that except sports fans.
Another thing,

426
00:28:10.521 --> 00:28:12.170
what I love about athletes,

427
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.560
maybe more than any profession,

428
00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:21.590
their career is over and other careers or beginning,

429
00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.780
they have that day when the cheering stops.

430
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:32.120
Imagine what that's like.
You build yourself up in your 37 years old.

431
00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.420
They'd paid you all this money for doing what you did as a kid,

432
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.660
and another thing the athlete has that we don't have.

433
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:42.560
Final score can argue that's it.

434
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:47.600
Eight to seven you lost.
You got seven,
they got eight.
You can say,
yeah,

435
00:28:47.601 --> 00:28:51.590
but they should stop.
You've got seven they got.

436
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:56.480
Now if you've got eight,
you get the applause.

437
00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:01.340
You get the down.
You get that every day.
Recognition.

438
00:29:01.341 --> 00:29:04.280
Nonrecognition walked down the street

439
00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:09.950
athletes,
so I love,
I'm so,

440
00:29:09.951 --> 00:29:13.610
I love all it brings all my curiosity sports,

441
00:29:13.611 --> 00:29:16.190
bring it to a head because I'm always interested in

442
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.640
last night the Dodgers was,

443
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:23.350
he left a lefthander into pixis right handed bat.

444
00:29:23.351 --> 00:29:26.450
He's got all those pictures in the dugout.
Why did even,

445
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.950
why did he leave him in?

446
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:33.270
<v 1>Did you find there was something unique about the top of the line athletes that</v>

447
00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:36.540
you would talk to you that they,
that they genuinely had something different?

448
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.073
You guys didn't have

449
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.950
<v 2>confidence.
Yeah,
that's it.
Stan Musial,</v>

450
00:29:41.951 --> 00:29:43.690
the grape cardinal outfielder,

451
00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.760
Wally west Lake was a teammate of his and he,
while they told me this story,

452
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.231
it's,

453
00:29:50.231 --> 00:29:54.210
they're sitting in a dug out before a game and Westlake those over the museum

454
00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:58.030
said,
Stan,
I got up this morning,
breakfast was great,

455
00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:03.040
the show was great to drive in was great and in batting practice I've hit five

456
00:30:03.041 --> 00:30:07.690
home runs.
I feel great.
You ever had that kind of Day Stan?
And he said,

457
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:11.770
every
that's as good as they get.

458
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:16.210
The quarterback who throws 10 incomplete passes,

459
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:21.610
never thinks about the 11th flow.
To have the 10 incomplete effect.

460
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:25.510
Him Confidence.
They have that ability.

461
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:30.490
You take wide receivers in football,
they're all fast.
They all have good hands.

462
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.060
The great ones,
the great ones,
they Bowlby,

463
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.213
it's coming.

464
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:41.880
Gretzky told me he saw the puck go into the goal before it went into the corner.

465
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.810
It's a a,
so I have great appreciation.

466
00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:51.760
I also have appreciation for politicians.
They do something we don't do.

467
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:56.830
They have a first Tuesday in November.
You don't have that day.

468
00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:01.180
You didn't have a first Tuesday in November.
They win and lose.

469
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:07.030
They stand up before the public and they win.
They lose.
They get rejected.

470
00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:13.980
Jimmy Carter telling me the saddest day of his life was flying home from his

471
00:31:14.171 --> 00:31:18.310
last appearance when his advisors told them,
you know,

472
00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.190
they know in the afternoon.
Yeah,
you're going to lose.

473
00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:27.030
The great story of Barbara Bush told me when George Bush loss to Bill Clinton at

474
00:31:28.031 --> 00:31:31.300
three o'clock in the afternoon,
and they knew he was going to lose,

475
00:31:31.301 --> 00:31:35.110
and they're all sitting around Samba and Bob Mover.
She came in and said,

476
00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.660
where do we get a driver's license?
