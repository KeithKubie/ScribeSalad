00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
Hey guys, we are back outside again today, because today we're experimenting with a relatively dangerous substance today

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.360
We're playing with propane now in our standard atmosphere propane is typically a gas

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.260
But if you compress it into a bottle like this

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.100
It actually liquifies under its own vapor pressure you shake one of these bottles and listen [carefully] you

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.709
Can actually hear liquid propane sloshing around inside?

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.109
The purpose of today's experiment is to see if we can get that liquid propane out now if you remember back to a previous

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.920
experiment

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.769
We took a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher and sprayed it into a pillowcase

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.739
To create a homemade dry ice and the process for doing that is very similar to how we're going to extract our liquid propane here

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.199
Today now I want to give a shout out to my friend Kevin

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.869
He's the Backyard Scientist and before he started playing with Liquid nitrogen

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:46.079
He used liquid propane and the way he would do that was by modifying the torch for the propane tank itself and sticking it upside

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.839
Down in the glass so we're going to make that modification here today

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.649
I'm going to show you step-By-step. How it works

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.979
Because of the pressure the propane is putting on the inside of the tank it wants to escape until by opening the valve counter Clockwise

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.039
More propane can shoot out and by turning it clockwise it restricts the flow and limits the flame eventually shutting it off now

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.118
This is kind of interesting if you look down the tip of the nozzle you'll see a little wire mesh in there and the purpose

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.688
Of that is to stop flashbacks gas can burn freely outside of the nozzle

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.779
But it doesn't work its way back inside because that wire mesh stops it

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.990
It's really interesting is if we remove the sheathing from the nozzle here?

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.659
The flame actually goes out and if we try and relight that again it won't actually work the whole in the tip here is so small

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.529
It's shooting a gas out like a jet and so we're not able to light it even with the barbecue igniter

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.400
It whisks the heat away, so quickly. There's no time for ignition. so let's make the hole bigger

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.470
Here's the basic idea. I got myself a hacksaw and a drill with a 9/32 inch drill bit

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.279
We're going to use the hacksaw to cut the tip off the torch and the drill bit to hollow it out

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.799
And there we have it as easy is that we've got an instant homemade propane spewer

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.580
The hole on this module is exponentially wider than the factory version, and so when we open the valve now

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.529
There's nothing to restrict the flow so the nozzle cools down quickly and begins dripping liquid propane

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.949
Now I'm going to try something now that you probably shouldn't try at home

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.220
I'm going to open this valve all the way and touch it off with a barbecue igniter

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.589
Just want to see what happens is anything gonna happen

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.940
There we go how sweet

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.689
Now you might be wondering why the flame didn't travel back into the bottle and make this thing explode and here's why we know that

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.050
The fire triangle says three things need to be present in order for combustion to happen

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.980
We need to have an ignition source

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.200
We need to have fuel and we need to have oxygen

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.990
But there's no oxygen in the bottle so there's no way for combustion to take place until it travels out of the nozzle it mixes

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.920
with the oxygen in the air

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.259
But saying that this still isn't an experiment

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.590
I can recommend for anyone else

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.190
all right now for the fun part the backyard scientist found that if we crank this valve fully open and turn it upside down and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.999
Leave it in the glass all I have to do is give it a few minutes and the glass will fill itself up

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.919
so we have our propane with our modified tip we have a glass so let's go ahead and put the two together and see if

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.920
It really works

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.280
it is

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.769
Now that we got our glass filling up with propane let me tell you about some of the characteristics of propane itself

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.109
We already know that propane is normally a gas

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.049
But if you can press it and stick it in a pressurized steel container

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.438
It will actually carry as a liquid the liquid itself is pretty cold

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.369
But maybe not as cold as you might think it's nowhere near the boiling point of liquid nitrogen

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.139
Propane boils at minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit. That's about minus 42 degrees Celsius

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.899
But the amazing thing is it won't freeze until it hits minus

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.509
306 now even though it's far from being as cold as liquid nitrogen making contact with your bare skin can cause frostbite

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.269
But the bigger Concern here is this liquid is flammable

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.049
Meaning if you got a near flame or spark it could go off and cause a lot of damage

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.799
Propane vapors are actually heavier than air which means they're not going to float away into the atmosphere

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.970
They will sink down into the corners of the room

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.419
So if you're working in a very confined space with propane there's a small chance that could push out all the air and suffocate you

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.579
there we go guys it's been about six or seven minutes our glass is about halfway full and you can see the stuff is cold because

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.689
Frost is forming on the outside of the glass itself or our capture rate has decreased quite a bit

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:03.400
I think that's because most of the liquid is out

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.269
And we're just blowing bubbles at this point the interesting thing is our tank is still going it slowed down

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.429
But it's still pumping out liquid propane look at this down in here. So let's take it apart and play with the liquid itself

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.670
So there we go guys the goal of this experiment was to extract liquid propane

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.509
And I think you could say we've done that successfully, but there are a couple more quick experiments

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.370
I want to try before we go first off

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.010
What will a marshmallow do soaked in liquid propane and what will happen if we light it off? OK here we go dunk number one

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.310
Oh, you hear that? That's already frozen solid that's cool

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
Look at how hard that is

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.980
Cool. It froze pretty quick. Let's move in this for about another minute yeah, it's about a minute. Take it out and smash it.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.360
Oh that's hard

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.360
Nice

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.219
Yeah, it's like really crispy on the outside, but still a little gooey on the inside

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.400
Maybe I should have left it a little bit longer because now I just made a mess everywhere

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.659
Let's try that again, but this time I'm going to light it off

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.640
alright, that's been about a minute. You can see this thing

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.549
Is actually go crispy it chips off. I'm going to light it up away from the propane

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:45.149
That burned up pretty quickly and even scorched the whole thing so marshmallows in liquid propane kind of cool

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.209
But there's one bigger question on my mind that I'd really like to see the results, too

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.689
What would happen if we touched an open flame to a glass of liquid propane?

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:54.989
What the whole thing explode would it go up in a big fireball or would it

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.789
just sit there and casually burn? you and I both know there's only one way to find out now

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.759
I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen so I came out here to a big cement Pad

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.839
I'm think I'm just going to set this thing down and throw lit matches into it so we can ignite it from a distance

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.499
Sound safe right here we go moment of truth. Ooh

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.539
That was so close

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.770
There we go

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.090
Okay, so that wasn't incredibly dangerous looks like it's still burning

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.060
It is so there's a little flame in there

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.810
But that's not super dangerous at all in fact you can barely even see the flame

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.150
If you look closely you can actually be my match floating at the bottom. What if I roll it around a little bit

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.110
Oh wow look at that

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:47.789
It's got the little bits of Marshmallow inside their burning

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:54.690
wow, so it didn't explode and this actually makes sense because if you think about it this whole container is filled with propane like the

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.399
Bottle itself, there's not much oxygen here, so it doesn't actually ignite until it gets up here where it meets the atmosphere

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.769
But if I shake it around I can agitate that

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:05.879
You create a lot more gas venting off a good to think light

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:10.709
It was bigger if we were to pour this stuff out on the concrete it would have a lot more surface area and probably create

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.819
A much more dramatic effect I'm actually going to try it. I'm going to pour this on the pavement here we go

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.589
Cool, and it's gone in an instant. It's just gone it would have sat there and burned for

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.760
Indefinite amount of time in the glass, but you throw it on the concrete boom it's gone

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.649
That was very cool. Let's go ahead and summarize what we just learned here today

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.700
We know that propane is a gas in its normal state, but when compressed and confined to a container

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.240
It turns into a liquid

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.210
We found that traditional propane nozzles are designed to mix air with the propane to give a nice teal blue color

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.450
But that if we remove the shroud that mixes the air it won't let off at all

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:52.030
We chopped off the tip of the nozzle with a hacksaw and drilled out the inside and found that rather than exploding the large amount

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.390
Of gas being expelled burned slowly with the air causing a bright orange flame

00:07:55.730 --> 00:08:00.429
we opened the valve all the way tipped it upside down a cup and left it for about six minutes where we extracted all the

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.070
Liquid propane and got half a glass or about one cup

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:08.589
We tried freezing marshmallows to see what they would do and found. They got really crispy on the outside, but unless they're soaked longer

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.430
they stay pretty gummy on the inside and

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:16.090
Finally we tried lighting matches and throwing them into an open container of liquid propane to see what happened where we discover all that really?

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.470
Happens is it just slowly burns off the top as it's able to mix with the air. So there you have it guys now

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:25.600
You know how to modify your propane torches to extract liquid propane remember this stuff is extremely flammable

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.729
And this probably is'nt an experiment you really want to try at home

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.209
But I'm sure glad you joined me for this video, and I'll be looking for you the next one. Talk to you then

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:37.419
Ha I guess it comes out the back good to know

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.059
Like made Marshmallow snow that's going to be bugger to clean up
