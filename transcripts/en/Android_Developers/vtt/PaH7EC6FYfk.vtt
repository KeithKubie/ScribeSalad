00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.747
RICH HYNDMAN: This week's
Android Developer Office

00:00:01.747 --> 00:00:04.990
Hours, live from DroidCon,
Holland this week.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.310
We're in a very nice corridor
that they've put us in outside

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.140
the main hall.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.900
There's lots of interesting
talks going on in there.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.420
Something's different.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.161
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]
we wear the stupid hats.

00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:16.652
Or amazing hats.

00:00:16.652 --> 00:00:17.902
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.670
As usual, I'm joined by--

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.510
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.880
lent us some awesome headwear to
make this show a little bit

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.170
more ridiculous.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.462
I mean, awesome.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.430
RICH HYNDMAN: Epic.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.780
As normal, I'm Rich Hyndman.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.590
And I'm joined by--

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.450
NICK BUTCHER: Nick Butcher.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.640
MATT GAUNT: Matt Gaunt.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.340
SPARKY RHODE: Hey, guys.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.350
NICK BUTCHER: Just
in time delivery.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.080
We have one Sparky Rhode.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.980
SPARKY RHODE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.767
RICH HYNDMAN: We'll actually
let you do some sign-ins so

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:45.400
you can tell what's going on.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.640
Hopefully this week will
be slightly more

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.090
sane than last week.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.330
And this guy.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.245
Say hi to the internet.

00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:52.070
MALE SPEAKER: Hey.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.615
RICH HYNDMAN: Hopefully
this week will be

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:53.833
a little more sane.

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:55.720
Last week got a little bit
crazy over at Devoxx.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.560
We couldn't really hear
anything anyone said.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.102
But we've got a whole
lot of questions in

00:00:59.102 --> 00:01:01.480
the moderator's way.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.522
You can find that at
developers.googl

00:01:02.522 --> 00:01:05.690
e.com/live/android.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.330
And [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.860
Hey, Sparky.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.550
Good to see you again.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.980
Hey, Yossi.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.530
Good to see you.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.040
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.250
from Munich.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.690
And Paul, isn't it?

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.960
Paul Hanson as well.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.180
It's good to see you.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.400
Hopefully you've got some
questions for us today, Paul.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.410
Have we got anything to talk
about this week before

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.180
we jump into the--

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.035
We did so much last week with
all the SDKs and APIs and puns

00:01:28.035 --> 00:01:29.025
everything.

00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:30.510
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, it
got a bit nasty.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.005
Wasn't it?

00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:32.990
RICH HYNDMAN: It got a
bit much for us guys.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.370
This week [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.370
NICK BUTCHER: Nexus 10 back in
stock in the UK, and probably

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.180
out of stock.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.986
SPARKY RHODE: [INAUDIBLE]
should be arriving

00:01:39.986 --> 00:01:40.840
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.160
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.720
Nexus [INAUDIBLE] shipping
people, very exciting.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.560
SPARKY RHODE: Has anyone asked
where you can get Nexus 4?

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.213
NICK BUTCHER: Copy
at my house.

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:50.740
RICH HYNDMAN: I would say
that's a bit expensive.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.470
NICK BUTCHER: I don't know.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.890
RICH HYNDMAN: It's rather
[INAUDIBLE] today.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.120
Maybe

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.760
google.com/store/devices, probably.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.490
YOSSI ELKRIEF: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.740
How can I get a hat like--

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.021
RICH HYNDMAN: How can
you make a hat?

00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:01.390
MALE SPEAKER: Cruzerlite.com

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.890
RICH HYNDMAN: Cruzerlite.com.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.010
NICK BUTCHER: Is that I-T-E?

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.400
MALE SPEAKER: C-R-U-Z,
L-I. It's on the hat.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.810
RICH HYNDMAN: Hey [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.970
And we have a big
Android barbecue

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.330
kicking off here in about--

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.815
two hours, Todd?

00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:20.805
Is it the first one?

00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:22.200
Has this ever happened before?

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.500
First ever big Android
barbecue.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.864
NICK BUTCHER: Inaugural
barbecue.

00:02:25.864 --> 00:02:26.840
Hope I don't get
food poisoning.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.975
MALE SPEAKER: I haven't seen
the actual barbecue yet.

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:31.460
RICH HYNDMAN: You should come
around so they can see you.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.972
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Speaking of
barbecue, these two are also

00:02:33.972 --> 00:02:35.660
making a barbecue.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.910
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.710
RICH HYNDMAN: What's that?

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.970
MALE SPEAKER: He had
a barbecue set.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.760
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah,
just got it.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.600
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, nice.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.020
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh, what?

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.480
That's pretty epic.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.105
MALE SPEAKER: That's
from Andrew Bell.

00:02:54.105 --> 00:02:55.490
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.030
And also this one.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.440
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.300
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.290
April.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.790
RICH HYNDMAN: Well, let's get
some content into the show.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.360
And has anyone inside
the Hangout got a

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.570
question for us this week?

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.490
Going once, going twice.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.990
MATT GAUNT: Anything on NFC?

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.280
NICK BUTCHER: Drum roll.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.530
PAUL HANSON: I've got one.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.840
It's just these lock
screen widgets.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.700
Do you have full access to NFC
and other resources on the

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.988
lock screen widget?

00:03:23.988 --> 00:03:25.820
NICK BUTCHER: No.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.740
PAUL HANSON: No?

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.620
OK, cool.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.230
I didn't think so.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.290
NICK BUTCHER: No, they're still
remote user access.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.540
So only remote-able objects,
you can put inside it.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.940
PAUL HANSON: OK.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.726
RICH HYNDMAN: It's-- yeah--
pretty much just the same as a

00:03:37.726 --> 00:03:39.680
desktop widget in
most respects.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.630
You just set the flag to say
whether you want desktop or

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.590
lock screen or both.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.365
It's like a manifest in
the declaration--

00:03:45.365 --> 00:03:47.590
Winnie the Pooh's just joined
us-- in the declaration of the

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.090
lock screen widget.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.840
And I think so far the abundance
of lock screen

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.790
widgets have been clocks, which
use a single font weight

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.256
throughout.

00:03:55.256 --> 00:03:57.590
NICK BUTCHER: Boo.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.470
Anyway, in fact, I think
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.810
Isn't the NFC chip powered
down until

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.130
screen on and unlocked?

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.736
RICH HYNDMAN: It may well be.

00:04:05.736 --> 00:04:06.706
NICK BUTCHER: So I
believe that was

00:04:06.706 --> 00:04:07.180
certainly the case before.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.224
I don't think that's changed
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:09.224 --> 00:04:10.550
I don't know off hand.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.240
But yeah.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.810
That reason, I don't think--

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.946
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:12.946 --> 00:04:16.190
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, for that
reason, [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.990
PAUL HANSON: That sounds good.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.390
Thank you.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.190
It's what I expect.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.089
Thanks, guys.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:20.470
RICH HYNDMAN: No
problem at all.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.480
Yossi's joined twice,
I believe, now.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.240
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, Yossi.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.915
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:27.000
YOSSI ELKRIEF: I just
lost my Wi-Fi.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.620
So this one will drop soon.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.490
RICH HYNDMAN: Do you
have the moderator

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.010
there for us, Sparky?

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.180
SPARKY RHODE: I do.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.990
We have a bumper crop of
moderator questions this week.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.570
I count, I believe, 17
moderator questions.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.070
RICH HYNDMAN: You count or you
looked at the number which

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.520
tells you how many there are?

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.505
A handy thing.

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:53.350
SPARKY RHODE: But I actually
counted them.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.600
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.540
SPARKY RHODE: Leave it to me to
use an order and operation

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.990
where a constant time
will suffice.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.370
RICH HYNDMAN: OK, then.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.620
Let's get straight into our--

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.170
SPARKY RHODE: OK.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.030
"Best practices for unit
testing Android apps?

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.150
What is Google using, and
what's in the pipeline?

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.290
Guice, Maven, JUnit, Robotium,
UI Automator Viewer, or

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.056
other?"

00:05:14.056 --> 00:05:15.656
NICK BUTCHER: To come to do this
Hangout, I just walked

00:05:15.656 --> 00:05:17.540
out on a talk on testing,
unfortunately.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.950
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.442
do you want to give a plug to
the official guidelines first?

00:05:22.442 --> 00:05:22.780
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.050
I gave a link to the
developer docs and

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.940
that was my only answer.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.770
NICK BUTCHER: So the question
is, what is Google using

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.050
internally?

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.220
And that tends to vary by app.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.110
So most people are using their
normal JUnit stuff.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.780
I've been hearing a lot about
Mockito, gaining a lot of

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.910
popularity since Mockito added
support for mocking out

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:46.590
Android objects.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.710
That's getting really,
really popular.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.290
There's also the new UI
Automator framework, which our

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.710
internal testing
team developed.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.092
And then that's just been
open sourced in the

00:05:56.092 --> 00:05:59.420
latest tools release.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.920
One of my statements is a
service called testdroid.com,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.050
who offer an awesome recorder
service to essentially

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.900
generate Robotium [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.172
Which is very, very cool.

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:15.944
MALE SPEAKER: Testing
on 100 plus devices

00:06:15.944 --> 00:06:18.210
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, and then you
can upload it to a cloud

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.660
or test on a bunch of
different devices.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.493
Any other favorites?

00:06:22.493 --> 00:06:26.090
MATT GAUNT: It's just JUnit, I
think is the classic, really.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.750
I think the best bet may be,
start there just for really

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.560
local testing.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.540
The Testdroid's awesome for
getting [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.390
devices.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.710
Obviously, there's other things
like DeviceAnywhere and

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.520
some other people that do a
similar sort of thing where

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.970
you can test on devices,
get sceen shots.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.740
So I think Testdroid adds an
extra load of stuff with it.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.860
If you're just running all
of your own test scripts.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.525
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, and
whichever one you choose, even

00:06:46.525 --> 00:06:48.100
if you do them all, it all comes
down to the quality of

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.480
the test scripts in the end.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.480
Are your test cases valid?

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.951
Can you actually get them
to pass and fail?

00:06:53.951 --> 00:06:55.080
Are you testing the
right thing?

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.500
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE] the
whole hour like that?

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.040
RICH HYNDMAN: This isn't me.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.840
This is just what Nexus
10 has come to.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.300
NICK BUTCHER: And yeah, he also
specifically called out--

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.440
we should say this is
from powder366.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.372
I'm going to take that to mean
that you're a snowboarder and

00:07:07.372 --> 00:07:09.920
therefore awesome.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.200
He asked specifically
about Guice.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.900
I would say--

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:12.550
I can't see.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.840
RICH HYNDMAN: All right.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.570
All right.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.220
NICK BUTCHER: I would
specifically say that I

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.610
definitely use Guice
very heavily.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.790
I think at one time the Google
Drive app might have used it.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.780
But I don't know if
that still holds.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.530
Mostly because of the run
time and [? fancy ?]

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.440
resolution stuff.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.385
All the reflection APIs
are pretty expensive

00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:29.520
on low power devices.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.450
So I don't think we
use Guice hugely.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.160
And there's this new crop of
other dependency injection

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:40.430
frameworks, which are using
ahead of time compile time

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.940
resolution.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.205
So stuff like--

00:07:42.205 --> 00:07:43.710
what's the one I'm
thinking of?

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.620
Auto--

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.440
no, that's the bus.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.406
Dagger.

00:07:46.406 --> 00:07:46.890
RICH HYNDMAN: Dagger.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:47.450
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.700
are pretty interesting.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.590
Or Android [? annotations ?]
and stuff like that.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.040
I would say you do some kind
of injection-y type things.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.005
RICH HYNDMAN: And Dagger,
actually by injecting code, so

00:07:56.005 --> 00:07:57.890
you can debug as well.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:58.250
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.530
So they compile time.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.430
You can see the code
it spits out.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.550
You can debug it.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.990
And there's no additional cost
on runtime, which is what you

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.550
really, really care about.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:07.630
Not so much Guice.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.180
The other tool, which
is upcoming-- it's

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.030
not launched yet.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.070
But we heard about it
a couple weeks ago.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.400
The Square guys, the prolific
open sourcers of awesome code,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.060
are working on a framework
called Spoon, which we had a

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:19.670
preview of.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:20.850
And [? Jake Watton ?]

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.810
from Square gave it a very good
talk at Devoxx a couple

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:25.270
weeks back.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.820
And he gave us a sneak preview
of the Spoon framework, which

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.150
should be going open source
soon, which lets you run your

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.030
tests across a bunch of devices
and recall the results

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.909
off of them and see screen shots
and make sure you're not

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:40.066
breaking your layout on
Device Y or whatever.

00:08:40.066 --> 00:08:41.640
So there's some cool
tools out there.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.520
Anyway.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.020
RICH HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.466
NICK BUTCHER: Kind of nailed
that question.

00:08:44.466 --> 00:08:45.716
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.030
Next [? person. ?]

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.750
PAUL HANSON: I've got one
question based on what you

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.490
said about dependency
injection.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.130
Has anyone ever used Spring?

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.310
Because I heard some
time ago--

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.710
Spring being big in Java, but
they were doing some stuff

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:02.270
with Android.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.820
Anyone had any use for that?

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.520
NICK BUTCHER: I have not.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.510
I used Spring in my former
life as a J developer.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.850
My gut reaction is it's a kind
of a whole massive stack,

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.703
which scares me about all these
things happening at run

00:09:17.703 --> 00:09:18.920
time in Android.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.200
I want to make sure
that you're not--

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.210
that some developer--

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:22.740
[? conveniently ?]

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.037
not sacrificing any
performance or

00:09:24.037 --> 00:09:24.690
anything like that.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.290
So I haven't looked
at it in depth.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.650
But I have some sense.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.065
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, it's
kind of always sat on

00:09:32.065 --> 00:09:34.130
the edge of my vision.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.910
But I've never really paid
much attention to it.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.915
I've not needed to, I guess.

00:09:37.915 --> 00:09:39.165
So yeah.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:42.770
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.952
beta test.

00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:45.960
PAUL HANSON: OK, thanks, guys.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.995
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, and make
sure it's not doing anything

00:09:48.995 --> 00:09:50.085
in run time.

00:09:50.085 --> 00:09:52.165
I don't really know what
it's doing because--

00:09:52.165 --> 00:09:53.415
be careful there.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.060
So next question from
the moderator.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.670
SPARKY RHODE: Next question
from the moderator.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.030
"I want to perform
an action when a

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.630
user is near a location.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.720
I have a proximity alert
on a service that runs

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.025
indefinitely.

00:10:11.025 --> 00:10:13.400
Is this is good practice in
terms of battery use,

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.130
performance, et cetera?" Can
we provide other ideas?

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:22.684
"Does maps check in reminder
work differently, et cetera?"

00:10:22.684 --> 00:10:23.790
I think [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.000
has not been a real
strength of our

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.700
location API in the past.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:35.050
Reto published a blog post not
quite a year and a half ago

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.490
called Deep Dive Into Location
that's worth checking out.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:42.300
He calls out things like
passively listening for

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.890
location updates that other apps
request that you don't

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:49.155
have to wake up the radios
yourself to do it.

00:10:49.155 --> 00:10:55.820
Don't use any finer location
than you need.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.680
If you're still several
kilometers away from your

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.770
destination, you don't actually
need to know within

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.000
20 meters where you are.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.890
And then, my advice is also just
use some estimation to

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.580
reduce the frequency
of your updates.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.250
If you know that's going to be
15 minutes before you get to

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.720
your destination, you don't need
to check your location

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.650
every five minutes.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:19.900
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.500
Reto's Google I/O 2011
talk as well.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.810
Pro tips.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.860
You might as well watch
pro tips too.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.608
MATT GAUNT: Didn't someone open
source the code from that

00:11:28.608 --> 00:11:29.850
as well [INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:30.730
NICK BUTCHER: Two
implementations.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:31.110
Yeah.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.890
So I think the guys
from Novoda--

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.380
RICH HYNDMAN: Novoda
did one, yeah.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:34.780
NICK BUTCHER: --open
sourced it.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.790
Github.com/novoda.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.270
They've got a Novoda-cation--

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.970
Novoda location, something
like that--

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.750
library, where they basically
took Reto's tons and tons of

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.420
awesome best practice code
and wrapped it up

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.630
into a library project.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.935
So you can actually just listen
to certain broadcasts

00:11:48.935 --> 00:11:51.660
for all these location events.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.600
And there's another one, I
think, as well from the guys

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.440
from [? Quite. ?]

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.005
So Stefano from [? Quite ?],
think used AspectJ to do a

00:11:58.005 --> 00:12:00.410
similar kind of thing, so
compile time using library

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.050
project using aspects.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.100
So two implementation of that.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:03.630
So yeah.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.500
[INAUDIBLE] definitely Reto's
post, specifically just the

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.370
case of geofencing.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.140
I wouldn't say having a service
running the whole time

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.100
is really the best thing.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.500
You basically want your service
to die as soon as

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.740
possible when it's not really
doing any work.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.510
So you probably want to use a
combination of the passive

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:22.220
location provider and inexact
repeating alarms to grab

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.930
locations whenever anyone else
fires up the location provider

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.960
and also notify your app with
the passive provider.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.170
But then if you need to check
at a minimum interval, like

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:35.185
every 15, 20 minutes, well then
use the inexact repeating

00:12:35.185 --> 00:12:36.606
alarms as well.

00:12:36.606 --> 00:12:37.030
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.590
I mean, I'm slightly confused as
to why they need to have a

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.390
service running all
the time as well.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.645
Because that's kind
of the whole point

00:12:43.645 --> 00:12:44.360
of proximity alert.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.810
You're waiting for
something to kick

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.500
off, then you do something.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.390
Rather than have it--

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.720
[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.320
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, so I think
in practice, right from the

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.870
start, there's something that
maybe we're not understanding.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.350
Or perhaps you just need
to think about it

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.990
in a different way.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.470
Because of having a service
running all the time scares me

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.414
a little bit.

00:13:05.414 --> 00:13:07.360
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:07.800
All right.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.512
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:09.512 --> 00:13:10.710
SPARKY RHODE: You can see maybe
running a service all

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.830
the time if you're doing
something like opportunistic

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.980
location matching.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.560
Say, where am I now
and what points of

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.160
interest are near me?

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.710
Sort of like the field trip app
or something like that.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.870
Maybe then it makes a little
bit more sense.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:26.320
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.490
But you're not [INAUDIBLE]
location

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.080
the whole time, right?

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.340
You want the service to stop
itself as soon as it's stopped

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.620
any work and schedule itself to
be woken up again after a

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.907
period and then stop itself.

00:13:35.907 --> 00:13:36.761
Right?

00:13:36.761 --> 00:13:37.190
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.975
And I mean, I guess you'd also
get to a point where you'd

00:13:38.975 --> 00:13:41.580
want to use a cell tower
location as just a rough

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.800
guide, wait for that to change,
try and listen off the

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.350
passive things.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.640
And if you need more fine
grained GPS, then start

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.710
perhaps thinking about how you
can try and avoid that.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.030
When you do use it,
use it sparingly.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.936
Yeah.

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:58.840
NICK BUTCHER: Good advice.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.792
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:13:59.792 --> 00:14:00.744
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:00.744 --> 00:14:02.180
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.510
[INAUDIBLE] asked us one
question in the chat.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:09.850
"How can we access a list view
item field using a simple

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:13.980
cursor adapter that contains a
progress bar, not bind to the

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.400
cursor data from [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.252
I should have read while
I read that.

00:14:20.252 --> 00:14:24.084
It's a long sentence
after the negation.

00:14:24.084 --> 00:14:29.611
"How can I access a list view
item field using a simple

00:14:29.611 --> 00:14:33.350
cursor adapter?"

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.090
MALE SPEAKER: Can I explain
probably better?

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:35.990
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes, sure.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.970
Yes, please.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:37.750
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.610
In the list view, I have the
items binded with the simple

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:43.950
cursor adapter.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.100
OK?

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.380
But I have-- one view more
is a progress bar.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:55.000
And from a different trait, I
need to access this progress

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.350
bar and update the value.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.200
I don't want to update the
database because you can

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:00.840
[INAUDIBLE].

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.695
If I want to update the database
each millisecond, I

00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:07.010
would [INAUDIBLE] the
access to the SD

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.630
card millions of times.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:14.630
So I want to access just the
view of the list view and get

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:19.230
the item, find the progress
bar, and update.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:23.810
All of this from a
different trait.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.800
RICH HYNDMAN: So you've
got a list.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.330
And at some point, one of the
items in that list will have a

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.640
progress bar going across it?

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.760
MALE SPEAKER: Each item has
one one progress bar.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.015
RICH HYNDMAN: You've got
[INAUDIBLE] tasks running.

00:15:38.015 --> 00:15:40.640
MALE SPEAKER: They're running
downloading, some downloading.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.450
And I need to refer to
the progress bar

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.740
and update the value.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:51.020
Because the items are binded to
simple cursor adapter, it's

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:56.110
binded with the cursor, I cannot
simply just get the

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:59.960
position or something like that
and access to the view.

00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:05.170
MATT GAUNT: But you
can't access--

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:06.320
you don't know which particular

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.370
item you want to allow?

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.620
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:16:15.205 --> 00:16:17.610
I ruined one week to
find a solution.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:23.090
But nothing to do because
from the--

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.820
SPARKY RHODE: Maybe--

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.420
YOSSI ELKRIEF: But if
he extends list

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.250
view and then use--

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.580
I forgot the term for it.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.270
SPARKY RHODE: Maybe something
more like a custom view

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:45.890
adapter, where you have your own
code that draws the view.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:47.170
And at that time, you can--

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:51.320
MALE SPEAKER: No, I'm just
using the regular simple

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.790
cursor adapter for
this list view.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.656
I don't use a custom adapter.

00:16:56.656 --> 00:16:57.608
SPARKY RHODE: But I'm asking--

00:16:57.608 --> 00:16:58.560
MALE SPEAKER: I'm just--

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.020
YOSSI ELKRIEF: You can extend
the simple cursor adapter.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:06.079
And then use it to override the
get view method so it will

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:07.880
fit your needs.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:15.579
And then if you use a view
container that has the tag for

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:19.480
each item in the cursor,
it can do view get tag.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.130
And then you can--

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:20.590
MALE SPEAKER: Yossi.

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:21.050
Yossi.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:21.920
Sorry.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.849
Sorry to stop you, Yossi.

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:26.950
I agree with you if we already
decided that the get view or

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.270
new view, et cetera.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.590
But not from our [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.620
treat, not from AsyncTask.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.130
OK?

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:37.350
The AsyncTask has nothing
to do with the get view.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.670
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.730
You can and add a new method
through the simple cursor

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.900
adapter that you extend.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:48.045
And then from that adapter, you
can get the position and

00:17:48.045 --> 00:17:49.440
check the tag.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.060
And if the tag is the same tag
you need from the cursor, then

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.480
you can update the view.

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.465
You understand what I mean?

00:18:00.465 --> 00:18:00.720
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.332
Of course I understand.

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:03.030
Yeah.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.160
It's interesting [INAUDIBLE]
purpose.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:04.325
Yeah.

00:18:04.325 --> 00:18:06.110
Yeah.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.700
Is I will try to do that.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.110
MATT GAUNT: I think this
is where probably I'd

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:12.200
instinctively go to solve
that problem.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.690
I would just--

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.540
I guess the way you're saying
you don't know which item on

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.215
the list you want to update, you
need to find that way of

00:18:19.215 --> 00:18:21.260
matching the two up, which
you do in the adapter

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.250
one way or the other.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:24.050
But yeah.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.260
If you extend the simple cursor
adaptor, then you can

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.480
start doing a lot
of this stuff.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.712
And it's one of those things
where you have to go to

00:18:29.712 --> 00:18:32.020
yourself, is it trying to do
something outside of what the

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.950
pre built cursor or the
pre built adaptor

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:35.200
is designed to do?

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.460
Yeah.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.590
Just make sure you use the
view holder design path.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.990
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.590
View holder, and also
use hash map or

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.750
something for faster using.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.240
And then when you use the view
holder, set the hash map tag

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.302
to the same view so you
can find it faster.

00:18:55.302 --> 00:18:56.180
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.080
I believe that is the
right solution.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.040
I was just looking for something
to not change all of

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.420
the structure, not change the
simple cursor adapter with

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.550
something else.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:06.790
Just looking for--

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:10.283
that is why the custom is there,
just to [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:10.283 --> 00:19:11.090
all that.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:12.990
Can I have one more
question probably?

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.890
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:14.840
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.930
Any way for a non system
application to write in the

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:21.580
secure settings?

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:21.970
RICH HYNDMAN: No.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.140
NICK BUTCHER: Nope.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:23.780
MALE SPEAKER: No way.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:28.230
But is it changed something in
the 4.2 with the settings?

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.490
What is it?

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.190
What is this?

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:34.350
RICH HYNDMAN: So some settings
were moved to global settings

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.160
from system settings.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.090
They didn't obscure them.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.562
So some, you can read and write
system settings, or at

00:19:40.562 --> 00:19:43.420
least into the tables.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.550
And some of those items have
now been moved into global

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:48.360
settings where they're
now read only.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.160
The main one of those
is flight mode.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.630
NICK BUTCHER: Some things in
multi user tablets, it just

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.370
doesn't make sense to
have a per user

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.680
setting like flight mode.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.140
It should about the
global settings.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.470
So there was some refactoring of
where the settings lived to

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.112
support multi user.

00:20:05.112 --> 00:20:05.560
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.375
So if if you've got a widget
which used to turn flight mode

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:11.080
on or off, now it's best just
to send the user to the

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.005
settings screen for flight
mode, to the network and

00:20:13.005 --> 00:20:14.050
wireless settings screen.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.210
That's the only place
now that they--

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.930
well, that's the place--

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.400
MALE SPEAKER: If I understood
well, there are many, many

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.730
applications that use a battery
level checker that

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.300
must be updated for the 4.2.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:27.520
Right?

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.850
RICH HYNDMAN: Because
it doesn't fail.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:32.410
All it does is just return
to say that it

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:33.470
didn't write the value.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.752
It's the same situation.

00:20:35.752 --> 00:20:36.560
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.030
RICH HYNDMAN: The application
is not going to

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.780
throw out an exception.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:44.275
MALE SPEAKER: Is there any
other way we can save

00:20:44.275 --> 00:20:50.060
information to somewhere in the
system, like the secure

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:54.050
that is accessible only from an
application that will write

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.780
the information?

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:57.450
RICH HYNDMAN: You're own--

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:58.290
NICK BUTCHER: I don't understand
the question.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:58.720
RICH HYNDMAN: --shared
preferences?

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.380
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.520
I will repeat again.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:07.770
I'm looking for somewhere to
write some information.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:11.330
And only my application
can access this

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.030
information, not like--

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.180
what?

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.900
RICH HYNDMAN: In your own shared
preferences, you can

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.345
just-- or any file-- you
can open it as private.

00:21:19.345 --> 00:21:20.950
And then it's not accessible
to anyone else.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:21.600
It's your own--

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:21.810
MALE SPEAKER: Where?

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:22.170
Sorry.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:23.120
Where is [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.602
NICK BUTCHER: Multiple of your
own applications or just one

00:21:25.602 --> 00:21:26.990
application?

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.470
MALE SPEAKER: One application.

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:30.710
RICH HYNDMAN: All the files,
all the data for your

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:31.930
application is protected.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.270
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.900
Protected.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:37.190
When they root to the mobile end
user some explorer, they

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.890
can find any files, any
database, anything.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:42.860
SPARKY RHODE: Nothing's
protected when it's rooted.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.925
I mean, if you want to keep
things so that they can't read

00:21:45.925 --> 00:21:47.580
it after the devices
has been rooted--

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.260
I don't know--

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.671
your own encryption scheme or
something is probably what

00:21:51.671 --> 00:21:52.363
you'd have to do.

00:21:52.363 --> 00:21:55.590
RICH HYNDMAN: KeyStore API?

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:56.846
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, you
might be able to use

00:21:56.846 --> 00:21:57.926
the KeyStore API.

00:21:57.926 --> 00:21:59.660
I'm not certain.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:21:59.800
RICH HYNDMAN: So, yeah.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.350
For the most part--

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.190
MALE SPEAKER: Yes?

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:04.880
RICH HYNDMAN: For the most part,
yeah, you just use the

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.190
protection that Android
offers you.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.210
But if you're concerned about
rooted users as well--

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:11.210
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I know
that the data over the

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:14.460
application is accessible only
from the application.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.890
But if they use some
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.180
walk around, they can
find the data.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.810
They can change everything.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.750
And now, if for [? three ?]

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:28.670
last years, 20% of the people
have a rooted phone,

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.440
now they are 80%.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.130
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]
anywhere near that.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:32.630
NICK BUTCHER: No way.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.130
Less than one.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:35.905
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, I would
definitely say less than 1% of

00:22:35.905 --> 00:22:38.720
people have a rooted phone.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.090
MALE SPEAKER: What?

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:42.700
NICK BUTCHER: At the end of the
day, this is kind of moot.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.810
It's not a secure computing
environment, right?

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:47.480
This is a piece of code running
on a user's device, an

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.240
untrusted device.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:48.630
Right?

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:49.840
You can't be 100% sure.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.240
I mean, there's ways
you can help.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.660
Android is a messy [? can. ?]

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.710
But at the end of the
day, it's code

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.000
running on their device.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.600
If it's super secure, then don't
keep it on the device.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.130
Keep it on the server
or something.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:22:59.320
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.590
At any point, anyone could run
this on an emulated or

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:05.010
simulated environment and get
access that data anyway.

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.590
So there's not going to be a
place that you're going to be

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.840
able to put that to keep
it totally secure.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.680
MALE SPEAKER: Because in one
of our applications, until

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:23.530
version 4.2 of Android, we were
using the encryption AES,

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.750
AES encryption.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:31.585
But I don't know why starting
version 4.2, it's crashing

00:23:31.585 --> 00:23:32.960
when we try to--

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.500
NICK BUTCHER: I know why.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.720
MALE SPEAKER: You know why?

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.810
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, there was
a change to secure element.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.480
Some people were making bad
assumptions about how

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.110
SecureRandom--

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.595
sorry, not secure element.

00:23:41.595 --> 00:23:42.270
RICH HYNDMAN: SecureRandom,
yeah.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.232
NICK BUTCHER: How SecureRandom
worked.

00:23:44.232 --> 00:23:46.396
I think we have a blog post
coming out on this, right?

00:23:46.396 --> 00:23:47.070
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:49.160
There'll be more information
on it soon.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.310
NICK BUTCHER: I don't have
details at hand.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.630
But yeah.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:51.350
The implementation of

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.980
SecureRandom has changed slightly.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.640
And so if you were making bad
assumptions about how it

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.751
worked, then it will
break for you.

00:24:00.751 --> 00:24:01.150
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:01.940
Thank you.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.240
RICH HYNDMAN: We have seen
a few apps break over

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.113
SecureRandom.

00:24:04.113 --> 00:24:07.020
NICK BUTCHER: Ping us offline
right now, and I'll try to get

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.050
the exact change you
need to make.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:10.620
But we have a blog
post on this.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.540
MALE SPEAKER: And what do you
suggest doing at this time

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.460
until we find the
final solution?

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:22.570
How can we work around the
problem of encryption in 4.2?

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:23.970
NICK BUTCHER: So if your app's
not working, if it completely

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:27.460
fails on 4.2, then I guess for a
temporary measure, you could

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.520
set a max SDK on your APK
so that 4.2 users

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.495
can't download it.

00:24:31.495 --> 00:24:34.500
That would be one way to do
it until you fix the bug.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.766
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:24:35.766 --> 00:24:36.880
RICH HYNDMAN: I can probably
get offline.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.600
We'll try and--

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.610
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, we
can resolve this

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.780
if it's a huge issue.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.952
Ping us after the show
and I'll send

00:24:42.952 --> 00:24:45.046
you some sample code.

00:24:45.046 --> 00:24:45.480
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.490
I will do that.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:48.110
Thank you.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.340
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:48.940
Also [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.550
Nexus, there will be a blog
post going out soon making

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:55.790
that available to the
wider audience.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.510
OK.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.310
Somebody has joined
us in the Hangout.

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.610
NICK BUTCHER: I'm getting grief
on the comment box for

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:01.400
not wearing a hat.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.470
MATT GAUNT: Yes you are.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:03.310
NICK BUTCHER: It's
hot in here.

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:04.800
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.010
So you've got the blue.

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:07.738
It is hot in here.

00:25:07.738 --> 00:25:08.850
NICK BUTCHER: I guess it's
probably [? sane. ?]

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:09.650
RICH HYNDMAN: It's
why we're facing

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:10.300
this way in the corridor.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.790
Because if you face that way,
it's just sun and brightness,

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.770
and you can't see us at all.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:15.490
SPARKY RHODE: Who said that?

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.350
I can't see you.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.450
NICK BUTCHER: Can we get on to
the multi [? printing ?]

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:18.790
questions?

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:19.700
I want to answer that one.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:20.460
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.690
Next question--

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:22.540
MATT GAUNT: Go, go go.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.790
NICK BUTCHER: If there's no
one in there before that.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.835
RICH HYNDMAN: Well,
you can just skip.

00:25:27.835 --> 00:25:28.607
Just jump straight to it.

00:25:28.607 --> 00:25:29.601
MATT GAUNT: Well, be crazy.

00:25:29.601 --> 00:25:30.098
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:25:30.098 --> 00:25:31.590
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.860
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.815
Rumburak, I guess, in the UK
asks, "What happens to the

00:25:35.815 --> 00:25:38.440
worker threads in a pool doing
some network queries to be

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.645
displayed on the UI when the
activity is destroyed, eg like

00:25:41.645 --> 00:25:43.180
a [? config ?] change?

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.390
And what are activities and
tasks described in terms of

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:48.776
Android OS and Linux processors
and users and so

00:25:48.776 --> 00:25:48.900
on?"

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:49.590
RICH HYNDMAN: Nice.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.860
NICK BUTCHER: So
good question.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:57.090
So generally, an Android
application is a user.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:59.585
There's one user per application
at install time

00:25:59.585 --> 00:26:00.700
that you can have.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:01.500
That's not quite true.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:02.980
You can actually share the
user ID between your

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.110
applications if you set a
flag in your manifest.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:08.020
But generally, it's one user to
an application and a single

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.240
process, which is Random VM.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.910
So when your application
starts, yeah,

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.580
the process is started.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.690
It's forked from [? Zyguts ?].

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.550
And you get one thread.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.390
So that Java thread,
which maps exactly

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.530
to the Linux zThread.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:25.022
eThread.

00:26:25.022 --> 00:26:27.160
RICH HYNDMAN: eThread,
eThread.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:27.950
NICK BUTCHER: So then yeah.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.495
But then you have many, many
different ways in which you

00:26:30.495 --> 00:26:31.330
can do multitasking
after that.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.570
So when you ask what happens to
worker threads in the pool

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.825
doing some network queries,
that's kind of

00:26:35.825 --> 00:26:36.510
an open ended question.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:37.960
It depends on how you create
those worker threads.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.390
I mean, if you're talking
about AsyncTask, which I

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:45.000
suspect you might be, then those
threads will continue to

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.490
completion.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:48.685
But then they won't really have
a context to call back

00:26:48.685 --> 00:26:51.540
onto, so those won't
go anywhere.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.670
But if you are going to do your
own thing-- so if you're

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:55.425
going to create a thread
yourself, or if you're going

00:26:55.425 --> 00:27:00.442
to use an ExecutorService or an
IntentService or loaders or

00:27:00.442 --> 00:27:04.270
any of these good things, then
you have these tasks that

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:05.710
persistently--

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.650
destruction of your activity
and recreation of your

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.270
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.610
So it's kind of an open
ended question.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:11.830
Yeah.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:16.680
AsyncTask is convenient but not
always the right answer to

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.330
your problem.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.420
Take a look at some other stuff
like IntentServices and

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:24.568
handler threads and another
such mechanisms as well.

00:27:24.568 --> 00:27:25.852
RICH HYNDMAN: That's
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:25.852 --> 00:27:27.766
And don't use your activities.

00:27:27.766 --> 00:27:28.672
MATT GAUNT: No.

00:27:28.672 --> 00:27:29.580
Never do that.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.880
NICK BUTCHER: So I hope I
answered your question.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.260
SPARKY RHODE: Right.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.020
My--

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:34.930
RICH HYNDMAN: What's
that, Sparky?

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:39.040
SPARKY RHODE: My sort of icing
on that cake is if you are

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.760
going to run an AsyncTask,
either make sure that you

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.590
don't rely on information
from your context.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.480
Or if you do, then when
your context--

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.330
i.e, your activity-- goes
away, kill the task.

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:54.870
Kill the AsyncTask
before you do.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:55.350
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.000
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I used
to use AsyncTask quite

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.500
frequently.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:58.750
I think because it's
so convenient.

00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:59.350
Right?

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:02.220
It's so easy to create and get
these callbacks, which does

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:05.170
all the the marshalling of the
threads-- or mostly-- for you.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:06.380
But you end up--

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.750
if you have to survive rotation
changes and things

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.040
like that, you end up having
to write some extra stuff.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.430
So I've actually been more
inclined to use a Handler

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:16.800
thread these days and
pass messages.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.596
I find that you get much more
control over when stuff

00:28:20.596 --> 00:28:23.990
happens and how [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.450
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:28.080
I still like the old occasional
in line thread,

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.940
just chuck it into
[? random book ?], get it

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:30.760
straight in line,
and come back.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.980
If it just needs to be taken
off the main thread.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.160
NICK BUTCHER: Pro tip, if you're
going to do that, make

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.630
sure you're setting
the process.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.600
So if you do create just a
thread, make sure you're

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.230
setting the android.os.process,
not the

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:44.220
java.line.process.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.605
It's a bit confusing because
there's two process classes.

00:28:46.605 --> 00:28:49.094
So make sure you import the
right one and do the set

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:50.455
thread priority to background.

00:28:50.455 --> 00:28:50.890
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:53.550
And that actually goes into
a background thread in the

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.820
kernel as well, which is nice.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:57.940
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE],
yeah.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.190
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:00.580
Happy?

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.095
You got to answer the question
you wanted to answer?

00:29:02.095 --> 00:29:02.960
NICK BUTCHER: It's
a good question.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.624
I like multi [? thread. ?]

00:29:04.624 --> 00:29:05.380
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.150
I was just about to ask you
if you have a question.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.380
But he's disappeared.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.330
What's up next?

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:12.360
Is there anything coming through
on the G+ thread?

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.720
MATT GAUNT: Just lots of
love for the hats.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.770
Lots of love.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:16.752
NICK BUTCHER: "Are the
hats available

00:29:16.752 --> 00:29:18.005
for sale?" says Lionel.

00:29:18.005 --> 00:29:18.725
I think they are.

00:29:18.725 --> 00:29:21.500
Is it cruzerlite.com?

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.195
RICH HYNDMAN: I think
CruzerLite plushy.

00:29:23.195 --> 00:29:25.420
If you trying that--

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.860
they're here selling them
at DroidCon, Holland.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.846
MATT GAUNT: Come
up to Holland.

00:29:30.846 --> 00:29:32.570
RICH HYNDMAN: Come to Holland.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:33.310
You can get them here.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:37.130
I think they're 20 euros each.

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.372
Or follow Aaron Capo on--

00:29:39.372 --> 00:29:40.176
Aaron--

00:29:40.176 --> 00:29:41.790
Jesus.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:45.158
Two wrong names in
one sentence.

00:29:45.158 --> 00:29:47.250
I'll remember his name
in a second.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:48.500
It's Aaron though, right?

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.157
On G+.

00:29:52.157 --> 00:29:54.900
MATT GAUNT: Aaron Casten?

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.410
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:56.030
Aaron Casten.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:57.510
That's probably it.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:00.140
That's where they are.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:00.630
OK.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:01.580
Next question.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:02.730
MATT GAUNT: Let's do it.

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:03.115
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:30:03.115 --> 00:30:06.630
So frequent commenter Jan Souza
asks, "How can I do a

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:12.625
horizontal scroll on list view
like the G+ application in

00:30:12.625 --> 00:30:14.040
landscape?"

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.230
RICH HYNDMAN: That's
a custom layout.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.900
That, you can talk to
[? Chris Benz ?].

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.970
He is currently working on
a project to do one.

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:21.260
There are numerous
other projects.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:21.760
But you're right.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.750
Currently, there isn't a
system widget which we

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.800
recommend using to
do horizontal

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.060
scrolling on a list view.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.780
NICK BUTCHER: There was some
work on something in the

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:30.540
support library [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:31.310
chapter on G+.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:33.760
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.280
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]
is really good.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.520
NICK BUTCHER: And [INAUDIBLE]
is already up.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.520
So I don't know what the
status of that is.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.900
But you might be able to look
at it as the basis of your

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:43.323
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:43.323 --> 00:30:43.746
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:30:43.746 --> 00:30:46.590
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:47.530
Yeah.

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:48.540
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.890
RICH HYNDMAN: I mean, Gallery
got deprecated because it

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:51.770
wasn't supported.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:54.590
And it didn't do things
quite right.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:55.820
MATT GAUNT: It didn't
[INAUDIBLE] views, did it?

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.020
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.240
NICK BUTCHER: There are a bunch
of these implementations

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.930
of horizontal list view on
GitHub and so forth.

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:03.970
RICH HYNDMAN: I predict you'll
have 10 good implementations

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:05.800
soon instead of none.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.470
There's a few people
working on them.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.236
So just search the community.

00:31:12.236 --> 00:31:14.040
You don't have to come to
Holland for that one.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.810
MATT GAUNT: The main one is
just script for one that's

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:16.850
definitely using an
adapter path.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.850
Because one way or another, if
you do that, then hopefully,

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:21.270
whenever the the next
one comes up--

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:22.630
whatever it might be--

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.180
it'll still be adapter based.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.756
So hopefully it won't be too
much that you have to change.

00:31:26.756 --> 00:31:27.200
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.780
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.070
NICK BUTCHER: You might want
to take a look at list view

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.940
and how it does recycling
as well.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.900
Because that's pretty key
to getting performance.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.482
MATT GAUNT: It does a lot
of crazy stuff in

00:31:35.482 --> 00:31:36.160
there, doesn't it?

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.770
I swear at one point I started
looking at it.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:38.780
And yeah.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.860
It's a bit mental.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.455
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE] list
view, right, is its parent

00:31:41.455 --> 00:31:45.210
that you can extend and
change it somehow.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:46.570
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:47.910
MATT GAUNT: The community
will provide.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:50.650
RICH HYNDMAN: Ask and the
community will provide.

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:51.760
Maybe Sparky.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.910
NICK BUTCHER: Nothing
got next?

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.720
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.130
Another one there, Sparky?

00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:59.910
The next question.

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:02.660
SPARKY RHODE: "Is there any
way to enable multi-user

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:07.440
support on AVD with Android
4.2 and the latest ADT21?

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.500
The option in settings
is missing.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.450
And I can't see any option when
creating the new AVD."

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:14.550
Unfortunately, I don't know.

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:15.830
RICH HYNDMAN: If you create--

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.860
it must be the case, if you
created a high resolution

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.830
device, you've got the
tablet layout.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:21.973
Creating a high resolution
device means you'd get the

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:22.510
multi user.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:25.210
NICK BUTCHER: I don't know.

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:29.260
There may be some AM
flags you can poke.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.640
So before we launched
multi-user, people had already

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:35.810
found it in JV in 4.1.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:38.850
And there were some activity
measure settings you could

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.310
toggle from the command
line to turn it on.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.840
You could maybe try those.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.520
That's not an official answer.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.630
That's just me.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.280
RICH HYNDMAN: So try making
a bigger emulator.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.310
Seriously.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:49.460
And yeah.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.700
Have a look back through the
people who managed to

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.820
enable it in 4.1.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:54.940
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, yeah.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.315
That's a good point.

00:32:55.315 --> 00:32:56.390
They don't specify
whether they've

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:57.570
tried creating a tablet.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:57.890
Yeah.

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:01.940
So when you created a 4.2
emulator, did you create a

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.310
large screen or larger device?

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:05.610
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:09.290
I think that's a really
good suggestion.

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:10.730
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE] anything
really so you can

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:12.130
mimic devices?

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:12.660
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.950
The new [? NT21 ?]

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:18.270
has a new device dialogue.

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:20.126
And on the second tab, you can
just choose the device that

00:33:20.126 --> 00:33:23.300
you want and choose Nexus
10 or Nexus 7 on there.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:27.260
It would be interesting to
see if it had multi-user.

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.510
I love multi-user.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:33.600
SPARKY RHODE: Unfortunately,
I've gotten lazy.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.370
I have actually not yet
created a 4.2 AVD.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:40.160
I've been using only devices.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:40.490
RICH HYNDMAN: Right.

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:41.080
That's not lazy.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.100
That's what you're supposed
to do if you've got them.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.700
NICK BUTCHER: Zeroth
world problems.

00:33:47.295 --> 00:33:47.960
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.080
multi-user.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.020
It'd be interesting to see.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.760
NICK BUTCHER: Nico in France
is using one of my favorite

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.050
features in Jellybean.

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:54.545
RICH HYNDMAN: What's that?

00:33:54.545 --> 00:33:56.675
NICK BUTCHER: The activity
options class, where it lets

00:33:56.675 --> 00:33:59.180
you create these nice scaled
animations when you launching

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.230
a new activity.

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.730
If you have a recents, for
example, where it scales up

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:05.912
from a thumbnail to the full
screen, which I think is a

00:34:05.912 --> 00:34:10.699
really, really cool way of
retaining context to the user.

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:12.135
And says, yeah.

00:34:12.135 --> 00:34:12.540
They love it.

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.679
But how do they do
the reverse.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:16.150
So you can do this.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:20.429
You can set a custom
animation.

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:25.909
So you won't be able to scale it
to view or to a bitmap like

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:27.190
you can with the activity
options.

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:29.532
But you can just set a custom
animation to then scale it to

00:34:29.532 --> 00:34:30.219
a certain place.

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:35.159
So it's standard activity dot
set pending transition?

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:35.670
RICH HYNDMAN: Override
pending transition?

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:38.040
NICK BUTCHER: Override
pending transition?

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.000
Something like this, I think.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.780
So I think you can do that.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:41.080
So yeah.

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.100
You can't do a scale down
to a thumbnail or

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:43.440
anything like that.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.407
But you can get close
to that kind of

00:34:45.407 --> 00:34:50.090
behavior using these standards.

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:52.500
Rich is Googling
[? ecstatically. ?]

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.154
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:53.154 --> 00:34:54.889
overflow answers come up
before our official

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:56.489
documentation.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:58.130
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:59.380
SPARKY RHODE: As long
as they point to our

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.010
documentation, it's fine.

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:03.860
RICH HYNDMAN: Chet and Romain's
talk at this year's

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.400
Devoxx covered this
exact point.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.665
I don't think those talks are
going live until December.

00:35:11.252 --> 00:35:12.420
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.250
RICH HYNDMAN: And yeah.

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:14.710
It was a three hour
talk they gave.

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:17.050
And there was approximately
400 awesome tips.

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:18.490
So we didn't manage to
remember them all.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.910
But I'll be watching that
and sharing that

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:22.030
talk as much as possible.

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:23.530
NICK BUTCHER: I want to rewatch
that awesome talk.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:24.680
There were so many
tips in there.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:28.946
I think I might create a G+
thread and just document all

00:35:28.946 --> 00:35:31.210
of those tips.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:32.940
RICH HYNDMAN: Yossi has added
the Hangout toolbox.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.970
What the hell's going
to happen now?

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:37.220
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:42.820
MATT GAUNT: I tihnk Yossi should
just be joining the

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:43.730
Google+ Hangout.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:47.360
And then he just can pull
out a new Yossi

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.646
plugin of the week.

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:51.830
[INAUDIBLE], wasn't it?

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:53.610
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Basically it's
every day plugin of the week

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:54.200
[INAUDIBLE].

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.370
OK.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.110
RICH HYNDMAN: Plugin
of the week.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:58.360
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:00.328 --> 00:36:01.980
NICK BUTCHER: Any [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.062
participants?

00:36:04.062 --> 00:36:05.595
Who have we got down there?

00:36:05.595 --> 00:36:06.440
RICH HYNDMAN: There's
unknown user.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.420
I think that might be--

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:08.295
NICK BUTCHER: Hello,
unknown user.

00:36:08.295 --> 00:36:09.060
RICH HYNDMAN: It's unknown
user somehow.

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.490
[INAUDIBLE].

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:11.020
Yossi--

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:12.560
NICK BUTCHER: Do you
have a question?

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:12.710
Nope.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.060
RICH HYNDMAN: Nope.

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:17.270
OK You've got something that
you'd like to answer?

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:19.450
Are you particularly excited
about any of the questions?

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:20.270
NICK BUTCHER: Does anyone
understand this

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.480
question from Zboarda?

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:27.700
Zboarda asks, "How can you
make a dialog appear as

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.340
swiping in a fragment?

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:33.482
I want to show a dialog over
a fragment to mark a multi

00:36:33.482 --> 00:36:34.760
valued question.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.920
The fragment is in
a view pager.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.230
How can this be achieved?"

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:42.830
MATT GAUNT: Is it just that you
move the fragment across,

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:45.630
dialog comes up?

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:47.995
RICH HYNDMAN: Well, we can do
that, listing for the view

00:36:47.995 --> 00:36:51.743
pager transitions page change?

00:36:51.743 --> 00:36:52.650
YOSSI ELKRIEF: I think
he doesn't want

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:53.410
the frame to move.

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:55.300
He wants [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:56.610
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:58.951
RICH HYNDMAN: What
are you doing?

00:36:58.951 --> 00:37:00.595
MATT GAUNT: But you do get
pulled back when the view

00:37:00.595 --> 00:37:00.900
pager's swiped.

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.082
At that point you'd want
to bring up dialog.

00:37:03.082 --> 00:37:03.540
But yes.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.540
I agree with Nick.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.680
Doing that, then throwing up
a dialog, just from a user

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.270
perspective just sounds nasty.

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:11.670
RICH HYNDMAN: If you really
needed to do something which

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.740
blocks the interaction
[? tool ?], something had been

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:17.520
filled in, I would probably
have an extra view in your

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.740
layout which would show
inside the view pager.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.710
And then have that enabled.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:23.261
And then they're finished
interacting with

00:37:23.261 --> 00:37:23.670
it, get rid of it.

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:25.920
But not actually have a dialog
on top, just have it as a view

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.300
inside your layout.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.220
So as you swipe across,
it's already there.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.360
And then they can dismiss it.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.178
NICK BUTCHER: I'm not sure
I completely get it.

00:37:33.178 --> 00:37:34.522
A multi valued question.

00:37:34.522 --> 00:37:35.866
A multi valued question.

00:37:35.866 --> 00:37:38.410
Is that like multi select?

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:39.630
SPARKY RHODE: I'm wondering
if maybe he means

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.440
he just wants to--

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.380
you touch it, and it pops up.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.880
These are what you can populate
the field with.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.730
And then it closes down again.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:48.650
RICH HYNDMAN: Maybe.

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:50.450
[INAUDIBLE].

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:51.150
I don't know.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:52.760
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, that's
what I thought, that the

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.060
fragment doesn't really
move in the pager.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.710
Basically, when you touch it,
then you get a dialog with all

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:03.170
the possible options
to choose from.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:05.700
SPARKY RHODE: It kind of sounds
to me like even your

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.670
traditional dialog activity,
the transparent background,

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:09.920
would be just fine.

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:13.310
NICK BUTCHER: So yeah.

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:16.700
I'm not a massive of dialogs.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:17.513
I don't know.

00:38:17.513 --> 00:38:18.380
I'm not a huge fan.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.580
It sounds like what you're
trying to do is like a

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.120
multi-step, wizard-y
type behavior.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.650
In which case, you might want to
take a look at some awesome

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:28.270
code which Roman Nurik
shockingly open sourced.

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:29.265
So if you go to code.google.com/

00:38:29.265 --> 00:38:30.515
p/romannurik-code.

00:38:35.256 --> 00:38:35.945
romannurik-code.

00:38:35.945 --> 00:38:36.960
RICH HYNDMAN: Where are
you reading that from?

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:37.270
NICK BUTCHER: My head.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:39.910
It's up there.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:41.460
There is a sample.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.850
Or you can look at his G+ feed
from a month or so back.

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:45.830
Or you can go--

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:47.080
RICH HYNDMAN: Probably
search for Roman--

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.560
it'll come up.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.075
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE],
didn't he?

00:38:53.075 --> 00:38:54.530
G+ page.

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:56.630
NICK BUTCHER: Just fumble around
on your computers and

00:38:56.630 --> 00:39:00.146
look at his use of
wizard flow.

00:39:00.146 --> 00:39:00.820
RICH HYNDMAN: Next
[? seven ?].

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:01.650
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:02.586
wizard hat.

00:39:02.586 --> 00:39:05.394
[INAUDIBLE].

00:39:05.394 --> 00:39:07.570
RICH HYNDMAN: I'm sure Yossi
could do a Hangout

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:08.460
[INAUDIBLE].

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.960
OK.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.980
Next one.

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:12.370
NICK BUTCHER: Should we
issue the next one?

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:12.780
RICH HYNDMAN: Well, Yeah.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.570
Unless there's anything
coming in on--

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:15.240
MATT GAUNT: I'll double check.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.500
RICH HYNDMAN: Is anyone checking
the YouTube comments?

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.665
Because they're always
hilarious.

00:39:17.665 --> 00:39:19.942
MATT GAUNT: I can do
that right now.

00:39:19.942 --> 00:39:22.056
RICH HYNDMAN: And so valuable.

00:39:22.056 --> 00:39:23.990
MATT GAUNT: We've got
no questions in G+.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.470
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.900
We're good.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.150
Moderator.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.930
NICK BUTCHER: Moderator up.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:29.940
OK.

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.927
"I have a fragment from the
support library containing a

00:39:31.927 --> 00:39:34.870
view with a flip animation
on the y-axis.

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:37.730
It's kind of flipping
a book page.

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:39.170
Page sticks to the finger.

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:42.030
However at 85 degrees,
the view disappears.

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:43.400
Clipped, question mark.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.330
How can I change this?

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:46.660
Or should I use OpenGL?"

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.190
RICH HYNDMAN: Wow.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:49.460
SPARKY RHODE: I'm
just wondering.

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:54.423
Is this just a simple matter
of geometry, that when you

00:39:54.423 --> 00:39:58.720
look at a text for edge on,
there's nothing to see?

00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.140
RICH HYNDMAN: I think so.

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.580
Right?

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.450
NICK BUTCHER: 85 degrees,
it's almost--

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:04.500
RICH HYNDMAN: At 90 degrees,
it just disappears?

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.710
You want it to add
some thickness?

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:08.130
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:09.080
I wanted to--

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:13.290
that's why I asked him,
is it just going away?

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:16.070
Or is it a transient condition
that comes back as you scroll

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:20.195
past 95 degrees or something?

00:40:20.195 --> 00:40:20.580
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:25.420
I mean, we have 3D rotations.

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.470
NICK BUTCHER: I'm also
wondering, is this an issue

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:30.650
with our OpenGL, with
hardware UI?

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:36.700
What I'm wanting to check is
actually just [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.730
accelerated equals false.

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:42.780
And try just to rule out the
possibility that there's some

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.572
complication due to
a hardware UI.

00:40:45.572 --> 00:40:46.822
Worth checking.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:52.290
SPARKY RHODE: And then if you
want to get fancy about it--

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:54.750
if you think it might be just
a visual artifact because

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:58.380
you're viewing the page edge on,
then animate a bent page.

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.182
Actually make it [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:00.182 --> 00:41:01.432
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.160
MATT GAUNT: Let's
put you on mute.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.350
RICH HYNDMAN: Ravi, sorry,
you're going on mute.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:12.253
NICK BUTCHER: We miss you, Al.

00:41:12.253 --> 00:41:14.060
RICH HYNDMAN: We miss you, Al.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.802
Have you got a question
for us though, Ravi,

00:41:16.802 --> 00:41:17.630
now that you're muted?

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:18.840
Yes.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:19.390
SPARKY RHODE: All right.

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:22.580
NICK BUTCHER: Just to finish up
on that on as well, I think

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.312
it sounds--

00:41:23.312 --> 00:41:25.940
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.000
SPARKY RHODE: I was just going
to say, dodge the issue by

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.030
actually giving the page some
depth, warp it, bend it or

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:35.010
something so that it actually
occupies all three dimensions.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:36.920
NICK BUTCHER: I'm trying to
work out, is it just a

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.960
transition animation?

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.830
Or is it following your finger,
in which case you're

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:40.900
using ViewPager, perhaps?

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.100
Because if so, then the latest
release of support library

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:46.880
introduced the new class page
transformer, which lets you

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.360
apply an effect as
you page in.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.555
So that might actually be
able to create this

00:41:52.555 --> 00:41:53.260
same kind of thing.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:54.550
MATT GAUNT: That'd be cool.

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:55.920
NICK BUTCHER: I'm not if that's
what you're doing.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.546
But if it is, then take a look
at page transformer.

00:41:58.546 --> 00:41:59.930
RICH HYNDMAN: Something
weird just happened.

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:01.310
It's the first time I've
ever seen Cedric

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.450
without his hat on.

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:05.620
And we're all wearing hats.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:06.410
The irony.

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:08.644
Cedric from Genymobile--

00:42:08.644 --> 00:42:09.130
CEDRIC RAVALEC: Hi.

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:10.690
RICH HYNDMAN: --has come
along to say hello.

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:11.590
[INAUDIBLE]

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:12.875
CEDRIC RAVALEC: I
am on the net?

00:42:12.875 --> 00:42:14.625
RICH HYNDMAN: Live, yeah,
to the world.

00:42:14.625 --> 00:42:15.110
CEDRIC RAVALEC: OK.

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:17.540
Nice to meet you.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.935
I like this one, this color.

00:42:18.935 --> 00:42:20.200
How can I have one like this?

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.050
RICH HYNDMAN: They're
selling it in the

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:22.024
partner store over there.

00:42:22.024 --> 00:42:24.460
CEDRIC RAVALEC: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.075
RICH HYNDMAN: You're
always wearing it.

00:42:26.075 --> 00:42:27.350
MATT GAUNT: He's got the cap.

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:28.820
RICH HYNDMAN: He's
got the cap.

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.083
CEDRIC RAVALEC: I forgot
it this morning.

00:42:30.083 --> 00:42:31.333
RICH HYNDMAN: I'm embarrassed.

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:35.620
SPARKY RHODE: Should we let
Ravi ask his question?

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:37.540
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, Ravi, what's
your question, dude?

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.436
Just unmute first.

00:42:39.436 --> 00:42:43.236
Or it's going to be very hard
for the internet to hear you.

00:42:43.236 --> 00:42:44.530
MATT GAUNT: We need
to to unmute him?

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:44.880
RICH HYNDMAN: No.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.850
He can unmute himself.

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:46.950
Here we go.

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:48.200
Yeah?

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.780
RAVI: Hi, Sparky.

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.020
How are you?

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:52.940
SPARKY RHODE: Hey, Ravi.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:53.900
What's up?

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:54.450
RAVI: Yeah, good.

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:55.700
I like your beard, man.

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:00.200
Right.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.040
I just have some quick questions
about Android

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:07.215
development for application
management with using

00:43:07.215 --> 00:43:07.920
[? style of ?]

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.070
session managements and stuff.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:14.900
So is there any factory way to
do session management in

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:20.130
Android just like we do in
Microsoft technologies using

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:22.820
special CS management
servers and stuff?

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.140
So is there any kind
of in built thing

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:25.950
which we can manage?

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:30.852
Or do we need to dispatch some
[INAUDIBLE] using a kind of

00:43:30.852 --> 00:43:34.246
shared preferences or internal
storage and stuff like that?

00:43:34.246 --> 00:43:38.584
SPARKY RHODE: Are you talking
about a session with a stable

00:43:38.584 --> 00:43:40.512
application?

00:43:40.512 --> 00:43:41.480
RAVI: No.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.700
I mean, if we have a log in--

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.120
I mean, we don't have an
external server which manages

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.230
the sessions.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:51.000
But the server only authorizes
the username and the password.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.630
The only thing we need is to
make sure the user is in the

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:55.850
right session.

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:58.400
Or just to make sure if users
do not make any activity, we

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.080
can pass to others.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.630
So if an existing session
goes out, the user is

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:05.762
forced to log in again.

00:44:05.762 --> 00:44:06.714
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah,
you can just

00:44:06.714 --> 00:44:10.760
[INAUDIBLE], and if they--

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.874
you can do any number
of things.

00:44:15.874 --> 00:44:17.960
It's slightly [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:20.546
There's a lot of feedback
coming back through.

00:44:20.546 --> 00:44:21.796
Is there any chance you've
got any headphones?

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.330
SPARKY RHODE: You're not viewing
the Hangout in two

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:29.310
windows, are you?

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:30.080
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.330
Or close the YouTube one.

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:34.850
So no.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:37.350
I don't think there is anything
automatic like you're

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:40.640
asking for which does session
management [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.050
application.

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:43.364
But [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:49.490
what happens [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:50.740
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:58.448 --> 00:45:01.080
activity.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:01.550
RAVI: Yeah.

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:03.890
I mean, currently, what we're
doing is we're sorting

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:06.035
everything in a secure
light server.

00:45:06.035 --> 00:45:07.900
I mean, a scale like
databases.

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:12.640
And whenever there is not much
activity for a predefined

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.510
period of time, and we are
forcing the user to make the

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:18.340
login activity once again.

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:24.520
But I thought if there is any
kind of standard way to manage

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:26.865
everything automatically which
is embedded into the Android

00:45:26.865 --> 00:45:28.190
operating system.

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:32.582
RICH HYNDMAN: Well, I think
it's pretty [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:32.582 --> 00:45:36.490
without interrupting your
[INAUDIBLE] timeline.

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:37.940
MATT GAUNT: I mean,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:41.536
one use case is when you've
got [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:11.288 --> 00:46:13.573
RICH HYNDMAN: That's
a good case, man.

00:46:13.573 --> 00:46:14.823
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:34.580
RICH HYNDMAN: Thanks, Ravi.

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.044
RAVI: No problem.

00:46:36.044 --> 00:46:37.294
RICH HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:43.540
OK.

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:46.450
Next question.

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:47.920
MATT GAUNT: I'm starting
to get hot as well.

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:52.430
SPARKY RHODE: I don't know if my
moderator is showing these

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:53.810
questions in the same
order as yours.

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:55.615
Because I think we
skipped a couple.

00:46:55.615 --> 00:46:57.240
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, really?

00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.770
SPARKY RHODE: But maybe
they're further

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:00.610
down the line in yours.

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:01.356
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:01.356 --> 00:47:03.970
any that we haven't
got to yet.

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:05.240
SPARKY RHODE: Did you get
Cedric from Switzerland?

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:07.860
"Which of the following
Bluetooth Low Energy actions

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.850
can we performing in API17?

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:10.520
RICH HYNDMAN: None.

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:11.805
SPARKY RHODE: My answer
was none.

00:47:11.805 --> 00:47:12.280
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.400
I think so.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:13.700
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.500
supports low energy profile.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.810
Nexus 4.

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:19.588
But I don't think you can
actually interact with the API

00:47:19.588 --> 00:47:21.362
from your application in
any way whatsoever.

00:47:21.362 --> 00:47:22.507
NICK BUTCHER: There's no
software implementation.

00:47:22.507 --> 00:47:22.954
RICH HYNDMAN: No.

00:47:22.954 --> 00:47:24.204
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:28.680
Sorry.

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:34.560
SPARKY RHODE: Gabriel Ittner
from Berlin wants to know, "Is

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:39.200
it allowed to send the user to
a website to pay for the app

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:43.470
using Wallet or Paypal or some
other payment method after

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:45.710
maybe using the app for a period
of time for free?"

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:46.830
RICH HYNDMAN: No.

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:47.880
SPARKY RHODE: And I said no.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:48.350
No.

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:51.130
Google Wallet is the only
allowed payment processor for

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:57.400
apps in Google Play with the
exception of this media

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:01.730
exemption for content which is
purchasable and consumable in

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:04.444
many different places.

00:48:04.444 --> 00:48:05.380
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:09.220
And I know that the next thing
you're going to say is Google

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:12.262
payment services inside an
app [INAUDIBLE] or paid

00:48:12.262 --> 00:48:13.550
applications don't support
the country that I want.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:14.800
So am I still not [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.510
If you wanted to be listed in
Google Play, you have to use

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:21.250
Google Play billing services.

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:22.916
There's no other
option, really.

00:48:22.916 --> 00:48:27.380
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Can I also add
Google in app payment and also

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:30.470
have Paypal payment
as an option?

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:32.090
Or if the Paypal.

00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:34.630
Options is on--

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:37.522
RICH HYNDMAN: It must just be
a Google payment service if

00:48:37.522 --> 00:48:38.890
it's just in the Play store.

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:40.033
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Oh,
a single one?

00:48:40.033 --> 00:48:40.386
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:48:40.386 --> 00:48:42.660
Just a single one.

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:44.310
SPARKY RHODE: Of course, the
beauty of the Android

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:45.010
marketplace--

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:46.680
or the Android ecosystem--

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.240
is there is more than
one app store.

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.430
We don't lock you into just one
channel for buying apps.

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:55.730
And if people prefer to have
other payment options besides

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:58.350
just Google Wallet, then there
are lots of other app stores

00:48:58.350 --> 00:48:59.600
they can list in.

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:02.725
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:49:02.725 --> 00:49:05.210
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, the Google
Android DDA, the Developer

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:08.060
Distribution Agreement,
and also the--

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:08.810
RICH HYNDMAN: Content policy.

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:11.190
NICK BUTCHER: --content policy
that supports this.

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:13.050
It's all spelled out for you.

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:18.390
It says, you must use an
approved payments authorizor.

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:20.250
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:22.115
It's very clear now that it's
only Google Wallet.

00:49:22.115 --> 00:49:24.390
NICK BUTCHER: And that
is Google Wallet.

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:26.150
RAVI: Knock, knock.

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:28.840
[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:32.610
RICH HYNDMAN: And as if
by magic, it is muted.

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:34.010
I was hoping that someone from
the Dutch Android Usergroup

00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:36.650
would walk past so we can grab
them, and they could plug that

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:38.120
awesome Usergroup.

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:40.220
They were founded exactly
one year ago.

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:41.070
NICK BUTCHER: Happy birthday.

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:43.010
RICH HYNDMAN: One conference
ago, I should say, really.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:43.190
But yeah.

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:44.200
Happy birthday to the Dutch
Android Usergroup.

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.770
And if Johann comes back
around, I will

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:47.780
certainly grab him.

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:48.970
MATT GAUNT: They're going
to be watching

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:49.786
the show right now.

00:49:49.786 --> 00:49:52.060
So they should be all just
running right now.

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:52.750
And if they're not, then--

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:53.010
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, of course.

00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:54.590
All the Dutch Android Usergroup
from wherever you're

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:57.640
watching the show from right
now, come and say hello to the

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.440
rest of the internet.

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.685
SPARKY RHODE: We have just been
joined in the Hangout by

00:50:01.685 --> 00:50:03.210
a new member.

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:04.060
Welcome, Paul.

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:05.230
Is there anything you'd
like to talk

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:07.900
about, Android related?

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:08.300
PAUL HANSON: Hi.

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.210
Thank you.

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:11.910
I just had one question
in terms of Android.

00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:17.460
It's kind of, why the
war on SD cards?

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:20.900
RICH HYNDMAN: Why the
war on SD cards?

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.530
MATT GAUNT: There's
a war on SD cards?

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:24.316
NICK BUTCHER: Attack.

00:50:24.316 --> 00:50:26.310
RICH HYNDMAN: It's only
Nexus devices, right?

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:27.550
We just want a good
user experience.

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:32.540
And SD cards have too many
failed user interactions, user

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:35.020
experiences, everything
about them.

00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.730
There's no good model
for having an SD

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:38.470
card inside a device.

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:40.990
If you're going to start
installing apps to it, you pop

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:42.790
it out, and they no
longer exist.

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:45.290
If we start installing apps to
it, we pop it out, and they

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:46.000
don't exist.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.980
You mount it on another
computer, they generally are

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:50.620
FAT formatted and can't be
accessed from both devices at

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:52.270
the same time.

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:53.510
There's just so many reasons.

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:54.720
NICK BUTCHER: It's not
user experience.

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.780
You end up having to get the
user to manage storage, which

00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:59.620
is a pretty crappy
user experience.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:00.645
RICH HYNDMAN: And then at at
some point, you want to

00:51:00.645 --> 00:51:02.290
upgrade from a 16
gig to a 32 gig.

00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:05.690
And you have to somehow get your
techie friend to manually

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:07.386
copy over everything from one
to the other, including all

00:51:07.386 --> 00:51:09.600
the hidden files so things
don't break.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.644
PAUL HANSON: Don't you have to
do exactly that when you buy a

00:51:11.644 --> 00:51:12.256
new phone now?

00:51:12.256 --> 00:51:13.172
RICH HYNDMAN: Sorry?

00:51:13.172 --> 00:51:14.700
PAUL HANSON: You don't have to
do exactly that now when you

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:15.425
buy a new phone?

00:51:15.425 --> 00:51:18.510
If all of my stuff is on the
internal storage of a phone--

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.470
and I get a new phone because
it's got old or whatever.

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:23.720
I get the next Nexus
or whatever it is.

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:26.000
I have to do exactly that
process that you just describe

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.330
there to copy all this stuff
to keep my data from my

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:31.040
existing phone over
to my new phone.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:31.770
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No, you do not.

00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:37.390
Because you can do a backup
through the Gmail account.

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:42.960
And also you can use the auto
download to all the apps.

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.052
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:44.052 --> 00:51:45.560
RICH HYNDMAN: Even if the
copying [INAUDIBLE]--

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.540
PAUL: [INAUDIBLE]
background data.

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:48.730
RICH HYNDMAN: --a million other
cases that an SD card

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:51.240
isn't a good user experience
for the majority of users.

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.825
They are sought after by techies
and people who like to

00:51:53.825 --> 00:51:55.280
carry a lot of content around.

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.155
But it's not a great
user experience.

00:51:57.155 --> 00:51:58.130
NICK BUTCHER: You had
the choice, right?

00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:59.526
RICH HYNDMAN: You
had the choice.

00:51:59.526 --> 00:52:00.776
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:02.861 --> 00:52:05.324
PAUL HANSON: I heard a rumor
that future versions of

00:52:05.324 --> 00:52:10.390
Android are not going to allow
read/write access to SD cards.

00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:11.110
NICK BUTCHER: Wait, what?

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:12.994
You know about future
versions of Android?

00:52:12.994 --> 00:52:15.940
PAUL HANSON: Well, I heard a
rumor from someone of a friend

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:19.190
of friend, the kind of thing.

00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:20.670
A future version of Android
is going to

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:23.000
disable read/write access.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.410
RICH HYNDMAN: If that did
happen, it would be like the

00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:26.920
manufacturer wouldn't be
able to work around it.

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.820
I mean, ASUS have managed to do
quite a good job, I think,

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:33.570
of including multiple SD card
support on their devices.

00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:35.550
You have the micro SD,
USB slots, all

00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:36.200
these different things.

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:37.760
And it works very well.

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.130
I mean, it is an platform.

00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:40.470
But they can do [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.630
NICK BUTCHER: Wait.

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:43.255
Are you actually talking about
the new commission for reading

00:52:43.255 --> 00:52:44.190
the SD card?

00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.910
Is that what you're
talking about?

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:45.340
PAUL HANSON: Possibly.

00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:46.200
Yes.

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:46.410
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:47.040
That's different.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:47.560
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:48.330
So we did that.

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:51.990
So we've introduced a new
commission as of API16 to

00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:54.310
where it's optional, the
permission to read.

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:57.415
Because at the moment--
well, prior to 16, the

00:52:57.415 --> 00:52:58.440
SD cards were readable.

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.330
And anyone can read
anything on that.

00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:04.766
And there were security issues
that ensued because of this

00:53:04.766 --> 00:53:06.190
and mistreating it.

00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:06.380
So yeah.

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:07.400
We introduced a new
permission.

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.170
But so that we didn't break
all the apps and to give

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:11.410
people some time to upgrade,
it's optional at the moment.

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:16.120
So if you have the developer
options, you can go in and

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.560
turn it on and enforce
those permissions.

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:21.720
So that only applications with
the read SD card [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:24.725
write SD card permission can
actually read from it.

00:53:24.725 --> 00:53:25.680
But yeah.

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.110
In some future release, we've
said that we're going to make

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:30.820
the default to enforce this.

00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:31.670
PAUL HANSON: Fair enough.

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.970
NICK BUTCHER: So yeah.

00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:34.800
It's just that we're giving app
developers some time to

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.765
update their apps to ask for
this new permission.

00:53:36.765 --> 00:53:37.850
RICH HYNDMAN: But we're
not taking anything

00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:39.190
away in this case.

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.770
Oh, Cedric's back.

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:40.800
And he's been and
bought a hat.

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.990
Cedric's back with hat again.

00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.810
SPARKY RHODE: All right.

00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:44.016
CEDRIC RAVALEC: Hi, guys.

00:53:44.016 --> 00:53:45.130
It's wonderful.

00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:45.690
[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:46.560
MALE SPEAKER: Is
everything OK?

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:46.850
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:53:46.850 --> 00:53:46.940
We're doing great.

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:47.600
Thanks.

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:48.300
NICK BUTCHER: Do you
want us to give a

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:50.960
quick plug for AndroVM?

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.410
CEDRIC RAVALEC: Yes.

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:52.020
With pleasure.

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:52.997
With pleasure.

00:53:52.997 --> 00:53:53.751
OK.

00:53:53.751 --> 00:53:55.380
Hello to everyone.

00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.920
So I'm Cedric Ravalec
from Genymobile.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:00.000
And I'm at DroidCon.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.900
And we are doing a conference
tomorrow on software who's

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.780
called AndroVM.

00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:09.870
It's an Android virtual
machine on your PC.

00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:14.305
So you can emulate your Android
smartphone and tablet

00:54:14.305 --> 00:54:16.970
and make all your tests you
want and emulate all the

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.950
sensors of the mobile.

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:21.870
And it's a quite famous
open source project.

00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:26.190
We have more than 200,000
downloads.

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:28.802
So you can go and help
us to develop it and

00:54:28.802 --> 00:54:29.980
to test it for us.

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:31.950
androvm.com.

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:33.180
This is what I can say.

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:33.590
RICH HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:35.847
Everything that helps with
Android testing has always got

00:54:35.847 --> 00:54:36.380
to be good.

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:36.960
Especially--

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.300
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:42.710
RICH HYNDMAN: We have now also
been joined by someone who's

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:43.590
now one year old.

00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:45.070
It's the Dutch Android
Usergroup.

00:54:45.070 --> 00:54:46.105
JOHANN: Hi, guys.

00:54:46.105 --> 00:54:46.843
NICK BUTCHER: Happy birthday.

00:54:46.843 --> 00:54:47.689
RICH HYNDMAN: Happy
birthday to the

00:54:47.689 --> 00:54:48.960
Dutch Android Usergroup.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.150
Are you not feeling left
out without a hat?

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:51.870
NICK BUTCHER: Fine.

00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:53.120
There we go.

00:54:54.805 --> 00:54:57.462
JOHANN: Good to see you from
this side of the camera.

00:54:57.462 --> 00:54:58.938
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:58.938 --> 00:55:00.906
MATT GAUNT: We need to have
a screen shot of this.

00:55:00.906 --> 00:55:03.110
RICH HYNDMAN: How many members
of the Dutch Android Usergroup

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:03.560
now, Johann?

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:06.400
JOHANN: Well, have 330
something members.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.020
But I don't think they're
all Dutch.

00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:10.778
RICH HYNDMAN: You should have
done a big push to make it 365

00:55:10.778 --> 00:55:12.020
by the one year anniversary.

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:12.932
JOHANN: Yeah.

00:55:12.932 --> 00:55:13.784
RICH HYNDMAN: If you had done
that the last week,

00:55:13.784 --> 00:55:15.580
[INAUDIBLE].

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:16.741
20-20 hindsight.

00:55:16.741 --> 00:55:18.920
JOHANN: We have a pretty
hardcore group of about 50

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:19.780
during our meetups.

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:22.950
And it's a good amount.

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:26.980
And maybe 20 or 30 who are
always at every meetup.

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:28.310
NICK BUTCHER: And where
do you meet?

00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:28.850
JOHANN: Everywhere.

00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:29.530
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:30.460
Dutch Android Usergroup.

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:33.400
So there's a lot of activity
in Amsterdam itself.

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.470
Of course, we have Amsterdam.

00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:39.990
But there are a lot of one man
shows, Android shows, around

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.810
the Netherlands.

00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:42.976
So there's a lot of activity
in the east and

00:55:42.976 --> 00:55:43.660
the south as well.

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:46.065
So I would tend to--

00:55:46.065 --> 00:55:49.442
well, not serve them all-- but
I think in December we're

00:55:49.442 --> 00:55:51.236
going to have something
about NFC.

00:55:51.236 --> 00:55:52.430
We have it in Eindhoven.

00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:56.370
It's a bit on the southeast
of the Netherlands.

00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:58.760
So it's a good thing.

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.330
NICK BUTCHER: And where do
people go to find out more?

00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:07.260
JOHANN: You can go to
www.dutchaug.org.

00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:08.850
RICH HYNDMAN: Dutchaug.org

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:10.710
NICK BUTCHER: So any dutch
developers out there--

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:13.000
CEDRIC RAVALEC: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:13.900
RICH HYNDMAN: I was
going to say.

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:16.270
And Cedric of course from the
Paris Android Usergroup.

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:17.560
So we're going to plug
PAUG as well.

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:17.910
P-A--

00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:19.542
Is it paug.org, paug.com?

00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:21.330
CEDRIC RAVALEC: Yeah, paug.fr.

00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:22.140
RICH HYNDMAN: Fr.

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:24.935
P-A-U-G dot F-R for the French
Android Usergroup, like 2000

00:56:24.935 --> 00:56:25.680
members now.

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:26.100
CEDRIC RAVALEC: Yeah.

00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:26.342
Yeah.

00:56:26.342 --> 00:56:26.585
Yeah.

00:56:26.585 --> 00:56:31.120
And we're working very hard have
also DroidCon in Paris

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.180
for next year.

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:34.885
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:34.885 --> 00:56:36.025
MATT GAUNT: It's about time.

00:56:36.025 --> 00:56:37.510
RICH HYNDMAN: About
time, yeah.

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:39.015
I think I'm a member
of all three.

00:56:39.015 --> 00:56:42.160
London Android Usergroup, Paris
Android Usergroup, and

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:42.490
Dutch Android Usergroup.

00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:44.205
NICK BUTCHER: [? We're being ?]
promiscuous.

00:56:44.205 --> 00:56:44.800
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.240
usergroups I'm a member.

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.020
What about you?

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.060
Have you joined them all?

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:48.490
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah?

00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:50.400
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.180
RICH HYNDMAN: Got to catch
them all, damn it.

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:52.830
NICK BUTCHER: So if you
enjoy these Hangouts--

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:54.080
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.130
NICK BUTCHER: If you enjoy these
Hangouts talking about

00:56:57.130 --> 00:57:00.630
Android development, want to do
them IRL with some Android

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:01.208
developers.

00:57:01.208 --> 00:57:02.458
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:05.061 --> 00:57:05.560
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:05.825
Yeah.

00:57:05.825 --> 00:57:06.370
Thanks very much.

00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:07.395
JOHANN: Thank you.

00:57:07.395 --> 00:57:08.910
NICK BUTCHER: So I think we're
kind of out of time, right?

00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:10.940
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE], we've
got three minutes left.

00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:12.190
And--

00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:13.440
RAVI: So I can do some--

00:57:15.995 --> 00:57:17.245
MATT GAUNT: Ravi [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:20.418 --> 00:57:23.771
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]
jump in.

00:57:23.771 --> 00:57:25.455
[INAUDIBLE], Yossi?

00:57:25.455 --> 00:57:25.880
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:26.530
You hear me?

00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:27.970
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:29.740
YOSSI ELKRIEF: OK.

00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:35.010
About the GCM, one
quick question.

00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:41.090
Basically, the Android model is
that apps are to be put on

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:41.585
the background.

00:57:41.585 --> 00:57:44.980
You press the home button, and
the app continues to work

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:49.740
until the system closes down
and the processes is

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:52.045
successfully terminated
by the system.

00:57:52.045 --> 00:57:58.155
But if the user presses Force
Stop, then the GCM messaging

00:57:58.155 --> 00:58:01.080
won't work on the device.

00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.880
That's what I saw.

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:11.190
Is that the designed framework
for the GCM to work?

00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:12.100
RICH HYNDMAN: Not at all.

00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:13.230
No.

00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:14.900
The app shouldn't be running
at all anyway

00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:17.380
from boot the system.

00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:18.460
It should just be going
straight through to

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:19.120
broadcaster receiver, right?

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.930
And again, picked up and
starting whichever parts of

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:23.855
your application are needed
to process the message.

00:58:23.855 --> 00:58:24.280
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.730
But I'm not getting anything.

00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:31.166
Basically, when I press the
Force Stop on the settings--

00:58:31.166 --> 00:58:33.220
RICH HYNDMAN: Are you sure
you're not unregistering from

00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:34.340
the service?

00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:35.320
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, I'm sure.

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:39.820
Because unregistering from the
service is only when the

00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.620
application--

00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:47.020
we have an exit button on our
app that keeps the device

00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:50.620
registered to the GCM.

00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:53.500
RICH HYNDMAN: Well, that's
a bad thing anyway.

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:56.080
You have an exit button on your
app that then closes the

00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.260
GCM connection, did you say?

00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:57.500
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No.

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.580
It doesn't close the GCM.

00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:03.040
It keeps the devices registered
and closes all the

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.370
other stuff.

00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:07.950
So the user basically doesn't
see us on foreground or

00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:08.900
background.

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:12.170
We kill the service for the
communication and everything,

00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:14.280
terminate it.

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.880
And basically, then you
can get a GCM message.

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:25.770
But when I do the Force Stop on
our app, it basically stops

00:59:25.770 --> 00:59:29.690
delivering the GCM.

00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:31.750
MATT GAUNT: Sounds like
a weird edge case.

00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:33.290
RICH HYNDMAN: It is a slightly
strange edge case.

00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:35.050
People shouldn't be hitting
Force Stop on apps.

00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:35.660
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, I know.

00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:38.233
But basically, you have
users that do it.

00:59:38.233 --> 00:59:39.400
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, they're
going to do it if they don't

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.400
trust your application.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.910
So it seems more like
an app issue.

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:43.610
Then if you've got users hitting
Force Stop on your

00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:46.390
application, they're doing it
for the exact reason that they

00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:48.255
want to stop it popping
up all these messages.

00:59:48.255 --> 00:59:50.720
And it's their only
way, probably.

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.570
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Basically,
I'm more

00:59:52.570 --> 00:59:55.820
paranoid than most people.

00:59:55.820 --> 01:00:00.530
So basically, when I use the
phone, every time I don't have

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:05.340
any things on the recent, I go
to Settings and just press

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.700
Force Stop on all the
applications.

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:07.940
RICH HYNDMAN: [? I think ?]

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:10.680
Force Stop kills broadcasts as
well, broadcast reception.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.360
MATT GAUNT: Can it be kind of a
back up period, this kind of

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:13.820
Force Stop?

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:16.500
And then [? something's ?]
preventing it from being

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.810
restarted so quick.

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:19.760
RICH HYNDMAN: It could
also be that, yeah.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.010
It does sound like--

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.670
I generally don't Force
Stop applications.

01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:26.190
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, me too.

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:28.380
But just for testing,
I did it.

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:32.570
So that's when I found
that issue.

01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:36.350
When users complain that
doing the Force Stop--

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:37.670
NICK BUTCHER: It's like when
you [? start ?] an

01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:41.010
application, until you run it
for the very first time, it's

01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:43.040
in a different status,
isn't it?

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:43.390
SPARKY RHODE: Yes.

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.720
It's in the application
stop state.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.300
NICK BUTCHER: Exactly.

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.140
I was wondering whether--

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:48.390
[INAUDIBLE]

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:54.870
RICH HYNDMAN: And there's
things you can do

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:55.860
to get around it.

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:58.544
But I don't really want to
suggest them, to be honest.

01:00:58.544 --> 01:01:00.216
MATT GAUNT: I don't think it's
probably a good suggestion if

01:01:00.216 --> 01:01:03.890
you don't want to suggest it.

01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:04.880
NICK BUTCHER: I think
Rich is nailing it

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.020
on the head, really.

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:09.100
It sounds like there is some
behavior of Force Stop that

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:09.610
[INAUDIBLE] understand.

01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:11.820
And you should try to understand
why your users are

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:12.750
Force Stopping your app.

01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:13.910
It might be that--

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:16.320
RICH HYNDMAN: Honestly, if I was
pressing the exit button--

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.670
I don't know.

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:18.490
[INAUDIBLE]

01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:19.802
just come in.

01:01:19.802 --> 01:01:20.930
Yeah, I guess it would
[INAUDIBLE].

01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:21.800
SPARKY RHODE: I would.

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:22.480
RICH HYNDMAN: I guess--

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.980
I don't know-- if you changed
the word exit to sign out, it

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:27.100
would make a lot more sense.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.110
Or users would understand
what's it's doing.

01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:29.720
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.010
We have the sign out button.

01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:32.610
But we also have the
exit button to keep

01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:35.400
us working on the--

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.470
RICH HYNDMAN: Is that
little Amir?

01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:38.090
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:40.560
Just woke up.

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.446
RICH HYNDMAN: Actually, we
shouldn't have woken Amir up

01:01:43.446 --> 01:01:44.960
because it is time for
us to quit today.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.565
And we're not allowed to run
over today because there's a

01:01:46.565 --> 01:01:48.516
big Android barbecue
to get to.

01:01:48.516 --> 01:01:50.260
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Thank you guys.

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:50.570
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:51.130
Cheers.

01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:51.573
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Have fun.

01:01:51.573 --> 01:01:52.016
Have fun.

01:01:52.016 --> 01:01:52.730
RICH HYNDMAN: Cheers
to everybody else.

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:54.130
Thanks for joining us today.

01:01:54.130 --> 01:01:57.496
And we should be back in the
normal environment next week,

01:01:57.496 --> 01:02:00.570
the London office and
the Munich office.

01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:01.550
Until next week.

01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:03.766
Normal time next week as well,
Wednesday, 2:00 PM.

01:02:03.766 --> 01:02:04.698
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:04.698 --> 01:02:06.100
Keep Android deving.

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.300
RICH HYNDMAN: Keep
Android deving.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.600
Make awesome apps.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.260
MALE SPEAKER: So next week,
the first question will be

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.580
mine that you left--
