NICK MIHAILOVSKI: All right.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.370
How's it going everybody?

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.120
My name is Nick Mihailovski.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.850
I'm here with Andrew Wales
and Pete Frisella.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.610
We're on the Google Analytics
developer relations team.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.730
Today we're really excited to
talk to you about cross-device

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.890
optimization using
Google Analytics.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.140
We changed the title last
minute, so don't worry, you

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.590
guys are in the right
presentation.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.890
We have an awesome presentation
for you today.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.580
Today we're going to talk
about three big things.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.790
We're going to talk about how
you can measure beyond the web

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.670
and app with Google Analytics.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.790
We have an amazing presentation
about how you can

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.580
optimize experiences
across devices.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.830
And finally, we're going to tie
this all together with how

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.940
you can measure online and
offline experiences together,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.920
all using Google Analytics.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.290
So let's begin.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.160
Today we're in the middle of a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.470
once-in-a-lifetime technology explosion.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.530
Wow.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.040
Take a look at Saint
Peter's Square.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.670
Take a look at the
scene in 2005.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.480
There's one person
on a cellphone.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.250
I think it's a flip phone.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.140
Like, who uses a flip
phone today?

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.486
Now fast forward to 2013.

00:01:08.486 --> 00:01:11.160
There's a million devices, many
different devices that

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.730
people are using.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.780
What's amazing is that these
devices are different.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.660
We see tablets, we
see smartphones.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.700
In fact, at the end of the day,
people are using more

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.090
devices than ever before.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.020
And our data shows that, within
the United States, 90%

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.930
of users have three
or more devices.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.820
So I want to take a
quick poll here.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.870
Raise your hand if you
have, personally,

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.220
three or more devices.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.410
That's a huge amount
of people.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.340
Now keep your hand up.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.620
I want to see who has the
highest number of devices.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.860
Keep your hand up if
you have 4 devices.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.300
5 devices.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.779
6.

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:49.258
7.

00:01:49.258 --> 00:01:49.751
8.

00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:50.244
Wow.

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:51.723
9?

00:01:51.723 --> 00:01:53.202
10?

00:01:53.202 --> 00:01:55.667
11?

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:57.076
12?

00:01:57.076 --> 00:01:57.910
PETE FRISELLA: Go by fives.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.480
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Maybe 15?

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.970
20 devices.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.870
Seeing two people,
a couple people.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.210
25 devices?

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.540
Wow.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.259
You guys definitely
are all winners.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.420
Come by our booth after this.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.300
We'll give you a cool little
Google Analytics Android box.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.460
The fact of the matter is, as
you saw, everybody's using

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.070
many devices.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.770
So something else magical
happened in 2005.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.860
Can anybody guess what it is?

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.150
That was the year we launched
Google Analytics.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.830
And so when we launched Google
Analytics, we built a piece of

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.550
tracking code for the
web that included a

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.830
lot of client logic.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.800
And that data got sent to
Google Analytics using

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.990
something we call the utm.gif.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.850
A couple years later,
we launched V1 of

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.510
our application tracking.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.360
What we had to do, is we had to
port all that client logic

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.750
and the complexity into Java
and into Objective-C to

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.180
support our Android
and iOS SDKs.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.390
As we look to the future, what
we really want to do is

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.520
support measuring users
across any devices.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.110
And so, because it was so
complex to port our code, we

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.360
completely rewrote our
infrastructure for collection.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.910
And we released something
what we call

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.280
the measurement protocol.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.230
And we released this maybe
a couple months ago.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.750
And the measurement protocol is
an easy to use way to send

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.370
data to Google Analytics
from any devices.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.800
So all of a sudden, you now
have a way to measure

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.530
interactions with game consoles,
set-top TV box, even

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.200
point of sale system, pretty
much any sort of places where

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.230
you have user interactions.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.020
So let me quickly explain to
you how the measurement

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.920
protocol works.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.840
But before we get into that, we
really need to understand

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.480
the Google Analytics
data model and what

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.270
we're trying to represent.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.420
At its core, Google Analytics
represents how users interact

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.400
with content.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.240
For example, this lovely
lady here is buying

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.940
flowers for her boyfriend.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.990
In this scenario, the
user is the lady.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.120
And viewing the product page for
flowers is the interaction

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.090
that we'd want to track.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.340
So to measure this interaction
with Google Analytics, there's

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.090
three pieces of information
we need.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.020
One is we need to identify the
tracking ID which defines the

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.960
Google Analytics account
you have.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.130
Two, you would need to identify
what we call the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.900
Client ID, and this represents
an anonymous user.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.190
We represent it with
the cid value.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.850
And finally, we need to
represent the interaction.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.320
We represent it with what
we call the Hit Type.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.550
Within Google Analytics
there's many

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.250
different Hit Types.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.529
There's page views, events,
transactions, items, so forth.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.670
So these three values map
into a request to

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.100
the measurement protocol.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.040
The protocol is actually
an HTTP request.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.200
To this end point,
google-analytics.com/collect.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.620
You send a Get Request.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.060
You specify version.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.890
And then you have the
three values.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.050
You have the tid, which
is your UA number.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.130
You have the cid, which is
the anonymous User ID.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.430
You have the Hit Type, in
this case is a pageview.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.330
And finally is flowers.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.590
It's that easy.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.840
And to send this data, if I go
back into this screen here, in

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.010
the back here I have Google
Analytics real time report.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.690
So all I need to do is grab
this URL, open a browser

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.860
window, hit Enter--

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.600
hopefully, if everything
works, boom.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.970
We see the data directly
in real time reports.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.040
That's how easy it is to send
data to Google Analytics.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.760
Now, the user interaction
model is super flexible.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.410
And the measurement protocol
is really easy to use.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.080
So you can take this model and
apply it to many different

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.250
scenarios that might not even
have to do with websites.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.670
For example, here's my Google
employee badge.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.760
Inside of it is an RFID chip,
and on the chip has my

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.730
employee ID.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.500
That represents the user.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.060
Now, here I have
an RFID reader.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.240
And the reader's hooked up to
Google Analytics, through this

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.810
little app here.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.750
So when I scan my badge
over the reader--

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.000
with any luck--

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.110
Boom.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.000
I see the data directly
in real time reports.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.430
Now, what's even more amazing
about sending data from any

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.570
device, what's really
cool about this--

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.155
let me just go back to my
presentation here--

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.580
what's really exciting is that
demo only took five lines of

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.870
shell script.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.090
That's how easy it
was to send.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.840
So now anybody can send
data to Google

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.450
Analytics from any device.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.100
All right.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.150
Enough fun and games.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.430
Let's look at a real
world application.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.270
In fact, let's take a look at
how the Chrome Dev Rel team at

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.840
Google uses the measurement
protocol to

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.640
measure their app, Yeoman.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.130
So what is Yeoman?

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.800
Yeoman was inspired
by Ruby on Rails.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.080
And the Rails framework makes it
really easy, with a command

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.360
line script, to add a couple
commands and get an entire

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.160
Ruby web application.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.820
So the Chrome Dev Rel team,
because of the plethora in

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.465
growth of all these different
JavaScript frameworks, wanted

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:40.890
to provide a simple command line
tool so developers can

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.280
write a couple commands and
they could build all this

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.980
structure of framework of their
modern web applications.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.990
So here's the screen
shot of the tool.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.830
And what the developer relations
team wanted to

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.120
understand was how many people
are actually using this tool.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.050
So when they started looking
at the problem, the first

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.920
question that came to mind-- you
know, the first thought--

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.480
they were like, yeah, we'll
use App Engine.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.225
App Engine's powerful.

00:07:00.225 --> 00:07:00.980
It's easy.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.440
It gives us all the power.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.470
But when they started looking
at the problem of what they

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.340
had to solve, they had to write

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.250
collection to collect logs.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.640
They had to write some
asynchronous tasks to process

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.440
those logs into reports.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.260
They had to build a front end
to display all the reports,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.610
and potentially even get into
some visualizations to make it

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:18.540
all look pretty.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.150
Now, that's a lot of work.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.260
And when we showed them the
measurement protocol, it was

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.620
very easy to see why using
Google Analytics in the

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.420
protocol would save
them so much time

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.010
and be so much easier.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.710
So they implemented the
measurement protocol in this

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.870
application.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.530
And when users actually use the
app for the first time,

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.540
they're prompted with a simple
little opt-in to collect

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.110
anonymous data to Google.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.850
When the user approves that,
we create a random ID that

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.010
gets stored on disk.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.110
And that's what we use
for the Client ID.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.440
Now, every command that the user
uses is actually sent as

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.780
an event to Google Analytics.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.570
So all of a sudden, they can
log into the report and see

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.730
exactly how many people
are using their app.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.050
And this is huge.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.830
This is huge because they're not
tracking installs, they're

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.240
tracking active users using the
unique visitors metric.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.740
In fact, this is one of the most
popular things they use

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.210
during performance review time
because they can actually

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.570
quantify the impact their team
has on growing the adoption of

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.070
this product.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.500
What's nice about this is Google
has a lot of features

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.970
out of the box, Google
Analytics does.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.360
And so one of the business
questions that they have is,

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.270
what is the actual impact of
their outreach efforts?

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.660
And so the team actually goes
around the globe, speaks at

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.460
many events like I/O. One of the
events is called G-Kenya,

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.049
and it's actually part of our
Africa outreach event.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:34.850
And at one of those events
they talked the Yeoman

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.659
product, and so they
were curious.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:38.770
Like, what was the last amount
of people who actually used

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:39.650
the product?

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.360
And here, directly in analytics,
they can now tell

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.340
whether that event
was effective.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.970
Effectively, they're using
Google Analytics to tell

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.740
people that they should travel
around the world.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.590
It's pretty amazing.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.400
And finally, they're using
analytics to show what are the

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.220
actual applications people
are using and frameworks.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.780
And this is great, because when
they started looking at

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.850
their development cycle and
saying, where should I focus

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.110
my time and effort, they could
see what were the top

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.560
languages people used and then
incorporate these as the

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.270
default setting, so people
don't actually have to

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.740
download them independently.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.810
So the measurement protocol with
Google Analytics gives

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.560
the developers of any
application the ability to

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.220
measure how users use
their application.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.740
With that, I want to turn it
to Andrew to talk about

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.405
cross-device optimization.

00:09:24.405 --> 00:09:25.740
ANDREW WALES: Awesome.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.990
Thanks, Nick.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.930
So Nick just showed you how you
can send data to Google

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.150
Analytics from pretty much any
connected environment really

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.690
easily, using the measurement
protocol.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.670
And that's really awesome.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.920
In this next section, I want to
show you some things we're

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.910
working on to make it easier
for you to actually analyze

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.775
that data and to build better
cross-device experiences for

00:09:48.775 --> 00:09:51.690
your users.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.270
So I want to start
with User ID.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.470
Now, you saw in Nick's demo,
when he was sending those hits

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.000
with the measurement protocol,
he was using a field called

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.580
the Client ID, or cid.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.670
And this has been around in
Google Analytics for a while.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:10.010
Basically, it's an anonymous
ID that represents a single

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.050
user on a single
client device.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:17.340
So if I'm using your web app on
my smartphone, I have one

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.910
Client ID that represents
me using that phone

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.040
in GA, Google Analytics.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.370
Now, if I access your site on
a desktop, I'm going to get

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.110
another Client ID, a unique
one, that GA's

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.470
going to use as well.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.520
And this is going
to keep going.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.950
So if I use your web app on five
different devices, I have

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:42.490
as many as five different
unique Client IDs in GA.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:46.540
Now, this can be fine if you
want to do analysis of my

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.400
experience with your
app on one device.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.470
So if you want to say,
OK, how's Andrew

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.320
using my app on a desktop?

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.890
That's fine.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:55.340
No problem.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.030
You can definitely do that.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.090
Where it gets tricky, and where
we run up against a

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.780
little bit of a barrier, is
when you start asking

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.140
questions about, how is Andrew
using my product across all

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.920
these different devices?

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.650
For example, how many devices
in total do I use

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.510
to access your app?

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.970
How much revenue do I generate
across all of

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.640
my devices for you?

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.750
This is where Client ID starts
to feel a little bit like some

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.070
walls that we run up against
in analytics today.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:26.060
So we're introducing a brand
new ID called User ID.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.380
And the difference here is
that User ID is going to

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.820
represent a single user across
all of their devices.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.470
And with that User ID, we can
start to break down those

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.580
walls and start to answer some
of these really cool

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.740
cross-device questions.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.440
Let me show you a really simple
example of how this is

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.690
going to improve GA reporting.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.090
So let's say Pete's using my
web app on his smartphone.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.470
And you can see here, GA
has generated for him a

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:55.970
unique Client ID.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.420
And in my reports, he's
considered one unique visitor.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.130
Now this is fine.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.620
All's well and good, until Pete
decides he wants to go

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.790
get himself a tablet.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:05.580
Good for Pete.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.690
But bad for me.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:10.450
Because now, when he uses
my app, he's got a

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.460
new Client ID, right?

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.290
It's unique.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.640
And GA is saying, great, now
I've got two unique users.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.930
Well, I know there's actually
only one Pete.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.340
He's irreplaceable.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.640
But he's using two devices.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.290
And as this continues on, he
gets more and more devices, he

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.120
shows up as more and more unique
visitors on my reports.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.960
This gets to be a problem,
because I actually only have

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.800
one user, but here it's
saying I have three.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.340
So let's do this again
using User ID.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:42.170
So now Pete's using my app
on his smartphone.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:44.890
And when he signs in-- because
this is actually a signed-in

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:45.370
experience.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.510
When he signs in, I'm going to
take his User ID from my auth

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.480
system and I'm going
to send it to GA in

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.340
this new uid field.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.100
And I'm going to do the very
same thing when he does this

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.150
on his tablet, and when he
does it on his laptop.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.100
And you can see, as he keeps
accessing my app, the number

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.410
of unique visitors
stays the same.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.660
Because GA now understands this
is one user with three

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.910
different devices.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.210
So User ID.

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.100
It's going to enable
cross-device reporting.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.430
It's really best for signed-in
experiences.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.910
So where you have an auth system
that has an ID that's

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:20.220
stable that represents a
particular user across all

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.660
these different devices.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.570
And that ID has to be
non-personally-identifiable.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:26.690
And this is really important.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.780
Because you can't send
personally-identifiable data

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.990
to Google Analytics.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.080
So please, for example, don't
use my Social Security number

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.080
and send it into GA.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.750
That is not a good idea.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.120
Don't do it.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.790
It's really easy to
actually do this.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:44.060
So this is an example of using
our analytics.js library,

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.400
which is our new JavaScript
library that's built on top of

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.090
the measurement protocol.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.600
And mostly we've kind of
abstracted out the

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.540
complexities of auth.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.780
But most of the work in GA is
being done with just this one

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.420
line, this set API where you
can just say, if you have a

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.670
User ID, if somebody's signed
in, you can get it and set it

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.290
to this uid parameter.

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.460
And now when you send this page
view, it's going to send

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.610
that uid along with it.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.980
It's pretty straightforward.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.000
So you see now it's really easy
now to send data from any

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.170
connected environment using
the measurement protocol.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.020
And I just showed you how you
can use User ID to have this

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.530
idea, this notion,
representation of a user

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:23.510
across all their different
devices.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.800
Now I want to show you some new
reports we're working on

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.720
to help you actually analyze all
this data and to do some

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.220
pretty cool optimizations.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.060
I want to show you
three reports.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.540
The first is the Device
Overlap report.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.630
Second is the Device
Paths report.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.170
And the third is the Acquisition
Source report.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.590
So I'm going to start with the
Device Overlap report.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:45.885
And this is brand
new, by the way.

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:46.720
It's a sneak peak.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.980
We've never shown it before, so
I'm very excited to show it

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.860
to you today.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.450
So the Device Overlap report is
all about allowing you to

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:58.020
segment users and outcomes like
conversions, revenue, by

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.250
different device combinations.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.090
So let me show you
what I mean.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:08.330
So suppose Nick is using my
app on his tablet, then he

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.980
moves to the desktop and he uses
my app there as well, and

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.230
he actually does an in-app
purchase for

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.300
$3.99 This is great.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.550
Great for me.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:21.730
If you did this without using
User ID and you looked in GA

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.860
before these new cross-device
reports, you might see

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.550
something like this where you
see Nick represented as two

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.150
unique visitors.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.500
And if somebody asks you, well,
what's the value of

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.380
tablet here in this
interaction?

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.160
You look at this report and it's
really hard to figure out

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.450
what the value was.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.800
You would be totally reasonable
in saying, eh,

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.800
tablet really doesn't have
much value here.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.920
We should get more desktop
users, right?

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.870
Because that guy spent $3.99.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.560
It's actually the same person,
but we can't tell that.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.080
So you're missing a little
bit of the picture there.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.970
Now let's do this again with
User ID and cross-device

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.330
measurement.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.170
It's actually Pete.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:00.770
So Pete's actually signed
in now, and I'm

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.260
sending Pete's User ID.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.960
Now with the new Device Overlap
report, look at the

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.770
difference.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.630
We're able to say, you actually
had just one user.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.150
They used a combination of
desktop and tablet, which is

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:14.470
actually what happened.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.870
And that combination of desktop
and tablet led to

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.010
$3.99 in revenue.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.610
So if somebody asks you, what's
the value of tablet,

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.280
you can say, well,
this is great.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.320
Actually, in combination
with desktop, it

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.210
produced $3.99 in revenue.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.500
So that's the Device
Overlap report.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.340
Allows you to segment users
and outcomes by device

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.590
combinations.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:41.575
Next, I'm going to show you
the Device Paths report.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.940
This report's all about
segmenting users and outcomes

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.240
by device paths.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.530
So not overlap this
time, but paths.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.670
So let me show you
what that means.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.760
So I just showed you how you
can now use combinations of

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.320
devices as segments, right?

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.600
So we were able to see
that Pete used

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.120
both desktop and tablet.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.770
That's pretty cool.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.599
Wouldn't it also be cool if you
could segment by paths?

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:09.040
So not just the fact that Pete
used both together, but that

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.680
he moved from one to another
in a specific order.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.300
And what could you
learn from that?

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.310
So that's the Device
Paths report.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:19.220
This is brand new.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.410
We've really never had
anything quite

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.220
like this in GA before.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.240
And what you'll see here on
the left, this is the

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.170
sequencer view.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.220
You'll see all the top paths
users are taking across

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.930
different device types.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.350
And then on the right side,
you'll see all their

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:36.550
engagement metrics, including
outcomes like revenue,

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.430
transactions, et cetera.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.050
Now, one of my favorite
features-- oops.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:41.630
Let me back up.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.470
One of my favorite features
about this report--

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:45.980
so I'm really interested
in revenue, right?

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.770
As probably most people
are who have apps

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.460
that are out there.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.500
I'm really interested in the
paths that actually lead up to

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.660
transactions because I want to
try to maximize the number of

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.390
people I can drive through those
most profitable paths.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.210
So using the sequencer options,
I can say, just show

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.320
me all the paths that led
up to a transaction.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.760
I'm just interested in those.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.670
And actually, here I'm only
going to see the last two.

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.090
So when we do that, this
is what we get.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.590
And look at that third
row there.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:14.610
This is actually pretty cool.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.410
Because we can see that this
specific path, when people

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:21.250
move from desktop to tablet,
this is ridiculously

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.100
profitable for me.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.990
Look at that revenue, the
number of transactions.

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.820
This is really awesome.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.750
One of the things I might do
after looking at this is to

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.440
create a promo on the desktop
that says, hey, if you have a

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.730
tablet, come check us
out on the tablet.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.100
Because I know when people move
from desktop to tablet,

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.650
they're more likely
to purchase.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:42.000
And when they do purchase,
they purchase a lot more.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.320
Just one example of the insights
you can pull out of

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.880
the Device Paths report.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.660
And again, this is all about
segmenting users and outcomes

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:53.230
by device paths, not
combinations.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.280
One last report I want
to show you is the

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.780
Acquisition Source report.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.710
This report's about
getting true

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:02.550
acquisition value by device.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.650
And once again, this has really
never been possible in

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:05.900
GA before today.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.950
So let me run through
another scenario.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.030
So Nick's using my app.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.430
I only have two users,
Nick and Pete.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.000
Hopefully some of you,
maybe later.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.890
So this app's being
used by Nick.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.720
He makes a $0.99 purchase.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.140
Then he uses my app on a tablet
and he makes a $2.99

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:27.625
in-app purchase.

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:28.870
It's fantastic.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.440
And he loves this so much that
he actually makes a $14.99

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.050
in-app purchase on
the desktop.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.600
This is great.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.880
Now, if we looked at this in GA
today, without using User

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.470
ID, without using any of the new
cross-device reports, we

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:43.860
might get a report that looks
like this, right?

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.870
We have three unique visitors.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.650
They're split across desktop,
tablet, and mobile.

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.230
And if somebody were to ask
you, well, what's the

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.860
acquisition value of tablet?

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.330
Or, sorry-- of mobile.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.140
You'd look at this report and
you'd say, well, we acquired

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.970
one user for mobile and they
made a $0.99 purchase, right?

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.390
So it's not nothing,
but it's not a lot.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:04.360
And you might actually
say, well,

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.620
desktop generated $14.99.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.970
So maybe that's the better
acquisition channel, right?

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.260
Maybe we should try to get
people coming through on

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.220
desktop instead of mobile.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.660
Let's do this again using
User ID and the new

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.400
cross-device reports.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.380
So here's the same
interaction.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.855
Now Nick is signing in, so I'm
sending his User ID to GA.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.350
And here's what we
get with the new

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.150
Acquisition Source report.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:33.960
We're able to see that there
was just one user, that we

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.630
acquired them through mobile.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:39.790
And here's the really cool part,
we can see that on the

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.980
originating touch point, which
was that original mobile

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.500
phone, we generated
$0.99 in revenue.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.690
But the really awesome thing is,
now we can see, because we

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:51.010
have User ID that's tying all
this together, we can see on

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:54.060
all these other touch points,
all these other devices, Nick

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.440
actually spent $17.98
more, incremental.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.770
So now when somebody asks you,
well, what's the acquisition

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.570
value of mobile, you can say,
well, it's $0.99, but then

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.730
they went off and spent $18.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.540
This is actually a really great
acquisition channel.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.400
You'd have the exact opposite
conclusion.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.440
This actually does work.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.800
It's just that you couldn't
really see it before.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.635
But now with User ID,
and the Acquisition

00:21:15.635 --> 00:21:16.900
Source report, you can.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.570
So Acquisition Source.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.730
Get true acquisition
value by device.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:30.560
So just to summarize what
I've covered so far.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.420
User ID, it enables cross-device
measurement in

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.380
Google Analytics.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.890
It should be
non-personally-identifiable.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.100
And I'll say that again.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.440
Non-personally-identifiable.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.240
And right now it's in a limited
pilot, and we'll have

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.300
more details about when
it's coming to

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.250
you guys pretty soon.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.510
I also showed you three new
cross-device reports.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.990
And these are going to enable
cross-device analysis, and

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.390
they're all built on top
of using User ID.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:58.800
And these reports are coming
soon, and we're going to have

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.520
some more information for
you soon about when

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.770
you can expect those.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:06.235
Cool.

00:22:06.235 --> 00:22:08.380
So now I want to pass
it off to Pete.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.340
He's going to talk a
little bit about

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.100
measuring online to offline.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:11.584
PETE FRISELLA: Great.

00:22:11.584 --> 00:22:13.036
Thanks, Andrew.

00:22:13.036 --> 00:22:13.520
All right.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.860
So Nick gave us some really
cool demos with the

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.080
measurement protocol.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.975
And you can do some really
awesome things with the

00:22:18.975 --> 00:22:19.510
measurement protocol.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.060
It's pretty exciting.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.970
Andrew introduced User ID,
which allows us to do the

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:24.980
cross-device measurement.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.920
So I'm going to take a look now,
let's put these things

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.330
together and see how we can use
that to actually combine

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:31.680
online with offline
measurement.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.520
So why is online and offline
measurement important?

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.550
Like, why do we care?

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.300
Well, if you think about the
way people interact and the

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.180
way users interact with your
business or your services

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.710
these days, a lot of times
they'll start the online

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:48.340
interaction, and then actually
conclude in the offline world.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.270
So maybe they will do some
research online, look at a

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.860
product they really enjoy, and
then visit the store and make

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.520
the purchase there.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.770
So when we think about a lot
of these situations like in

00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:01.450
retail where this happens, how
to get those two to connect

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.350
and how do we find that path
from the online campaign all

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.380
the way through to that
final purchase?

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.280
All right.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:07.790
So this is important.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:08.890
And it's not just for retail.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.800
There's things like, maybe
someone purchases a ticket

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.650
online and then they visit the
event, the venue, and they use

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:14.680
the ticket there.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:19.250
Or perhaps they purchase
something and then return it

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:20.090
and come back again.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:22.130
So these offline and online
interactions are taking place

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:23.040
all the time, right?

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.940
So from a customer perspective,
you want to know

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.190
that particular path.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:31.940
So when we think about the
measurement problem and why

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.010
this is important, and how it
looks today, this is a very

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.920
basic and simple report.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.950
But it tells a story.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:42.590
If you were to ask somebody,
based on what you see here,

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.330
what's the outcome or what do
you think happened for this

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:48.490
particular set of campaigns, I
think the likely conclusion

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:50.670
would be, well, they all seem
to perform reasonably well,

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.310
but they're all kind
of the same.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:56.340
They're all generated around
$25,000 or so in revenue.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.000
So if you were to follow up and
ask, OK, well, is there

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.600
any particular campaign we
should probably pay more

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.250
attention to?

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:02.750
Maybe one that we want
to optimize or

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:03.930
spend more money on?

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:05.470
It would really be difficult
to find this,

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:07.090
to determine this.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.890
But we just talked about how a
lot of times you have online

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:12.130
interactions that end up
concluding offline.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.100
So we know that data's out
there and it exists.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.180
So we probably want to make
decisions for that complete

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:20.260
story, and not just
this online story.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.530
So in that sense, what you
really want is probably

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.900
something that looks like this,
where you have your

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:29.660
offline and your online revenue
together in one place.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.150
And now you have a completely
different story, right?

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.240
If you ask those same questions
again, what do you

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.870
think happened here, what
campaigns perform really well,

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.140
now you see there's something
that happened here that wasn't

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:39.940
apparent before.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.270
It's that one of your campaigns
generated a large

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:45.290
amount of offline revenue.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:46.460
And now you can say, well,
what should we

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.220
spend more time on?

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.140
And the answer is a lot
more clear now.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.570
We should probably look at
the newsletter in May.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.320
I don't know what we did there,
but something generated

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.300
a lot of offline
revenue, right?

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.410
So this makes a lot
of sense, right?

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.520
We want to know these two
combined to give us some good

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.130
optimization possibilities and
what the actual paths that

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.200
people are taking from
online to offline.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.580
Everybody kind of gets this
and understands this.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:08.960
But we really want to be able
to have this data in GA.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.840
So let's look at
how we do this.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.370
How do we actually implement
something like this using what

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:14.050
we know about measurement
protocol and the

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.660
Client and User ID?

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.300
So the first thing we want to
do is step back and think

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.830
about the User ID and this
Client ID concept.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:24.840
So which one should you use to
implement online to offline?

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.600
There's two things
to think about.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.270
The first thing is, do you
have a consistent way to

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:30.470
identify the user?

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:31.910
And this goes back to what
Andrew was talking about the

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:33.210
User ID, right?

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.720
So if you do have a consistent
way to identify users, maybe

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.730
through a sign on or an
auth system, then you

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:40.610
want to use User ID.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.606
So when that's available, use
User ID, and that's going to

00:25:43.606 --> 00:25:45.760
be a stable ID that you
have and provide.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.530
So it could be an auth system,
it could be like a loyalty

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:48.550
card or something.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:51.050
It's just a way to identify
that user.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.900
If you don't have that, then
you can still do this.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.580
You just want to use
the Client ID.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:57.580
And we have a mechanism that
allows you to extract that

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.420
Client ID that we've set for you
through Google Analytics.

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.630
OK.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:04.980
So now we understand maybe
which ones we should use.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.680
Let's look at how we'd actually
implement this on a

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:12.940
real-life scenario
using User ID.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.560
So the scenario is, we have a
retail store, Daily Deals.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.710
And there's an online
component in

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.600
this offline purchase.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.690
So typically, you'd see
something like, a user visits

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:25.300
a site, they would sign on and
when they do that we would

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:26.650
know what user this is.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.170
Like, who does this belong
to, this account?

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:29.240
We'd have that information.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.100
So we have a User ID.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.380
Maybe browse the site a little
bit, look around to see what

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.520
they enjoy.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.060
Maybe there's a new deal that
they really want to take

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:40.140
advantage of, so they'll
print off a coupon.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.580
And this is your online
component now.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.310
They've completed that, and now
they're going to the store

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.590
with the coupon.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:49.340
So from the in-store purchase it
looks something like this.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:53.260
Visitor visits the store
with their coupon.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.940
And now that they have the
coupon, we actually know that

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.340
it belongs to Andrew because he
printed it off and we know

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:01.200
which coupon this was printed
off for which user.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.770
And he uses that coupon
to make a purchase.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:08.600
And finally the transaction
concludes and we have the

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.790
complete cycle from online
to offline interactions.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:12.900
This is what we all know
what happens today.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.940
But how do we apply GA to this
scenario to get that report

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.100
where we see those two,
online and offline

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.350
revenue, come together?

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.870
Well, the first thing you want
to do is enable online

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.620
management with the User ID.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:26.860
This is the important part.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.030
When you send in hits to Google
Analytics, you want to

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.900
make sure that you set the User
ID, this stable ID that

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.850
you have, because you have an
auth system and you have

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.780
signed in, right?

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.500
The second thing you want to do
is, in the in-store side of

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.440
things, from the point of sale,
because we have the

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.610
measurement protocol, now you
can send hits from pretty much

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:45.140
anywhere, including point
of sale systems.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.380
So at that point, what you
want to do is send the

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.180
transaction to Google Analytics,
you want to make

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.180
sure you set the user ID
in that situation.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.830
And the thing that's maybe not
100% obvious, but is important

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:56.750
here, is what the coupon
actually accomplishes.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.470
The coupon is what
actually ties

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:01.010
these two things together.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.420
It allows us to encode the User
ID into the coupon, for

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.387
example, which we then
can extract in

00:28:05.387 --> 00:28:07.095
the in-store purchase.

00:28:07.095 --> 00:28:10.690
So this actually makes
the connection.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.800
So let's look at number one, the
step where we want to do

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.200
online measurement
with the ID.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.860
You've seen this before,
it's the same as what

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.090
Andrew showed you.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:18.530
Because you have an auth system,
you want to get the

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:21.330
User ID, and you want to set
it when you send hits to

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:22.580
Google Analytics.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.870
The second step is the
in-store purchase.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.560
So again, we have the
measurement protocol.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.840
At that time, we want to make
sure we set the User ID to the

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:36.020
same ID that we had from the
online coupon when they

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.550
printed that, and we want to
send the transaction value

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.430
when it actually takes place.

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.180
So this will actually tie the
offline purchase back to that

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.793
online interaction,
and going back all

00:28:45.793 --> 00:28:47.043
the way to the campaign.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:51.690
So that was retail, but it's
just not retail, right?

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:52.800
You can use this for a lot
of different things.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.290
If you have a loyalty card, that
gives you a nice, stable

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:57.140
ID that you can use for these
different channels.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.570
Memberships, tickets, all these
things you can encode

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:02.770
these User IDs into, and then
at the time of redemption or

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:06.080
the offline interaction, you can
get that User ID back out

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.997
and pass it along to
GA with the hit.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:11.630
So that was User ID.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:13.870
Let's look at Client ID.

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:15.870
So maybe you don't have an auth
system or you don't have

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:19.050
a way to get a stable ID across
different channels.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:19.950
We do have the Client ID.

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:23.620
That's the ID that's generated
by Google Analytics.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.660
So if we look at this scenario,
it's kind of a test

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:28.260
drive scenario where you're
interested in a car and you

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.763
want to book a test drive, or
you want some more information

00:29:29.763 --> 00:29:32.450
about the car.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:33.550
So the same scenario.

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:35.970
You have an anonymous ID user
that comes to the site.

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:39.360
They might do a little bit of
research about the car and

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.240
what they're looking for.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.190
It might not be there.

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:44.730
And they'll fill out a form,
and that form will get

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:46.930
submitted to a CRM system, so
a Customer Relationship

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:50.640
Management system, and within
there it'll generate a lead.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.650
So that's the online component
of this scenario.

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:55.490
Then you have the
car salesman.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:59.360
And this guy, looks very
familiar to Nick, comes along

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.630
and he grabs that lead out
of the CRM system.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:04.510
And he calls up the customer.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.420
And he talks to him.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.550
And he's really good at what he
does, so he convinces the

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:08.910
guy to book a test drive.

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:09.930
That's all he does.

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:13.640
All he does is just book
test drives, Nick.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.370
And once he's done that, he
indicates in the CRM system,

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:21.000
OK, we move this prospect or
customer from a new lead to a

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.750
booked event.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:26.400
So this customer's gone through
this conversion.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.080
So how do we apply analytics to
this to make sure that we

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.950
connect this offline test drive
booked component back to

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:34.350
that online behavior that
initially got him to the site,

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:38.290
and what research that they
may have done before that?

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:40.210
So in this case, to implement
Google Analytics, you want to

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:43.170
make sure that you have
analytics implemented on the

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:43.920
site in general.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.480
So across all the
site you should

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.650
have analytics installed.

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:51.370
The second thing we want to
do is send the Client ID

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:53.070
with the form POST.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.610
So we need a way to get that
Client ID out of the tracker,

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.280
so the Google Analytics
ID that's provided.

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.220
And then we need to send that
to the CRM system so that it

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:03.050
can be saved within the lead.

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:06.145
And then from the CRM's
perspective, when the test

00:31:06.145 --> 00:31:08.580
drive's actually booked, we need
to get that ID and then

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.400
send the hit back to Google
Analytics using

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.930
that same Client ID.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:14.820
So let's see how that looks.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.400
Let's see how the first
step looks.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:22.110
So for the form itself, we want
to submit the Client ID

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.860
with the form.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.730
So we need to add a new
field to the form.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:27.970
In this case, the ID is Client
ID, but it could be any ID,

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:29.310
whatever, of your choosing.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:30.530
The important thing
is that the form,

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.130
the element, is hidden.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:34.045
And we're going to use this to
set the value for the Client

00:31:34.045 --> 00:31:35.440
ID when the form gets posted.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.690
So we have this new element.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.250
And then we add a listener
to the form for

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:43.110
when it gets submitted.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.900
Because we want to know, once
that form gets submitted, we

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.540
want to grab the Client ID from
the tracker and we want

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.690
to send it to the CRM system
with the actual lead gen.

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:54.960
So the way we do that is,
we have a method, inner

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.960
mechanism, to allow you
to pull the Client

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.420
ID out of the tracker.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.930
So that first line there, the
blue line, is how we get that.

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.430
So once you have the value, then
you want to set the value

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:09.320
of the input element for the
form to that Client ID.

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.950
That way, when the form gets
submitted, that value will be

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:12.980
sent along.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.770
And then finally, we just want
to send an event to Google

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:16.720
Analytics to indicate that
there was a new lead gen.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.980
And that's going to use the
Client ID that's part of the

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:19.970
tracker already.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:21.710
So it's going to be associated
with that particular user's

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:22.960
interactions.

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:27.240
The second part is, we want to
send another event to Google

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.210
Analytics from the CRM system to
indicate that this user has

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.860
booked with us for
a test drive.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.220
And now it's measurement
protocol,

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.830
which is very simple.

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:37.460
At this time, we just want to
make sure we pull up the

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.200
Client ID that we saved in the
CRM system, that same ID.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.600
And we send it along with the
hit to indicate that there was

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.470
an event where the test drive
was actually booked.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.220
And that will tie back all of
that interaction across, from

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.585
the online to the offline CRM
system, back into Google

00:32:51.585 --> 00:32:56.400
Analytics, and you'll have that
view of that full path.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:56.680
All right.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.420
Just to wrap up things here, the
important thing here is,

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.550
we want to make that
connection, right?

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.370
So if you're doing online
to offline, you use that

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:05.020
connection, use the User ID or
a Client ID to make that

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:05.520
connection.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.190
And that's important.

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:09.610
Once you have that connection,
then you're able to attribute

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:12.200
offline interactions to online
campaigns and online

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.600
interactions.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.840
And once you have that, then
you're able to optimize for

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.980
the complete story.

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.290
So now I'll pass it
along to Nick.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:21.800
He's going to finish up.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.390
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
Thanks, Pete.

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:23.920
And Andrew.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.170
That was really exciting.

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.990
I don't know about you guys,
but this is pretty amazing.

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:29.790
We've covered three
big things today.

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:32.760
We talked about how Google
Analytics is enabling every

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.460
developer here who's building
applications to now use Google

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.870
Analytics to really
measure usage.

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:41.120
We talked about beautiful
reports of how we can now

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.610
optimize across devices, and
how this will enable you to

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.870
make better decisions of how
you're building your apps.

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:49.530
And finally, we talked about
getting the true value of your

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.550
marketing campaigns by tying
the offline and online

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:54.870
experiences together, all
using Google Analytics.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:56.530
So there's a couple key
things here of when

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:57.820
this stuff's available.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.960
The measurement protocol
is available now.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.380
What that means is, everybody
here, after this session,

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.850
should go look at our developer
docs and implement

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.429
Google Analytics in
your applications.

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:09.679
The second thing is User ID.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:10.850
That's coming soon.

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:13.170
Subscribe to our
+GoogleAnalytics channel and

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:15.820
we'll announce when it's
available for trusted testers.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.320
Finally, all our developer
documentation's on

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.219
developers.googl
e.com/analytics.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:22.409
If you haven't been there,
shame on you.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:24.239
Go there after this session.

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:26.489
Finally, come see us in the
after hours, where we'll be

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:27.850
answering questions.

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:29.270
Thanks a lot for your
time, guys.

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:35.870
