00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.500
About 40 million adults aged 18 and older

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.900
suffer from anxiety in the US,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
making it the most common mental disorder in the region.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.200
It develops from a complex set of factors that include genetics,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.900
brain chemistry, personality,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.000
and life events.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.900
It’s more than just feeling nervous to speak at a public event.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.200
It’s a mental disorder characterized by excessive worry

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.900
or fear strong enough to interfere with daily life.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.900
With that, many don’t realize things a person does because of their anxiety.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.800
This is a list of 13 of those things.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.000
Number 1: You disappear without notice.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.500
Anxiety can hit you anywhere, whether it’s at the grocery store,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.800
a party or at work.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.900
You just need 15 minutes alone to recollect yourself.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.900
People who don’t understand anxiety may see this as rude or weird,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.900
but it’s something that you really need.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.900
Number 2: You freak out over the time it takes someone to respond to your text.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Anxiety blows a lot of things out of proportion

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
whether you send a text to your mom or that special someone

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.900
when they take a while to respond

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.000
you begin to wonder if what you said was a little too weird,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
too rude or if you’re annoying them.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Why are they taking forever?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Was it something I said?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.900
Number 3: You over check things.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.000
Teachers have always told you to double check your homework before turning it in

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.900
but what if you check it too much,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.400
too much to the point of never turning it in.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.500
Your anxiety makes you a perfectionist.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.000
Whether it’s homework or checking to see if the door is locked

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.900
you check and recheck things multiple times.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.400
Sometimes you know something is perfect

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.000
but your anxiety won’t let you relax

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
unless it’s checked one more time… or two.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Number 4: You don’t go to parties.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.700
It’s not that you’re antisocial,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.400
you actually do want to go to the party.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.900
Whether it’s worrying about the big crowd or loud music

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.800
all you want to do is have a good time like everyone else

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.500
but you know your anxiety won’t let you

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.700
because of that you skip the party all together.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.800
Number 5: You let opportunities pass you by.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.600
As a perfectionist you often think you’re not good enough for opportunities presented to you.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.900
You become afraid of failing and making a fool of yourself

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.300
because of this you convince yourself to not take the opportunity, at all.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.300
But, before we continue with the list we’d like to thank our sponsor, “Intention Inspired".

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.800
This brand is doing a really cool challenge called “30 Days of Brave.”

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.100
If you have anxiety or just need a little encouragement to do something you’ve always wanted,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.600
this challenge is perfect for you.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.100
So, how it works is that when you sign up you'll get an e-mail every morning at 5 a.m. designed to help you achieve your goals.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.100
It will include an intention of the day,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.900
exciting challenges that help you set up your day for success,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.900
powerful yet simple exercises,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.900
inspiring quotes, meditations and affirmations.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.500
And, most importantly you’ll be able to connect with a community of like minded people who just like you

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.900
want to stretch their minds and push towards braver action.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.000
Very cool stuff designed for you to exercise that brave muscle and achieve your goals.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
What could you do in just 30 days with 5 minutes per day?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.200
So if that’s something you’re interested in make sure you sign up.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.800
All right, back to the list.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.000
Number 6: Certain dates give you anxiety.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.700
People with anxiety tend to remember the exact date of traumatic events.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.600
When the date arrives those emotions once again surface making it very difficult to get on with your day to day routine.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.600
Number 7: You hold on to your phone too much.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.300
Sometimes it’s hard for you to just sit and wait.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.200
It makes you uneasy to see people busy with something while you’re just sitting there

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.200
as a result you need to have your phone or something to fidget with.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.400
Number 8: You don’t make new friends.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.600
It may seem like you don’t want to make new friends

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.400
but you actually worry too much about the kind of impression you’re making on people.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.020
Afraid, you convince yourself that making no impression is better than making a bad one.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.900
As a result, you end up keeping to yourself even though you really want to meet new people.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.900
Number 9: You dread going to school/work even though you’ve done it a million times before.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.500
Unfortunately anxiety doesn’t care about how many times you’ve done your day to day routine

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.900
It hits when it wants to hit.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.900
Before going to work you may feel your heart race, have sweaty palms and feel jittery.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.800
Number 10: You’re clingy in relationships.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.100
You really care about your partner and due to that you may ask too many questions or send too many texts

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.000
because you want to know how they are.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.900
This may come off as clingy but your intentions aren’t bad. You’re just a little over protective because of your anxiety.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.700
Number 11: You cancel plans.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.400
Making plans is tough because in the moment of making a plan you’re confident and ready to take on the world.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.100
When the date finally rolls around anxiety can all of a sudden hit and you have to cancel.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.700
Sometimes you even have to cancel the plans you made in the first place.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.400
Number 12: You rehearse what you’re going to say before making a phone call.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.100
You prep and rehearse everything you’re going to say before making a phone call because

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.200
you’re afraid of making a mistake or forgetting what you had to say.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:01.400
Now this is great for phone interviews but it’s exhausting when all you want to do is ask customer service a question or talk to a friend.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.900
Number 13: When you ask someone to be alone you’re not asking them to leave forever.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.400
Sometimes you need a break from people in order to calm yourself down.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.700
When you take that break people who don’t understand anxiety tend to think you’re either upset with them or that you don’t like them.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.100
It’s hard for you to keep friends because of this.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.100
You do need your alone time but you’re not asking to be left alone forever.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:28.600
That’s the end of the video. If you have anxiety we at Psych2Go would like to know your thoughts on the list and if we missed anything.
