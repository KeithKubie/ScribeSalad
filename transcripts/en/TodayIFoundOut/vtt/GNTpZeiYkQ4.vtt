00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:02.600
Why we call the Seasons Summer, Autumn, Winter
and Spring

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.890
If you’ve ever found yourself wondering
why the seasons are called as they are, well,

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:07.890
wonder no more.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.950
“Winter” derives from the Proto-Germanic
*wentruz, meaning winter.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.680
This in turn probably comes from the Proto-Indo-European
(PIE) *wed, meaning “wet”.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.060
Alternatively, it may come from the PIE *wind-,
meaning “white”.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.410
Either way, the Proto-Germanic *wentruz gave
rise to the Old English “winter” as the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.690
fourth season of the year and the name for
the season has stuck around ever since.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.440
“Spring”, referring to a season rather
than the many other meanings of the word,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.360
first popped up in the 16th century.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.600
Starting in the 14th century, this time of
year was called “springing time” and then

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.670
in the 15th century this got shortened to
“spring-time”, and then further shortened

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.840
in the 16th century to just “spring”.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.199
The 14th century “springing time” came
about in reference to plants “springing”

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:51.739
from the ground and the like.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.550
Before the season was called these things,
it was called “Lent” in Old English.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.329
“Summer” came from the Old English name
for the season “sumor”, which in turn

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.280
came from the Proto-Germanic *sumur-, which
itself came from the Proto-Indo-European root

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.840
*sam-, meaning summer.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.820
*sam- seems to be a variant of the Proto-Indo-European
*sem- meaning “together / one”.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.350
The origin of “fall” as a name for a season,
rather than the more common “autumn”,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.479
is not perfectly clear, though it’s thought
that it probably came from the idea of leaves

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.030
falling from trees and many plants, particularly
the contraction of the English saying “fall

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.119
of the leaf”.

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.510
It first popped up as a name for a season
in the later 16th century in England and became

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.170
particularly popular during the 17th century,
at which point it made its way over to North

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.170
America.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.829
Funny enough, calling autumn “fall” in
England has since passed out of widespread

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.729
practice, but has survived as a common name
for the season in North America.

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.570
This is not unlike how “soccer” was originally
one of the most popular names for the sport

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.810
in England around its inception and a long
time after, which spread to North America,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.000
only to have the name die out in England,
leading many to believe “soccer” is an

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.710
“American” name for the sport.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.460
As for “Autumn”, this came to English
via the Old French “autompne”, meaning

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.470
autumn.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.130
This in turn came from the Latin “autumnus”,
also meaning “autumn”.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.330
From here things get murky, but it’s thought
“autumnus” probably came from an Etruscan

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.200
word and is possibly related to the Latin
“augere” meaning “to increase”.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.470
Beyond that, nobody is quite sure why the
season was originally called that.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.010
Calling the season “autumn” in English
first popped up in the 12th century, though

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.760
was a rarity until around the 14th century.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.450
It then began to pick up steam and became
common in the 16th century, about the same

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.130
time calling it “fall” popped up as the
name for the season.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.370
Before calling the season “autumn” or
“fall” in English, it was called “harvest”.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.210
Incidentally, you may also wonder why the
seasons are called “seasons”.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.931
The word “season” in this context comes
from the Old French “seison”, meaning

00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:44.630
“sowing / planting”.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.220
This in turn came from the Latin “sationem”
meaning “sowing”.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.930
Initially this referred to actually sowing
seeds, but later, as with the Old French “seison”,

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.280
shifted definition to refer to the time period
when you sow seeds, so literally “seed-time”.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.580
“Season” in this sense in English popped
up around the 13th century.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.380
It was also around this time that “season”
popped up referring to seasoning food- in

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:23.000
this case from the Old French “assaisoner”,
meaning “to ripen”.
