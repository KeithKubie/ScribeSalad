00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:08.975
What'd you think
of that case?

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.144 align:start size:88% position:13%
Snooze fest.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.246 align:start size:47% position:53%
[ Laughs ]

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.814 size:63% position:31%
Thought it was
a snooze festival.

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:17.417 align:start size:66% position:34%
How many snooze fests
have you gone to now?

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.319
I haven't been for a few years
'cause parking was so tough

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:22.321 size:63% position:69%
about four
or five years ago,

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:23.689 size:84% position:58%
so I was like,
"[bleep] this snooze fest."

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:25.458 size:63% position:31%
They were sleeping
in their cars.

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:27.260 size:78% position:39%
You can't even
get into the parking lot.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:28.961 size:59% position:70%
People can't wait
to snooze.

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:29.962 align:start size:84% position:16%
[ Laughs ]

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:31.297 size:63% position:31%
They don't --
They don't realize

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.031 size:63% position:31%
they could have just
stayed at home.

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:33.533 align:start size:63% position:38%
Stay home and do it.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.535 size:88% position:44%
Stay home, you don't have to
come to a festival.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:37.770
Oh, snoozing at home is free
if you don't turn the heat on.

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:40.840
Every single case
that I am a guest bailiff for,

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:43.342 size:63% position:31%
I want to grow
and I want to learn,

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:44.844 size:66% position:33%
and that's
what I did today.

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:46.212 align:start size:44% position:56% line:92%
You did?

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:46.212 align:start size:97% position:3%
I did.

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:47.480 align:start size:56% position:44%
How did you grow?

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:49.015 size:66% position:33%
I take that back.
I<i> learned.</i>

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:53.953 size:81% position:41%
I learned that that mother
is willing to give gifts.

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:55.488 size:63% position:69%
Referring to
the woman?

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:56.689 align:start size:84% position:16%
The woman.

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:59.192
It's unclear
whether he wanted the products.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:02.428
Sounds a little like a little
pushy-mom kind of scenario.

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.030 size:72% position:36%
Seems like
she pushed them on him.

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:05.765 size:72% position:36%
He might have done them
to be nice.

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:07.500 size:63% position:31%
He's out there
chasing a dream.

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.535 size:63% position:31%
He wants to act.
He wants to model.

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:11.337 align:start size:53% position:47%
He's got poses.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.405 size:63% position:31%
He has poses.
You saw those poses.

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:13.840 size:59% position:70%
He was
throwing out poses.

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:15.541 size:66% position:33%
You don't
just pose like that

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:17.710 size:72% position:36%
unless you've
posed like that before.

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:19.011 align:start size:28% position:72% line:92%
Right?

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:19.011 align:start position:0%
That's what I saw.

00:01:19.044 --> 00:01:20.313 size:63% position:69%
He's had
at least a few gigs.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.414 align:start position:0%
He's had a few gigs.

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:24.016 align:start position:0%
And then here he is --
he's got to be on set,

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.352 align:end size:63% position:63%
and he's got acne
all over his face.

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:27.553 align:start position:0%
If that happens to me,

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:29.388
I'm not
throwing those products away,

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:30.823 size:66% position:33%
I'm lighting them
on fire

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:33.025 align:start position:0%
and I'm throwing them
into a gully or something.

00:01:33.058 --> 00:01:34.927 align:start size:88% position:13%
Is that a --
yeah, gully.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.331
Yeah, I feel like maybe there's
no gullies near where he lives,

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:39.599 align:start size:59% position:41%
but you never know.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:41.534 size:63% position:69%
Can you get Siri
on your phone

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.603 size:88% position:56%
and say,
"Where's the nearest gully?"

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:45.905 size:75% position:38%
I leave my phone in the
locker room every time I
get to the courthouse.

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:48.241
She'd probably just direct you
to a hockey game, I'd imagine.
