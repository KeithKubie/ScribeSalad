00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.460
Hey guys, we are back at the Beach because for this video

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.540
I'm going to show you how to turn a palm leaf into a cool little fishing toy that you can actually cast

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.960
All you're going to need for this project is one single palm leaf you can see it kind of folds down in a V-shape with

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.750
This hard yellow Ridge line if we follow that down far enough

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.930
[we're] going to find it thins out and what we want to do is just take our nail

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.750
And we want to actually peel this thing off

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.250
 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.760
Find the tip and slowly peel off that ridge line and if you pinch the leaves as you do you should be able to keep

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.109
Them intact and just very gently pull that entire ridge line off of the leaf

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.119
Make sure you're really gentle when you rip this off because we need the leaves and we are going to be using this later

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.599
This thing's kind of like a little whip and that's great because that's pretty much

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.110
We're going to be using it for in a minute

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.879
Near the topic gets really flimsy and we don't really need that so you can go ahead and break it off

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.270
But where it starts to get firm you want to loop that over into a circle

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.249
And then just twist that back on itself three or four times is what that's going to do is it's going to hold the circle

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.829
in position so that it won't unravel if you give it a little bit of a tug it'll start to tighten in on itself and

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.389
That's what we're looking for right [there]. Just a little circle a little bit bigger than your thumb [alright] now

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.939
Go ahead and set that to [the] [side] because now it's time to make our fish

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.989
So now if you look at your palm leaf you're going to see it's been split into two different pieces

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.439
Just go ahead and give it a tug to separate them because we're going to be using each of these

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.869
Individually now what you're looking for is a palm leaf

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.239
That's somewhere around an inch thick it doesn't have to be exact but somewhere around that size it can be perfect take your first leaf

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.610
And put it straight into your palm, and then hold it in place with your thumb

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.509
You want to see that there are a couple inches?

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:26.110
overlapping

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.979
Underneath your hand then take the leave and wrap it back in through [your] pointer finger and your middle finger and hold it in place

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.899
And you also want to have a loop a couple inches tall now just do that same thing again

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.900
make a loop bring it back hold it with your fingers and

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.779
Then you can use your thumb to hold everything in place

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.070
So we've essentially just made two loops and that is the end of step one

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.669
Take the base of the second leaf and push it through the center circle

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.070
But bring it to the outside of the first circle, and then pull it all the way through about a foot now

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.369
We're going to do is we're going to weave in and out and in and out and to do that

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.529
We're going to go inside this loop, and then we're going to go to the outside [of] the second loop

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.719
We're going to bring it all the way around

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.350
And we're going to go inside the first loop

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.940
Pull it tight

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.600
And you're going to see this [loops] [going] to want to pop off so hold that down with your middle finger

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.860
Then bend the leaf around push it through the center and pull it through [all]

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.310
[we] have to do now is pull these tight by slowly working individual leafs and what that's going to do is

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.509
Eventually work itself down and do a cool little fish save one more little tug should tighten everything up and hold everything securely in place

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.220
All right

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.179
so our little fish is starting to look pretty good all we have to do is trim up his fins a little bit and put

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.930
Them on a stick and we're just about done

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.400
Now if you look at the palm leaves you can see that all the fibers run horizontally

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.199
[and] if you pinch with your thumb, you can kind of dig into it and pull away

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.059
And it will just follow that strand leaving a little bite mark out of the leaf do that a couple more times

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.579
just

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.029
Staggering where you pinch it and what you're ultimately going to be doing is trimming down the fins and give it a cool little fin

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.690
effect

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.229
For these inside fins. I like to start on the inside and just repeat that process [just] stagger. Where you make those cuts

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.298
Boom just like [that] our little fishy is done

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.309
So guys we got our fish we got our rod and all we have to do now is bring the two together

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.569
Now to add the Rod just split the fins at the back and push through that little hole

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.828
Until you can see the Rod poking through the tip of the fish's mouth

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.620
Then you just want to pull all the way through until you see that little circle disappear into the fish's belly

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.000
Now bend the stick back around and push it through the hole in the top [fin]

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.730
Until it comes out the hole in the bottom fin

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.060
And just give it a little tug and that puts your little fish on a stick

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.668
These things make really cool toys for the kids because watch this you grab the rod at the bottom and give it a little flick

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.829
You can cast your line and catch a fish just like that. How awesome is that?

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.359
Then just push your rod back up to reset it and you can cast it again

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.710
Now there's one more cool trick. You can do with these fish if you've made one of these headbands

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.890
I showed you in another video

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.529
Take the base of the stick and just push it down through the front and makes a cool little decoration for your kids

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.190
If you look closely, it's kind of like he's got a fishing line coming right out of his mouth

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.230
That's pretty cool and really simple to make

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.809
So there you [have] it guys that's how to use one single [palm-leaf] to make a really cool Polynesian fishing toy

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.770
Thanks so much for joining me for this experiment, and I'll be looking for you the next one. Talk to [you] then

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.650
you
