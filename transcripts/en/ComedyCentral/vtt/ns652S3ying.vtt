(upbeat music)

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.438
- [Whispered Voices] Dead Kevin.

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:06.506
- I like the first one.

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:07.741
The second one was a little...

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:09.042
I think Dennis Quaid's
making a comeback, man.

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.276
- Nah, the second
one was good, man.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.544
- He still has a really
young face, you know?

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.046 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Oh, for sure.
- Oh, wait!

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:15.048
You guys have your keys?

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:17.384
- Shit.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.188
- [Jack] You don't have yours?

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.858 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Nah, I lost my
keys like a week ago.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:28.461
- I don't have keys
for the apartment.

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:30.030
- You don't have keys
for the apartment?

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.531
- No, you guys never did,

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:35.101 align:start size:94% position:6%
you never went down to the
shop thing and got 'em.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:37.871 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Whatever, let's just go
and let's just see the movie,

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.039
and just worry about this later.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.540 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Alright, he's right.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.674 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We're wasting time here,
let's just go see the movie...

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:43.276
- Just worry about it later.

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:44.377
- Yeah. We'll just go.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.745 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Alright.
- Yeah, let's just go.

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:47.580
- Cool. Who's driving?

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.420
- My keys are on the same
chain in the apartment.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.888
- My car's in the shop.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.123
- I don't have a car, so...

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.393
- Were you gonna try
to fix that problem

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.095
any time in your
adulthood, Jack?

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:03.963
- How do I fix not having a car?

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:05.231
- Getting a car.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.033
- Alright, fine, okay,
let's just take a cab.

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.201
- Alright, let's call a cab.

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:09.969 align:start size:88% position:13%
We'll get there somehow,
let's call a cab.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:10.804
- Cool. Let's get a cab.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.072
- Let's get a cab.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.007 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Problem solved.
Let's just get a cab.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.676
- [Ryan] Do you have your phone?

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:20.847
- My phone's in the apartment.

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:23.183
- I threw my phone in
the ocean on a dare.

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:24.684
- Why?

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:26.252
- Because someone dared
me to do it, so I did it.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.253
- Well, I...

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:29.923
- You don't have a phone?
- I don't have a phone.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.424
- You still don't have
a phone? Jesus fucking.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:32.392
How old are you?

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:33.793
Sorry, how old are you?

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:34.761
- 27.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:35.695
- (laughs) Okay.

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:37.230
- What does my age have...

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.765
- What does your age have
to do with having a phone?

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.733
Your goddamn phone?
You're a grownup!

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:41.968
- Hey! Stop!

00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:43.169 align:start size:81% position:19%
- How old are you?
- 27! I'm 27.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.003
- Years?

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:47.874
- Yeah, years. What
else would it be?

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:49.709
- Alright. No movie.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.445
Let's just go eat. Come on.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:53.713
Let's just go eat.

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:54.948
- Alright, yeah,
let's just go eat.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:55.982
- Okay, let's get food.

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:57.917
Let's go eat some food.

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:00.854
Do you have your wallet?

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:03.089 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm gonna say
this, and I feel like

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:04.824
you guys might know it already.

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.793
- You don't have a wallet.
- I don't have a wallet.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:07.627
(laughs)

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.129
- Alright, alright!

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.563
- What, I thought you knew!
- You don't have a wallet?

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:11.764
You don't own a wallet?

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:12.999
- 'Cause you get sore
asses for a while!

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.434
You put the wallet
in your back pocket,

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:15.502 align:start size:97% position:3%
and you have scoliosis!
- What are you talking about?

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:16.669
Where do you put things?

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:17.837 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You have scoliosis
in your back!

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:19.072 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Where do you put
dollar bills and cards?

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.006
You put the wallet on
the bottom of one cheek

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:21.474
for years and years and years--

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:22.675
- Are you fucking crazy?
What are you talking about?

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:23.943
- Trying to fix their posture!

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:24.878
- What are you talking
about? Are you insane?

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:25.879
- I'm trying to fix my posture!

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.247
- You don't own a wallet?

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:28.481
- It kinda makes sense.

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.216
- I can add like three
inches to my height!

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:32.785
- Come on, let's just...

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:36.055
What do we have in our pockets?

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:37.357
I have...

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:38.958 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Empty your pockets.
What do we got?

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.960
- I brought a bag of chips.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.794
- Chips.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:43.863
- Fuck, I... Shit.

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:45.431 align:start size:81% position:19%
- You have to stop
bringing that.

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:46.833
- Yeah, that's my fault.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.769
- I have this bag of weed.

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.738
- Let's just smoke some
pot and eat some chips.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:53.339
- Smoke some pot and
eat some chips. Boom.

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:54.641
- That's our day.

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:55.475
- Not a big deal.
Let's just do it.

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:56.176
- That'll be fun.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.143
- Jeez. (laughs)

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:59.412
Well what are we smoking out of?

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:02.015
- Oh yeah, pipe's inside, sorry.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.952
- You serious? Are you joking?

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:08.621
- Hey. Let's just eat the chips.
