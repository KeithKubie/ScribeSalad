1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage your host for this evening.

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.710
<v 1>Jad Abumrad and Robert Krulwich</v>

3
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:19.783
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

4
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.980
<v 3>Okay, so Robert and I have been on tour for the last two months.</v>

5
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.820
We went to city after city after city,

6
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.450
something like 21 cities went to year. We were both like, yeah,

7
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.160
sick kick their asses,

8
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:38.210
but it was so much fun and the show was called apocalyptical is about endings,

9
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.390
which is not the most obvious topic to choose to invite people to do with

10
00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:44.771
theaters here.

11
00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:47.870
We're going to just tell you different stories that end really brilliantly,

12
00:00:47.871 --> 00:00:50.290
but these are, this is a series of ending stories.

13
00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:53.930
That's what we did that night and we did it with some amazing musicians and

14
00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:58.130
comedians and video artists who projecting beautiful images on these massive

15
00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:02.780
screens above our head and also we had puppets, enormous, beautiful,

16
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.860
articulate, gorgeous puppets and you can see all this.

17
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.450
We are releasing a really nicely shot video of this entire performance at the

18
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:13.490
same time as this audio podcast.

19
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.760
Go to radiolab.org/live you can watch the whole thing.

20
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.240
He knows some of the best moments of the show were purely visual,

21
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.860
so we encourage you to check it out.

22
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.200
But what follows is the audio podcast version of that show,

23
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.820
which we recorded live at the paramount in Seattle. This show actually

24
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.380
<v 4>truly begins with a radical rethinking of one of the most important ending</v>

25
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:39.780
stories that has ever happened on planet earth,

26
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.150
which is the story about the end of the dinosaur.

27
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.370
<v 0>There's all kinds of dinosaur puppetry, beautiful stuff at the beginning, uh,</v>

28
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.000
which we're going to skip over. But again,

29
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.150
you can check it out@radiolab.org slash live we're going to jump to the part

30
00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:54.990
where we hear from scientists who have been forensically probing this moment and

31
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:57.420
have a totally new way of thinking about it. Okay,

32
00:01:57.421 --> 00:02:00.810
we're going to start you off with a guy. Well, the guy who started off for us,

33
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.630
it's a guy named Jay Jay Malosh

34
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.880
<v 4>professor at Purdue University,</v>

35
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.270
and I study impact craters among other things.

36
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.710
<v 0>Not only can Jay Malosh create impact craters with his mind,</v>

37
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.970
but he and his colleagues have been investigating this moment almost as if it

38
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:21.140
were a crime scene that happened not 60 million years ago, but yesterday.

39
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.170
And the story that they've put together, it's more than just interesting.

40
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.393
It's frankly,

41
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.940
frankly terrifying and weirdly specific as it happens. Take for example,

42
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.150
the seemingly simple question of when, when did it happen?

43
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.310
You don't mean like the year, cause that would be a little too specific. No,

44
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.540
I don't know if you remember what Jay, you got even more specific than that.

45
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.020
This was a casual question that I threw out. Listen to his answer. By the way,

46
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:49.550
do we know anything about seasons?

47
00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:51.550
Was this him at warm but particularly actually, yeah.

48
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.370
<v 4>Was between, well this is a bit of a stretch,</v>

49
00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:57.220
but it was some time between June and July.

50
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.130
<v 5>Yeah, you could say that. So specifically,</v>

51
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.050
how would you know that the reasoning is we can, for example, um, this was the,

52
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.540
uh, this was the first surprise. Kind of a controversial idea,

53
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:10.270
but that basically goes like this. Jay says,

54
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.880
scientists have found some pollen in rocks,

55
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:16.750
which date from that time to different kinds of pollen and based on an analysis

56
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:18.160
of those two kinds of pollen,

57
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.250
<v 4>we know that the um,</v>

58
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.940
impact took place between the flowering of the Lotus and the flowering of the

59
00:03:23.941 --> 00:03:26.160
water and oh wow. Okay.

60
00:03:26.161 --> 00:03:29.160
So that's what Lotus you see flowering on the left gets a water,

61
00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:31.350
the leaf flowering on the right. You can see this.

62
00:03:31.351 --> 00:03:35.160
If you look at our video online fossils found at the impact site that had pollen

63
00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:38.280
from both of these flowers in the same rock,

64
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.730
which suggest that the impact did in fact take place somewhere between June and

65
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.380
July. It's one of those things in geometry, we,

66
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.420
we get a glimpse of a moment far, far back in time.

67
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.400
<v 5>So let's go deeper into that moment.</v>

68
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.913
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

69
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.440
<v 7>all right, everybody, let's collectively rewind our minds back in time.</v>

70
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.200
10 millions of years into the past 66 million years ago to be precise.

71
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.430
There they are majestic beasts

72
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.210
hanging out on the plains, eaten their Lotus leaves

73
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.640
sometime in June,

74
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.480
June 17th let's say,

75
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.550
and everything on this day

76
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.650
<v 4>pretty much normal.</v>

77
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.860
This particular fateful day was no different than any of millions and millions

78
00:04:42.871 --> 00:04:45.750
of previous days as far as the dinosaurs were concerned,

79
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.350
but if there were any astronomers at the time, which they weren't,

80
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.860
they might have had some inkling that something was coming because they looked

81
00:04:54.931 --> 00:04:56.490
up. They would have seen

82
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.690
<v 7>tiny little</v>

83
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.670
<v 4>dawn of lighten sky wars planets,</v>

84
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.010
the moon move with respect to the stars.

85
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:09.420
This would had a constant bearing and the old semen could tell you that if you

86
00:05:09.421 --> 00:05:13.290
see something constant bearing that's on a collision course with you

87
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.610
<v 8>and that thing of course is our asteroid zeroing in on the earth.</v>

88
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.970
I want to say that we do know quite a bit about this asteroid from the size of

89
00:05:22.981 --> 00:05:26.880
the creator and from the amount of certain minerals found at the impact site.

90
00:05:26.881 --> 00:05:31.881
We know that the asteroid was roughly six miles wide and then again roughly six

91
00:05:33.331 --> 00:05:33.931
miles long,

92
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:38.520
which makes it approximately the size of Manhattan island or our Mount Everest.

93
00:05:38.521 --> 00:05:41.400
It's roughly the size of Mount Everest. That is Doug Robertson,

94
00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:43.600
a geologist who knows quite a bit about this as to,

95
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.640
and by the way it has a name and that it's, it's the asteroids called Baptist

96
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.200
Stena Baptist steamer y that Stena Baptist in,

97
00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:56.160
I dunno the name asteroids on another subject.

98
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.160
We do know that the Earth's

99
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.510
<v 4>moon was probably produced by a collision with something the size of Mars.</v>

100
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.930
<v 9>Well, just do that in cause it's cool. Does it really relate to our story?</v>

101
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.660
<v 4>Don't have the whole evening here. Let's just stay to it. Okay.</v>

102
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.450
The dinosaurs are here on earth. They're eating their leaves. Meanwhile,

103
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:18.920
up in space are asteroid baptist. Dina is now hurtling towards the earth,

104
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:20.000
20,000 miles

105
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.801
<v 10>in our area.</v>

106
00:06:20.801 --> 00:06:25.600
Fast 20 times faster than a very fast way moment and scientists couldn't be sure

107
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.220
what would happen mathematically.

108
00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:31.210
I mean when in a Mount Everest sized bullet traveling at 20,000 miles an hour

109
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.810
gets our atmosphere. The atmosphere is really just a very,

110
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.210
very thin skin over the rest of the earth.

111
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.250
<v 9>So scientists thought, all right, if we're going to construct this story,</v>

112
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:44.090
let's just take it piece by piece and first figure out what would happen when

113
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:47.930
this big ball hurling through space slams into our atmosphere,

114
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.130
which is made of gas of course. So just to approximate,

115
00:06:51.131 --> 00:06:55.790
let's fire a bullet through some gas and watch what happens.

116
00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.510
<v 0>Now here we basically showed a super slow motion video of a gun firing a bullet</v>

117
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.390
underwater. You can see it on our website, radiolab.org it's very beautiful.

118
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.420
You see the bullet coming out and freeze it right there at the edge. Okay.

119
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.240
Basically what you see is this bullet steaming through the water.

120
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.961
And by the way,

121
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:15.920
we use water as an approximation for gas cause in gas you'd have the same effect

122
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:20.120
I'm about to describe creating a wake behind it and the week gets wider and

123
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:22.340
wider as it trails away from the bullet.

124
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:24.830
And if you imagine this shape in three dimensions,

125
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.190
really what you're looking at is a kind of a cone

126
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.600
<v 9>funnel shape in inside the the the,</v>

127
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.670
that the wallets of the funnel inside that cone is nothing,

128
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.860
nothing, nothing.

129
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.220
<v 4>Because it's in water. So you're saying there's, it's like a hole in the water.</v>

130
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.800
<v 9>That's what I'm saying. There's nothing in there.</v>

131
00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:47.420
It's a vacuum in there because the bullet is, is shooting through the water,

132
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.710
pushes the water out of the way and for a beat,

133
00:07:49.711 --> 00:07:52.350
the water doesn't have time to come back together and so all you have is

134
00:07:52.351 --> 00:07:54.270
emptiness in there. Right there. This,

135
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.950
what you're seeing is a massive hole in the water created by a tiny little

136
00:07:58.951 --> 00:07:59.784
bullet.

137
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.740
Now imagine that that bullet is six miles wide and the hole that it's making is

138
00:08:04.741 --> 00:08:06.390
right above your head. Well, what does that mean?

139
00:08:06.391 --> 00:08:08.400
If you're a dinosaur looking up, what would happen?

140
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.590
<v 4>Well if you were in the right place and this is going to be the wrong place in</v>

141
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.860
the secondary to, if you were in the right place to,

142
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:19.610
to look behind the asteroid as it came in,

143
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.600
you'd probably be able to see clearly through the space

144
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:28.700
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

145
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.710
<v 9>what does that mean?</v>

146
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.060
You would suddenly be looking at a nighttime hole in a daytime sky. Right?

147
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:36.693
Whoa.

148
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.170
<v 0>To be fair, Jay did tell us that a, you would need special kinds of</v>

149
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:46.390
<v 9>eyeballs to see this knight hole in a day sky and the dynast didn't have that.</v>

150
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:49.460
So science still,

151
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.050
I mean just imagine what a last image that would be to see day and night come

152
00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:55.440
together in the same moment.

153
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.110
<v 12>But according to Jay,</v>

154
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:03.140
you better not blink because before you could open your eyes again

155
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.060
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

156
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.900
<v 12>the asteroid would have hit the surface.</v>

157
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.110
And if you are in a position to see that,

158
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:17.880
then you're going to be in Gulf by the violence that is just about to occur.

159
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.331
And by the way,

160
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:21.870
the audience was just laughing at a dinos de Los Muertos graphic that just came

161
00:09:21.871 --> 00:09:25.590
on the screens. So we know it was a big explosion, fine, and it was violent.

162
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:26.250
Fine.

163
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.520
But I think we should be a little bit subtle about this because obviously if an

164
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.370
asteroid is the size of Manhattan and it lands on your head,

165
00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:36.360
you're not going to feel very good about that. But if Manhattan is,

166
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.910
is hitting the planet earth,

167
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.050
that's a little bit like a pebble hitting an enormous beach ball. Yeah.

168
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:44.060
And I can imagine that the,

169
00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:47.580
the little pebble size relativistically speaking the pebble would create some

170
00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:52.560
damage in the spot where it landed. But let's suppose that you are,

171
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:58.290
um, alleviating mother of three Hadrosaur living in New Zealand. Right?

172
00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:01.320
And you're just spinning at the moment that the asteroid comes in,

173
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.620
you're on your Antipolo going the other side of the planet.

174
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.840
Would you have any idea that this was happening?

175
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.760
That was the next question that we talked to Jay.

176
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:13.260
How much damage with this thing actually do? Well, we can do experiments.

177
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.230
<v 7>We can produce things,</v>

178
00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:24.190
situations like this in small quantities in the laboratories gay,

179
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.240
you all send it here, which brings us [inaudible]. We're good to hear.

180
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.880
You're good. To this guy, Peter Schultes,

181
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.670
and I like to do impact experiments.

182
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.280
Pete shields basically has every 13 year old's dream job.

183
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.140
He gets to blow shit up for a living.

184
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.890
Basically what B does is he works at this place that you're seeing right here on

185
00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:47.190
the screen. This is the NASA Ames laboratory in California,

186
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.430
and the thing that they're putting together, they're in the middle of frame.

187
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.120
That is a giant three story tall cannon.

188
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.960
What beat does is he takes projectiles. So for example,

189
00:10:57.961 --> 00:11:01.860
you're going to see him take a little glass bullet over there and he's going to

190
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.610
load it into the top of the Canon and then he's gonna fire it right into a

191
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.570
standup for planet earth, which for him will be a sand pit.

192
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.370
And lucky for us when we called Pete,

193
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.370
he was just about to pull the trigger on this thing. So you're,

194
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:19.260
we're calling you on a day in which you are trying to IX re-experience the day.

195
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.870
I actually, yeah, but I think we're gonna to survive. That's our plan.

196
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.880
We gated in. Okay, hold on. We're going to, we're going to assume the position.

197
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.860
Can we have to cross our fingers?

198
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.750
<v 13>Okay, here we go. Here we go. Here we go.</v>

199
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.480
Can we handle all? Am I ready? Like,

200
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.303
here we go.

201
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.080
Rolling.

202
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.493
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

203
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:54.070
<v 7>oh, that is gorgeous. Is Jeff? Oh</v>

204
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.250
<v 9>my gosh. Are they gonna as that? You'll get instant playback thing.</v>

205
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.860
Oh my gosh. That is the sound of a man.

206
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.110
Very happy with his explosion.

207
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.120
<v 8>You can see every piece of this, of what's happening.</v>

208
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.620
So based on experiments like this,

209
00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:15.670
people like p configure out precisely what happened when the asteroid hit the

210
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:16.210
earth.

211
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:20.110
They can quantify the explosions power by basically leveraging up experiments

212
00:12:20.111 --> 00:12:21.220
like this. So according to Doug,

213
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:25.300
the amount of energy that would have been on leash when that thing came rushing

214
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.193
in onto earth

215
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.000
<v 9>is roughly this.</v>

216
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.870
That would hit the earth with an explosion that's 100 million mega tons.

217
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.963
<v 2>[inaudible] okay,</v>

218
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:49.030
<v 9>Sarah Lipstick. Sara, our guitarist Kinda swung her guitar around,</v>

219
00:12:49.031 --> 00:12:53.260
had a mental moment. Don't look at her wrong or she'll do that to you. Okay.

220
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:55.660
So here's essentially how Doug broke that down for us.

221
00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.810
Two tons of tea and tea.

222
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:03.250
We're talking tons of your not mega tons to tons of t and t will essentially do

223
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.413
this.

224
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:08.743
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

225
00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.110
<v 0>On one of the three screens, you see a 10 story building imploding.</v>

226
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:17.220
Two tons of t and t will take down a building now 15,000 tons of TNT.

227
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:22.990
That is what the United States dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 on a second screen,

228
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.570
we see archival footage of the atomic bomb.

229
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:31.700
That chaos is 15,000 tons of TNT. Now these days, according to Doug Robertson,

230
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:36.730
a hydrogen bomb current hydrogen bombs are typically of the order of 1 million

231
00:13:38.391 --> 00:13:40.040
tons of TNT equivalent.

232
00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.660
Now 1 million tons of TNT equivalent. That's what we call a mega ton,

233
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.093
and if you remember,

234
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:51.520
Doug said that the asteroid impact was the equivalent of 100 million mega tons.

235
00:13:52.931 --> 00:13:56.090
So really what he's saying in concrete terms is that that impact was the

236
00:13:56.091 --> 00:14:01.091
equivalent of 100 million of those bombs going off all at once in the same spot,

237
00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.600
which is a lot.

238
00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.540
<v 9>That is true. That is true.</v>

239
00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.520
However it means it really depends on what you mean by a lot because I was doing

240
00:14:13.521 --> 00:14:18.440
a little googling and I was surprised to learn that a 110 million mega tons is

241
00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:22.070
not nearly enough to destroy the planet, to destroy the entire planet.

242
00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.110
You would need, you ready for this?

243
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.670
110 quadrillion mega tons of GT,

244
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.560
which is a 100 million times 110 million mega tens of t and. T.

245
00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:34.550
So going back to your head resource situation, mother of three in New Zealand,

246
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.370
if the thing came in anti portal to her,

247
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.280
maybe she would feel the ground shake a little bit,

248
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.250
but after a minute she'd be like whatever. And she'd go back to eating leaves.

249
00:14:43.251 --> 00:14:44.084
You probably wouldn't.

250
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:45.650
<v 8>Oh No, no, no.</v>

251
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:50.030
Cause that's not what we were taught in homeroom by Mrs [inaudible] or whoever

252
00:14:50.031 --> 00:14:54.530
your teacher was. Here's the classic explanation. There was an impact of course,

253
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.990
and it kicked up an enormous amount of dusty. You'll remember this.

254
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.930
The Dustin kind of covers the planet. It blankets the earth,

255
00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:03.680
makes the earth very cold, makes the earth very nasty. All the big plants die.

256
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.980
The little plants get sick, the dinosaurs get hungry, the dinosaurs get sick.

257
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.360
And then gradually, you know,

258
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:13.250
they get dead deader and deader and deader from different things. 10,000 years,

259
00:15:13.251 --> 00:15:15.200
30,000 years forward until you get like,

260
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.180
oh like 900,000 years later and you got a shivering,

261
00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:22.660
the last dinosaurs sitting there in the cold cold.

262
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.460
And that's the end. That's the story we were told in school

263
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.150
<v 9>is a long, slow wintery collapse. Yeah. No, no.</v>

264
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.250
Why we tell these good people that tired old story from Mrs. What does it Miss?

265
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.910
Some recruiters make. I made her Magruder tonight. Okay. Yeah.

266
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:43.640
Let us offer up a completely different Tabesh night and Scottish. All right,

267
00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:47.300
well we'll go with that. Let's actually flip the understanding completely.

268
00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:49.730
I think we should based on new science. So, all right,

269
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.020
here's what we're going to do. Keith.

270
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.650
Pull up that a ballistics video that we showed earlier with the red sand.

271
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:58.100
Can you sort of pull that up and blow it up to the three screens and then, yeah,

272
00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:58.963
rewind it back. If you

273
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:06.410
think you know back just a bit more. Okay,

274
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:07.940
so this is a 6,000 frame.

275
00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:11.270
A second video that you're seeing here is from Pete's lab.

276
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.660
At this point on the screen, all you're seeing is a pit of red sand.

277
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.720
Now what you see in the first few frames is you see the laser hitting right

278
00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:21.050
there, red sand flying in the air, super slow Mo.

279
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.050
And the next frame forward, right there you see some fire,

280
00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:27.440
you see a little bulb of fire erupt near the impact site,

281
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.940
right where the laser hits the sand.

282
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.910
There's this little clump of flame and we freeze on that spot.

283
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:36.050
Now scientists can now measure the temperatures in that spot right there.

284
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.940
Oh yeah. Right there. Okay. And just to state the obvious,

285
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:44.990
we know from those measurements that that spot right there would have gotten

286
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.400
very, very, very,

287
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.480
very, very hot.

288
00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:00.210
<v 14>No, we beyond the temperature of the sun, I mean, we're talking temperatures,</v>

289
00:17:00.211 --> 00:17:05.211
maybe 20,000 degrees will sun's temperatures about 5,000 degrees.

290
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.120
And if we're talking temperatures four times hotter than the sun,

291
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:14.520
<v 9>well anything that's that hot is going to instantly, instantly turn to gas</v>

292
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.860
<v 14>of very, very high temperature, high pressure gas.</v>

293
00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.800
It's actually rock vapor rock esteem.

294
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.100
So imagine this thing comes barreling in is astroid.

295
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.340
It doesn't just bounce off the earth. It clouds into the earth.

296
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.640
It goes into the surface. Two miles in, five miles in,

297
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.960
seven miles in 10 miles in 20 miles into the earth. It goes,

298
00:17:37.961 --> 00:17:42.700
all the rock that's plowing into is turning into a liquid and then into a gas

299
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.900
and now watch what happens next. Snacks.

300
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.170
<v 9>This is a basic physic experiment we're going to show you on the screen.</v>

301
00:17:48.171 --> 00:17:53.171
You see it's very lovely video actually of a hand dropping a metal ball into

302
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:57.330
some sand. This is just a dude dropping a ball and some sand.

303
00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.910
Watch this right here. Paul goes in

304
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.190
in like a millisecond after it makes impact, disappears into the sand.

305
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.000
A little spear of sand goes shooting back in the opposite direction.

306
00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:13.140
Sort of a bounce back effect. Does this always happen? This whatever this is,

307
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.760
it's like Newton's law of something.

308
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:15.863
<v 15>Yeah.</v>

309
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.870
<v 9>Newtons love sand hook. Say, yeah,</v>

310
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.220
but what you see is you see this fine plume of sand.

311
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.060
You're shooting back in the opposite direction as a sort of rebound right now.

312
00:18:26.061 --> 00:18:30.440
Imagine that that ball is an asteroid and that sand over there,

313
00:18:30.441 --> 00:18:33.140
that's the planet earth. So Keith, play that one more time.

314
00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.410
You play the video again, but this time as the ball drops,

315
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.020
it gradually morphs into an astroid. [inaudible]

316
00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.630
yes, thank you for the as well.

317
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.180
You would get the same effect. You would get the

318
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:55.630
<v 15>[inaudible].</v>

319
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.560
<v 9>The simple point is just something we do. You wonder how,</v>

320
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.080
where we get all of our sound design out of that man's mouth.

321
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:06.670
That's where you would get that same bounce back effective of fine plu shooting

322
00:19:06.671 --> 00:19:10.510
back in the opposite direction. But we know from what we just heard, uh, uh,

323
00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.990
Doug described that it would not be raw, it would not be sand.

324
00:19:13.991 --> 00:19:16.560
In this case it would be rocking gas. Yes,

325
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.210
<v 14>we'll move hot gas expands upward and pushes right on through the atmosphere,</v>

326
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.250
up into space. Some fraction,

327
00:19:23.251 --> 00:19:27.960
get the moon revealing some fraction of that hit Mars. Okay,

328
00:19:27.961 --> 00:19:31.110
so now you've got this sneeze of rock vapor. It's out in space.

329
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.830
Basic physics says that as it travels out farther away from the earth,

330
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.200
what's going to happen is it's going to start to cool down a bit.

331
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.540
And when he calls it recondensed as into little droplets that uh,

332
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.650
basically form class very quickly,

333
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.590
little droplets of glass about the size of sand.

334
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.760
Now if you look at one of these little droplets of glass under a microscope,

335
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.670
this is what it looks like right there on the screen.

336
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.510
You see what looks kind of like a translucent snowball that is actually an a

337
00:19:57.511 --> 00:20:01.110
magnified image of one of these bits of glass that fell from space that day.

338
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.190
Most of them didn't land on the ground. I'll talk about that in a second.

339
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.000
There it is. I don't know about you,

340
00:20:07.001 --> 00:20:10.750
but I find that totally terrifying cause that's,

341
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:14.200
it looks like a little Baptist Dino, right? Tiny molest joy,

342
00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.830
except now imagine trillions of these things in a cloud,

343
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:21.880
in the cloud of shrapnel going out away from the earth.

344
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.200
And what's going to happen next is that it's going to start to lose the momentum

345
00:20:26.201 --> 00:20:29.710
that cloud, when it does the earth's gravity is going to grab back,

346
00:20:29.711 --> 00:20:33.970
hold of it and say, come on back. And 90% of them come back to the earth.

347
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:40.500
<v 8>What does falling glass do? Harm. Yes. Because what happens is that the,</v>

348
00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:45.501
the glass out in space starts to spread out like north and south and east and

349
00:20:45.541 --> 00:20:48.220
west and eventually it will appear

350
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.970
<v 9>in the sky over New Zealand. It's now a global phenomenon. And you know,</v>

351
00:20:51.971 --> 00:20:55.000
it's really hard to imagine what the hairdresser would have seen.

352
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.330
But the thing to keep in mind is that these things, as they're coming in,

353
00:20:58.331 --> 00:21:02.620
these bits of glass, uh, 90 some odd percent are burning up in the atmosphere.

354
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.040
So very few of them are hitting the ground. So from her point of view,

355
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:11.490
probably would have looked like the greatest media shower any one has ever seen

356
00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:18.150
with one significant bummer, which is this,

357
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.920
when these little bits of glass come in,

358
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:24.210
each one that burns up is the positing a little bit of heat into the sky.

359
00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:28.770
And collectively there's such a massive rain of these things coming in.

360
00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.050
<v 4>Well, the heat would build up, the sky would turn red.</v>

361
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:36.443
<v 2>Okay.</v>

362
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.280
<v 4>Yeah. Would it be getting hotter and hotter?</v>

363
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:42.580
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

364
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:47.440
<v 9>and at a certain point Jay wondered, well how hard exactly would it have gotten?</v>

365
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:52.420
Like how much heat exactly would have built up there in the sky and then started

366
00:21:52.421 --> 00:21:53.530
to radiate down.

367
00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:59.440
<v 4>Um, we, uh, calculated the amount of heat that would come down. We, uh,</v>

368
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.850
number 10 kilowatts per square meter and yeah. Okay, well we get this number.

369
00:22:03.851 --> 00:22:07.760
Well, what, what does that mean? Well, I went home and I, um,

370
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.880
hooked up a, a, a, uh,

371
00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:14.830
current meter and pride to measure the amount of heat produced in my oven for

372
00:22:14.831 --> 00:22:16.030
different amounts of power.

373
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:21.630
And I could get about seven kilowatts per square meter in my oven on Broil and,

374
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:27.540
<v 9>oh, like 500 degrees broil you mean? But that wasn't quite enough.</v>

375
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:32.070
Not nearly. So Jay started measuring other kinds of ovens.

376
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.440
<v 4>Finally found out that the heat would be in fact, like being in a pizza oven,</v>

377
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.900
a pizza oven is about right.

378
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:44.110
<v 9>Which means that if you were addressed real dinosaur anywhere above the ground</v>

379
00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.920
on the earth on that day, you would have experienced some heat.

380
00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.380
It is almost unimaginable.

381
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.390
Maybe it started at a hundred degrees because it was June with summer,

382
00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.020
but within minutes it would've been 300 degrees,

383
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:05.170
500 degrees, 700 degrees,

384
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.230
900 degrees.

385
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.310
Estimates are on that day.

386
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.030
Temperatures topped out at something like 1200 degrees

387
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:21.310
at that temperature. Nothing can protect you, your scales,

388
00:23:21.311 --> 00:23:23.050
your for whatever you got,

389
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:27.910
it's not going to do any good at your blood will literally start to boil inside

390
00:23:27.911 --> 00:23:30.550
your body and you will die.

391
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:50.743
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

392
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.060
[inaudible], [inaudible]

393
00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.670
<v 9>so essentially according to this theory,</v>

394
00:24:05.671 --> 00:24:09.270
the dinosaurs and everything else on earth that day would have been incinerated.

395
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.470
Doug thinks that's what the demand, not so much the impact,

396
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:18.000
but all that objective that went up into the sky came down as glass rain and

397
00:24:18.001 --> 00:24:18.834
created that heat.

398
00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:23.840
That's what did the men and he would argue it didn't just do some of the men or

399
00:24:24.151 --> 00:24:29.130
even many of the men. He would say it did all of them in all at once.

400
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:32.640
There is zero evidence that any dinosaur made it through.

401
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.970
And the crazy part of this theory is that j and Doug thinks that the whole

402
00:24:35.971 --> 00:24:40.320
process from the impact of the glass rain to the incineration of all of these

403
00:24:40.321 --> 00:24:43.290
species on the planet, it would have taken a few hours.

404
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:51.730
His best guess, he thinks maybe two hours.

405
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.400
I mean, that's less time than a a business lunch. Yeah.

406
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.520
You try getting east northwest,

407
00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:06.290
anywhere on Mercer Street at rush hour in two hearts and do that.

408
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:07.640
I mean, if you think about it,

409
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.680
that is less time than you will spend in this theater tonight.

410
00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.493
<v 6>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

411
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:51.490
<v 17>that means that you're saying that an animal that had been supreme</v>

412
00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.273
[inaudible]

413
00:25:55.730 --> 00:26:00.590
disappears in a few hours completely. Yes.

414
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:05.300
Yup. That's what the evidence suggests. That's right.

415
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:10.203
<v 16>[inaudible]</v>

416
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:16.210
<v 17>well, you can consider the evidence, but also you could consider common sense.</v>

417
00:26:16.211 --> 00:26:20.350
I mean, we've got a world filled with terrestrial dinosaurs.

418
00:26:20.351 --> 00:26:22.990
They were on every continent. They were even in Antarctica.

419
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:28.630
And to say that they all disappeared in two hours, I mean,

420
00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.750
all that would,

421
00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:34.030
that suggests that there's none of them in out of harm's way.

422
00:26:34.031 --> 00:26:38.200
None of them in a cave somewhere. None of them in the grotto, none of them in a,

423
00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:43.300
in a protected forest of any kind of it, the word all in that connection,

424
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.490
it's just too

425
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.460
<v 9>much. I just don't buy it. But yeah,</v>

426
00:26:47.461 --> 00:26:52.461
I mean the truth is that the science is never going to be so exact as to say,

427
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.410
yeah, all of them disappeared or it happened on a single day or on an afternoon.

428
00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.550
Now, no tool that we have is that precise,

429
00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.990
but what Jay is saying is that it happened fast, very fast.

430
00:27:03.991 --> 00:27:04.920
Nothing made it through.

431
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:10.770
What I find interesting is that ultimately you don't need the ballistics or

432
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.281
anything.

433
00:27:11.281 --> 00:27:15.660
We've shown you so far to know that something major and sudden happened because

434
00:27:15.661 --> 00:27:19.410
you can see evidence of it literally etched into the earth.

435
00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:26.160
Here's the thought where we first found within the boundary,

436
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.620
you can see it really well out in Colorado actually.

437
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.120
We sent one of our producers,

438
00:27:30.121 --> 00:27:33.630
Molly Webster out there to meet a paleontologist named Kirk Johnson.

439
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.560
They hiked over a couple of hills. They found this one specific spot,

440
00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:41.970
Mike ready for dinosaur to come around the corner and then the minute they

441
00:27:41.971 --> 00:27:42.804
started to dig,

442
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:52.620
<v 2>taking down like a foot from where we were.</v>

443
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:57.430
<v 9>Turns out for every three feet you get down 10,000 years in time. See,</v>

444
00:27:57.431 --> 00:27:58.660
the earth has layers,

445
00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.110
kind of like a tree has rings and every three feet down you go.

446
00:28:02.111 --> 00:28:06.970
You're going back in time about 10,000 years and when you go all the way down,

447
00:28:06.971 --> 00:28:10.810
all the way back to 66.0 9 million years,

448
00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.860
you will find this one little skinny strip of rock.

449
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.613
<v 2>Okay?</v>

450
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.590
<v 9>That's the kiddie boundary.</v>

451
00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.690
This one skinny gray line, this, this gray, crappy.

452
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.380
No, in a very real way,

453
00:28:32.381 --> 00:28:37.381
that line that you're seeing that represents the day the asteroid hit the day

454
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.870
just above that line. That's a little bit after the day.

455
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.240
Just below that line is a little bit before today.

456
00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:47.290
The line is called the KT boundary and what's cool is you can actually touch it.

457
00:28:47.291 --> 00:28:51.490
You can touch evidence of that moment. And in fact, Kirk,

458
00:28:51.491 --> 00:28:54.490
what he did that day was he took his finger and he dug a piece out and he handed

459
00:28:54.491 --> 00:28:55.324
it to Molly.

460
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.460
<v 18>We're hold, I'm holding. You're holding the shaky dad.</v>

461
00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.690
It's like a, it's almost like chunks of coal. Yeah,

462
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.960
but it's not what you're holding dark

463
00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.240
<v 9>gray mudstone the carbon rich bud stone.</v>

464
00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.520
And in that mudstone you'll find all kinds of things.

465
00:29:10.521 --> 00:29:15.521
I mean you'll find very rare minerals like iridium that probably came in on the

466
00:29:15.981 --> 00:29:17.900
asteroid and got smushed into that line.

467
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:22.280
Those little glass balls I was talking about. There's a little hell balls. Well,

468
00:29:22.281 --> 00:29:24.770
if you get out a microscope and you look at that rock,

469
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:26.630
you will see them in there.

470
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:32.960
We put up a funny cartoon of the Little Hel balls. They're all in that line.

471
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:34.430
How thick do you think that line is?

472
00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:37.700
What's about an inch is like hitting in there.

473
00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.010
It's sort of the story of that day. Absolutely. And here's the thing, if this

474
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.260
<v 12>is the line right here, this little strip here,</v>

475
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.960
Robert traces a picture of the KT boundary with his finger.

476
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:51.070
And then you dig just below the line you were going to find over and over again.

477
00:29:51.071 --> 00:29:53.650
Dinosaurs everywhere. I mean, not going to be alive. Of course,

478
00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.980
he starts putting some toy dinosaurs onto the line and making them move,

479
00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:00.650
but giving them a certain amount of energy, which I shouldn't, but they,

480
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:01.803
they're fossils.

481
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:07.020
And you will find dinosaur fossils from Europe and Idaho and Montana.

482
00:30:07.511 --> 00:30:10.030
This one says it was made in China,

483
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.780
but if you just got above the line, you don't find any dinosaur.

484
00:30:14.781 --> 00:30:15.700
So below the line,

485
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:20.970
scientists have looked everywhere above the line and they haven't. Well,

486
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.080
everywhere they have looked anyway, they found nothing, nothing,

487
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.660
nothing.

488
00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.470
<v 19>It's a different world. That's the amazing thing. It's a different world.</v>

489
00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.180
And as you're pretty ready to go, this is one world, and that's another world.

490
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.870
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

491
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:41.620
<v 12>so you're literally just pointing, Pinky to point. Your fingers spread. Yeah.</v>

492
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.793
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

493
00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:48.030
<v 19>this is another moment where I would urge you at some point, not now,</v>

494
00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.680
keep listening, but at some point,

495
00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:53.850
watch the video of this performance because what Sarah, Darren, Glen,

496
00:30:53.851 --> 00:30:57.360
and Keith do in this moment, this really, it's pretty amazing.

511
00:34:14.261 --> 00:34:17.470
I just want to give it a very special thanks to the people who shared the stage

512
00:34:17.471 --> 00:34:19.300
with us. Sarah lip state from Novella.

513

Darren grey on the base and Glen Coaching on the drums.

514
00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.770
They're both from the band on Fillmore.

515
00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:27.620
We were so lucky to share the stage with those guys along with um,

516
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:32.680
a video maestro key scratch who was doing the live video. Brilliant.

517
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:38.140
Puppeteer, Myron Guso. Oh my God. That guy. So good. Check out all of them

519
00:34:42.390 --> 00:34:45.030
visually it's pretty, it's pretty worth watching. Anyhow,

520
00:34:45.031 --> 00:34:45.864
we'll be back in a second.

<v 9>Hey, I'm jab and Ron. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.</v>

541
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:20.100
We're continuing with our live performance of apocalyptical from the paramount

542
00:36:20.101 --> 00:36:22.080
Peter in Seattle, Washington.

543
00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.960
And we just heard a new theory about the end of the dinosaurs,

544
00:36:24.961 --> 00:36:29.580
a very sudden fast, dramatic end with a sudden musical at the very,

545
00:36:29.581 --> 00:36:33.810
very end. Now for the next question, this is sort of the obvious next question,

546
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.070
uh,

547
00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:40.070
which is what made it through and how well we did ask scientists that question

548
00:36:41.251 --> 00:36:43.350
and here is what they told us.

549
00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.670
<v 17>[inaudible] if on that day you were a creature in the ocean and you happened to</v>

550
00:36:51.671 --> 00:36:54.530
be within 300 feet of the water surface of you,

551
00:36:54.531 --> 00:36:56.860
imagine this room filled with ocean water.

552
00:36:56.861 --> 00:37:00.580
We're talking about you guys up in the balcony up there.

553
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:04.840
People not surprised you to learn. You don't do very well.

554
00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:10.600
There's a certain amount of heat and mostly there's acid rain pouring in.

555
00:37:10.601 --> 00:37:12.730
So a lot of you will die.

556
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.620
Look down with the higher paying seats if you're below 300 feet.

557
00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:21.970
And this always happens to people would, you know, with the better anyway,

558
00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:27.720
you do find and on land it turns out plain ordinary dirt is a very good

559
00:37:30.041 --> 00:37:35.020
insulator. If you've got 1200 degrees on the surface, then about um,

560
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:39.260
three or four inches down, you'd be comfortable there for several hours. Oh,

561
00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:41.890
just a couple inches. You only need a few inches.

562
00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:45.280
So that means you can be a little warm, and if you squiggled down, you're okay.

563
00:37:45.281 --> 00:37:47.830
You could be a beetle squiggling down, you're okay.

564
00:37:47.831 --> 00:37:51.370
You could be a dinosaur tending to an underground nest.

565
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:55.510
And if the nest isn't far enough below the ground,

566
00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.170
and a lot of them were, then the babies that hatch will have babies that hatch.

567
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.770
We'll have babies than hatch. We will call their babies and years later, birds.

568
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.410
And if you're an early version of a crocodile,

569
00:38:05.411 --> 00:38:07.360
you bury yourself deep enough into the mud.

570
00:38:07.361 --> 00:38:10.000
You also get through as do the plant's roots.

571
00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.720
A lot gets through actions usually.

572
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.960
<v 9>And that actually brings us to a,</v>

573
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.040
what I find to be one of the coolest parts of the story.

574
00:38:17.041 --> 00:38:20.310
This is the part that involves all of us in this room.

575
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.570
So it turns out on that day as the fire was raging above on the surface,

576
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:29.700
somewhere in a little hole in the ground happened to be a furry little animal.

577
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:35.410
It has the distinction of being the great, great, great,

578
00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.680
great,

579
00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:41.350
<v 12>great, great, great, great, great, great, great,</v>

580
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:46.240
great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,

581
00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:50.480
great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,

582
00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:55.740
great, great, great, great, great, great, great,

583
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:57.940
great, great, great.

584
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:03.460
<v 2>It's Cetera. Grandma of everybody in this room. It is true.</v>

585
00:39:03.461 --> 00:39:05.560
There was a creature down there. Um,

586
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.820
there was a creature down there.

587
00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:13.720
I thought we should stop there because we were getting away with something and I

588
00:39:13.721 --> 00:39:17.070
didn't want to push it too far. All of a sudden it was just Uli. Yeah.

589
00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.540
Though there is a creature down there,

590
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:23.110
<v 0>uh, in a, in a little hole. And when the dinosaurs got cleared away,</v>

591
00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:25.600
this creature could step out of her hole. She could step out of her niche.

592
00:39:25.601 --> 00:39:27.700
She had more food, more places to roam.

593
00:39:27.701 --> 00:39:30.280
She could populate the planet ushering in the age of mammals.

594
00:39:30.281 --> 00:39:31.770
And now here we all are in Seattle.

595
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:37.920
<v 2>Oh, don't flatter yourself. It's not a straight line. It's a weekly lie.</v>

596
00:39:37.921 --> 00:39:38.754
I do weekly.

597
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.113
<v 0>Here's the problem.</v>

598
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.900
We've never known anything about this animal that gave rise to all of us.

599
00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.810
We've never known what you look like. We've never known, uh,

600
00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.790
you know how she spent her days.

601
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:51.940
We never known anything because we've had no fossils of her.

602
00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:54.820
But recently actually,

603
00:39:54.821 --> 00:39:57.610
literally as we were reporting this story right in the middle of our reporting,

604
00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:03.220
uh, a team of scientists led by a woman named Maureen O'Leary who is herself a

605
00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:05.230
mammo. She took, uh,

606
00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:08.920
fossils that we do have fossils of this creatures descendants and then using

607
00:40:08.921 --> 00:40:12.520
fancy algorithms was able to cross reference the traits to work our way back for

608
00:40:12.521 --> 00:40:17.260
the first time to a composite picture of what we think our great great-grandma

609
00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:20.500
look like. So now Seattle, a Radiolab exclusive.

610
00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:25.350
<v 21>We present you our great, great, great,</v>

611
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.590
great set her up grandma

612
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:35.150
<v 19>here. A giant rodent costume thing runs out onto the stage. All right,</v>

613
00:40:35.151 --> 00:40:38.630
well this is what she looks like and we got to point out certain anatomical

614
00:40:38.631 --> 00:40:42.590
features that caught the scientists admiration. First of all, she has very,

615
00:40:42.591 --> 00:40:44.370
very pink and fleshy ears.

616
00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:48.320
So show them bath and a pale soft underbelly English of all.

617
00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.360
It's very nice for as Gad is now demonstrating,

618
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:53.840
could you show them your profile just so they can see your head?

619
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.580
First skull is considered either rat flight or a crocodilian.

620
00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:01.160
You can go either way, but she does that enormous BB black eyes.

621
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:04.850
No fleshy pink nose. And would you show them your teeth?

622
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:07.520
She's kind of proud of her teeth because they can tear flesh,

623
00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.910
they can rip medicine. She is an omnivore.

624
00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:12.780
<v 0>However, here was the issue.</v>

625
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:17.030
You was the issue that we ran into when we asked Maureen and the scientist who

626
00:41:17.031 --> 00:41:19.730
did this work. We were like, okay, now we've got an image of this creature.

627
00:41:19.731 --> 00:41:23.960
That's amazing. What do we call her?

628
00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:29.210
What is her name? This was Maureen's response.

629
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:33.140
Its official name is the hypothetical placental mammal

630
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.660
<v 22>look kind of a name was back suddenly feeling bad for this little creature.</v>

631
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:42.920
Well it's not something that we thought of as we were sort of busily working on

632
00:41:42.921 --> 00:41:43.440
the paper,

633
00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.700
<v 17>but then a funny thing happened.</v>

634
00:41:44.701 --> 00:41:47.010
Our producer Molly was talking to marina and she was saying,

635
00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:52.320
<v 7>Jesus is such an awful name and marine system. Molly. Well,</v>

636
00:41:52.321 --> 00:41:56.880
you can name it. And Molly says to Marie, wait, are you serious in Maureen,

637
00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:01.500
sister Molly? I don't know. Are you serious?

638
00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.073
<v 22>So</v>

639
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:08.240
<v 0>we're like, hell yeah, we're serious. Let's crowd sources, right?</v>

640
00:42:08.241 --> 00:42:10.700
This is what mammals do these days. We crowd source. I mean,

641
00:42:10.701 --> 00:42:14.750
think of this opportunity. A little radio show gets the name,

642
00:42:14.751 --> 00:42:18.680
the ancestor of us all. So we've put out the call to the Internet.

643
00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.320
We've got the thousand submissions in response.

644
00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:26.300
Great names like we'll send door first,

645
00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:29.420
first surs de Nova,

646
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:35.960
and after eight rounds of voting, the winning name was, wait for it.

647
00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:37.530
Wait

648
00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:39.910
<v 2>for it, wait for it</v>

649
00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:46.990
<v 7>on the screen. You see the following letters appear one after another, s, c, h,</v>

650
00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:51.910
r, e, w, d, I, N, g, e, r,

651
00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.253
<v 2>shooting her,</v>

652
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:01.623
shooting her.

653
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:07.880
<v 22>I can't even tell you what a crisis was for the staff.</v>

654
00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:10.640
It's just such a bad day.

655
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:17.890
<v 7>And the whole experience made us wonder, should we have died in that asteroid?</v>

656
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:22.090
Do we deserve to be here?

657
00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:25.950
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

658
00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:29.970
<v 17>so if you're asking yourself, what is the moral of our story,</v>

659
00:43:29.971 --> 00:43:30.804
here's what we've shown you.

660
00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:34.500
But we have a big mighty species that die and then a smaller species,

661
00:43:34.501 --> 00:43:36.750
which is you and I, we take it's place.

662
00:43:36.751 --> 00:43:40.620
So you've gotten death and you've gotten resurrection and you got it maybe in a

663
00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:41.970
single afternoon. So that's the argument we're making here.

664
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.030
This is Jay Molossia's argument that it was boom.

665
00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:51.480
<v 0>I mean it is the suddenness of of the whole Bover that is kind of unimaginable.</v>

666
00:43:52.781 --> 00:43:53.441
I mean like I'm in,

667
00:43:53.441 --> 00:43:58.090
there you are one day you have evolved over millions of years to be this long

668
00:43:58.091 --> 00:43:59.400
neck, beautiful creatures,

669
00:43:59.401 --> 00:44:04.401
70 feet from your nose to your ass and then our tail and then in an afternoon,

670
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:10.750
like on one Tuesday afternoon, suddenly you, everyone you knew gone.

671
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:15.200
<v 17>But there are other ways to think about this. The extinction yes was sudden,</v>

672
00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:19.220
but in the grand sweep of time, it wasn't really an,

673
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:22.850
and it was just a moment in a stream of endless change.

674
00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:27.200
Cause everything we see around us, the tallest mountains, the size of oceans,

675
00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.170
the animals about us that seem so different from ourselves.

676
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.050
Every category that we have in our heads that seems so permanent,

677
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.800
blurs given enough time,

678
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:40.800
mountains erode and become a hills, that peaches,

679
00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:46.230
animals changing any kind of all kinds of ways. The only thing that's constant,

680
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:50.550
it's always is changed. You like to think of ourselves.

681
00:44:50.551 --> 00:44:55.551
We humans just somehow inevitable or crucial pivotal that the past was a time

682
00:44:55.981 --> 00:44:58.470
and we were missing in the future. We'll always have us in it,

683
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:02.430
but that's an illusion. Since this great science writer, Lauren Isley,

684
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.930
we are rag dolls made out of many ages and skins. He says,

685
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:12.300
changelings who slept in witness or still the uncouth guys of waddling

686
00:45:12.301 --> 00:45:17.190
amphibians. We've played such roles for infinitely longer ages than we had been.

687
00:45:17.191 --> 00:45:19.800
Men. All right, entity is it dream

688
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.370
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

689
00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:24.470
<v 12>we are process not reality.</v>

690
00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:29.420
What we call realities as Isley is an illusion of the day light,

691
00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:33.170
the light of our own particular day.

692
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:41.343
<v 23>[inaudible]</v>

693
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:46.520
<v 19>just a couple of notes before we go on. Uh,</v>

694
00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:50.340
that whole dinosaur thing about the sudden fast end. That is just a theory.

695
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.700
A verdict is obviously still out. In fact,

696
00:45:53.701 --> 00:45:58.701
in 2011 a team of scientists published a paper saying that maybe the asteroid

697
00:45:59.131 --> 00:46:02.610
that hit the earth created that devastation was not that distinct,

698
00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.220
but another asteroid with a different name,

699
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.760
but with the same size and dimensions and all that. So who knows. Also,

700
00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:11.330
when I said to the people up in the balcony, if you were in the balcony,

701
00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:13.710
you might've been killed off by heat.

702
00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:16.260
I think that turns out to be a little bit wrong.

703
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:20.570
If you've been in the shallow ocean of the day, he would have been acid rated.

704
00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:23.730
Some other factors would have been not so much heat.

705
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:29.430
<v 9>Okay, so this is the part of the show coming up where we, uh, we, we,</v>

706
00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.140
we traveled with a bunch of different comedians. Patton, Oswald, Simon Amstel,

707
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:37.280
Ophir Eisenberg, Kurt Braunohler, actually Kurt open this particular show.

708
00:46:37.281 --> 00:46:42.200
You can see his full set at radiolab.org/live super funny.

709
00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.120
But on this night we had two comedians.

710
00:46:44.121 --> 00:46:47.870
And so right at this spot in the middle of the show, out walks a guy,

711
00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:51.140
one of the most talented mammals he looks like.

712
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:53.990
Actually it's like someone with his finger in an electric socket.

713
00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:57.410
Huge amounts of here that are standing like, ouch. You know,

714
00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.540
like he's got a halo. His name

715
00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:07.240
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

716
00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.500
<v 24>We're just going to play his whole set.</v>

717
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:13.360
It's a little Seattle specific and spots, but it's just, well, hello.

718
00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:15.453
Hello,

719
00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:20.860
<v 25>hello, hello.</v>

720
00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:26.020
What I get done. And then

721
00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:40.630
[inaudible] [inaudible] the month. Duh Duh. When a swell

722
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:49.150
[inaudible] flush. You can see the, I could eat a more

723
00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:52.553
warm Rashida.

724
00:47:57.590 --> 00:47:58.040
[inaudible]. [inaudible]

725
00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.220
<v 2>Yep, Yep, Yep.</v>

726
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:01.340
<v 25>Zoo my room.</v>

727
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.823
<v 2>Okay.</v>

728
00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:07.530
<v 25>Wow. Microsoft</v>

729
00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:15.060
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

730
00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:19.350
<v 25>thank you. Um, this is a,</v>

731
00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:23.940
this is a moment that you have to take, uh, if you can,

732
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:29.790
uh, and if you can't, uh, you know, then you've lost it. But,

733
00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:34.860
um, once you have it, once you possess the moment, um,

734
00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.800
you can do so many things with it. Um,

735
00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:41.790
a lot of people tend to just exist within it. Um,

736
00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:46.530
others pawn it off to moment brokers. Um, uh,

737
00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:50.850
or if you're a big fan fan of moment. Shawn's, uh, um, you, um,

738
00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:55.920
I can do that. Uh, also the moment, a moment, glory blend of coffee,

739
00:48:55.921 --> 00:48:58.230
single origin from Argentina is excellent.

740
00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:02.610
You can get that at most Bauhaus or participating in Stumptown coffee roasters.

741
00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.520
Um, so definitely check that out.

742
00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:11.220
I'm really stoked that we finally closed down that awful Bauhaus. Um,

743
00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:15.240
coffee and books. It was just what a terrible location, right.

744
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:21.580
You know, right on a like a corner where you can see it really visibly. And, um,

745
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:26.760
I don't like that. Um, and, and I called the,

746
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:31.670
the city, the city comptroller and I just said, we need to get rid of it. Um,

747
00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:34.270
and we need to get as many,

748
00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.550
many buildings cause there's a lot of those buildings are so old up on Capitol

749
00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:41.760
Hill, it's just, it gets, it gets old. Um,

750
00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:45.740
and so I'd like to replace them with new constructions, um,

751
00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:48.720
mostly glass and contemporary metal. Um,

752
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:53.520
and I want to be able to see the architect's idea and then see them have to

753
00:49:53.521 --> 00:49:55.350
shave off about 40% of that idea.

754
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:56.263
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

755
00:49:57.490 --> 00:50:00.970
<v 25>By replacing a lot of the materials with cheaper versions of the original</v>

756
00:50:00.971 --> 00:50:02.040
design. Um,

757
00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:06.070
I enjoy seeing that and I would rather see that than in a coffee shop that

758
00:50:06.071 --> 00:50:08.700
promotes, um, a type of a communal, uh,

759
00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:13.060
living that can only happen in an area that it is located in. I just prefer it.

760
00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:19.880
<v 2>That's what I prefer. That's just me.</v>

761
00:50:19.881 --> 00:50:20.714
Sorry guys.

762
00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:26.970
<v 25>That new building. Okay. Maria. My, my,</v>

763
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:33.140
um, okay. So, um, obviously as you know, uh, Seattle is, is,

764
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:35.620
uh, is becoming their Cooper. And the thing is,

765
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:36.583
<v 2>it's like</v>

766
00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:40.760
<v 25>I'm going to do a song, um, that is about that.</v>

767
00:50:40.761 --> 00:50:44.630
So you guys can get a little bit more used to the, the Vancouver Culture, um,

768
00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:46.130
that is spreading down

769
00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.780
<v 2>Canada, Canada.</v>

770
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:54.880
<v 25>Um, little, uh, uh, Mr. Rogers reference, but, um,</v>

771
00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:57.400
Canada is Atlanta may believe.

772
00:50:58.420 --> 00:50:59.253
<v 2>Okay,</v>

773
00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.153
here we go.

774
00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:09.133
Okay.

775
00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:15.930
<v 25>Okay. Here we go. Any big fans of anybody born after 1990.</v>

776
00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:21.730
Okay. That's about the tonality you would expect.

777
00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.013
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

778
00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:31.300
<v 25>why is it always higher? I don't understand that. Um, okay.</v>

779
00:51:31.301 --> 00:51:36.040
Anyways, um, so you're gonna know this reference. This is a from the old, uh,

780
00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:40.990
Buck Rogers, uh, series, uh, Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, g, Buck, you know,

781
00:51:40.991 --> 00:51:41.800
that kind of stuff.

782
00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:46.030
So that's where you guys after 1998 so you guys can relate to what I'm doing on

783
00:51:46.031 --> 00:51:46.864
stage. And so,

784
00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:48.613
<v 2>um,</v>

785
00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:54.000
<v 25>I hope you like this. This is, this is definitely, definitely a song.</v>

786
00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.113
<v 2>Okay.</v>

787
00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:32.493
[inaudible] [inaudible]

788
00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:10.623
[inaudible] [inaudible]

789
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:22.930
[inaudible] a good moment.

790
00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:33.420
[inaudible]

791
00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:34.253
<v 26>my own food.</v>

792
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:39.623
[inaudible] who is

793
00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:45.933
[inaudible]

794
00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:51.853
<v 2>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

795
00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.030
[inaudible] [inaudible] thank you very much.

796
00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:18.670
<v 25>Um, if you're, if you're down, um, at a, in, in,</v>

797
00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:22.840
in Ballard and having a good time, um, it's,

798
00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:26.290
it's because there's so much Scandinavian energy there that,

799
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:27.623
<v 2>uh,</v>

800
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:30.620
<v 25>they just do, they just do it. Right.</v>

801
00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.113
<v 2>Um,</v>

802
00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:34.900
<v 25>so when you hit the sunset tavern and you're like,</v>

803
00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:37.330
why isn't this turned into a glass tower?

804
00:54:37.331 --> 00:54:40.180
It's because the power of Norway,

805
00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:46.670
this is Norway. They're going to screw with that. You know what I mean?

806
00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:51.350
Like Norway at all? No, what I'm saying,

807
00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:55.160
there's no way out of this. I mean, you're basically, you know what I'm saying?

808
00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:59.150
It's like a hot dog. You know, you think you want it and you're like, ah,

809
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:01.310
probably not. But,

810
00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:12.180
um, and I'm pretty stoked I've said this before, but I,

811
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:16.220
I'm going to say it again just because we're in Seattle. I am pretty stoked, um,

812
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:20.660
about, uh, uh, Vivace um,

813
00:55:21.050 --> 00:55:25.910
being replaced by a Starbucks. I just think that it makes sense. It makes sense.

814
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:30.380
Let the people who do it really well do it better. You know what I'm saying?

815
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:31.700
That's what I'm saying.

816
00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:35.000
So this song is going to be one of those songs where you're going to think to

817
00:55:35.001 --> 00:55:39.710
yourself, is this better than the original? Maybe. Okay.

818
00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:40.923
<v 2>Alright.</v>

819
00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:49.490
<v 25>It's called pastiche in lieu of originality. Here we go.</v>

820
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:53.833
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

821
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:24.753
[inaudible] [inaudible]

822
00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:31.990
<v 26>don't want us to use real parents in the ones that come from, they miss them.</v>

823
00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:35.070
She didn't follow.

824
00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:38.903
<v 2>Okay,</v>

825
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:41.800
<v 26>Whoa, Whoa, whoa.</v>

826
00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:44.840
We need to know a logo. No

827
00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:49.630
logo characters. [inaudible]

828
00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:51.550
<v 2>yeah.</v>

829
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:56.330
<v 26>Yay You.</v>

830
00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:58.003
<v 25>The thing is,</v>

831
00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:01.080
<v 2>a good thing is</v>

832
00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:05.093
I think

833
00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:10.520
<v 25>using, using, using logic. Um, I think,</v>

834
00:57:10.521 --> 00:57:15.140
you know, obviously it is smart to name a company after a,

835
00:57:15.141 --> 00:57:17.210
a character from Battlestar Galactica, but I just,

836
00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:19.700
<v 2>it makes sense</v>

837
00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:24.270
<v 25>and that's why I'm starting my own coffee business called cylons.</v>

838
00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:28.800
<v 2>Cylons coffee is the best coffee.</v>

839
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:37.150
<v 25>I have a new movie coming out called silence of the lambs and,</v>

840
00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:38.763
<v 2>um,</v>

841
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:43.340
<v 25>it's a theme song. It's done by Garfunkel and Oates. Of course.</v>

842
00:57:43.341 --> 00:57:48.341
You can probably guess what that song is called a the sound of silence and,

843
00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:50.093
um,

844
00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:55.160
<v 2>which is just [inaudible]. Mm hmm.</v>

845
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:58.870
<v 25>And sometimes</v>

846
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:03.363
and sometimes,

847
00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:05.693
<v 11>yeah,</v>

848
00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.920
<v 25>it's the sound of silence. Okay. So,</v>

849
00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:14.510
<v 2>um, this song, thank you for my next trip.</v>

850
00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:22.050
<v 25>No, it's been a pleasure. This is my last, uh, Radicchio lab and I am</v>

851
00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:27.170
and I'll say no, in all seriousness. That's a totally different show,

852
00:58:27.171 --> 00:58:31.640
but I'm radio lab. Um, it's been awesome, man. I mean, uh,

853
00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:35.760
I discovered some really great friends the first time I did something, um,

854
00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:40.780
for radio lab and I continue to find great friendships and a love and passion

855
00:58:41.721 --> 00:58:44.600
for sound and um,

856
00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:49.370
science and knowledge and art. And so I think that, um, I'm lucky,

857
00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:53.810
<v 2>lucky to be part of it in this small way that I answered. Thanks. Radio,</v>

858
00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:55.270
Radiolab, wherever you are.

859
00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:59.400
<v 25>Okay. So this is a, it's a quick song and it goes</v>

860
00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:00.493
<v 2>okay.</v>

861
00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:07.950
Okay. And, uh, this song is,

862
00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:13.730
<v 25>this song is a, that's a, that's a good one.</v>

863
00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:18.440
<v 11>Yeah. Okay.</v>

864
00:59:18.570 --> 00:59:19.403
<v 25>Here we go.</v>

865

<v 1>[inaudible] okay.</v>

866
00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:35.333
Ooh.

01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:33.570
[inaudible] walking cross this baron

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:37.280
[inaudible] baby,

877
01:00:37.281 --> 01:00:42.281
I can gum blame when those chairs is gold chair into the sky.

878
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Squawking with the laser precision swooping now on seeking breeze and knowing

879
01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.610
that shining

880
01:00:56.470 --> 01:01:01.470
little.in the distance is not a super extra shiny star on the astro physicist

881
01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:09.230
dinosaurs would have said in that time.

882
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:12.643
[inaudible]

883
01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:17.380
<v 15>uh, Ben.</v>

884

<v 26>Oh boy. Yes. Arby's. Matt.</v>

885
01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:27.330
It was great to see the earth concoct his large lizard families,

886
01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:36.540
those lizards made sounds and attacked each other and wore coats and clothing,

887
01:01:37.091 --> 01:01:40.180
but oh well, all of that got burned off.

888
01:01:40.181 --> 01:01:43.870
And the evidence of a natural intellectual society may not be apparent to us.

889
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:48.090
Whoa. I know. Yeah.

890
01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.420
But what happened to the sleaze stacks?

891
01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.330
What happened to Whoa, those slurping sleaze,

892
01:01:57.310 --> 01:02:02.310
eggs moving and probably at top speed of three miles per hour or the aliens that

893
01:02:04.241 --> 01:02:08.680
donated genetic material to the hominids in order to create the society people

894
01:02:08.681 --> 01:02:09.570
that we are now.

895
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:13.570
This explains our fascination for diamonds and goals because we've just kind of

896
01:02:13.571 --> 01:02:15.920
dug it up for their spaceships. Oh,

897
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:20.993
Yay.

[inaudible] [inaudible]

910
01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:10.510
<v 12>let's just take stock for a second. Robert,</v>

911
01:04:10.511 --> 01:04:13.750
we did our super fast radical dyno ending.

912
01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.600
Reggie did his Reggie ending, which,

913
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:19.210
which you never quite sure what he's saying. You know?

914
01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:21.700
Can you imagine we have scripts everything.

915
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.090
Imagine if I just want you open through the river

916
01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:26.010
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

917
01:04:26.010 --> 01:04:30.080
<v 22>all evening long. It would be outer space, man. Wow. Okay, so what's in the,</v>

918
01:04:30.081 --> 01:04:31.650
what's next? What's our next day?

919
01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:35.600
<v 12>Pink ending now. The pagan thing. You mean like the color? Yeah,</v>

920
01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.590
this is the one that answered,

921
01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.430
I think the most basic question you could ask in a show like this. This asks,

922
01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:41.760
when did endings begin?

923
01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:47.700
It's a serious question. That's a weird one. When did endings begin? Wouldn't

924
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:50.160
<v 22>they're always, I mean the moment you had beginnings,</v>

925
01:04:50.161 --> 01:04:53.040
wouldn't that then imply an end because the beginnings have to do something

926
01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.560
<v 12>and you'd think so,</v>

927
01:04:55.950 --> 01:05:00.060
but if you think hard about the origin of the universe, I would propose,

928
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:01.170
but when the universe began,

929
01:05:01.171 --> 01:05:04.320
which by seminar [inaudible] was a huge explosion of energy,

930
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.190
which then condensed and cooled into matter that that whole event came in

931
01:05:08.191 --> 01:05:12.750
without any notion of endings at all. Huh? When you get matter,

932
01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.160
when you get that condensation,

933
01:05:14.161 --> 01:05:18.850
you get a list of elements which we can now turn to in the periodic table of

934
01:05:18.851 --> 01:05:20.020
elements with which you, I'm sure,

935
01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:24.580
very familiar and enjoy every evening before dining or sleeping.

936
01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.730
Keith here now puts the periodic table up on the screen. So if we,

937
01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.430
if we look at this at this chart,

938
01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:33.490
let me start up in the upper left hand side of the hydrogen and we move through

939
01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:37.450
it. The helium and lithium and beryllium and Boron and carbon and on and on.

940
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:38.740
As we move through the list,

941
01:05:38.741 --> 01:05:43.000
I can tell you that every one of the first 82 elements on this chart with two

942
01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.350
exception, which I mentioned in a minute,

943
01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:48.730
everyone of these has a version of itself that goes on forever and ever and ever

944
01:05:48.731 --> 01:05:52.720
until the end of time. Every one of these you're saying is immortal.

945
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:55.870
Is that what you're saying? Yes. Now, here's the thing.

946
01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:59.890
When we get to number 83 that's business.

947
01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:02.890
I would argue that this is where the universe invents and things.

948
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:04.690
Really what is, what is bismuth?

949
01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:09.850
It's a rock kind of a shiny black rock and you're saying this shiny black rock

950
01:06:09.851 --> 01:06:12.940
is, is is, is where death begins? Yes. Yes.

951
01:06:12.941 --> 01:06:15.400
I would say that that's a fair apply. Would that be well,

952
01:06:15.401 --> 01:06:18.520
because all the atoms at the bottom of this chart are a little heavier than the

953
01:06:18.521 --> 01:06:22.420
ones on the top, meaning they have lots and lots of of neutrons and protons.

954
01:06:22.810 --> 01:06:25.300
Here. Keith brings up an image of a bismuth. Adam with lots of jiggling,

955
01:06:25.301 --> 01:06:27.700
protons and neutrons. There's so many of them. As you can see,

956
01:06:27.701 --> 01:06:31.810
they're having a little trouble holding their themselves together and French

957
01:06:31.811 --> 01:06:36.670
scientists studying this. Adam recently determined that inevitably,

958
01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:40.480
inevitably something will happen to this. Adam. It goes something like this.

959
01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:47.560
Protons and neutrons fly off the Adam and amazingly Roberts pool was perfectly

960
01:06:47.561 --> 01:06:51.120
timed in this case with Keith hitting the button to do it visually and that had

961
01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:56.270
ever happened before. Wow. You tell him that so well do it again.

962
01:06:56.290 --> 01:07:00.580
Do that again. Okay. I don't think I can do it twice. Well, no,

963
01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:02.440
you don't add sound effects. I've know the side effects are you?

964
01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.200
<v 2>You do that one more time.</v>

965
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:12.920
Oh No. Now you're like stripe. That made him angry.

966
01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:15.673
Stop it.

967
01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:24.310
<v 12>That's the point I'm trying to make Keith, is that this Adam,</v>

968
01:07:24.311 --> 01:07:29.030
when it loses protons, it loses its identity. What an Adam decays it.

969
01:07:29.050 --> 01:07:31.900
This Adam is no longer bismuth if it doesn't have the right number of proteins.

970
01:07:31.901 --> 01:07:34.690
That's the way chemistry you were saying like as it as it shifts its protons and

971
01:07:34.691 --> 01:07:37.300
neutrons. It's dying. That's right. Now here's the cool thing.

972
01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:42.660
When we go back to the chart to number 83 every element after it po

973
01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:49.900
[inaudible] descend rig elements 84 to one 18 also decay.

974
01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:54.490
So on the periodic table you see two teams. Basically the ones at the top,

975
01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:56.140
they're forever ours.

976
01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:59.170
They go forever and on the bottom you have the ones that die, right?

977
01:07:59.230 --> 01:08:01.250
That's correct, that's correct. But with the,

978
01:08:01.251 --> 01:08:05.710
with the two exceptions I mentioned I should say 43 and 61 that's technium and

979
01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.920
promethium. Nobody really likes those two

980
01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:12.603
<v 2>there.</v>

981
01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:15.530
<v 12>I find them actually unnecessary. I'll tell what if they,</v>

982
01:08:15.531 --> 01:08:18.410
if they mess up the whole logic here, let's just it, let's just get rid of them.

983
01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.090
Let's to get one of them. Get Out, get them out of here.

984
01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:22.193
<v 19>Okay.</v>

985
01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.670
<v 12>We just spoke two holes into the table.</v>

986
01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:27.880
Let me just say when we've divided up like this,

987
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:31.840
now you can see that bismuth is APA dividing line. Maybe if the universe,

988
01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:33.550
cause this is like this is what you see.

989
01:08:33.551 --> 01:08:36.360
It's like the KT boundary with the dinosaurs. This is a, this is different.

990
01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.380
Everything for everything. But the cute,

991
01:08:38.381 --> 01:08:41.050
cool thing is business is pretty good for you. Really.

992
01:08:41.051 --> 01:08:44.320
People swallow a little bits of business every time they get tummyaches to do

993
01:08:44.321 --> 01:08:48.040
this all the time. You recognize this color. Maybe screen fills with pink. Yeah,

994
01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:49.340
pink. I mentioned [inaudible].

995
01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:52.780
Do you recognize the product associated with this color?

996
01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:56.980
You know this product, pepto Bismol. Yeah, but just say it right?

997
01:08:57.070 --> 01:09:00.880
Say it the way it should be. Said pepto. What did I say? What bismal no, no.

998
01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:04.460
Say the only, the first syllable pepto is, are you applying the [inaudible]?

999
01:09:04.570 --> 01:09:07.900
You're applying the Bismol stands for business. I don't have to imply it's true.

1000
01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:10.240
There's a pepper blue tines bismuth.

1001
01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.790
I don't know Robert and I was with you right up until this point,

1002
01:09:12.791 --> 01:09:14.680
but if I had to guess,

1003
01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:20.010
I would say that Bismol is just the name of the dude that made pepto B j Jake f

1004
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:25.330
abysmal. You know, I'm telling you that each bottle of pink liquid,

1005
01:09:25.331 --> 01:09:28.840
there are little black rocks and, and that's just the truth. I don't know.

1006
01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.210
I don't know if prove it to you. Relevant to me.

1007
01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:37.260
Now that I hear Robert Appears on the screen in chemistry goggles,

1008
01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:42.790
you know, laboratory with a chemistry teacher by my time in Brooklyn.

1009
01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:47.590
And what you then see us do is we take in tablets of Pepto B.

1010
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:50.740
We Mush them up with a mortar and pestle. We add some water,

1011
01:09:50.741 --> 01:09:53.440
we add some hydrochloric acid, we shake it some aluminum,

1012
01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:58.710
and you get to see little bits of black rock precipitate out of the pepto

1013
01:09:58.751 --> 01:10:02.350
bismal. Lots of them. I was surprised at how much black stuff is in there.

1014
01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:05.620
And then I showed the test tube to Jack Jad. Look,

1015
01:10:05.621 --> 01:10:10.621
you can't deny scientific fact at hiding inside every single pepto bismal tablet

1016
01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:15.910
is pure street-level grade crystal business

1017
01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.360
in the side, pepto B.

1018
01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:24.360
You will find an element that not only cures Tommy eggs fairly and introduces

1019
01:10:24.461 --> 01:10:26.830
death to the universe. I think it's such a great element.

1020
01:10:26.831 --> 01:10:29.610
We should have a toast to business. Yeah, it's ever toast. Okay.

1021
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:31.243
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1022
01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:40.190
<v 19>Can we close the segment by both of us taking two big pint glasses,</v>

1023
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.720
filling them up to the top within pepto Bismol and chugging

1024
01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:53.683
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

1025

he got us the lab connection and Zach Fan and who shot it,

1029
01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:10.220
edited it and re edited it and re edited it

1030
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:14.260
and radio lab fashion

1031
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:17.110
<v 9>is there. Now we will pause only to do some business</v>

<v 11>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

1050
01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:42.850
<v 7>hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.</v>

1051
01:12:42.851 --> 01:12:47.140
I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab and we're going to go back now to the final segment

1052
01:12:47.141 --> 01:12:51.100
in our show about endings recorded live at the paramount theater in Seattle.

1053
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.903
<v 9>All right,</v>

1054
01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:56.400
<v 7>we're going to close the show. We're going to shift the mood a bit.</v>

1055
01:12:56.530 --> 01:13:01.230
We're going to close out this show and our tour with a very different kind of

1056
01:13:01.231 --> 01:13:02.890
ending. Yeah. Cause unlike dinosaurs, you know,

1057
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:05.940
dinosaurs have no idea what's ever going to happen to them.

1058
01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:10.350
But in this story we have an ending in which the enders can see what's coming.

1059
01:13:10.351 --> 01:13:14.640
It's coming right at them. Not Fast, but in this case very slowly.

1060
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:19.830
So can you guys hear me easily? Easily. Okay, good.

1061
01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:22.800
We'll introduce you to two guys. Chris Jones and Dan Moran.

1062
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:26.820
They both actors in Manhattan, both been doing it 30, 40 years,

1063
01:13:28.290 --> 01:13:32.840
<v 17>30 40 years, plays movies, you name it. Uh,</v>

1064
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:33.823
five 40 arm.

1065
01:13:34.090 --> 01:13:38.480
Tom's body gassers pantomime circus tune season on Broadway downtown.

1066
01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:41.670
<v 27>Moonstruck the share moving Shakespeare.</v>

1067
01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:42.810
<v 17>There are a lot of comedies.</v>

1068
01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:45.450
He worked pretty much everywhere there is to work as it happens.

1069
01:13:45.451 --> 01:13:48.780
I know this story cause Chris, one of the actors is an old friend.

1070
01:13:48.781 --> 01:13:51.450
We met in a high school musical actually many years ago.

1071
01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:56.380
<v 27>Oklahoma. You think everything is Oklahoma? I didn't know.</v>

1072
01:13:56.381 --> 01:13:58.100
I don't know anything goes.

1073
01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:00.990
<v 11>Mm.</v>

1074
01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:03.960
<v 7>Our story for both Chris and Dan begins 10 years ago</v>

1075
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.470
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

1076
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:08.960
<v 7>Dan was onstage, big stage, Washington,</v>

1077
01:14:08.961 --> 01:14:13.140
D C I was doing streetcar as a streetcar named desire.

1078
01:14:13.150 --> 01:14:15.670
He was playing the lead role. Stanley Kowalski.

1079
01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:19.000
You know the guy that Marlon Brando made famous for yelling, Hey,

1080
01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:22.573
<v 15>that guy,</v>

1081
01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:29.600
<v 7>the woman playing Stella said it's really sexy how your left arm doesn't swing</v>

1082
01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:36.420
when you walk. It's kind of like animalistic. I said, well that's cool.

1083
01:14:36.421 --> 01:14:37.254
So I used it.

1084
01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:40.430
<v 9>You thought, all right, if it works, it works.</v>

1085
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:43.640
I'll just play the character that way is the guy whose arm doesn't swing.

1086
01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:47.890
<v 28>But I, after the show ended, I was walking down the street in Manhattan.</v>

1087
01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:52.500
I thought, why isn't my left arm swing? What's going on?

1088
01:14:53.130 --> 01:14:53.963
<v 9>Oh Chris.</v>

1089
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.020
So right out of around the same time he was in Delaware shooting a film,

1090
01:14:58.230 --> 01:14:59.130
a movie by

1091
01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:02.670
<v 7>m night Shambhala, kind of a great movie.</v>

1092
01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:06.090
[inaudible] called the village marks.

1093
01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.860
<v 9>I played Adrian Brody, his father, and we're getting ready in wardrobe.</v>

1094
01:15:11.861 --> 01:15:13.120
One day he noticed that

1095
01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:15.020
<v 27>and I had a slight tremor,</v>

1096
01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:20.330
occasionally difficult time buttoning buttons with my right hand.

1097
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:22.910
I thought I had a pinched nerve in my neck.

1098
01:15:23.690 --> 01:15:26.930
I went to see an orthopedic guy and he said, you should see a neurologist.

1099
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:30.110
<v 28>I went to um, a doctor and he said,</v>

1100
01:15:30.170 --> 01:15:34.610
very gleefully, I think you've got Parkinson's.

1101
01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:41.360
And he had to run a deficit in the Parkinsonian that he's pleased.

1102
01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:44.570
He was able to help me out. He nailed it.

1103
01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:50.880
<v 9>Now Parkinson's, if you ask an expert,</v>

1104
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:51.940
which we did,

1105
01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:54.970
<v 5>Cheryl Waters, Columbia University Medical Center,</v>

1106
01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:58.540
Parkinson's is a very mysterious disease.

1107
01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:02.830
I'm not sure what to think about it now because it keeps evolving and changing.

1108
01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:05.950
Some people, according to Dr. Waters, when they get the disease,

1109
01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:07.720
nothing happens, nothing.

1110
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:10.870
They come with tremor and they die with a little bit of tremor and nothing else

1111
01:16:10.871 --> 01:16:14.710
ever happens. But in other cases for some reason it could wreak havoc

1112
01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:20.610
<v 0>because sometimes, and doctors really don't know why this is the case.</v>

1113
01:16:20.611 --> 01:16:23.700
Sometimes the disease will just start to march through the brain.

1114
01:16:24.090 --> 01:16:25.590
It'll begin deep down,

1115
01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:30.600
low down and the brainstem and then it will gradually inch its way upward.

1116
01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:34.230
First of all, detect this little cluster of cells in the middle of the brain,

1117
01:16:34.231 --> 01:16:37.500
that control movement and that's when you start to see the shakes and then

1118
01:16:37.501 --> 01:16:42.501
little by little there's a progression progression up a migration to the surface

1119
01:16:43.591 --> 01:16:48.210
to other areas of the brain that control thinking, memory,

1120
01:16:48.690 --> 01:16:52.320
concentration and in those cases the disease,

1121
01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:54.270
it is an extra bleak progressive.

1122
01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:57.970
So you got these different kinds of Parkinson's one that sleeps one day it

1123
01:16:57.970 --> 01:16:58.900
<v 9>goes on the rampage.</v>

1124
01:16:58.950 --> 01:17:02.390
The problem is when you're diagnosed you can never quite be sure which kind you

1125
01:17:02.391 --> 01:17:05.770
got because for the people in whom it spreads,

1126
01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:10.100
it can take decades. When he you have Parkinson's,

1127
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.400
<v 27>did you feel like you</v>

1128
01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:16.640
<v 28>no trouble at the time it was a joke. It was a joke. This is nothing.</v>

1129
01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:17.750
I'm fine.

1130
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:18.710
<v 27>In the beginning,</v>

1131
01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:21.980
Dan and Chris didn't really worry a whole lot about this cause they didn't have

1132
01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:26.000
to. In fact, Chris, when I first was diagnosed and was performing,

1133
01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.100
he was doing a lot of Shakespeare and you'll,

1134
01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:30.710
if his hand never started to to shake a bit.

1135
01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:35.390
It was always nice to have a nice big cloaker Cape for me to wear to hide my

1136
01:17:35.391 --> 01:17:38.330
hand bind so that the audience wouldn't see the tremor.

1137
01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:41.810
Truth is it didn't happen. All that often wasn't much of a deal.

1138
01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:43.190
Chris kept acting.

1139
01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:47.900
Dan kept acting and in both of them their Parkinson's seemed to be the kind that

1140
01:17:47.901 --> 01:17:51.380
stays asleep for two years,

1141
01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:56.690
three years, five years, seven years,

1142
01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:00.380
but then after eight years

1143
01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:04.410
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1144
01:18:04.410 --> 01:18:05.243
<v 19>just woke up.</v>

1145
01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.600
I just found out that it got her and a hundred a moon dances.

1146
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.980
He's not quite sure when it happened,

1147
01:18:10.981 --> 01:18:13.560
but suddenly his limbs were aching all the time.

1148
01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:18.160
That easy control that you have over your body as you're walking down the street

1149
01:18:18.161 --> 01:18:21.640
where all the limbs are moving together and you don't have to think about it for

1150
01:18:21.641 --> 01:18:24.220
him but started to disappear.

1151
01:18:25.630 --> 01:18:29.400
You'd have to think about each leg, each foot, independently, left foot,

1152
01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:33.480
right foot, left heel,

1153
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.030
right here to Chris.

1154
01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:40.170
He would actually have these moments where he would try to move his arm where

1155
01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:42.660
his brain would basically say to his arm, Woo,

1156
01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:47.660
<v 28>but his arm would just sit there and stark like it wanted to move.</v>

1157
01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.990
It just somehow couldn't. I would freeze on stage.

1158
01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:53.670
<v 27>It was a nightmare</v>

1159
01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:56.450
<v 19>and as things progressed,</v>

1160
01:18:56.451 --> 01:19:00.810
Dan would have these moments in rehearsals where suddenly you would just go

1161
01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:02.003
blank.

1162
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:06.330
<v 28>I had done this TV show on FX.</v>

1163
01:19:06.810 --> 01:19:11.130
I had one scene where I couldn't remember five lines, I just couldn't remember.

1164
01:19:11.131 --> 01:19:13.090
Five lines. We chuck all night.

1165
01:19:14.230 --> 01:19:17.680
<v 27>I got my interests. We would do lines and come back out and blow it.</v>

1166
01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:22.740
Now this isn't an easy situation for anybody, but if you're an actor,

1167
01:19:22.770 --> 01:19:25.200
if you're somebody who has to inhabit a character,

1168
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:28.740
the different rhythm than yours and different flow, use your body to do that,

1169
01:19:28.741 --> 01:19:31.350
which is how you pay the rent. For actors.

1170
01:19:31.351 --> 01:19:34.600
Parkinson's is just awful because it kills their craft. Oh,

1171
01:19:34.601 --> 01:19:39.601
your face becomes a mask so you haven't got your face and without face you don't

1172
01:19:39.691 --> 01:19:42.360
have flow. The way I like in it,

1173
01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.530
if you take a pebble and you throw it into a pool of water, it goes

1174
01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:53.720
and there's a ripple that goes. Just concentric circles go out from the impact.

1175
01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:57.130
If you take me my body,

1176
01:19:57.131 --> 01:20:02.131
my self as an actor and you throw a pebble into my pool,

1177
01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:07.760
it goes thud. There's no fluidity. There's no,

1178
01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:11.600
<v 28>it just stops. I once I,</v>

1179
01:20:11.601 --> 01:20:15.380
I opened up to the acting world. I had Parkinson's,

1180
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:17.510
my agent strapped me,

1181
01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:22.790
the calls pretty much stopped calling and that was that.

1182
01:20:23.570 --> 01:20:26.420
But then one night something happened

1183
01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:29.490
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

1184
01:20:29.490 --> 01:20:32.190
<v 27>how did this idea come up? Well,</v>

1185
01:20:32.670 --> 01:20:37.140
it was my first idea and I guess your brilliant idea. Thank you buddy.

1186
01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:39.480
And we should say that these two guys, Chris and Dan,

1187
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:43.530
they've actually known each other for years. The two of you met doing what?

1188
01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:48.750
Among the thin country, which is a classic play on Broadway and Dan explains,

1189
01:20:48.751 --> 01:20:51.180
it was late one night he was having insomnia,

1190
01:20:51.570 --> 01:20:54.120
which is the usual side effect of the medication he has to take.

1191
01:20:54.630 --> 01:20:58.290
And he was just looking around for something to read and he grabs this play off

1192
01:20:58.291 --> 01:21:02.040
the shelf. It was a play by Samuel Beckett,

1193
01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:08.690
the play in one act, and he starts reading characters have clove.

1194
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:10.850
I mean this was a play that he knew he had read it before,

1195
01:21:11.150 --> 01:21:15.980
but that night it seemed to talk to him in a way that was totally new.

1196
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:19.130
Their interior gray light right from the start.

1197
01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.770
It started off with a guy shuffling on stage.

1198
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:26.670
Clove goes and stands under the window, left stiff, staggering walk,

1199
01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:29.150
shuffling around. He looks up at the window left.

1200
01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:33.380
He turned to looks to window right. And I said, well yeah, I know shuffling.

1201
01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:39.080
He thought, I feel this guy can't sit, can't get comfortable,

1202
01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:43.130
seem familiar to him. And then on the next page, hamsters,

1203
01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:47.150
another guy interests the scene, very red face, black glasses,

1204
01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:51.080
also in bad shape. This guy is stuck in this wheelchair. Can't walk anymore.

1205
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:54.250
He takes off his glasses. Why exercise is faced with the glasses,

1206
01:21:54.630 --> 01:21:57.590
puts them on again. So here you got these two guys, one can't sit,

1207
01:21:57.650 --> 01:21:58.910
one can't stand.

1208
01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:02.750
They're stuck in this little room with these two windows that look out and

1209
01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:06.530
outside those windows either due to an asteroid,

1210
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:11.510
a nuclear holocaust, what used to be green is now gray,

1211
01:22:13.710 --> 01:22:14.760
<v 28>like a wasteland.</v>

1212
01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:20.210
<v 27>Is there anyone alive out there do you think or no? No.</v>

1213
01:22:21.410 --> 01:22:25.850
Outside their window. They can see the ocean but it seems to stop moving.

1214
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:29.970
There are no waves now in game

1215
01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:32.510
<v 11>and</v>

1216
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:36.200
<v 27>that's a term that comes from the chest and it refers to that moment in the game</v>

1217
01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:40.520
when they're just a few pieces and just a few moves left the last few moves

1218
01:22:40.521 --> 01:22:44.060
before the inevitable outcome. It's not the end.

1219
01:22:44.061 --> 01:22:46.250
It's the point right before the add.

1220
01:22:46.251 --> 01:22:49.680
And it's the place where you become aware of the end for the first time.

1221
01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:52.520
And dinosaur can't do that. But these two characters,

1222
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:54.950
they've run out of everything out of painkiller.

1223
01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:00.600
Painkillers are gone out of biscuits and they have that awful awareness and now

1224
01:23:01.041 --> 01:23:04.400
they have to deal with it. Like here we are. What do we do?

1225
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:05.980
<v 11>How</v>

1226
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:10.870
<v 27>do we fill up the time on this rock hurtling through space?</v>

1227
01:23:11.170 --> 01:23:12.003
The more I read it,

1228
01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:17.260
it just felt like Parkinson's to me being locked in a room with my body.

1229
01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:20.860
I'm not getting out. There's no killer. I'm not getting out of this room.

1230
01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:24.720
And then on page three, one of the characters,

1231
01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:28.750
a guy named Pam stops what he's doing and he says, enough.

1232
01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.420
It's time it ended

1233
01:23:32.690 --> 01:23:33.523
<v 2>and yet</v>

1234
01:23:35.190 --> 01:23:36.150
<v 27>I hesitate.</v>

1235
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:42.110
I hesitate to end and dance is something about the line and yet I hesitate.

1236
01:23:43.951 --> 01:23:47.790
I hesitate to to end just flipped a switch for him.

1237
01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.440
Screw these people that won't hire me

1238
01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:52.760
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1239
01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:57.440
<v 27>because I've got this fucking little disease that makes me shake or talk funny.</v>

1240
01:23:57.530 --> 01:24:01.010
I don't need those people. No. The next morning he calls Chris.

1241
01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.180
Chris described the call,

1242
01:24:02.181 --> 01:24:04.910
you're sitting there and one day the phone rings was that it was happening.

1243
01:24:04.911 --> 01:24:08.330
He says, how'd you like to get together and take a look at end game?

1244
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:12.140
Christian remembers thinking. I don't know. I'm not sure if I'm up to it.

1245
01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.850
It's a 70 minute long play.

1246
01:24:13.851 --> 01:24:18.010
It's gotten 12,000 words and material is monumental, but they,

1247
01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:19.790
I know that let's just, no pressure. Let's just,

1248
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:23.450
let's just meet at each other's apartments. So one day Dan would read one part,

1249
01:24:23.451 --> 01:24:25.280
Chris, the other part, the next day they'd switched.

1250
01:24:25.281 --> 01:24:28.650
And they did this for almost a year. The two of them each other's living rooms,

1251
01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:33.830
reading the play back and forth until finally they contacted the Becca the state

1252
01:24:33.831 --> 01:24:38.470
and got permission to put on one live performance in New York.

1253
01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:43.570
We decided Chris is having more trouble with his movement than I am.

1254
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:47.050
I'm more trouble with my speech and Chris's. So I thought,

1255
01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:50.210
well why don't I take on the part with all the speech and you got all the

1256
01:24:50.211 --> 01:24:52.870
moving. So will you do the whole movement? That makes sense.

1257
01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:56.230
You both leaned into your weaknesses. Yes. Well,

1258
01:24:56.231 --> 01:25:01.231
so the obvious question is why would two people in danger and in more danger

1259
01:25:02.441 --> 01:25:03.130
over time,

1260
01:25:03.130 --> 01:25:08.130
why would you decide to spend time staring at that danger straight in the eye?

1261
01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:12.190
Like that's just a weird thing to do. It's the only and do it.

1262
01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:15.730
That's the only way to do it. I can't like go through my,

1263
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:19.000
that's my life being afraid of this fucking disease.

1264
01:25:19.850 --> 01:25:23.860
When he said that I didn't quite understand what he was saying cause if you are

1265
01:25:23.890 --> 01:25:25.750
legitimately afraid of something,

1266
01:25:26.710 --> 01:25:30.250
why would it make you less afraid to stare at it's details?

1267
01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:33.460
That would make me more afraid. I mean I don't know if it's about fear really.

1268
01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:36.430
I think it's about knowing, knowing what, knowing

1269
01:25:37.210 --> 01:25:40.110
<v 9>no one where you are. Like where are you really are, you know?</v>

1270
01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:42.360
It's like a kind of journalism in a way.

1271
01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:45.960
Like I could imagine if you've got this thing that's been stealing from me for

1272
01:25:45.961 --> 01:25:47.940
10 years, right? It's stealing your body.

1273
01:25:47.941 --> 01:25:51.360
It's steering your craft at a certain way. You want to know like where am I?

1274
01:25:51.361 --> 01:25:54.150
Am I in my past? It is the end already happen for me.

1275
01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.840
Am I broken or do I have something left?

1276
01:25:58.230 --> 01:26:00.060
I mean it's sorta like in one of the back of plays,

1277
01:26:00.061 --> 01:26:01.260
not this one but an earlier one.

1278
01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:04.700
Their character waltz is on the stage and he says the following two sentences,

1279
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:09.800
I can't go on. I will go on. It's like there's two sentences. Contradiction,

1280
01:26:09.801 --> 01:26:11.390
right. I can't go on and I will go on.

1281
01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:14.660
It's almost as if Dan is trying to figure out which sentence is he? Is he the,

1282
01:26:14.661 --> 01:26:17.050
I can't. Is it done or is he the,

1283
01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:19.910
I will like he's got something left and the only way to know that is to look at

1284
01:26:19.911 --> 01:26:22.490
the thing that's posing the question. Boom.

1285
01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.610
<v 27>What if you put on the play and you find that you get the wrong answer?</v>

1286
01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:29.900
You find out I can't. Here's what Chris was worried about.

1287
01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:35.110
The big issue for me was what happens to my sense of myself if we get to the

1288
01:26:36.081 --> 01:26:40.190
performance stage of this project and it turns out,

1289
01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:42.890
<v 11>mm,</v>

1290
01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:45.360
<v 27>no, like I couldn't cut it</v>

1291
01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.140
<v 9>and yet they go on</v>

1292
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:54.050
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

1293
01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:56.960
<v 0>after a year of reading this play back and forth in their living rooms,</v>

1294
01:26:56.961 --> 01:27:00.320
Chris and Dan decide, okay, it's time to find a performance space.

1295
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:03.050
Time to hire a director. Oh.

1296
01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:05.600
They used to come dragging their asses into rehearsal.

1297
01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:10.280
Looking like these guys are going to be able to go from here to there.

1298
01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:13.640
That's yoga. Fozzy Chris and dance director, shaky and Wigley is,

1299
01:27:13.641 --> 01:27:16.730
I used to call him. He's known him for years. You did not call him back.

1300
01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:19.130
Oh you know cause that's what they were doing.

1301
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:22.640
It just says Dan and Chris were two of the best actors he has ever worked with

1302
01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:26.900
and oddly enough in this case their disease could be an asset.

1303
01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.870
I believe that because they're halfway home,

1304
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:34.400
they could feel what Beckett's characters in this play were feeling better than

1305
01:27:34.401 --> 01:27:34.790
anyone.

1306
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:37.670
I never felt for a moment this wasn't going to make the play better if they

1307
01:27:37.671 --> 01:27:41.420
could get through rehearsals, easier said than done.

1308
01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:45.950
Take the problem with a medication. Now both of them,

1309
01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:49.490
when they're peaking on their meds, they are sharpen their clear focus,

1310
01:27:49.491 --> 01:27:53.740
but when the meds start to taper away, they get clouding too.

1311
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:56.120
The hope was if they were going to rehearse together, they some have to,

1312
01:27:56.150 --> 01:28:00.530
they'd have to time it just right so that they pop their pills at the right time

1313
01:28:00.531 --> 01:28:03.320
and rise together, get clear,

1314
01:28:04.730 --> 01:28:08.280
and then taper off together at the same time. The

1315
01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:10.920
<v 27>medication gives you about an hour and a half window.</v>

1316
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:14.700
Might be just enough time to run a few seeds. Problem was,

1317
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:17.880
it wouldn't always work. I'd somebody I'd walk in and Dan says,

1318
01:28:17.881 --> 01:28:21.210
even when it's time to just, right. Sometimes the medication wouldn't take,

1319
01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:24.070
I would be completely locked up and Chris would be right in the middle of a

1320
01:28:24.071 --> 01:28:27.750
scene doing really well and then gets so tired you'd have to sit down.

1321
01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:30.880
Didn't have much stamina, so it's like that's just turn around,

1322
01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:34.890
go home or break out the mattresses. Sometimes Joe says they actually did.

1323
01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:37.920
We lay around on the floor or we just do something like you'd lay around on the

1324
01:28:37.921 --> 01:28:39.900
floor. Yeah. I said, let's lay down. Let's,

1325
01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.030
why don't we lay down and do the lines laying down.

1326
01:28:42.031 --> 01:28:45.420
That's actually a great exercise point is that a lot of times rehearsals were a

1327
01:28:45.421 --> 01:28:49.230
bust and as they got closer and closer to the performance day, Dan would say,

1328
01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:53.730
take me aside and say, you know, I got to tell you Joe is okay,

1329
01:28:53.731 --> 01:28:57.570
but I'm scared out of my mind, you know, scared out of my mind.

1330
01:28:57.770 --> 01:29:01.720
This would became terrifying and I,

1331
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:06.090
well that's good if you know who we are since when shouldn't we be scared right

1332
01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:09.390
then and then. Then he'd remind Dan of a basic law of the theater.

1333
01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:13.590
Terrible rehearsals, make great performances and most of the time,

1334
01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:17.550
but they knew this was a very different situation.

1335
01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:22.760
<v 9>Very different words. 15 oh,</v>

1336
01:29:22.761 --> 01:29:26.540
thank you baby. Then came July 13th last year.

1337
01:29:26.630 --> 01:29:29.630
The people are coming the night of the performance.

1338
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:31.703
<v 27>Uh,</v>

1339
01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:35.200
<v 2>Rosie. Yeah. You got our understudies</v>

1340
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:36.850
<v 9>couple minutes before the show.</v>

1341
01:29:36.851 --> 01:29:41.710
Dan Calls for the so-called understudies and then runs to the back door to smoke

1342
01:29:41.711 --> 01:29:42.460
a cigarette.

1343
01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:46.330
<v 28>I'm looking up this door and having shit why looked out and half suit many times</v>

1344
01:29:46.331 --> 01:29:50.140
before everything seems familiar.

1345
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.903
<v 2>Bye.</v>

1346
01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:58.230
<v 28>I don't belong there. I feel like I, I feel like I'm</v>

1347
01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:00.433
<v 2>okay.</v>

1348
01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:06.010
<v 28>Like what am I doing here? He says, he kept thinking,</v>

1349
01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:09.640
how did I think I could do this? I mean I'm going to fuck it up.

1350
01:30:10.270 --> 01:30:14.260
I'm going to forget lines. I'm not the character. I'm not,

1351
01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.930
I'm not fully the character. I haven't rehearsed enough.

1352
01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:18.550
I haven't had enough rehearsal time.

1353
01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:20.580
<v 9>And he says he actually walked out the door,</v>

1354
01:30:20.970 --> 01:30:25.470
got about halfway out cause he's at that moment he was thinking, you know that,

1355
01:30:25.530 --> 01:30:27.000
I mean that question, can I or can I?

1356
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:30.870
I've got my answer and I'm about to go out in front of hundreds of people and

1357
01:30:30.871 --> 01:30:35.610
show them nakedly. Then I am broken that I can't do this.

1358
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:37.230
Does the end has already happened.

1359
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:42.090
<v 28>Then he thought, I've started this ball rolling</v>

1360
01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:48.470
and I couldn't stop it. So no,

1361
01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:51.770
just do what you have to do. Just start at the beginning.

1362
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:53.840
Go until the end and then the stop

1363
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.560
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1364
01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:04.470
<v 9>okay. So the play begins with Dan in the middle of the stage.</v>

1365
01:31:04.710 --> 01:31:09.360
He's asleep in a wheelchair, covered by a sheet. Chris Paces around behind him,

1366
01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:12.430
sort of shuffles about, looks out those windows mumble.

1367
01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:20.210
<v 2>It's got it off. Okay. Chris was very worried about getting a little loud,</v>

1368
01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:26.473
Huh?

1369
01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:32.750
<v 27>For sound. He makes, he gets a laugh right from the start. The audience,</v>

1370
01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:38.030
God Beckett's humor. That was a great,

1371
01:31:38.031 --> 01:31:39.080
great relief.

1372
01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:44.410
<v 9>But then the thing Dan feared most happened in one of the big speeches of the</v>

1373
01:31:44.411 --> 01:31:46.810
play. You went blank.

1374
01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:48.730
<v 28>Oh my God. What's my next line?</v>

1375
01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:54.640
I lost the line.

1376
01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:59.560
<v 9>He says he's stared down at his feet for 20 seconds and then his wife fed him a</v>

1377
01:31:59.561 --> 01:32:03.550
line and he went on. That was one moment,

1378
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:06.940
but there was another moment,

1379
01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:12.110
<v 7>a series of moments actually that were entirely different.</v>

1380
01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:14.480
It began fish.

1381
01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:18.890
This fish just after Chris is opening monologue,

1382
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:22.730
Stan begins to speak John de be misery

1383
01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:26.290
<v 12>loftier than mine.</v>

1384
01:32:26.630 --> 01:32:31.630
I tried my damnedest to just stay with the story moment by moment.

1385
01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:34.810
Enough. It's time.

1386
01:32:34.811 --> 01:32:39.811
It ended in the shelter too and yet I hesitate.

1387
01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:45.540
I hesitate to to n yes,

1388
01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:48.700
<v 7>there it is. It's time and anything I hesitate.</v>

1389
01:32:49.250 --> 01:32:51.210
Dan says as he was up there making that speech,

1390
01:32:51.211 --> 01:32:54.090
that speech about how it's time to end and yet he hesitates.

1391
01:32:55.050 --> 01:32:59.400
A funny thing happened, you know my performance muscles started to take over.

1392
01:32:59.610 --> 01:33:02.730
His body loosened up his legs, his arms, his mouth.

1393
01:33:02.731 --> 01:33:06.270
Suddenly they were under his control in a way they hadn't been for months.

1394
01:33:06.810 --> 01:33:08.100
He could move them without thinking.

1395
01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:12.500
<v 12>It's a quite remarkable call. Yes. Have you not had enough?</v>

1396
01:33:14.890 --> 01:33:19.280
We were able to do things on stage of what?

1397
01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:24.920
<v 7>For this huge stretch of the plate. It was like the disease was gone.</v>

1398
01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:28.040
<v 12>That's always the lay at the end of the day, isn't it closed? Always.</v>

1399
01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:31.590
It's the end of the day. Like any other day, isn't it? Close login.

1400
01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:36.120
What's happening? What is happening? Something is taking its course

1401
01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:43.350
<v 9>and then there we are. That's enough.</v>

1402
01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.073
It was over

1403
01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:07.853
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

1404
01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:21.273
<v 11>he was amazing.</v>

1405
01:34:24.710 --> 01:34:27.890
And then I know we were walking back stage and Kristen, I just burst into tears.

1406
01:34:31.730 --> 01:34:32.710
Well you just don't cry.

1407
01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.590
It was not so much about the release of doing it,

1408
01:34:38.591 --> 01:34:41.110
but I think and more to do with family,

1409
01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:49.630
our kids and our why.

1410
01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:54.060
And some really good friends could see that

1411
01:34:57.770 --> 01:34:58.610
<v 15>still</v>

1412
01:34:59.330 --> 01:35:00.740
<v 27>some kind of possibility.</v>

1413
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:06.260
And I do believe that it was mixed with feeling like, Oh God,

1414
01:35:06.261 --> 01:35:10.700
I'm going to miss this. For me,

1415
01:35:10.701 --> 01:35:13.670
a lot of times when I commit to a project,

1416
01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:19.450
one of the things that I'm sort of curious about is who will I meet in the

1417
01:35:21.501 --> 01:35:25.490
person of me in this project?

1418
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.050
<v 11>Ooh,</v>

1419
01:35:28.050 --> 01:35:31.380
<v 27>who will I find in the room when I, when I work on the material?</v>

1420
01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:33.663
<v 11>And</v>

1421
01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:36.630
<v 27>I was pretty proud of</v>

1422
01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:40.333
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

1423
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:43.890
<v 27>who I found on this one.</v>

1424
01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:53.720
<v 7>There's something in this story that</v>

1425
01:35:55.290 --> 01:36:00.010
it speaks to all the things we feel about endings. I mean,

1426
01:36:00.011 --> 01:36:00.940
obviously it hurts.

1427
01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:05.080
It hurts to end is as Dan says,

1428
01:36:05.081 --> 01:36:08.740
and this is the line that gets me every night. Oh God, I'm gonna miss this.

1429
01:36:09.970 --> 01:36:14.970
But there's also something in with Chris's that if you stare unblinkingly at the

1430
01:36:15.281 --> 01:36:19.600
truth, you sometimes find something in yourself that you hadn't seen before,

1431
01:36:19.601 --> 01:36:22.390
which is in its way a new beginning.

1432
01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:28.840
And so it's time now it's time to end. You know,

1433
01:36:28.841 --> 01:36:33.520
we've never quite figured out how to end this show about endings except maybe to

1434
01:36:33.521 --> 01:36:37.210
follow Dan's simple advice and start at the beginning. Go until the end,

1435
01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:41.800
then stop. Yeah. And so ladies and gentleman, we've started at the beginning.

1436
01:36:41.801 --> 01:36:44.980
We've gone at the end and now we will stop.

1437
01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:47.933
<v 27>Hm.</v>

1438
01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:51.770
<v 7>I'd like to go on a little bit longer. A little bit.</v>

1439
01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.130
All right then Reggie, take us out.

1440
01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:13.453
<v 11>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

1441
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.863
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1442
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:54.583
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1443
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.750
<v 9>this moment right here, this moment,</v>

1444
01:37:57.751 --> 01:38:01.500
no one had a better view of this moment than me because I'm sitting there behind

1445
01:38:01.501 --> 01:38:04.740
a desk. You get out from the desk, walk to the side of the stage,

1446
01:38:04.770 --> 01:38:07.620
get the hyper-realistic T-rex,

1447
01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:11.520
dinosaur masterfully puppeteered by Mr Myron Cuso.

1448
01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:15.300
And you guys have like a break dance dance off in the middle of the stage.

1449
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:19.320
2,500 people just do not know what they're looking at because they're seeing

1450
01:38:19.321 --> 01:38:23.190
Robert Krulwich bust a move. I mean like busted move in that like, you know,

1451
01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:27.570
Young Mc like 1995 way busting move. It's like, it's amazing.

1452
01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:30.900
It's so amazing in fact that you have to go to the website right now,

1453
01:38:31.110 --> 01:38:33.120
radiolab.org/live and watch it.

1454
01:38:33.450 --> 01:38:38.430
I also shot multiple videos from behind the stage cause I was like,

1455
01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:41.880
I cannot even see this. It was so,

1456
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:47.990
it was the most joyful thing about it

1457
01:38:51.570 --> 01:38:53.070
and I want to thank you for that, Robert,

1458
01:38:53.370 --> 01:38:57.900
for allowing me to watch you do that night after night and for Reggie for

1459
01:38:57.901 --> 01:39:01.440
creating the music and for Sarah Upstate Darren, Greg Lynn Coachy,

1460
01:39:01.441 --> 01:39:04.080
Keith scratch. It was just awesome. It was awesome.

1461
01:39:04.110 --> 01:39:07.770
That plus the musical apocalypse. I will never forget those moments.

1462
01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:09.960
I also want to thank our sound geniuses,

1463
01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:14.520
Jill de bluff and Dave Sanderson and Dylan Keith and to our tireless fearless

Melissa O'Donnell and to the woman without who any of this would have been

1466
01:39:19.921 --> 01:39:24.730
possible. Our director, Eleanor [inaudible],

1467
