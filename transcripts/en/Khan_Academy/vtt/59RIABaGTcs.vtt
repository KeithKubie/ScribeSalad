00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:02.214
- Several videos ago,
we introduced the idea

00:00:02.214 --> 00:00:03.685
of a Fourier series.

00:00:03.685 --> 00:00:05.348
That I could take a periodic function,

00:00:05.348 --> 00:00:07.135
we started with the example of

00:00:07.135 --> 00:00:09.210
this square wave, and that I could

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.793
represent it as the sum of weighted

00:00:12.793 --> 00:00:14.293
sines and cosines.

00:00:15.232 --> 00:00:16.291
And then we took a little bit of

00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:18.321
an interlude of building up

00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:20.800
some of our mathematical foundations,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.117
just establishing a bunch of properties

00:00:23.117 --> 00:00:24.658
of taking the definite integral

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:28.032
over the period of that periodic function

00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:30.511
of sine and cosines and we established

00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:32.055
all of these properties.

00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:33.638
And now we're going to get the benefit

00:00:33.638 --> 00:00:35.265
from establishing all those because

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:37.174
we're going to start actually finding

00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:39.732
at least a formula for
Fourier coefficients

00:00:39.732 --> 00:00:40.871
and then we can apply it to our

00:00:40.871 --> 00:00:42.334
original square wave to see that, hey,

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:43.877
this could actually be a pretty

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.499
straightforward thing.

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:48.097
So right over here, I have rewritten

00:00:48.097 --> 00:00:50.905
a Fourier series expression,

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:52.323
or I've rewritten a Fourier series

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:54.636
for a periodic function f(t),

00:00:54.636 --> 00:00:57.278
let's say its period is 2π,

00:00:57.278 --> 00:00:58.496
and I'm going to use this in some

00:00:58.496 --> 00:01:00.769
of the properties that we have established

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.236
to start solving for
these actual coefficients.

00:01:05.236 --> 00:01:06.904
And what I'm gonna do in this video,

00:01:06.904 --> 00:01:08.126
I'm gonna first try to solve for

00:01:08.126 --> 00:01:09.508
a-sub-0 and then in the next video,

00:01:09.508 --> 00:01:12.631
we're gonna solve for
an arbitrary a-sub-n.

00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:13.813
And either in that one or the next one,

00:01:13.813 --> 00:01:17.594
we'll also solve for an arbitrary b-sub-n.

00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:19.417
So to solve for a-sub-0,

00:01:19.417 --> 00:01:21.695
what we're going to do is take

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:23.524
the definite integral of both sides

00:01:23.524 --> 00:01:25.349
from 0 to 2π.

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:28.726
So 0 to 2π, dt of f(t),

00:01:28.726 --> 00:01:30.106
well that's gonna be the same thing

00:01:30.106 --> 00:01:31.856
as going from 0 to 2π

00:01:33.073 --> 00:01:35.141
of all of this stuff.

00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:36.525
And remember, this is an infinite

00:01:36.525 --> 00:01:37.579
series right over here,

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.123
we have an infinite number of terms.

00:01:39.123 --> 00:01:41.679
And then we would have a dt out there.

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.031
But we know from our
integration properties,

00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:45.735
taking the definite integral of

00:01:45.735 --> 00:01:47.685
a sum, even an infinite sum,

00:01:47.685 --> 00:01:49.189
is the same thing as the sum of

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.487
the definite integrals.

00:01:50.487 --> 00:01:52.032
So that's going to be the same thing

00:01:52.032 --> 00:01:54.032
as taking this integral,

00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:57.204
dt plus this integral.

00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:00.567
And I could take the scaler out.

00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:01.788
Actually, let me just not do that,

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.415
let me just write it like this.

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:04.248
0 to 2π,

00:02:05.385 --> 00:02:06.943
dt.

00:02:06.943 --> 00:02:08.440
0 to 2π,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.273
dt.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:11.222
0 to 2π,

00:02:12.255 --> 00:02:13.435
dt.

00:02:13.435 --> 00:02:14.572
This is getting a little monotonous,

00:02:14.572 --> 00:02:15.405
but it'll be worth it.

00:02:15.405 --> 00:02:16.638
0 to 2π,

00:02:16.638 --> 00:02:18.181
dt.

00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:19.014
0 to 2π,

00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:21.005
dt.

00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:22.914
0 to 2π,

00:02:23.946 --> 00:02:24.840
dt.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.386
And we'll do it for every single one

00:02:26.386 --> 00:02:27.686
of the terms.

00:02:27.686 --> 00:02:29.229
And now what's nice is, we can look

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:30.772
at our integration properties.

00:02:30.772 --> 00:02:32.639
This right over here,

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.507
we could take these coefficients out.

00:02:34.507 --> 00:02:36.691
We could take this a-sub-1,

00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:38.496
put it in front of the integral sign.

00:02:38.496 --> 00:02:39.722
The a-sub-2, put it in front

00:02:39.722 --> 00:02:40.698
of the integral sign.

00:02:40.698 --> 00:02:42.203
The b-sub-1, put it in front

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:43.665
of the integral sign.

00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:44.761
And then all you're left with is

00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:46.300
an integral from 0 to 2π

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.741
of cosine of

00:02:47.741 --> 00:02:50.324
some integer multiple of t, dt.

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:54.287
Well, we established
a couple of videos ago

00:02:54.287 --> 00:02:56.811
well, that's always
going to be equal to 0.

00:02:56.811 --> 00:02:59.125
The integral from 0 to 2π of cosine

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:02.375
of some non-zero integer multiple of t,

00:03:03.263 --> 00:03:05.381
dt, that is equal to 0.

00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:06.642
And then the same thing is true

00:03:06.642 --> 00:03:08.873
for a sine of mt.

00:03:08.873 --> 00:03:11.315
So, this is gonna be fun.

00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:12.668
This is gonna be 0,

00:03:12.668 --> 00:03:13.806
based on what we just saw.

00:03:13.806 --> 00:03:15.310
If you just take that factor out of

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.735
that integral, take that a-sub-1

00:03:16.735 --> 00:03:17.626
out of the integral, it's gonna be

00:03:17.626 --> 00:03:18.883
a-sub-1 times 0.

00:03:18.883 --> 00:03:20.181
This is gonna be a-sub-2 times 0,

00:03:20.181 --> 00:03:21.115
that's gonna be 0.

00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:22.251
That's gonna be 0, that's gonna be 0,

00:03:22.251 --> 00:03:23.265
that's gonna be 0.

00:03:23.265 --> 00:03:24.889
Every term's gonna be 0,

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.868
except for this one involving a-sub-0.

00:03:28.868 --> 00:03:31.670
And so, what is this going to be equal to?

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.785
Well, let me write it this way.

00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:36.143
Let's take the integral of,

00:03:36.143 --> 00:03:38.341
the definite integral.

00:03:38.341 --> 00:03:40.613
Let me see where I have some space.

00:03:40.613 --> 00:03:42.563
So we're gonna take the definite integral

00:03:42.563 --> 00:03:45.405
from 0 to 2π of a-sub-0 dt,

00:03:45.405 --> 00:03:46.623
well that's the same thing.

00:03:46.623 --> 00:03:49.985
Once again, we can take
the coefficient out.

00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:52.068
And I can just put the dt

00:03:54.262 --> 00:03:57.757
like this and so that's going to be

00:03:57.757 --> 00:03:59.840
equal to a-sub-0 times t.

00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:04.488
Let me do that in magenta.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.122
Times t, evaluated at 2π

00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:10.606
and 0, which is going to be equal

00:04:10.606 --> 00:04:12.939
to a-sub-0 times 2π minus 0.

00:04:16.095 --> 00:04:18.248
Times 2π minus 0.

00:04:18.248 --> 00:04:20.972
Well, that's just 2π a-sub-0.

00:04:20.972 --> 00:04:23.324
So I could just write this a-sub-0

00:04:23.324 --> 00:04:24.157
times 2π.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.900
So this expression right here is

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.317
a-sub-0 times 2π.

00:04:29.461 --> 00:04:31.901
So let me scroll down a little bit.

00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:34.138
So I can rewrite this thing up here,

00:04:34.138 --> 00:04:36.221
the integral from 0 to 2π

00:04:37.635 --> 00:04:39.885
of f(t) dt

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:45.598
which is equal to this integral.

00:04:45.598 --> 00:04:47.099
Well, we've just figured out that

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.171
the integral from 0 to 2π of a-sub-0 dt

00:04:49.171 --> 00:04:52.947
is the same thing as a-sub-0 times 2π.

00:04:52.947 --> 00:04:55.364
Is equal to a-sub-0 times 2π.

00:04:57.134 --> 00:04:57.967
Times 2π.

00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:00.506
And so now, it's actually pretty

00:05:00.506 --> 00:05:02.702
straightforward to solve for a-sub-0.

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:05.285
A-sub-0 is going to be equal to

00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:08.626
a-sub-0 is going to be equal to

00:05:08.626 --> 00:05:09.459
1 over 2π,

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.863
1 over 2π times the definite integral

00:05:13.863 --> 00:05:14.946
from 0 to 2π,

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:17.887
I'll just write the dt,

00:05:17.887 --> 00:05:21.380
of, let me write it a little bit,

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.372
dt of f(t),

00:05:23.372 --> 00:05:24.794
oh I'll just write it like this.

00:05:24.794 --> 00:05:26.299
f(t) dt.

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:27.271
And this is pretty cool because

00:05:27.271 --> 00:05:28.981
think about what this is.

00:05:28.981 --> 00:05:30.116
This over here,

00:05:30.116 --> 00:05:33.569
this is the average value of our function,

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.683
this is the average value of f

00:05:35.683 --> 00:05:37.850
over the interval 0 to 2π.

00:05:39.013 --> 00:05:40.096
Average value

00:05:42.713 --> 00:05:43.546
of f over,

00:05:46.615 --> 00:05:48.562
over the interval,

00:05:48.562 --> 00:05:52.015
over we could say the interval from 0,

00:05:52.015 --> 00:05:54.291
the interval from 0 to 2π.

00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:55.467
And hopefully that actually makes

00:05:55.467 --> 00:05:57.010
intuitive sense.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.307
Because if I am,

00:05:58.307 --> 00:05:59.564
if you just think of
it from an engineering

00:05:59.564 --> 00:06:00.497
point of view, if you were just trying

00:06:00.497 --> 00:06:01.956
to engineer this, trying to just

00:06:01.956 --> 00:06:03.262
play around with these numbers,

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:05.091
you know all of these cosines and sines,

00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:07.895
they oscillate between
positive 1 and negative 1.

00:06:07.895 --> 00:06:09.196
So in order to actually represent

00:06:09.196 --> 00:06:10.293
this function, you're gonna have to

00:06:10.293 --> 00:06:12.730
shift that oscillation.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.829
Sum of a bunch of oscillation is

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:15.046
still gonna be an oscillation that's

00:06:15.046 --> 00:06:17.527
going to vary between

00:06:17.527 --> 00:06:20.027
positive 1 and our negative 1.

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:22.607
And in order to shift it, well,

00:06:22.607 --> 00:06:24.963
that's what our a-sub-0 is going to do.

00:06:24.963 --> 00:06:25.979
And so what you,

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.034
it makes sense that you would want

00:06:27.034 --> 00:06:28.416
to shift the oscillation so it

00:06:28.416 --> 00:06:30.649
oscillates around the average value

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:32.560
of the function.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.577
Or you could say the average value

00:06:33.577 --> 00:06:35.204
of the function over,

00:06:35.204 --> 00:06:37.434
over an interval that's representative

00:06:37.434 --> 00:06:39.830
of a period of that function.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.314
And so that is what a-sub-0 is doing.

00:06:42.314 --> 00:06:44.882
A-sub-0 is just going to be that

00:06:44.882 --> 00:06:47.382
average value of the function.
