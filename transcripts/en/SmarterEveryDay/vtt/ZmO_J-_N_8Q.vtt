00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.000
There is a particular physical phenomenon that I've always wanted to see but I've never been able to quite set it up.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.400
That changes today.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.000
This is a piece of bullet-resistant acrylic specifically rated up to nine millimeters.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.920
This is a phantom V 2511, stupid fast frame rates.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.059
I've always wanted to see the specific spot where a bullet

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.649
Interacts with a piece of armor right at the nose of the bullet

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.039
Think about it that moment in time where the tip of the bullet hits the strike surface is so small in time

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.140
That it's hard to imagine the physics

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.989
That's going on

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.889
The good thing is now we can visualize it in order to do this you have to line up the flight path of the bullet

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.360
Directly in line with the camera and not only that I don't want to see a 9-millimeter try to penetrate this acrylic

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.009
But not do it. I also want to see what it looks like when you actually get through hey

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:57.600
It's me Destin welcome back to smarter every day. I'm here with Gavin. Hello and Dan from the slow mo guys

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.500
Roll tide

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.280
Roll tide and what we're gonna. Do today is something. I've been wanting to do for a really really long time

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.890
170,000 frames per second you think oh, I'm at 120 at the moment we could go up to 170. Let's try it okay

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.959
We're gonna use a wireless trigger on the high-speed because we don't want to be anywhere near a bullet hitting bullet-resistant glass

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.860
So I've got a shield for the camera and we use a wireless trigger to be safe

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.000
You actually know how to run the Phantom well yeah, we're all going to our strenghts. Yeah exactly

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.920
Where's Dan?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.520
So it went in and it mushroomed out and it kind of peeled out the edges on the outside there, but that one little spot that

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.910
You can see you can see through it. This is weird science time here

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:03.289
I thought that the exact spot the bullet touched the acrylic first would suffer the most damage, but clearly that's not happening

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.400
I've got to thinking about this

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.679
And I think it has something to do with an old word

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.080
Called a frustum according to this old dictionary a frustum is a cone with the top cut off

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.040
Let's imagine that this is our acrylic plate the bullet interacts with the top of the plate at the point of impact right here

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.869
That force tries to punch its way all the way through the plate now long time ago

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.979
Engineers figured out that stress isn't transmitted through a plate like a cylinder

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.830
It's actually something called a pressure cone every material has its own compression cone angle

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.639
This is what I honestly think's going on here stress is equal to force divided by area

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.250
I know that much as the force is

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.920
Distributed over a wider and wider area as it goes down through the acrylic you eventually get to the point with a nine millimeter

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.170
where it no longer has the ability to fracture the acrylic the stress isn't high enough however a

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.019
50 Cal would definitely do that because there's a much larger pressure cone it gets further through the material

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.879
We basically get to the part where it'll just break out the back so there. There's a larger pressure cone

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.499
I've set some big words. We've got a little bit. I think that means we get to play with the 50 Cal now

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.430
The slow-mo guys video

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.130
Here we go hot

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.199
This cone of the front is like ejecta material being forced out of a meteor impact

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.069
Where's this stuff in the back? Is that cone is the stress propagating through the material? That's that's so pretty

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.080
Sweet okay

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.320
Weapon's clear!

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.440
Dude

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.029
Okay real quick. I wanna say. Thank you to the company that gave us the bullet resistant glass to be clear

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.559
It's not supposed to protect against 50 Cal rounds. It's just 9 mil stir not correct

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.310
Not 50 Cal correct, but we'll leave a link in the video description for those guys

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.929
So we can all agree that that's stinkin awesome slow-mo right, but there's more to it than just cool footage

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.590
I want you to think about

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.740
Fracture mechanics think about the pressure cone as it goes down through material

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.210
And how it has to get above the minimum fracture stress in order for it to do its thing

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.509
So just think about it on a deeper level also

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:02.720
Obviously this was a collaboration video. I'm actual real-life friends with Gavin and Dan super cool dudes the way

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.850
I'm just gonna go straight to the front door here the way a

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:11.659
collaboration video works is the hope is that more of you would subscribe to smarter every day and more of you that watch smarter every

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.260
Day will go subscribe to the slow mo guys

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.510
So please consider subscribing to this video if you feel like it earned it

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.090
but

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:23.690
The most important thing here is for you to go watch the video on the slow mo guys and subscribe to them

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.440
I want to say thank you to Gavin and Dan the slow mo guys for coming out and helping

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.340
Gavin knows what he's doing and Dan knows his way around a weapon as well

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.290
Play to our strengths Yeah play to your strengths. Well. But we let Dan come out anyway, so

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.860
If you wanna check out some stuff on their channel. What are you doing over there?

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.449
We're using a mirror to shoot the camera directly in the face with a 50 Cal

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:51.379
Hopefully see the bullet coming towards my lens an ambitious shot was it uh seven five Orion where the guy was

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.110
Shooting the German was shooting with a sniper rifle

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:58.400
It just sees the guy the flash of the weapon that goes into the scope of the guys

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.689
The Germans right here less violent version of that pretty much that except no one dies

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:09.140
This is them shooting in the intro for their video right now. I think you'll dig it. Go check it out anyway. I'm Destin

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.599
You're getting smarter every day. Have a good one

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.440
So now is the part of the video where I put subscribe buttons in the corner?

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.970
And hope that you will subscribe to them

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.960
And then I do something interesting visually interesting in hopes that you will

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.580
Have your attention drawn over there and click one of the subscribe buttons

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.029
so this is my attempt to be visually interesting and

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.550
Convince you to click the subscribe my buttons

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.370
There you go
