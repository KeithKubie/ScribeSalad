00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.260
Many of us want to become entrepreneurs.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.320
Starting your own business is one of the biggest dreams of our times.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.840
But how do you get to be an entrepreneur?

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.680
Most of the advice focuses on the practicalities:

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.660
writing a business plan, raising money, finding staff, marketing and PR.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.740
We'll go down a different route.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.220
In our eyes at the heart of successful entrepreneurship lies something oddly more abstract:

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.860
an accurate insight into the causes of human unhappiness.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.740
To be an entrepreneur means, essentially, to become an expert in the things that make life difficult for people.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:45.500
That's because every properly ambitious business is in some way trying to fix things for other people.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.740
And the bigger and more original what you're trying to fix happens to be, the more successful your business can be.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.640
Because consumer society is now well developed,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.020
it may be easy to think that all the big problems out there already have thousands of fixes anyway.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.300
Think of all those car companies, or pizza outlets, or news websites.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.120
We surely have enough of everything.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.020
What could we possibly add to what's already out there?

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.340
But to get a sense of the vast opportunities that still remain in capitalism all you need to do is ask yourself:

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.700
where and in what areas you're unhappy in the course of an average day?

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.540
Every unhappiness is really a new business waiting to be born.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.020
Your frustrations are a nearly inexhaustible source of raw materials out of which the businesses of the future can be built.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.320
So while there may already be plenty of breakfast cereals, and t-shirts, and cell phones, and cab rides for sale,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.120
there's so much more that frustrates and depresses us:

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.420
think of how difficult it is to get on with one's partner, educate children, cope with anxiety,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.820
discover what you want to do with your life, find a nice place to live, calm down in the evening.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.820
One could go on and on.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.240
Our griefs and irritations are endless, thankfully for the budding entrepreneurs.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.300
The biggest first step to take towards entrepreneurship

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.620
is therefore to learn to study your own unhappiness and what might possibly heal it for you and others.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:20.020
When profits decline in businesses it's really the result of too many people throwing themselves at trying to fix the same area

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.700
'cause they can't think of anything more innovative to do rather than start a new airline, mobile phone company, or supermarket chain.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.740
And by contrast, healthy profits are a reward for understanding and mastering

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.560
an area of human distress ahead of anyone else.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.080
Of course ideas aren't enough on their own; you need to take care of practicalities and money

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.400
but they won't help you if your original psychological insight into human unhappiness isn't sound.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.280
And by the same token, if your insight into what makes people unhappy is razor sharp, and your solutions bold,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.080
then however difficult the journey,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.400
your business will stand a high chance of making money and benefiting humanity too.
