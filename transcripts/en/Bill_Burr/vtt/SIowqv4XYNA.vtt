1
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.150
Hey, what's going on? Hey, baby.

2
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.880
It's the Monday morning podcast, um, for October 8th,

3
00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:15.650
2017 what's going on? Uh, yes. I'm singing a little bit of Tom Petty.

4
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.791
Um,

5
00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:21.500
I was lucky enough to be at the Florida gators game in the swamp against the LSU

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.940
Tigers and uh,

7
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.970
bam bam bam [inaudible] fucking SCC football,

8
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.400
80,000 people, whatever the fuck it is going. Absolutely ape shit. And uh,

9
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.460
they had this great tribute, which I'm sure some of you saw the clips, uh,

10
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.060
online of, uh, the whole stadium saying, I won't back down.

11
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.340
I was fucking on, you know, it sucks the guy died,

12
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.363
<v 0>you know,</v>

13
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.370
<v 1>but he leaves all that great music and all that. What I want to, yeah,</v>

14
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:52.580
that's a great fucking, that's a great life. You know what I mean?

15
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.240
Considering all this shit that fucking happens nowadays,

16
00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:59.060
the fact that that guy was able to make it into his sixties,

17
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.140
the very least still sucks. He died, you know, but whatever, it was a great,

18
00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:06.410
it was, it was fucking awesome. You know, it was hilarious as if you were there.

19
00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:08.690
Everybody sang the shit out of that first first.

20
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.610
And then when the second verse came along,

21
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.270
you saw the radio fans and then the real Tom petty fence. Right?

22
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.010
Now everybody knew the first birds I, oh, Ella, whoa, Baghdad.

23
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.690
Noah stem, I don't know, the worst day.

24
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.050
And then all of a sudden the fucking everybody knew that

25
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.450
<v 2>Yay</v>

26
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.890
<v 1>bare, right? And then it gets to the second verse, listen to it.</v>

27
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:30.730
Everybody's just Kinda, well, ah,

28
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.910
everybody's just waiting.

29
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.380
<v 2>Hey there.</v>

30
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.680
<v 1>Easy way out. Right? So, um, anyways,</v>

31
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:47.330
we went to the swamp out there in a, in uh, Gainesville,

32
00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:50.160
Georgia, where a Tom Petty is from. Evidently, I didn't know,

33
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.530
I didn't know that until he died. And, uh, I knew he was from Florida. Um,

34
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.110
yet another great musician from Florida, right? You get all the fucking,

35
00:01:57.111 --> 00:01:59.120
all my brothers from down there, you got Tom Petty,

36
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.830
I don't know where the heartbreakers are from, but you know, I mean, he met him,

37
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:05.360
so they had to be somewhere near Florida, right?

38
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.340
Somewhere in the fucking lower 48. But, um, Jesus Christ did, uh,

39
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.160
did that stadium, Ben Hill fucking stadium, the,

40
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.670
this Aka the swamp. Did that thing ever live up to its fucking name? My God.

41
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.320
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

42
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.080
<v 1>we had upper deck seats and um,</v>

43
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.070
it was a,

44
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.880
<v 0>okay,</v>

45
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.080
<v 1>it was a, it was just fucking, it was ridiculous.</v>

46
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.320
So we go up there and they had like the aluminum seats up top,

47
00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:35.270
just like the old Patriot's stadium, you know,

48
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.000
and if you stood up during the winter time when everybody had the big winter

49
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:38.451
coats on,

50
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:41.920
if you stood up too long after a good play or most likely disappointing playback

51
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.940
, then when you went to sit back down,

52
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:46.820
you lost your seat and then you were just sort of standing up.

53
00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:49.670
You couldn't sit down and then people would pelt you with hotdogs and fucking

54
00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:52.160
snowballs and all that shit. And you know what you did,

55
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.420
you laughed and all your friends laughed at you. You didn't make a fucking,

56
00:02:56.421 --> 00:03:00.220
you didn't have a cell phone to make a video and turn into a victim,

57
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.160
you know. So, um,

58
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.470
anyways, um,

59
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.790
we were sitting up there and you literally had to just walk back into the tunnel

60
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.510
and with all that heat coming off the field and all those people,

61
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.020
they're like literally when you walked into the stadium became like a wind

62
00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:23.460
tunnel. So, and I was going out there, man,

63
00:03:23.461 --> 00:03:24.510
and I'm going to tell you right now,

64
00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:29.040
there was a bunch of people just fucking sit down all shapes and sizes,

65
00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:33.750
all ages from kids all the way to old people just sitting down like, yell,

66
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.260
I got to take a good fucking 10 minute break here or I think I'm going to

67
00:03:37.261 --> 00:03:41.040
fucking die. And then mercifully the sun started to go, by the way,

68
00:03:41.041 --> 00:03:44.760
it's October, it's October, it felt like fucking August.

69
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.360
And um, the sun finally went down and, uh, it was a great game.

70
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.950
I know, you know, the gators were missing their a starting quarterback.

71
00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:55.521
And I also know,

72
00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:59.780
obviously LSU had that horrible fucking loss last week to the Trojans, Troy.

73
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.650
And um, so it was a big win for them. It was just a fucking,

74
00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:05.720
it was a great game. Unfortunate that kid missed that field goal.

75
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.770
Everyone's chanting his name, Eddie. Eddie. You know,

76
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.140
I don't know what happened. The fucking kid missed the extra point.

77
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.350
Just kinda suck cause I would love to see an overtime. But uh,

78
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.210
there was this one LSU Fan, this old guy just, he was fucking hilarious.

79
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.550
Even like they get her fantasies, as annoying as he was,

80
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.770
he was just this old guy and he would do these stupid dances whenever LSU had

81
00:04:27.771 --> 00:04:30.350
like a big play. He looked ridiculous.

82
00:04:30.351 --> 00:04:34.070
It was making a complete ass of himself all the while having the best time of

83
00:04:34.071 --> 00:04:38.900
his life and uh, in every way. I don't know.

84
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.321
It's just,

85
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:42.290
it's one of those just one of those great fucking moments why you go to sports

86
00:04:42.291 --> 00:04:47.120
and all that shit. And uh, you know, we had a great time.

87
00:04:47.121 --> 00:04:48.710
We didn't even pay for fucking parking either.

88
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.170
And then we found out why afterwards because we were so buried in. Um,

89
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.670
but uh, it was just awesome to finally go there. Legendary school,

90
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.140
legendary fucking field.

91
00:05:00.141 --> 00:05:05.141
And I actually learned this about that field is that that field is what is in

92
00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:09.620
like the top 20 biggest stadiums in the United States. Um,

93
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.780
here they are right here, Michigan number one, number two,

94
00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:19.610
Penn state than Ohio state, Texas a and M, Tennessee. Uh,

95
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.870
LSU, Alabama, University of Texas,

96
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.840
USC, Georgia. That's the top 10.

97
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.890
Then UCLA, the cotton bowl, Nebraska,

98
00:05:30.891 --> 00:05:35.570
Florida comes in at number 14, and I was pretty psyched as far as the top 10.

99
00:05:35.571 --> 00:05:38.660
I've been to every fucking one of those stadiums except for Penn state.

100
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.340
And uh, let's see, other one, Michigan,

101
00:05:43.341 --> 00:05:45.950
Texas and Tennessee. I haven't been in Tennessee,

102
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.400
so I gotta fucking knock those out. All right. I gotta try to do that Shit.

103
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.190
I know it's fucking stupid shit. But this is what this podcast is.

104
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.340
His podcasts is stupid shit. All right.

105
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.360
Stupid Shit that doesn't matter. And then listen to me,

106
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.950
you know, all these fucking assholes. You know,

107
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.790
I've been getting letters lately of really heavy variety. It's,

108
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:09.380
I don't fucking do that on here.

109
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.890
You're listening to the wrong fucking podcast is enough of that out there.

110
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.320
This place is to forget your fucking troubles.

111
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.940
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

112
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.240
<v 1>fucking asshole. Some douchebag sent me this fucking email.</v>

113
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.490
The name of the email is fuck America,

114
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.680
and then he goes on to present his argument about gun controlled psych buddy.

115
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.520
You started it off with Fuck America. Like w how would you,

116
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.660
how is the people that you want to listen to this going to listen to it after

117
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:39.440
that? So I won't be reading that one. You know what I mean?

118
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.920
At least fucking people screaming and fucking yelling about this, about that.

119
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.480
You know what I mean? Every time there's a big fucking tragedy.

120
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.780
You know what I love now? I love how everybody's got a fucking way in now.

121
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.330
Right? And then like it becomes,

122
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.860
my favorite things is celebrities react to the hurricane.

123
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.890
You know what I mean? Like, oh good.

124
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:04.940
I need to know what Jay Lo thinks about a category five. Oh, was she,

125
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.870
was she upset that that happened to Houston? Who wouldn't be?

126
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.610
Who Do fuck wouldn't be

127
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.010
<v 3>okay.</v>

128
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.190
<v 1>I don't fucking item. I just don't understand why they do that.</v>

129
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.680
I've never fucking understood.

130
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.830
Then there'll be like a fucking earthquake and then it's always like Hashtag uh,

131
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.790
fucking, uh, thinking about, you know, wherever the fucking earthquake hit.

132
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.090
You know, it's funny about those fucking accounts. Most of those,

133
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.260
like if you're smart, I guess you don't, you don't do your own account.

134
00:07:35.261 --> 00:07:39.070
You have somebody else do it. So whenever anything bad happens,

135
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:44.220
they actually had somebody else doing it for the person so they don't get in

136
00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:48.670
trouble. They don't say the wrong fucking thing. I just,

137
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.260
everything is just become that. I missed that whole story about Cam Newton.

138
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.560
He said some smart adequately thing to a fucking female reporter.

139
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.500
Right. And rather than her just settling with them, being like,

140
00:08:04.501 --> 00:08:06.060
hey cam, why don't you go fuck yourself?

141
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.570
And then they laugh it off and they both drink a bud light or something.

142
00:08:09.571 --> 00:08:12.450
A Miller light like that used to how it used to go down.

143
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.660
All of a sudden now he showed up to the game today for some reason dress like a

144
00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:20.860
pimp, like a, I don't know what.

145
00:08:20.861 --> 00:08:23.740
And then he's got like a fucking Rosie the riveter

146
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.950
I can think of that. He's going to say all these positive shit about women.

147
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.060
I don't, I just, I don't fucking, I don't know,

148
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.300
like it's just one fucking apology after another.

149
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.433
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

150
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:40.491
<v 1>Meanwhile,</v>

151
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:44.660
the world is going to hell in a fucking hand basket and I got to fucking sit

152
00:08:44.661 --> 00:08:49.580
here and, and I'm going to watch that. I need to see the resolution of that.

153
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.760
Like these two fucking adults cannot solve this amongst themselves.

154
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.390
<v 4>I swear to God, I had was half listening to Cam Newton.</v>

155
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:04.530
I swear to God he was talking to Rosie the riveter as if it was a real person.

156
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.530
Am I out of my mind or that wasn't that like a,

157
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.570
a like a caricature that represented women working in World War II?

158
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:19.040
Was it really a woman named Rosie and her middle name was the in the last name

159
00:09:19.041 --> 00:09:23.000
was riveter. Um, I might be wrong, you know,

160
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.011
by all means.

161
00:09:25.011 --> 00:09:28.220
Let me look this up before I have to have a press conference and fucking

162
00:09:28.221 --> 00:09:32.390
apologize to somebody. Here we go. A A row

163
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.260
<v 5>z the</v>

164
00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:38.740
<v 4>the riveter. Rosie the riveter.</v>

165
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.460
All right, Rosie. The river is a cultural icon. Yes.

166
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:47.020
I'd swear to God he was fucking talking like it was my Paula.

167
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.260
Maybe he wasn't. That'll be fucking hilarious. And lastly,

168
00:09:50.261 --> 00:09:54.890
I'd like to apologize to Rosie the riveter. I know she did a lot of things. Uh,

169
00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.860
she reverted a lot of rivets back, uh, down there by the river. And,

170
00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.720
uh, I apologize.

171
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.513
<v 3>Um,</v>

172
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.520
<v 4>here's something I wish people in the press could do.</v>

173
00:10:06.521 --> 00:10:08.590
I wish they could get their balls broken a little bit more,

174
00:10:08.591 --> 00:10:10.750
especially if you got, if you kind of go in the locker room,

175
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.690
you know what I mean? If you're going to fucking go in there,

176
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.330
people are going to bust your chops like the athletes.

177
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.810
Like they should be able to sit there and be like,

178
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.940
what did you say you bald fat fuck,

179
00:10:21.941 --> 00:10:24.640
who couldn't run 30 yards without having a heart attack?

180
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.910
What was your question about Mike? My decision in the second quarter.

181
00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:29.440
Why can't they do that?

182
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.410
I don't understand why they can't do that.

183
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:34.880
<v 3>Okay.</v>

184
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.020
<v 4>What'd you say lady?</v>

185
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.033
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

186
00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.310
<v 4>Um, you address me as Ms Sports reporter.</v>

187
00:10:43.311 --> 00:10:45.220
I'll go fucking fuck yourself.

188
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.830
That stupid ass story is it?

189
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:54.950
We'll get more fucking coverage than pharmaceutical companies basically being

190
00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:57.910
heroin dealers. You know what I mean?

191
00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.450
They're not gonna fuck with that cause they advertise on that channel,

192
00:11:01.451 --> 00:11:06.451
but God forbid somebody throws one high and tight at somebody with a fucking

193
00:11:06.701 --> 00:11:10.480
clam and all of a sudden all js is the whole fucking world stops.

194
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.480
I'm not saying he shouldn't apologize. They should fucking handle it this thick.

195
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.160
He didn't say it to me. The fuck am I sitting there watching it for?

196
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.333
<v 3>I don't know.</v>

197
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.950
<v 4>We lost like advertising money. I mean,</v>

198
00:11:26.951 --> 00:11:28.740
who can even fucking remember like what?

199
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.850
What do you know you only one thing I can ever remember,

200
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.180
this is some of the greatest advertising I guess because I can remember was

201
00:11:34.181 --> 00:11:35.980
Shaquille O'Neal did it,

202
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:41.040
did a bunch of Buick ads and that was the funniest fucking thing ever because in

203
00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:42.970
a lot of people, instantly when they saw it,

204
00:11:42.971 --> 00:11:45.040
it's like Shaq doesn't drive a fucking Buick.

205
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.220
It's one of the top 50 NBA players of all time.

206
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.460
The fuck did he do with his money that he's driving a Buick? He would've,

207
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.230
he blew all his God damn from being a player.

208
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.740
<v 1>We still got a TV gig. He's not driving a Buick.</v>

209
00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.240
You can't even fucking fit in one.

210
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.490
Maybe though that fucking Roadmaster for back in the 50s,

211
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.010
cut the roof off of Riviera. Maybe. I don't know. Take out the front seat.

212
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:10.630
He could sit in the back end. I Dunno.

213
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:14.150
<v 0>Um,</v>

214
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.470
<v 1>actually Shaq is memorable.</v>

215
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:21.120
I Dunno why he does that. And then he is the one with the little monopoly guy,

216
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.790
the general, which just looks like the cheesiest fucking insurance ever,

217
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.810
you know, and then check does that, you know, I'm not really smiling.

218
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:33.460
I'm just smiling because I'm going to get paid.

219
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.770
You know where he has the under and the overbite?

220
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.700
He just puts his top teeth on his bottom teeth.

221
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.100
<v 0>Um,</v>

222
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.170
<v 1>I dunno what the fuck I'm talking about. I usually, like I said,</v>

223
00:12:45.171 --> 00:12:47.890
I usually don't fucking do these when I fly in the same day. I just,

224
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.020
of course I have no fucking time. I have a million fucking things to do.

225
00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.600
Um, [inaudible] what else? What else? What else? Oh, should I address this?

226
00:12:56.601 --> 00:12:57.620
I will address this,

227
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.090
the big fucking story that everybody's talking about out there.

228
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.290
I am of the firm fucking belief. I am of the firm fucking belief.

229
00:13:06.291 --> 00:13:08.300
This is a new theory. I'm not saying I'm right,

230
00:13:08.301 --> 00:13:13.301
but I am of the fucking belief that the fucking attention that they give to

231
00:13:13.401 --> 00:13:18.080
these fucking lunatics is why more than ever people do that lunatic shit.

232
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:19.660
<v 0>Okay?</v>

233
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.490
<v 1>Like do you remember when Kim Kardashians,</v>

234
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.750
she made that sex tape and then all of a sudden somebody got ahold of it and

235
00:13:25.751 --> 00:13:30.751
then it went out there and then it became like this porno tape and up until then

236
00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:34.550
that was unbelievably embarrassing and it fucking ruined you.

237
00:13:34.551 --> 00:13:36.530
And then that was it. That was fucking it.

238
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.180
But somehow she came out the other side with the TV show and is now like a

239
00:13:41.181 --> 00:13:45.350
fucking again icon, multi fucking millionaire. And right after that happened,

240
00:13:45.351 --> 00:13:46.184
what happened?

241
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:50.810
A bunch of women who wouldn't have done that shit went out and tried to do that

242
00:13:50.811 --> 00:13:55.090
shit cause they saw it and what stopped it was none of it.

243
00:13:55.091 --> 00:13:58.010
None of them fucking made it. However,

244
00:13:58.011 --> 00:14:00.710
if they started fucking making it and started getting attention the way these

245
00:14:00.711 --> 00:14:04.040
lunatics do, I saw on the cover of people magazine,

246
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.730
they let go and this is the deadliest, Yada, Yada, Yada. All fucking time.

247
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.390
You're given these, these fucking lunatics a number to now shoot for.

248
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:14.450
<v 0>Wow.</v>

249
00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.870
<v 1>Cause the same way I sat on TV and I sat at home and TV and I'm said,</v>

250
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.970
oh look at that. Stand up. Stand up comedy. It looks cool.

251
00:14:19.971 --> 00:14:23.120
I want to fucking do that. Lunatics want to do this other shit.

252
00:14:23.121 --> 00:14:26.690
I am of affirm fucking belief. They should not fucking,

253
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.583
<v 0>yeah.</v>

254
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:29.800
<v 1>Shouldn't say the dude's name.</v>

255
00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.113
<v 0>That's it.</v>

256
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:33.970
<v 1>You go in, you whack the guy,</v>

257
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:37.720
you throw him in a fucking incinerator and then you throw his ashes in a fucking

258
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:39.790
sewer. That's it.

259
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:40.830
<v 0>Okay.</v>

260
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.890
<v 1>All right. And then you'd take care of whoever got fucking hurt.</v>

261
00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.210
That's what you do. All right.

262
00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:48.570
But all this fucking shit that you then put it on the top and then you know,

263
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.070
one of these fucking channels they're going to,

264
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.300
they're going to begin to do like they do with the serial killers. You know,

265
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:54.560
you never know the victim's names.

266
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.290
You just know that those fucking people and all the fucking celebrities,

267
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.690
you know who, if they even run their goddamn accounts,

268
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:01.490
then they've got a fucking comment about it.

269
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.060
They'll celebrity reaction to the tragedy where they weren't at, you know,

270
00:15:05.061 --> 00:15:07.280
something else. I fucking, I'm on a rant. You know what else I liked?

271
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.030
I liked all these douchebags who were taken videos of themselves.

272
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.860
They weren't anywhere near it. Hey, just letting everybody know that I'm right.

273
00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:18.650
It's like, yeah, Dude, you're 20 fucking miles down the street.

274
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:23.990
Who the fuck even knew you were there? Who are you making this for?

275
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:26.390
You can't just text your friends and be like, yeah, dude, I'm cool.

276
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:28.803
<v 0>I don't know.</v>

277
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.790
<v 1>Everything has got to be about, everybody's got to make it about themselves.</v>

278
00:15:32.791 --> 00:15:36.720
I fuck it. It drives me up. The fucking wall drives me up the fucking wall.

279
00:15:36.721 --> 00:15:38.400
I have no solution for this shit, but I,

280
00:15:38.401 --> 00:15:43.401
I do firmly fucking believe that they have to stop making these,

281
00:15:44.341 --> 00:15:49.110
these fucking lunatics famous and ranking.

282
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.390
You know, the body count. Um, I, I might be wrong.

283
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.510
The fuck do I know I'm a comedian. Okay, I'll,

284
00:15:56.511 --> 00:16:00.030
I'll apologize next week I'll wear a fucking, uh,

285
00:16:00.031 --> 00:16:03.810
Ted Bundy button on a pimp hat and I'll fucking apologize to somebody. I guess.

286
00:16:03.811 --> 00:16:06.750
I don't know what I'm all right. There you go. I'm done.

287
00:16:06.751 --> 00:16:11.250
I'm done with my fucking rant there. Um, anyways,

288
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.520
what else? What else? So yes, I went to the fucking, uh,

289
00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.490
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers game.

290
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.203
<v 0>Um,</v>

291
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.670
<v 1>that just fine. That shit just drives me nuts.</v>

292
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.280
It's not about so-and-so's fucking reactions,

293
00:16:25.281 --> 00:16:28.190
but the people that were there and then the people came in and fucking helped

294
00:16:28.191 --> 00:16:31.340
the people. It's not about the lunatic that did it. It's about those people.

295
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.670
That's what it's about. It's about you down the street.

296
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.820
Now he's fucking there and I fucking,

297
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.740
the DJ stopped playing records and I was like, well, what's going on?

298
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.120
<v 0>Um,</v>

299
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.110
<v 1>anyways, I had a, I went to a,</v>

300
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.970
I went to the fucking Buccaneers game, the pirate ship one,

301
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:55.970
not the Choo Choo train. It's very confusing for Boston sports fans. Okay.

302
00:16:55.971 --> 00:16:58.100
We got one with a pirate ship, one with a Choo Choo train,

303
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.140
and our fans were fucking great.

304
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.640
Great Goddamn fans love the stadium and a, you know,

305
00:17:04.641 --> 00:17:06.000
it's funny you could tell that they,

306
00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:10.850
they built the pirate ship first and then they put the flat screen,

307
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.960
that giant screen afterwards because the Buccaneers won a super bowl,

308
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:18.680
I believe the 2002 season.

309
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.670
And I remember vaguely remember them.

310
00:17:22.671 --> 00:17:26.150
They brought the flag up and they put it up on the ship, which was cool.

311
00:17:26.151 --> 00:17:28.190
You know what I mean? That Buccaneers, their pirates or whatever,

312
00:17:28.191 --> 00:17:32.210
they got the ship or whatever. Right. But now they got this giant flat screen,

313
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:35.810
so the fucking championship flag was blocking the TV screen.

314
00:17:35.811 --> 00:17:40.811
So now their Superbowl flag is made out of Mesh and it's difficult to see.

315
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.220
It's like you want a Superbowl should be a giant fucking flag,

316
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.870
move the ship or fucking put the the championship flag somewhere else.

317
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.170
Maybe they have another one. I couldn't see it, but that struck me as funny.

318
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.820
You know what I mean? And it also made me like Tampa Bay. Well I'm just going,

319
00:17:59.821 --> 00:18:02.060
look at these fleets, fuck gay only. They don't have a zillion dollars.

320
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.470
That just added onto this thing. Like somebody bought a house,

321
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.410
then they got a little money, they put a fucking addition on it, you know,

322
00:18:07.411 --> 00:18:11.280
and somebody bought a boat, then a recession happened, you know,

323
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:13.230
then he came back to the good times.

324
00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:16.350
He bought a big fucking TV and then they gotta adjust the sales.

325
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.291
You know, it's white.

326
00:18:20.291 --> 00:18:23.820
You ever see like a degenerate gamblers sitting there playing cards you always

327
00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:28.770
see like, like signs of when they want. They'll ever go really shiny bracelet,

328
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:34.410
you know, dirty hat, but like $500 sunglasses. It's just like,

329
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.830
it's up and down, up and down, up and down. Look the whole fucking wardrobe.

330
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:40.110
<v 3>Okay.</v>

331
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:44.980
<v 1>Dirty jeans with like a fucking wearing a mink. Um,</v>

332
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.580
anyways, so we went there, had a great time.

333
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:50.640
Was it barest by this one patriots fan who just would not sit down?

334
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.100
It was this fucking, you know,

335
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.670
this guy with like 140 pounds and he never got the shit kicked out of him

336
00:18:56.671 --> 00:19:00.390
clearly. And he just wouldn't sit down and people argue, well this is right.

337
00:19:00.391 --> 00:19:03.780
If he wants to stand up, it's like, but there's, you know, this is this guy.

338
00:19:03.781 --> 00:19:06.180
He brought his girlfriend, she's short, she can't see around him.

339
00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:10.020
There's nobody standing in front of them. And there's patriots. Fran was like,

340
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.730
you know, threatening to punch him in his forgot,

341
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.160
but I punch you right in your fucking ear.

342
00:19:14.161 --> 00:19:16.680
It was really like patriots fans arguing with patriots fit.

343
00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.610
It's fucking hilarious. And I saw that we even won the game.

344
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.570
We came out of the stadium and I saw there was a group of fucking patriots fans

345
00:19:24.571 --> 00:19:27.060
and they were like arguing with each other and I just heard it vaguely or this

346
00:19:27.061 --> 00:19:31.250
guy going to, why can't I wear a Teddy Bruschi Jersey if you can fuck away.

347
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.500
But then they just kind of walked by. Um,

348
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.790
<v 3>yeah.</v>

349
00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.410
<v 1>But anyways, it was a, uh, it was a great time and I,</v>

350
00:19:38.411 --> 00:19:40.800
we had a great show out there and then the next day,

351
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:45.630
all sober bill 53 fucking days in, uh,

352
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.260
we rode up to the swamp and uh,

353
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:54.000
listen to Ozzy on the way up because on the way up there, you kind of go, not,

354
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.130
you get like within like 10 miles.

355
00:19:56.131 --> 00:20:01.131
I think if you take the 75 north of where Randy Rhoads died.

356
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.460
So we listened to some early Ozzy early, uh,

357
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.780
Solo Ozzie I should say on the way up. And uh,

358
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:10.800
just had a great time.

359
00:20:10.801 --> 00:20:15.180
Pulled in fucking smoked a cigar at a great fucking time.

360
00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:17.910
Got To go to another sec game. It was, it was a great time.

361
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:21.390
Definitely a great time. So thank you to everybody came out. I will definitely,

362
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.630
uh, definitely be back. I think the next time I come back,

363
00:20:24.631 --> 00:20:28.830
maybe I'll go back for a Florida state. I've been to Miami,

364
00:20:28.831 --> 00:20:33.540
I bet to a, I bet. Did a gator, so like, oh,

365
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.070
ain't left, really is Florida state. And then they sent one, like,

366
00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:39.550
is it central Florida? There's another one that always has a lot of NFL players.

367
00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.990
Is it southern Florida? Something like that. I can't remember. Whatever,

368
00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:48.400
whatever. I'll figure it out. Um, oh that Patriot's fan wouldn't sit down.

369
00:20:48.401 --> 00:20:52.220
He had a Tom Brady fucking jersey on in salmon shorts and everyone's going,

370
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.480
don't you sit down and shut the fuck down? First time somebody said, sit down.

371
00:20:55.481 --> 00:20:58.600
And he goes, he turns around and goes, you would ask, we nicely, little shit,

372
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:03.340
little fucking guy. Um, and now like a stocky,

373
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:08.470
now I'll get tied. Domi built little guy. This was just a slight man and,

374
00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.570
uh, I dunno, was taking sports way too seriously. I remember we, we,

375
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.620
we got a first down, like a big first down at the end of the game.

376
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.150
And he did like that. And you know, that,

377
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.770
remember that Jordan thing that he would do,

378
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.900
we'd make a fist and he fucking bring his arm up. You know,

379
00:21:21.901 --> 00:21:26.020
when he sank the fucking shot and it was over, he fucking did that.

380
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.860
You know, when, when the Patriots got a first down,

381
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.570
he had fucking lower just sticking out and shit his ass.

382
00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.650
I don't know what the fuck,

383
00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.980
just looking at the Luna Tech and he just wouldn't sit down.

384
00:21:37.981 --> 00:21:41.400
And finally Barnett got him to sit down. I can't tell you what he said.

385
00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.710
I can tell you what it started with. He said, hey, Jyzelle

386
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.450
sit the fuck down. And I can't say the rest, cause everybody, you know,

387
00:21:48.451 --> 00:21:52.910
everybody, everybody gets all fucking uptight now. Uh, but you know what?

388
00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:53.744
It was effective.

389
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.480
He sat the fuck down and did not get up for the rest of the game.

390
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.210
And when he did,

391
00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:00.870
he's a few times he got up on big plays and everything else got up and they sat

392
00:22:00.871 --> 00:22:04.620
down. Then he was finally a fucking gentleman of up. Um,

393
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.710
here's an interesting question. Paul Versey asked me on the ride back, he goes,

394
00:22:10.711 --> 00:22:12.180
do you believe in destiny?

395
00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:14.930
<v 3>Okay?</v>

396
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.530
<v 1>And I told him, no, he goes down, I'm just asking like,</v>

397
00:22:18.531 --> 00:22:23.300
do you believe like Michael Jordan was destined to be the greatest basketball?

398
00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:25.880
And I was like, no, I don't. I don't.

399
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:31.820
And he was saying that he did that he believed that you, it's just, you,

400
00:22:31.821 --> 00:22:34.580
you have your destiny and one of your destiny is like,

401
00:22:34.581 --> 00:22:38.540
that's what the fuck your destiny is. And I just don't believe that.

402
00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.470
I don't, you know what I mean?

403
00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:47.360
I think you're born with the talent and if you work your fucking ass off,

404
00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.230
you can make it happen. However,

405
00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.080
how fucked up the world is,

406
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:57.530
there's a bunch of people that can take your destiny away from you. Like,

407
00:22:57.531 --> 00:23:01.550
you could fucking have a, you know, your Destiny's to be whatever,

408
00:23:01.551 --> 00:23:03.830
you're going to be a doctor and fucking Baba Baba.

409
00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.760
And then you go out one day you drive down the street and you get hit and by a

410
00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:11.090
drunk driver and you die. So like that was your,

411
00:23:11.091 --> 00:23:14.130
that your destiny was to get hit by a drunk driver? I don't, I don't think that,

412
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.430
I don't think it is. I don't think it is.

413
00:23:16.431 --> 00:23:20.480
I think if the world was a perfect place, everybody would reach their potential.

414
00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.650
But, um, you know, I've said this before, like I,

415
00:23:24.651 --> 00:23:27.320
the world doesn't give a shit about your dream whether it comes true or not.

416
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.233
It's fucking sucks.

417
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.940
And even if you make all the right choices and all that shit, you know,

418
00:23:31.941 --> 00:23:36.230
some fucking lunatic can, uh, you know, take it away from you.

419
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:40.670
So, um, see this is why I don't talk about that shit.

420
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:46.200
All you conch asking me about it. I don't want to fucking talk its worlds

421
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.430
<v 6>depressing enough as it is. Um, all right.</v>

422
00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:53.090

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.990
I know this has been like a fucked up podcast cause I'm trying to talk around a

443
00:25:00.991 --> 00:25:05.130
lot of shit and you know, and yet another one of my fucking friends died,

444
00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:09.870
coworkers died and uh, it's just fucking fucking sucks.

445
00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.550
It sucks. You know, Ralphie make the great,

446
00:25:14.551 --> 00:25:19.551
Ralphie may unfortunately passed away this weekend and uh,

447
00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.020
just legit, legit, legit fucking murderer.

448
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.770
That guy just fucking killed. He killed from the first time I saw,

449
00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.330
I think it was, um,

450
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:40.400
was it the late nineties when he came out? I believe it was the late nineties.

451
00:25:40.401 --> 00:25:44.570
He came out and there was already another comic there. Bigger guy,

452
00:25:44.571 --> 00:25:48.170
Ron Lester, who also is since fucking passed away unfortunately,

453
00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.600
which I didn't even realize he died last year.

454
00:25:50.601 --> 00:25:55.150
So rested peace to him and um, you know,

455
00:25:55.151 --> 00:25:57.940
those big guys had to deal with like clubs.

456
00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.860
They kind of had this thing where they just, you know,

457
00:25:59.861 --> 00:26:03.620
they had their big guy comic and uh,

458
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:08.880
so it was like weird. They almost were like in competition with each other. And,

459
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.480
um,

460
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.390
then Ron ended up getting all this acting work and he just sort of stopped doing

461
00:26:12.391 --> 00:26:15.270
standup, but Ralphie came in and just was just a fucking,

462
00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:20.580
was a force to be dealt with. And um, you know,

463
00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.140
it just fucking sucks.

464
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.140
I remember you was telling me he was gonna teach me how to smoked meat or

465
00:26:26.141 --> 00:26:28.870
whatever like that. You know, cause he was just going,

466
00:26:28.871 --> 00:26:31.300
you don't know how to do it, Bill. He's like, he from fucking Massachusetts,

467
00:26:31.301 --> 00:26:33.640
I'm from Tennessee, I'm going to show you how to do it, blah, blah, blah.

468
00:26:33.641 --> 00:26:36.670
And of course we both got busy. We never got around to doing it.

469
00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:41.260
And I know he's got two little kids, so, um,

470
00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.430
I imagine someone's putting together benefit somewhere for it.

471
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:48.810
So I imagine I'll be doing that. But um, yeah,

472
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.620
it was just a fucking, just a fucking sad, sad time.

473
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.520
God dammit. Um, I remember I did the,

474
00:26:56.521 --> 00:27:01.050
I the traveling virus tour with him. I did a lot of gigs with that guy.

475
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:05.310
Like a lot of those, uh, sort of, you know, I dunno,

476
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.100
he was much younger than me, but not much. I'm 49,

477
00:27:08.101 --> 00:27:11.310
he was 45 we came up roughly,

478
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.980
he started younger than I did. That's what it was. Cause he,

479
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:18.750
we both kind of started at the same time, I want to say. So, um,

480
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.350
he was always as seasoned as I was.

481
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:25.920
So I always felt like I felt like we were the same age even though I was older

482
00:27:25.921 --> 00:27:30.300
than he was. So as we went up, I just, a lot of comedy festivals,

483
00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:35.730
a lot of tours, the tours always got better. He was the guy who told you this.

484
00:27:35.731 --> 00:27:38.370
He was, Ralphie may was the fucking guy.

485
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.290
I remember I did this Gig Chu, she'll coot Charlie's, which is a great Gig,

486
00:27:43.291 --> 00:27:45.420
but they fucking accommodations were,

487
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.320
was the worst accommodations I ever had was up in Alaska.

488
00:27:49.321 --> 00:27:54.321
And I showed up and the bed literally was broken and it looked like,

489
00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:01.650
it looked like the bed bugs like left.

490
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.620
Like they couldn't hack it. We're like, fuck this.

491
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:08.020
And I remember the boards were busted in the,

492
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.000
the mattress was like fucking attic giant,

493
00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:15.960
creasing it and shit. And I was, you know,

494
00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:21.780
raised Catholic or whatever. So rather than expressing that you didn't like it,

495
00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:26.070
you just just took it and just was like, alright, I gotta be tough.

496
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.210
I gotta fucking,

497
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:31.270
I told you the first night is spent in fucking my walkthrough bedroom.

498
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.280
My first night in New York City, I felt this thing on my chest and I,

499
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:38.760
I turned on the light and there was a roach crawling across my chest and I

500
00:28:38.761 --> 00:28:41.670
flicked it off my fucking chest. I didn't even kill it.

501
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:46.410
I just thought it was like, oh, this is what I gotta I gotta like a,

502
00:28:46.411 --> 00:28:48.420
I gotta get myself tough enough to handle this.

503
00:28:48.421 --> 00:28:51.870
Like I'm going to live with bugs crawling over me. Yeah,

504
00:28:51.871 --> 00:28:53.790
I'm a fucking load a tech. I don't know what. So anyways,

505
00:28:53.791 --> 00:28:55.790
so I do the Gig and I stay in that shit all.

506
00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:01.470
So I end up going down to the laugh factory like a week or 10 days later.

507
00:29:01.471 --> 00:29:05.940
And I walk in. Raffi was always hanging out, always did the work, you know,

508
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.880
and I came down and he was just like, hey bill, what's up? I say, hey man,

509
00:29:08.881 --> 00:29:12.840
he goes way coming from, that's what we always asked each other. Um,

510
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:17.850
there was certain guys, you know, that were just road dogs. Hedberg Ralphie,

511
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:22.980
Stan Hope, Geraldo. Like these were, these were the guys.

512
00:29:22.981 --> 00:29:26.490
Every time I went to a fucking club, um,

513
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.320
they either were just there or they were going to be there the next week.

514
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.290
I just, when I was coming up, we were all kind of close in the same rooms.

515
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.100
Like Hedberg was, I had a little bit ahead of me as was Stan hope. Um,

516
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:42.821
and those, but those,

517
00:29:42.821 --> 00:29:47.350
they were roughly my age and those are guys that I really looked up to as far as

518
00:29:47.351 --> 00:29:51.370
like, you know, they were just, they were like,

519
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:55.180
they started a few years before me, so they were just sort of cutting this

520
00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.270
path. And they, and their style is like, I want to do that.

521
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.850
I want to say what the fuck I want to say on stay.

522
00:30:03.851 --> 00:30:06.910
I don't want to do what they're doing. I want to, you know,

523
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:11.080
be who the fuck I am. The way they are was basically it. So anyways,

524
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.990
we used to always ask each other, where you coming from?

525
00:30:13.991 --> 00:30:18.790
Where you going or whatever. Right. Whenever I ran to any of those guys. And um,

526
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.600
so I run into Ralphie and he goes, where are you coming from? I was like,

527
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:26.620
I did that Gig up in Alaska. Chilkoot Charlie's like, ah, fuck. I did that Gig.

528
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.690
Great Gig as like, yeah, great gig. And I was like,

529
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.120
Jesus Christ ago about that comedy Condo and Ralph,

530
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.590
we got this serious look on his face. He goes, he goes, I didn't stay there.

531
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.430
I go, what do you mean? He goes, man, he goes, I took one look at that place.

532
00:30:39.431 --> 00:30:40.540
He goes, I'm not staying here.

533
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:44.890
And they got me a hotel room and I just looked at him and I said,

534
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.550
you could do that. And he laughed. He goes, yeah. He goes,

535
00:30:48.551 --> 00:30:51.190
what the fuck they got to do? He goes, it's Alaska.

536
00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:55.540
They're gonna get another fucking comedian to fly six hours all the way up

537
00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:58.960
there, have some lumberjack, go on stage and tell some street jokes. It's like,

538
00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:03.140
just, just say no. And, uh, that was one of those things I,

539
00:31:03.141 --> 00:31:07.180
I fucking learned that. I was just like, all right. And after that, after that,

540
00:31:07.181 --> 00:31:11.410
if I went someplace, I just, and it was a shit. All I just said no.

541
00:31:11.411 --> 00:31:14.410
And if they just said, we're not paying for a hotel room, I said, you know what?

542
00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:17.740
I'm gonna, I'm gonna pay for a fucking hotel room.

543
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:24.120
And it was worth it to just be able to go back to a fucking place where you felt

544
00:31:24.611 --> 00:31:27.970
safe and you didn't feel like there was going to be bugs crawling on you or

545
00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:29.980
somebody just all over the fucking bar.

546
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.560
God knows what fucked some chicken or period.

547
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.470
Not even going to tell you that fucking story of a comedian knows that.

548
00:31:35.471 --> 00:31:40.180
Fucking want their God damn fucking crime scene cleaning lady quit.

549

That would be the best thing you've ever slept on for couples.

You know what I would love?

667
00:38:49.061 --> 00:38:53.410
I would love a mattress that when I fall asleep with a glass of booze in my

668
00:38:53.411 --> 00:38:55.810
hand, it doesn't spill on my pajamas.

But that's the old me and I gotta be honest with you.

our, my mom and her boyfriend being selfish or am I,

690
00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.610
uh, by the way, the person who will fuck you. America. I'm not saying that you,

691
00:40:30.611 --> 00:40:32.050
that you didn't make some decent points there,

692
00:40:32.051 --> 00:40:35.140
but it's a waste of time for you to write that for me to read it after you write

693
00:40:35.141 --> 00:40:35.561
that. All right,

694
00:40:35.561 --> 00:40:38.980
why don't you grow the fuck up and come up with a more mature title?

695
00:40:38.981 --> 00:40:42.880
And I'll read that one. How about that? How about that? How about that?

696
00:40:42.881 --> 00:40:47.350
And then I'll wade into the topic of gun control is if I know a fucking thing

697
00:40:47.351 --> 00:40:51.700
about it or even have a solution, our, my mom and her boyfriend being selfish,

698
00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:52.930
or am I dear bill,

699
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:58.200
I'm 19 and live at home working to get this carpenter's apprenticeship with the

700
00:40:58.391 --> 00:41:02.020
local union. And please don't say my name on the podcast. Well,

701
00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:05.880
why would you give me your name? You fucking moron. Um,

702
00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.180
about two months ago,

703
00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:11.230
my mom's boyfriend started coming over and staying over to a point where he was

704
00:41:11.231 --> 00:41:15.310
practically living their gross. Uh,

705
00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.770
they would stay here and this place,

706
00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:22.420
they would stay here in his place. Exactly half the time.

707
00:41:22.421 --> 00:41:26.410
The first three days he was here, I heard there headboard day and night.

708
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.890
I was like, who the fuck is this guy? Oh my God,

709
00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:36.500
boy. Oh boy. My mom said they had been friends for a year now,

710
00:41:36.501 --> 00:41:37.940
but only went on two dates.

711
00:41:37.941 --> 00:41:42.590
I asked her to have them not be here as much and if she could just come home

712
00:41:42.591 --> 00:41:44.330
without him. I don't want him.

713
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:49.180
I don't want to talk to my mom with this guy right fucking there. Uh,

714
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:52.670
nothing changed until one night I snapped in one on a rampage.

715
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:57.770
My mom called the cops on me that night and now the half the time they would,

716
00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:02.690
they would have spent here is just my mom now. But here's the kicker.

717
00:42:02.691 --> 00:42:05.180
So that's good. You've got 'em out of the house. But here's the kicker.

718
00:42:05.181 --> 00:42:08.660
Two weeks later he proposed, oh boy.

719
00:42:08.661 --> 00:42:11.030
When my mom talked to me about it,

720
00:42:11.031 --> 00:42:14.600
she asked if I had a problem with her wearing the ring. Literally,

721
00:42:14.601 --> 00:42:17.420
the question was only about the ring, not the engagement.

722
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:21.680
I feel totally disrespected by him and my mom for not seeing that this guy has

723
00:42:21.681 --> 00:42:23.150
no respect for her son.

724
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:27.920
I've decided to join the coast guard because the union stuff is taking too long.

725
00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:32.720
I would have just moved in with my dad if every day he didn't just bring out how

726
00:42:32.721 --> 00:42:35.870
much of a bitch my mom is. Jesus Christ. Dude, this is awful, man.

727
00:42:35.871 --> 00:42:37.580
I'm sorry you're going through this and I was,

728
00:42:37.581 --> 00:42:41.390
life sucks and it can't and I can't be around that. Uh,

729
00:42:41.391 --> 00:42:45.770
I'm ready to walk away and just dropped my family entirely, entirely.

730
00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:48.500
My Mom's swears this guy's a super, super nice,

731
00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:52.580
but he doesn't give a fuck about her life as a mother and subsequently me.

732
00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:53.720
Or maybe I'm wrong.

733
00:42:53.721 --> 00:42:57.530
I just wanted to get another opinion because I'm ready to just cut off everyone

734
00:42:57.531 --> 00:42:59.960
in my family and walk away. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Well,

735
00:42:59.961 --> 00:43:03.770
it's your mom and your dad. You don't want to do that. Um, you know,

736
00:43:03.771 --> 00:43:05.420
I could see why you want to get out of the house.

737
00:43:05.421 --> 00:43:09.920
When gave somebody bang your fucking mother. I mean, Jesus Christ a mom.

738
00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:11.540
How about doggy staff? You know what I mean?

739
00:43:11.541 --> 00:43:16.240
You always got to be in the fucking missionary position. Um, something for,

740
00:43:16.241 --> 00:43:21.040
for Christ's sake. And you slide down the bed a little more. Um,

741
00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:23.510
alright. Well until you move out,

742
00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:25.970
I would recommend getting some wireless headphones.

743
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:29.320
Maybe those Bose ones that block out the fucking noise.

744
00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.270
I don't know what to tell you dude. Um,

745
00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:37.070
I wouldn't join the coast guard unless you wanted to. Uh,

746
00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.950
or the coast guard sounds. That sounds like a great fucking job to me.

747
00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.710
Although I did fucking talk about, you know,

748
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:46.280
that time I went on that thing about like whenever a fucking hurricanes come in

749
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.730
on everybody's, you know, going to safety,

750
00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.890
like how everybody in the coast guard is just like,

751
00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:54.560
and they got to be on pins and needles cause they know some dumb fucks going to

752
00:43:54.561 --> 00:43:58.100
take this stupid boat out there and then when they fuck up and then they call to

753
00:43:58.101 --> 00:43:59.900
rescue them, these poor men.

754
00:43:59.901 --> 00:44:02.960
And women are going to have to go out and go fish them out. Um,

755
00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:06.410
all right. So what are you asking me here?

756
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:11.090
I would not cut out your mother and your father. Uh, I would tell,

757
00:44:11.091 --> 00:44:15.410
I would communicate to your mother how you feel about that guy and now you don't

758
00:44:15.411 --> 00:44:19.190
feel that he respects you. Okay. And that's the reason you're leaving, I guess.

759
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:21.440
And then I would talk to you dad saying, you know, dad,

760
00:44:21.441 --> 00:44:22.310
I would love to stay with you,

761
00:44:22.311 --> 00:44:24.650
but all you do is bitch and say what a bitch my mother is.

762
00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:27.800
And she's my mom and I am sick of listening to it. All right?

763
00:44:27.801 --> 00:44:31.980
Just try to say it in a nicer fucking way. But um, I

764
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.900
<v 1>don't, it doesn't sound like they're hearing you. Ah Fuck.</v>

765
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.000
But here's the thing, dude, if you're going to be, you can't,

766
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:41.850
you gotta fucking clear the air with them because you can't go into the coast

767
00:44:41.851 --> 00:44:44.130
guard in angry fucking lunatic.

768
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.800
Cause what's going to happen is you're going to get into a fight or something

769
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.500
cause you pissed off at that fucking Douche who's banging your mom.

770
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:53.520
And then that's going to affect your career. So, uh,

771
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:57.580
this is something that I've been working on. This is fucking brutal. Uh,

772
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:58.740
forgiving people

773
00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:04.660
like that guy you got to somewhere in your head and just forgive the guy for

774
00:45:04.661 --> 00:45:09.580
being a fucking moron and see, get that off of you.

775
00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:16.120
And, uh, you know, when you forgive somebody, it does,

776
00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:19.210
it does a lot for you. It gets it off for you.

777
00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:23.020
And then what you should be focusing on is trying

778
00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:29.540
to figure out what your dream is and start walking towards it every day and uh,

779
00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.380
and creating a life

780
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:37.930
that isn't like what you grew up with so your kid someday doesn't have to

781
00:45:37.961 --> 00:45:41.710
fucking deal with what you dealt with. And, uh, you know,

782
00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.090
and that doesn't happen overnight.

783
00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:47.410
And the mistakes I made was I went out thinking, all right, I wanna,

784
00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:50.890
I wanna change all this about what I didn't like about growing up.

785
00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.630
But then what happens is you grew up,

786
00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:55.570
you gravitate towards what's familiar and you end up re,

787
00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:00.550
I think he kinda go out and recreate it. Um, inevitably.

788
00:46:00.551 --> 00:46:03.160
And then you have to dismantle that start over again.

789
00:46:03.161 --> 00:46:04.120
At least that's what happened to me.

790
00:46:04.121 --> 00:46:06.790
I'm up super imposed and whatever the fuck happened to me. But uh,

791
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:12.430
uh, I wouldn't come at your mother or your are or your dad with anger.

792
00:46:12.431 --> 00:46:17.140
I would just say, listen, I, uh, I, I forgive you.

793
00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.110
I forgive you. I'm not happy with this. I forgive you.

794
00:46:20.111 --> 00:46:22.270
I understand you gotta try, try to do what's right for you.

795
00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:27.310
But this bothered me because x, y, and Z. And just say, tell you that's a dad.

796
00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:29.980
You know, some, I gotta forgive you for something and they'll get his attention.

797
00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:34.090
I forgive you for every time that I came over here and you went on and on about

798
00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:37.790
what a fucking bitch my mother was alright at,

799
00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:42.520
did a lot of damage and it did so much damage that I have to sit here and try to

800
00:46:42.521 --> 00:46:44.200
figure out how to forgive you for that.

801
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:48.660
And then just stop talking to him and listen to what he says. Okay.

802
00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:49.800
If he's any sort of a man,

803
00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:52.290
his head's going to drop and he's going to fucking apologize to you.

804
00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:55.860
And you can, you know, and I'm not saying that at all.

805
00:46:55.861 --> 00:46:58.360
The anger you're going to have towards them goes away. Right. Then it,

806
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:59.131
you start that.

807
00:46:59.131 --> 00:47:04.131
And if you guys work on starting over from that point and really fucking work on

808
00:47:04.531 --> 00:47:07.740
it and really fucking communicate, uh,

809
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:11.340
hopefully you can go out into the world and not be an angry young man like I was

810
00:47:11.341 --> 00:47:15.600
because I heard a lot of people. Um, all right. There you go. All right,

811
00:47:15.601 --> 00:47:18.900
problem with girlfriend. Dear billion.

812
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:21.830
I have a big problem with my girlfriend, with my [inaudible]

813
00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:26.050
<v 9>Lady [inaudible]</v>

814
00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:30.040
<v 1>James, call me Toby. I</v>

815
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.480
<v 6>have a big problem with my girlfriend. Um, if we've been date, we are,</v>

816
00:47:33.481 --> 00:47:37.600
we've been dating for the past three years and I think I might want to marry

817
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:39.350
her. Uh,

818
00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:42.880
but for the last month or so we've been having a fight.

819
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:48.190
My sister and I are very close and since my parents died last year in a car

820
00:47:48.191 --> 00:47:52.960
crash, we moved in together, which for some reason pissed her off.

821
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:57.730
I don't know why. Well, I mean, where were you living before that?

822
00:47:57.731 --> 00:48:00.790
She probably half to three years. Wanted you to move in with her?

823
00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:04.540
Probably once a God damn ring. Um,

824
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:10.320
then for some reason the fact that my sister and my best friend still smoked pot

825
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.870
and that they are doing it. Then for some reason,

826
00:48:13.871 --> 00:48:18.250
the fact that my sister and my best friend still smoked pot and that they are

827
00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:22.360
dating as well. Oh, she doesn't like that either. Um,

828
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:26.590
I would admit it was weird for me at first, but I got used to it anyway.

829
00:48:26.591 --> 00:48:29.500
The fight was about the fact that she wants to move in,

830
00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:32.830
that she wants me to move in with her. Yeah. Obviously,

831
00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:37.540
but I don't want to and she refuses to move in with me as long as my sister is

832
00:48:37.541 --> 00:48:39.550
there. I do love her and all that stuff.

833
00:48:39.551 --> 00:48:41.650
But this is something that I just can't do.

834
00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:46.860
My sister is in a very fragile place right now and my girlfriend can't get that

835
00:48:47.051 --> 00:48:50.260
or won't, I don't know what to do if possible. Can you ask me?

836
00:48:50.261 --> 00:48:52.510
I feel like women would understand better. Well,

837
00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.500
she's downstairs dealing with my daughter. Um,

838
00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:59.010
here's the deal with women. They're, they,

839
00:48:59.011 --> 00:49:01.930
they work on a different clock than we do. All right?

840
00:49:01.931 --> 00:49:05.710
So you just took three years of her life. All right.

841
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.930
And all she's hearing is, you know, you know that story,

842
00:49:07.931 --> 00:49:10.510
that telltale heart under the floorboards, that's their,

843
00:49:10.511 --> 00:49:12.610
that's their fucking womb. All right?

844
00:49:12.611 --> 00:49:16.990
They have a finite amount of time where they can have kids all right,

845
00:49:16.991 --> 00:49:19.840
before you stay, have to start doing some buck Rogers shit. Okay.

846
00:49:19.841 --> 00:49:23.230
And women do not want to go through that if they don't have to. All right?

847
00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:27.670
So what she needs out of you is some sort of fucking commitment. All right.

848
00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:30.070
And she was looking for that after three years.

849
00:49:30.071 --> 00:49:33.760
The fact that all she wanted to do was move in, she's being pretty cool.

850
00:49:33.761 --> 00:49:36.970
She should probably be going for the fucking ring depending on how old you are.

851
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:39.790
Um, and what I would do with, if I was you, dude,

852
00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:42.080
I would man the fuck up and either the commitment to her,

853
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.600
I break up with one or the other.

854
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:46.263
<v 0>Um,</v>

855
00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:48.090
<v 6>although the wildcard is,</v>

856
00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:52.780
is that your parents died last year in a car crash, so

857
00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:57.840
you're probably not in a place emotionally to make that fucking decision.

858
00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.073
<v 0>Um,</v>

859
00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:05.790
<v 6>yeah. Jesus Christ. You know what? Fuck everything that I just said.</v>

860
00:50:05.791 --> 00:50:08.010
Your parents died in a fucking car crash last year.

861
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:11.580
You got to look out for your family members and if she can't fucking understand

862
00:50:11.581 --> 00:50:15.300
that, then uh, I didn't know. I Dunno what to tell you.

863
00:50:15.301 --> 00:50:17.490
I guess she got to figure out how many you're going to find out how much you

864
00:50:17.491 --> 00:50:20.950
love her. You know,

865
00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:25.180
if she got to let it go, maybe you've got to let it go. I don't know.

866
00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.640
I have no fucking idea. Um,

867
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:31.220
but I understand her side.

868
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:35.660
I've invested three years in this and you moved in with another woman and it's

869
00:50:35.661 --> 00:50:38.000
your sister. That seems like a step backwards to her.

870
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:42.560
And then she has to move in. She wanted to fucking,

871
00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:45.200
she lets this chick wants to marry you.

872
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:49.550
So she wanted to move in and then have you guys have a bunch of communal stuff

873
00:50:49.551 --> 00:50:52.170
because women think that if you do that, that you're not going to get end.

874
00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.290
There's a less of a chance that you're going to break up with them.

875
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:57.770
They feel like it's moving in a positive direction and you went left,

876
00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.790
took a left hand turn, but life gave you a fucking lefthand turn.

877
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:06.470
So you're both not wrong. Why don't you try that?

878
00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.890
Just say to her, look, you're not wrong for being mad at me

879
00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:15.590
and I'm also not wrong for taking care of my sister.

880
00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:20.440
And then just stare at her and whoever talks first loses

881
00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:26.230
something along those lines. You're not wrong. And she's not wrong.

882
00:51:26.231 --> 00:51:28.900
She's not wrong at the three years to fucking be like, what the fuck?

883
00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:32.530
And you're not wrong for looking out for your sister when something tragic like

884
00:51:32.531 --> 00:51:34.960
that. This is fucking nothing but tragedy nowadays.

885
00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:41.500
Jesus Christ. Sorry that happens for you sir. Uh, two year, sir. Alright.

886
00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:45.790
Geographically locked by marriage. Jesus. There's just,

887
00:51:45.791 --> 00:51:49.150
there's just no real light here. Uh, Hi Bill. Love your work.

888
00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:52.540
Thank you for the laughter. Hey, something positive.

889
00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:58.800
I've been in a relationship since 2011 with a European woman that became a

890
00:52:00.341 --> 00:52:02.830
marriage. I am originally from South America,

891
00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:07.600
educated in the u s went to fancy school there. MIT. Look at you. You smart.

892
00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:11.630
Best then got my phd in Europe. Whoa. Lottie da.

893
00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:15.670
Spread your brain all around the fucking world, dear. Uh,

894
00:52:15.671 --> 00:52:17.500
we've been a solid couple.

895
00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:22.740
Our glue was out of love from mountaineering mountain climb.

896
00:52:24.621 --> 00:52:27.020
Is that what did it mountaineering? I didn't know what the fuck that is.

897
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:31.880
There's some weird section or does that mean you? You fucking,

898
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.000
it's not rock climbing mountaineering.

899
00:52:35.001 --> 00:52:38.690
You just walk up a mountain yodeling and outdoors sports.

900
00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:40.430
Fuck is mountaineering.

901
00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.050
Jeep had a wagon here. I remember that. I remember a mountain here

902
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:54.460
mount to nearing Wikipedia.

903
00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:59.320
You always have the answers. The term mountaineering describes the port,

904
00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:01.690
the sport of mountain climbing.

905
00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:07.680
Also rock climbing is what people do at gyms now in mountaineering is if you

906
00:53:07.901 --> 00:53:09.700
actually go up a mountain, okay, I get it.

907
00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:15.480
While some scholars identify mountaineering related activities as climbing

908
00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.420
parentheses, rock and ice and trekking up mountains.

909
00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:24.040
Others are also adding backpacking, hiking, skiing.

910
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:29.900
Oh, Jesus Christ. I already see these groups where we're mountaineering too.

911
00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:36.130
We just take a ski lift. All right, mountaineering. All right.

912
00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:39.900
Jesus Christ. Dude, what are you fucking James Bond.

913
00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:45.300
Born in Africa and went to MIT. Got Your Phd in Europe.

914
00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:48.600
Your fucking client. You climb mountains. Other outdoor sports.

915
00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:50.350
What are your top mountain? Airings.

916
00:53:51.310 --> 00:53:53.970
<v 0>Huh? What do you do from,</v>

917
00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:58.120
<v 6>I'm trying to think how you topped it as far as outdoor sports,</v>

918
00:53:58.540 --> 00:53:59.830
but now things are,

919
00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:02.220
<v 0>yeah.</v>

920
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:02.881
<v 6>What else do you do?</v>

921
00:54:02.881 --> 00:54:05.760
You grab cobras by the fucking tail and kiss them on the back of their head.

922
00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:10.190
By now things are a bit sour. What happened? We are way, way,

923
00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:13.680
we'd always been a solid cup or our glue was out.

924
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:18.210
Our love for mountaineering outdoor sports, but now things are a bit sour.

925
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:23.040
I don't see how I can have a career here in this continent and she's a working

926
00:54:23.041 --> 00:54:25.650
class lady who would suffer a lot from moving.

927
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:29.340
I also have a good business possibility in my home country. Brazil.

928
00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:35.550
Oh, South America. I thought you said Africa. South America.

929
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:39.220
Okay. So you simply can't let that go.

930
00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:44.490
I developed some somewhat of a scorn for the paperwork required to simply exit

931
00:54:45.070 --> 00:54:50.050
exist in Europe and would rather be on my own, live up to my own country,

932
00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:52.240
uh,

933
00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:56.800
make my money and have the freedom to explore my vast underdeveloped continent,

934
00:54:57.250 --> 00:55:01.270
but she wouldn't be able to come along. Also for my high tech education,

935
00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:05.150
most good jobs are in the great us of a,

936
00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:10.190
but I'm also burnt out with visas and permits and red flags. Uh,

937
00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.140
I don't think I have the strength to beg for a high tech job that will pay me

938
00:55:14.141 --> 00:55:17.680
less than my business in Brazil. Other than that, we get along fine.

939
00:55:17.681 --> 00:55:22.120
She's a solid partner, but not the type who would survive the third world.

940
00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:26.590
I think it's a no brainer, but I'm lost homebound and we'd love your thoughts.

941
00:55:26.591 --> 00:55:28.390
Thank you. Ah, Jesus Day. I mean too,

942
00:55:28.391 --> 00:55:31.900
that's a huge figure that you're gonna ask a fucking comedian who doesn't know

943
00:55:31.901 --> 00:55:33.100
you to make that decision.

944
00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:35.563
<v 0>Um,</v>

945
00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:42.400
<v 6>I think at the end of the day, whenever it comes down to stuff like this,</v>

946
00:55:42.401 --> 00:55:44.830
you have to make decisions that are going to make you happy,

947
00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:47.800
<v 0>all right? If</v>

948
00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:49.640
<v 6>you don't, you're not going to be happy.</v>

949
00:55:49.641 --> 00:55:52.250
And then you're going to make the person you with miserable. However,

950
00:55:52.251 --> 00:55:55.970
if there's kids involved, then you know,

951
00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:59.270
you gotta man up and suffer. It doesn't sound like you've got any fucking kids.

952
00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:03.950
All right? If you're married to this woman and you don't have any fucking kids,

953
00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:04.880
then you know,

954
00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:08.970
if you're going to start getting resentful and you're just going to argue and

955
00:56:08.971 --> 00:56:10.140
argue and argue and argue,

956
00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:14.640
all you guys are gonna do is take great years,

957
00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:17.430
young, healthy, fucking years of your life.

958
00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:20.640
We should be having a good time and you're gonna just make each other fucking

959
00:56:20.641 --> 00:56:24.070
miserable. All right? So either you figure how to fuck, just stay with

960
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:27.670
<v 1>her or she comes along with you or you go your separate ways. But</v>

961
00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:30.430
<v 0>um,</v>

962
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:31.510
<v 1>if you need to, you know,</v>

963
00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:33.910
cause guys were not good sometimes expressing ourselves.

964
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:36.190
Maybe just sit down before you talk to her.

965
00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:38.380
You write down what would make you happy?

966
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:43.210
You write down the points you want to make. I used to do this shit. Sorry.

967
00:56:43.211 --> 00:56:44.920
I can, I still haven't mastered this,

968
00:56:44.921 --> 00:56:48.670
but so I could figure out how to fucking have a productive confrontation and I

969
00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:50.980
would list all the points that I wanted to make.

970
00:56:50.981 --> 00:56:54.190
I would list what I wanted and then I would draw a big stupid smiley face

971
00:56:54.191 --> 00:56:58.810
reminding me not to be an angry cunt. Um, so I don't know if that helps you.

972
00:56:58.811 --> 00:56:59.680
I hope it did.

973
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.863
<v 0>Um,</v>

974
00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:03.510
<v 1>so anyways,</v>

975
00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:09.150
as if there weren't enough tragedies this month, my fucking,

976
00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:15.000
my fucking, uh, I don't what happened, they didn't record the f one race today,

977
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:20.340
so I missed that. Japan one. I did see the clip where for whatever reason, uh,

978
00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:24.910
Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel were like in some meeting in front of all

979
00:57:24.911 --> 00:57:28.930
the other drivers, like telling on each other, you know, oh,

980
00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:32.860
he took his steering wheel off. You know, the guys I go,

981
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.220
we took his seat pell, all those loose. It just made me,

982
00:57:37.221 --> 00:57:39.800
I just slide it just, I swear to God, man,

983
00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:44.860
I is like f one is that like the soccer of of motor sports.

984
00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:50.660
I can't, but we would kind of have a fucking, I don't understand people who,

985
00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:55.690
they have the balls to drive 200 miles an hour on each other's fucking bumpers,

986
00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:02.590
staring death in the face and then they go in there and they fucking telling on

987
00:58:02.591 --> 00:58:05.020
each other. I just, that was really disappointing to see.

988
00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:07.213
<v 0>Um,</v>

989
00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:11.060
<v 1>I still love the sport. It's such a great fucking sport, but I don't know,</v>

990
00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:14.090
you know what it is. Maybe it's just, maybe that's just, it's too much access.

991
00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:18.950
I don't need to see that shit. You know what I mean? I don't need to see that.

992
00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:21.020
Fuck. I don't need to know all the fucking ins and outs.

993
00:58:21.021 --> 00:58:23.780
The Rosie the riveter is this guy fucking complain about this or that.

994
00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:26.990
But anyways, come back. Congratulations to Lewis Hamilton.

995
00:58:26.991 --> 00:58:31.130
Despite the fact you're telling on people in meetings shamelessly.

996
00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:32.930
Maybe that's like a fucking European thing.

997
00:58:32.931 --> 00:58:37.140
Like they just have different fucking rules over there. You know what I mean?

998
00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:41.820
You can walk around in a banana hammock fucking speedo and that's just totally

999
00:58:41.821 --> 00:58:44.850
acceptable fucking telling on people. I mean that was just,

1000
00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:46.640
that was embarrassing.

1001
00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:48.903
<v 0>Um,</v>

1002
00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:53.590
<v 1>I dunno, I don't fucking know why did I bring up how much I love boozing though.</v>

1003
00:58:53.591 --> 00:58:56.410
I'm just thinking about getting one of those custom mattresses.

1004
00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:00.610
Remember that thing where they used to have the lady jumping up and down on the

1005
00:59:00.611 --> 00:59:03.580
mattress and the guy would have the glass of red wine and it wouldn't spill.

1006
00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:10.390
That's what I need. Uh, anyways, I start, uh,

1007
00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:16.270
I got some acting work coming up here over the next, uh, I don't know,

1008
00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:21.500
four or five weeks. So I got in at least another 20 days on whole,

1009
00:59:21.501 --> 00:59:26.390
not booze and thing. And um, I'm actually really enjoying it.

1010
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:30.230
I've dropped some weight and shit. I, I do enjoy not drinking,

1011
00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:31.310
but I will tell you this,

1012
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:35.960
it's just nighttime right now and it's fucking difficult. Oh, look who's here.

1013
00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:40.950
Hey Baby. There ain't no easy way. Yeah,

1014
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.960
I won't back down. You know,

1015
00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:45.680
I was one of the great things I've ever seen in this sporting event.

1016
00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:53.350
<v 4>Great. Can you please say that again? Do your impression of me again</v>

1017
00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:56.740
or a seen at a sporting event.

1018
00:59:59.470 --> 01:00:03.640
The lovely Nia. Everybody. Okay, dad,

1019
01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:10.060
how are you doing? Oh, I'm doing good. I'm doing, I'm great. Baby's asleep.

1020
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:14.530
Oh God. What's going on? It's been a while. Yeah,

1021
01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.110
I got her all amped up today, didn't I? Yes you did.

1022
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:22.780
She had one nap for 30 minutes all day. That's ridiculous.

1023
01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:25.010
<v 1>Well, weeks. We were excited to see each other.</v>

1024
01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:29.600
<v 4>Yeah, she was excited to see you. It was cute. Guys are cute.</v>

1025
01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:34.340
<v 1>I, it's ridiculous. I love that kid obviously. Um, Ooh.</v>

1026
01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:39.320
What do we got here? Oh, I already read this one. Oh, this guy won. All right.

1027
01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:42.530
I, I'll just paraphrase these two things, right? Oh, you already did them.

1028
01:00:42.531 --> 01:00:45.770
You don't have to go back. Well, there was one guy, right?

1029
01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.730
Is his, his mom. He's like 19.

1030
01:00:49.731 --> 01:00:52.910
He lives at home and his mom has a new boyfriend and he could literally hear the

1031
01:00:52.911 --> 01:00:56.900
headboard getting fucked. Yeah. Terrible. Terrible, right? Yeah.

1032
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:58.940
And then if you go eat, go stay with his dad.

1033
01:00:58.941 --> 01:01:02.570
But his dad is always talking about what a bitch is. You know a divorce. Oh,

1034
01:01:02.571 --> 01:01:04.130
that's photo X. Yeah.

1035
01:01:04.131 --> 01:01:06.720
So now he's thinking of just like joining the fucking coast guard,

1036
01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:10.880
<v 4>just so he didn't know. Well, I mean if you want to,</v>

1037
01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:15.140
but that seems like an awfully extreme. What'd she get a job at?

1038
01:01:15.141 --> 01:01:19.880
Like child world? Maybe you should. Yeah, definitely try to find his own place.

1039
01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:22.820
Try to stay on land and working out. Yeah, I think so.

1040
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:24.500
I don't think that you'd have to join nothing.

1041
01:01:24.501 --> 01:01:27.140
There's anything wrong with the coast guard. I think the coast guard,

1042
01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:31.150
you gotta it's gotta be rain and posy scattered me. How you kill?

1043
01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:35.660
You walk around a uniform. You're on a boat. You can vent. You have other dudes.

1044
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:40.920
Yeah. Then you, but you're not like, you're not out to see us anytime.

1045
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.590
Oh, does it? Does it not count if you're on a boat? What do you mean?

1046
01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:51.860
That's just what not count. I don't know what you're saying. I mean,

1047
01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:57.650
you know. Oh, right. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking of the navy.

1048
01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:02.930
The coast guard is not the same as the navy. No, it isn't. What do you, what?

1049
01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:05.750
What are you, when you said, when you said it doesn't count, what do you,

1050
01:02:05.751 --> 01:02:07.280
what do you mean what doesn't count?

1051
01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:12.890
Like you know like when guys go to jail and stuff, like it doesn't count.

1052
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:17.570
Like you're not like necessarily you're talking about guys banging other guys.

1053
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:24.900
How did you get dead? No. And what does it mean that doesn't count

1054
01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:32.220
to see whoever said where. Did you ever hear that?

1055
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:36.300
I feel like you have a bang a guy. Yeah. It didn't count. I was out on a lake.

1056
01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:38.460
No,

1057
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:43.460
I feel like for sexually flexible men or whatever,

1058
01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:49.040
like if you're in an extreme situation like jail or out to sea in God's name,

1059
01:02:50.011 --> 01:02:54.630
are you talking about like it doesn't, nothing. These people that go out,

1060
01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:58.080
somebody tips over and an inner tube, there's a drug dealer coming up.

1061
01:02:58.210 --> 01:03:00.420
They go out and they fuck them up and then they come back. Yeah,

1062
01:03:00.421 --> 01:03:04.440
they go on a patrol. But this isn't like, no, no, no. I got confused. I was,

1063
01:03:04.441 --> 01:03:08.910
I was thinking man, it was like the navy. Why aren't you like out on a boat?

1064
01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:12.690
Like for months? Yeah, but the navy then out there fucking each other.

1065
01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.490
They come into port and then they bang a bunch of, I was,

1066
01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:21.360
there's in the navy you can help your fellow man.

1067
01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:28.470
That was the village people. All right. Do you think native Americans are gay?

1068
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:32.940
Cause I, one guy with the head dress was going macho, macho man,

1069
01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:37.970
but they were singing about like guys stuff like places where there's groups of

1070
01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:45.420
men together. Listen, I've been to the YMC A, I never fucked another guy.

1071
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:49.500
I went there and I used their unbelievably old workout equipment.

1072
01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:54.990
I played some pickup. Hope I didn't see any gay sex happening there.

1073
01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:59.220
All right, well fine. Obviously the coast guard is not as aim as the navy,

1074
01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:01.260
but I was just saying that if it was,

1075
01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:06.350
it would be fine because it doesn't count because you're out to sea and like you

1076
01:04:06.961 --> 01:04:11.440
just your normal element and it's like,

1077
01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:14.790
are you like high right now? I swear to God I'm not.

1078
01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:18.630
I know I sound really high right now, but I'm not,

1079
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:22.110
but like you can, she's getting over being sick. By the way.

1080
01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:25.590
This isn't like some smoker thing with her. Um, yeah.

1081
01:04:25.591 --> 01:04:29.940
Cause they're going to be like, oh, she's got a smoker's cough. Um, no, I just,

1082
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:36.790
uh, I dunno, my point is I don't know what my point was. I was saying, you know,

1083
01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:40.710
my thing is the navy. No, I feel like, oh, he's doing in the coast guard.

1084
01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.830
He's joined the coast guard. I figured that's, that's like a fucking a,

1085
01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:46.710
like if you meet someone in a bar would think as a woman's guy said he's in the

1086
01:04:46.711 --> 01:04:50.130
coast guard. It's like being like, you know, women like fireman.

1087
01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:53.550
It's like you're a fireman except you're fucking on a boat. Yeah. No,

1088
01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:57.810
that's fine. Yeah. And you're like going in. There you go. Yeah. It's hot.

1089
01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:59.580
There you, that's what, that's what I was talking about.

1090
01:04:59.581 --> 01:05:01.170
You have to go and talk about jail sex.

1091
01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:06.120
I don't want to fuck that came from isn't enough. This kid has to think of,

1092
01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:08.460
we hear his mother getting banged up against the fucking headboard.

1093
01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:10.050
You've got to bring up fucking prison sex.

1094
01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:18.940
You know, this podcast has taken a lot of left turns throughout the years.

1095
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:23.200
That was one of the bigger ones. All right,

1096
01:05:23.201 --> 01:05:27.220
well you don't have to join the coast guard just to get away from your,

1097
01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:30.610
but maybe you do. I don't know. What does the Coast Guard do?

1098
01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:33.670
They're like the cops of the water. Right? Okay.

1099
01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:37.450
This is who I married.

1100
01:05:37.451 --> 01:05:41.590
Everybody is when you thought she was the brains of the outfit.

1101
01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.630
We have a child that we're going to raise. What is the coast guard? Oh wait,

1102
01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.890
that's right. Um, aren't they like the cops of the water?

1103
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:55.700
Hey, did they get upset when there's like a tornado and a tornado? Look,

1104
01:05:55.701 --> 01:05:58.780
I've dealt my aim. A fucking hurricane. Hey, settled down water.

1105
01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:04.210
That'll be enough of that. No, they actually do a lot of bad ass shit.

1106
01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:06.640
But people, they save people's lives.

1107
01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:09.280
They fly out there and fight all these fucking dopes.

1108
01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.380
But they are the cops of the water. I mean,

1109
01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:13.300
they would be insulted to hear me saying that.

1110
01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:18.070
A nicer way to say is they guard the shores of this great country. Can they, oh,

1111
01:06:18.071 --> 01:06:21.640
that's nice. Can they arrest? Oh God.

1112
01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:27.010
So like fucking that guy from a male. Yeah. Oh, good for you.

1113
01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:32.260
Um, can they arrest you? The coast guard? Yes.

1114
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:45.500
I would love to see you with a giant shipment of drugs when they pulled up.

1115
01:06:45.530 --> 01:06:49.580
Who are you guys? Do you guys like have sex with each other?

1116
01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:54.650
Oh, you're the coast. I'll wait. You're like the cops of the water.

1117
01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:57.800
Wait, can you arrest me?

1118
01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.680
I would pay a fucking me all the money in the world just to see the look on

1119
01:07:03.681 --> 01:07:06.680
their fucking face. I know. I'm insulting.

1120
01:07:06.681 --> 01:07:09.470
So many coast guard members, officers,

1121
01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:17.090
well officers, no, there's all different ranks.

1122
01:07:17.091 --> 01:07:18.750
I imagine this, there's semen.

1123
01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:23.900
Keep your mind out of the gutter all the way up to officers is captains.

1124
01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:27.830
[inaudible] you want me? Hey, why don't we do this? You know, Nia, when, when?

1125
01:07:27.831 --> 01:07:29.030
When? I don't know stuff.

1126
01:07:29.031 --> 01:07:33.650
I just asked the Internet and whoever made a page on it, then I just go, oh,

1127
01:07:33.651 --> 01:07:37.760
that's what it is. That's what it is. Okay.

1128
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:40.070
The coast guard.

1129
01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:44.420
Let's get it. Let's get a,

1130
01:07:44.421 --> 01:07:49.060
I gotta go Wiki on this so they'll actually help me out here. All right.

1131
01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:53.400
Okay. The United States Coast Guard is a service,

1132
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:57.390
a chief and highest ranking member. Oh, this is the commandant of the coat.

1133
01:07:57.391 --> 01:07:58.650
United States Coast Guard. Sorry.

1134
01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.650
Your phone is vibrating over the United States.

1135
01:08:01.651 --> 01:08:06.180
Coast Guard is a branch of the United States armed forces and one of the

1136
01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:10.460
countries. Yeah,

1137
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:15.800
you, you, you, you can't save everything by saying the water.

1138
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.170
Nia, you've been watching the Kardashians show way too fucking much here.

1139
01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:27.980
All right to mean Jesus. All right, one second.

1140
01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:33.040
The coast guard is a maritime military multi-mission service unique among the u

1141
01:08:33.111 --> 01:08:37.510
s military branches for having maritime law enforcement.

1142
01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:42.520
Can they arrest people with jurisdiction in both domestic and international

1143
01:08:42.771 --> 01:08:45.830
waters? Now there is a big one I didn't know international,

1144
01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:49.910
so you can't like outrun these fuckers and then just sit there and make faces at

1145
01:08:49.911 --> 01:08:51.860
them the second you get out in international waters.

1146
01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:55.100
I didn't know that they had a federal regular.

1147
01:08:55.101 --> 01:08:58.310
I thought once you went out and entered a international waters, it was captains,

1148
01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:01.730
captains, la, right. Captain's log, uh,

1149
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:05.270
in a federal regulation emission is part of the mission. It's mission set.

1150
01:09:05.271 --> 01:09:08.810
It operates out of the US Department of Homeland Security during peace time and

1151
01:09:08.811 --> 01:09:12.050
can be transferred to the u s department of the Navy. But

1152
01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:16.020
alright, I'm going to stop. No, no, see. Right. So I,

1153
01:09:16.021 --> 01:09:17.930
I didn't realize that they would then activated.

1154
01:09:18.710 --> 01:09:22.100
I thought they would like the f like sort of the farm team,

1155
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:27.560
like AAA of the navy. Oh, the water of the water. Yes.

1156
01:09:29.830 --> 01:09:30.050
You know,

1157
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:32.150
there's a lot of people laughing at us right now and they didn't know that they

1158
01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:36.230
could be activated to the navy. Um, all right.

1159
01:09:36.231 --> 01:09:39.770
My point is, I was just saying this has happened twice,

1160
01:09:39.771 --> 01:09:44.060
that they made part of the navy once in 1917 during world war one and another

1161
01:09:44.061 --> 01:09:46.970
time during World War II. And that's obviously, you know,

1162
01:09:46.971 --> 01:09:50.150
Pearl Harbor happened and the German u boats and I dunno what the fuck happened

1163
01:09:50.151 --> 01:09:54.200
in World War One. Okay. Where there wooden ships off our coast,

1164
01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.620
right? No, they weren't. Wouldn't ships at that point,

1165
01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:03.020
although the fucking biplanes were made out of like Kleenex I think. All right.

1166
01:10:03.021 --> 01:10:04.610
I think that we've showed how dumb we are.

1167
01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:11.120

1175
01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:42.650
Really the, we got the Kiddo so I dunno if that happens.

1176
01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:46.280
I don't know about that. Where is it? It's an Arizona.

1177
01:10:46.281 --> 01:10:49.820
You want to fly to Arizona to do a podcast for free.

1178
01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.630
Hey, how funny was it the other day?

1179
01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:04.520
The other day when you were getting sad and you were starting to cry and I just

1180
01:11:04.521 --> 01:11:05.960
kept making that sad face,

1181
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:09.020
which would then make you laugh and then you couldn't cry.

1182
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:12.590
I hate when Nia cries cause I don't know what to do. I told you that story.

1183
01:11:12.591 --> 01:11:16.050
Big Tears. Big Tears. Right. So she was talking,

1184
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.250
I didn't know what the fuck she was talking something about our kid. Yeah.

1185
01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:23.130
You don't even know what it is that I'm talking about. Like you don't even care.

1186
01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:26.810
You're just like, make it stop. Don't do that. Yeah.

1187
01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:31.200
All I did was she just started tearing up. She's like, you know what,

1188
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:34.440
to talk to you about something. I'm just worried during futures.

1189
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:37.260
He started doing that and when she did that, I just made this.

1190
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:41.190
I just looked at me a little sad phase and then she looked up and saw me and

1191
01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:44.760
then you started fucking laughing. It was funny as you had tears in your eyes,

1192
01:11:44.761 --> 01:11:48.660
but you were laughing and then she, she kept trying to go back to crying again.

1193
01:11:48.661 --> 01:11:49.710
No, listen to me.

1194
01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:53.460
I'm just trying to stay and then I would make the sad face again. Guys,

1195
01:11:53.461 --> 01:11:56.200
you gotta do that to you woman, next time she gets no there.

1196
01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:01.170
Look if it's something fucking serious. It was so, you know, it wasn't,

1197
01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:03.540
yes it was. It was silly.

1198
01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:08.790
I thought it was trivial. Not exactly a c.

1199
01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:11.280
Not everyone is going to be as, you know.

1200
01:12:11.281 --> 01:12:13.950
I thought it was trivial cause it was coming out of your dumb head.

1201
01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:16.170
Zackly exactly. You don't even know when it was.

1202
01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:19.500
And I was concerned about you were concerned about the cops of the water.

1203
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:25.650
Eight, eight. You laugh at like you baked.

1204
01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.310
So just the coast guard it,

1205
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:36.480
the ship has sailed. No Pun intended. It's over.

1206
01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.890
Oh maybe Cuba.

1207
01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:44.250
Alright, fine. No, don't, don't,

1208
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:48.690
don't give someone the pouty face when they're coming to you crying about an

1209
01:12:48.691 --> 01:12:50.160
emotional issue that they're feeling.

1210
01:12:50.161 --> 01:12:52.590
That's a terrible all right then tell me what you were concerned about.

1211
01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.980
I'll be a mature now. Good. What were you concerned about? Uh,

1212
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:59.640
it was about, but

1213
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:04.800
it's a good move because it keeps you happy. All right. That's the podcast.

1214
01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:09.670
That's the podcast. I know we have the creepy surveillance, the monitoring.

1215
01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:17.310
So you shot her with like a dart or something. She just face down.

1216
01:13:17.311 --> 01:13:21.270
She's out. That's like some discovery channel when you want to tag an animal.

1217
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:26.580
Um, all right. That's the podcast for this Monday. A go fuck yourselves.

1218
01:13:26.581 --> 01:13:29.490
I'll check in on you on Thursday. Thank you to everybody.

1219
01:13:29.491 --> 01:13:33.980
Came out to the shows this weekend, this weekend in St Petersburg, and uh,

1220
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:35.580
I had a great time once again out there,

1221
01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:40.020
a cigar capital of the u s Nini.

1222
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.650
It was fucking tremendous. It was tremendous. All right, I'll see you guys.
