1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.660
Sleep is critical.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's um,

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.090
you know what it is is amazing for sleep,
man.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.100
You know we should get in your place.
Get yourself a sauna.
Really?
Oh really?

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.110
Oh yeah.
He'd do 20 call shall sign of.
That's for fucking clowns.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.830
You wear a rubber nose when you do it.
Yeah.
Hey man,

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.720
I told showers after yoga.
You bear our rubber nose.

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.130
He fuck man.
Just being mean to me.
Clowns a fucking clown.

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.940
Fucking clown and trying to quake shock proteins.
Yeah.

9
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.270
I've got to get really cold.
You shove an ice bath.
You want to do that?

10
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:39.570
I'll do an ice bath.
I've done that.
Done Cryo.
Yeah.
Don't cry.

11
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.530
Have you done the real one when you had those in now than you did the one where

12
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:47.010
the neck below on?
It has the bullshit one.
Really?
Yeah.

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.920
The real ones only made by cryo healthcare.

14
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.460
They have one in New York or one center in New York.

15
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.400
They have one in La.
They have one here.

16
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.060
They wanted woodland hills like 10 minutes.

17
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.850
A Nice path for 20 minutes and talk to me.
Um,
okay.
You go numb.
It sucks.

18
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:07.200
I'm sure,
but so does 250 degrees below zero.
If you're not,

19
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:10.950
then eyes for three minutes.
Yeah,
yeah.
Come on Bro.
It sucks.
All right bro.

20
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.710
I get it.
You were fucking [inaudible].
I slouch,

21
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.570
slouching knows I just doubled,
burned him knowing a song I was singing.

22
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.020
Same.
Awesome.
Um,
yeah,
it's not good.
Um,

23
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.500
there's probably some real benefits to ice baths.
The benefit of um,

24
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.280
cryo over ice baths.
You could work out right afterwards.
Ice Baths,

25
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.820
they recommend you not work out there.
Like you just chill out for awhile.

26
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.300
But it's great after working out.
But for muscles,

27
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:38.490
strength and development,

28
00:01:38.491 --> 00:01:41.340
it's actually not good to do it right after training.

29
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.110
You actually should wait quite a while,
like maybe an hour or two.
So when you,

30
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:46.860
you've been,

31
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.940
you've had countless conversations with cutting edge scientists and exercise

32
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:54.630
people.
The five things that you do every day,

33
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.410
like that debt without fail,
what are they in terms of for your health?

34
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.700
First of all,
I supplement,
I think you believe in south,

35
00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:06.480

36
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:11.010

38
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.600
One,

39
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.600
one serving as 12 one scoop has 12 servings of fruits and vegetables in terms of

40
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:24.720
the amount of antioxidants and yet very healthy.

41
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:27.700
It's good just for like a backup plan.
Right.

42
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.450
I take these little packs with being on the road.
Um,

43
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.810
I take a lot of the Onnit Shit I take,
uh,

44
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.650
obviously I shouldn't dash shroom tech,
you know,

45
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.090
we have some awesome whole food supplements.
There's a bunch of great stuff.
Um,

46
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.830
I take a lot of vitamins.
I take vitamin D,

47
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:51.600
I take vitamin B,
I take a lot of fish oil,
a lot of essential fatty acids.

48
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:53.970
I believe in all those things.
All right.

49
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:57.720
Cut Way back on my sugar.
I mean,

50
00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:02.450
way back.
Yeah.
To where maybe once a week I'll have dessert.
Yeah,

51
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.970
I do that too.
Yeah.
I don't fuck around,
man.
Yeah.
Um,

52
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.210
I just intermittent fast.
Yes.

53
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.200
16 hours a day.
Yeah,
I do that too.
That makes me feel that,
you know,

54
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:17.350
my psoriasis is 100% gone.
That's awesome.
Part of it's also,

55
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:19.780
and I got to give a shout out to Dan Garner.

56
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.410

He's a fuck.

57
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.370
