00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.905
Say you're given a mesh like this. Some statue standing on a platform that's

00:00:03.905 --> 00:00:07.811
some distance from the origin. You'd like to rotate it in place on its base so

00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:11.446
that it's facing like this. You know that if you just try to rotate it, it's

00:00:11.446 --> 00:00:15.161
going to rotate around the origin and it will swing wildly in position. You want

00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:18.624
it to stay where it is. You have a few matrices at hand to perform the task.

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:22.331
You're given a translation matrix that would move the center of the model's base

00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:25.930
to the origin. You also have a rotation matrix that will rotate the model or

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.682
anything else around the y-axis. Finally, you can also invert the translation

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:33.934
and rotation matrices. The question is, what series of transforms will rotate

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:37.481
the model on its base? In other words, we want to end up with the object in the

00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:41.360
same position, but rotated around its own axis. Put the transforms in the usual

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.230
right to left order, rightmost being applied to the object first. If you don't

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.703
need all four slots for matrices, just leave the leftmost ones empty. For

00:00:48.703 --> 00:00:52.714
example, if you needed just a single transform, put it in this rightmost slot.

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:55.960
To solve this one, you might want to remember the rule, once a transform is

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.463
applied, forget about it and just think about where the model itself is then.
