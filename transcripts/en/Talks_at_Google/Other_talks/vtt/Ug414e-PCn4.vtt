00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:02.265
SPEAKER: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:03.171
How are we doing?

00:00:03.171 --> 00:00:03.624
[AUDIENCE SOUNDS]

00:00:03.624 --> 00:00:04.530
SPEAKER: There we go.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.614
Yes.

00:00:05.614 --> 00:00:07.280
We're running a little
bit late, so I'll

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.030
go ahead and jump
right to it, but it's

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.855
my pleasure and privilege
to invite Ryan Holiday.

00:00:11.855 --> 00:00:13.720
He's a writer and strategist.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.034
He's worked with the likes
of Tim Ferris, Google,

00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:19.590
Complex Media, and several
other bestselling authors.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.845
And now he's here to talk
to us about his new book,

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:24.240
"Ego is the Enemy."

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.673
Previously, he has
written three other books.

00:00:26.673 --> 00:00:28.670
The last one, "The
Obstacle is the Way,"

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.990
has become a big
success with the likes

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.910
of NFL players, rappers,
and competitive athletes.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.488
So we're very lucky
to have him here

00:00:36.488 --> 00:00:38.808
and we're excited to hear
about his [INAUDIBLE] book.

00:00:38.808 --> 00:00:40.670
So please give him
a warm welcome.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.364
Thank you.

00:00:41.364 --> 00:00:42.530
RYAN HOLIDAY: Thanks, buddy.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.030
Thank you.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.270
Awesome.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.449
Is this the clicker?

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:47.990
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.073
RYAN HOLIDAY: OK, perfect.

00:00:49.073 --> 00:00:51.280
How's everyone doing?

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.040
This is my first
talk for the book,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.450
so I hope you can enjoy
being my test audience.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.206
Actually, no, I made this
one up just for you guys.

00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:05.862
I hope I'm not biting the hand
that feeds me a little bit,

00:01:05.862 --> 00:01:07.320
but there are some
Google mentions.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.464
So we'll get into it.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.040
I set out to write a
book a few years ago,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.530
actually, that the topic was
going to be about humility.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.790
That ended up being much
harder than I thought.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.458
And as I was meditating
on this idea-- oh,

00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:23.582
there's a monitor up there.

00:01:23.582 --> 00:01:24.534
Very cool.

00:01:24.534 --> 00:01:26.914
As I was meditating
on this idea,

00:01:26.914 --> 00:01:30.120
it occurred to me-- actually,
I remember exactly where I was.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.320
I was standing in the
American Apparel parking

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.770
lot, because unlike
Google, we didn't

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.402
have all these
awesome pods where you

00:01:36.402 --> 00:01:37.980
could take private phone calls.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.620
So I was on the phone and I
was thinking about this book

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.460
and I was talking
it through, and it

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.824
occurred to me that we're all
in one of three phases in life.

00:01:45.824 --> 00:01:47.240
You can actually
see the evolution

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.253
of the drawings of the idea.

00:01:50.253 --> 00:01:53.510
You can see that weird
mouth-looking drawing.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.780
The idea is at first, we're
aspiring to something.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.480
Then, from that aspiration,
either comes success

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.600
or we fail at that thing.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.610
And we're constantly repeating
through these things.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.803
I do all my books on these
four by six note cards.

00:02:06.803 --> 00:02:11.050
So these are the first four
note cards of the book.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.470
The idea is you're aspiring
to get some taste of success,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.860
then you succeed,
maybe you plateau, then

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.860
you begin to get
complacent, and you fail

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.400
and then you're
back to aspiration.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.710
Or you succeed and you want
to aspire to something else.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.030
This is the idea.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.402
And what occurred
to me-- instead

00:02:28.402 --> 00:02:30.485
of talking about humility,
I would talk about ego.

00:02:30.485 --> 00:02:34.910
Because ego is the
opposite of what you need

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.490
at any of those three phases.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.270
As Cyril Connolly says,
"Ego sucks us down

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.980
like the law of gravity."

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.180
Again, I'm not talking about
ego in the Freudian sense--

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.580
which, even after a fair
amount of reading about,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.050
I still don't quite understand.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.030
I'm talking about ego
in the colloquial sense.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.000
The group of traits
that we associate

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.797
with ego-- selfishness,
delusion, arrogance, greed,

00:03:03.797 --> 00:03:04.796
endless competitiveness.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.090
What we mean when
we say, oh, that's

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.000
all ego-- that's what
I'm referring to.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.060
Not the Ego, per a
psychologist's definition.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.881
And so again, ego-- depending
on whether we're aspiring,

00:03:20.881 --> 00:03:22.255
so we're just
starting out, we're

00:03:22.255 --> 00:03:25.550
trying to do something--
ego is the worst element

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.030
you can introduce into that.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.960
Those traits are the worst
things that you can do.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.730
And then, when we succeed, if
that aspiration is made real,

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.740
ego manifests
itself in a new way.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.550
Now the arrogance
is more pronounced,

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.900
let's say, or we start to have
control over other people.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.740
So that ego manifests itself
in our leadership styles,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.970
in our management systems.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.569
We can start to tell ourselves
this story about who we are

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.360
and how we got to where
we are, which we'll

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.390
talk a little bit more about.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.790
And then, often, because
ego is the root of--

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.030
or is undermining our
success, we get into failure.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.060
Or something turns out to be
harder than what we expected,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.960
we have some crisis or scandal.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.230
And now again, ego
is a negative element

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.190
to introduce into your
life because instead

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.459
of learning a lesson,
it's taking from this

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.470
that it's other people's fault
or that you'll never recover.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.406
So ego is manifesting itself
in profoundly different ways

00:04:24.406 --> 00:04:25.780
wherever we happen
to be in life,

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.550
but in every single phase,
it's a negative trait.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.260
And so my premise is
that ego is the enemy.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.290
And I love this quote
from Richard Feynman,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.790
where he's saying, "The first
principle is that you must not

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.860
fool yourself-- and you are
the easiest person to fool."

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.810
That's ego.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.010
Ego is fooling us
precisely when we

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.960
need to be fully in
command of all our senses,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.920
we need to be aware of
the objective reality

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.420
of our situations, we need to
understand what we're good at,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.380
what we're bad at.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.286
And so ego is fooling us.

00:04:58.286 --> 00:04:59.940
And I make a
distinction in the book

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.290
between confidence and ego.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.970
I say confidence is
earned and ego is stolen.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.590
Ego is fooling yourself.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.199
So that's the
premise of the book.

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.115
Obviously, I thought
it'd a little absurd if I

00:05:09.115 --> 00:05:11.274
came to Google and
I talked to one

00:05:11.274 --> 00:05:12.940
of the world's most
valuable companies--

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.040
it might be the world's
most valuable company.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.020
I know you guys are
always like this.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.478
But it would be foolish for me
to come here and talk to you

00:05:19.478 --> 00:05:21.540
about aspiring to do something.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.120
As a company level,
obviously, you've

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.550
achieved an incredible amount.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.922
And even just to
work here, that's

00:05:26.922 --> 00:05:28.130
an incredible accomplishment.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.507
So I won't talk
about that and things

00:05:30.507 --> 00:05:32.340
are going pretty well
for Google these days,

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.680
so I'm not going to
lecture you on how

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.145
to recover from failure
because, clearly, that's

00:05:37.145 --> 00:05:38.020
not a problem either.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.010
I wanted to talk about success--
the way in which success

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.150
can breed ego and undermine the
things that we're trying to do.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.790
And so there's a
chapter in the book,

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.990
and the story I
wanted to tell today

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.520
is, ironically, about not
telling yourself a story.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.530
And the way that ego
can work and change

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.940
the stories that we tell
ourselves and, ultimately, lead

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.170
us astray.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.820
To me-- Nassim Teleb-- he calls
this the narrative fallacy--

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.850
the way that we cobble
together the events of our past

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.770
into a personal narrative.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.770
Not just personally, but
sometimes about history.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.040
We connect disconnected
events and we

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.570
create a sense of
certainty and cohesion

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.940
that's not really there.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.200
As David Maraniss said, "Myth
becomes myth not in the living

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.200
but in the retelling."

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.640
And so when we reflect
back on our success,

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.640
or when we read about our
success in the media-- success

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.340
about projects we've
worked on or things

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.250
we've been a part
of-- the ego is there

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.360
puffing these things up
and making them different

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.800
than they actually were.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.610
And so the story
I tell in the book

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.020
is the story of Bill
Walsh, who in 1979, took

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.190
over the San Francisco 49ers.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.650
At that point,
they were not just

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.310
one of the worst
teams in football.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.018
They may have been
one of the worst teams

00:06:55.018 --> 00:06:57.700
in all of professional sports.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.790
Took over as the general
manager and the coach--

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.850
he'd previously been
the coach at Stanford--

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.210
and he immediately set
about trying to change.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.955
They were fully ensconced
in a culture of losing.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.255
It was a bad franchise.

00:07:14.255 --> 00:07:19.810
In fact, the year before he took
over, the team was two and 14.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.170
And then he took over.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:26.162
And he did a lot of work, he
drafted some good players.

00:07:26.162 --> 00:07:29.440
But that season-- the
first season as a coach--

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.030
they were two and 14 again.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.850
And not only two and 14,
they currently-- or they

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:41.980
still-- hold the record for the
only team to lead in 12 games

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.830
and still lose them.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.410
So it was a miserable,
horrible season.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:50.580
And then the next season
was almost as bad.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.990
They went six and 10 in 1980.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.387
But they were so bad
that year that he almost

00:07:57.387 --> 00:07:58.970
quit about halfway
through the season.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.450
And so it was a pretty bad ride.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:08.516
And the next season,
they won the Super Bowl.

00:08:08.516 --> 00:08:10.080
They beat the
Cincinnati Bengals.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.121
This is the season that
features the catch, maybe

00:08:12.121 --> 00:08:16.570
one of the most famous
plays in all of football.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:17.150
But they win.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.210
And here he is, hoisted on
the shoulders of his players.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:27.070
And he is quickly
hailed as the genius.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.960
He turned a team around
in probably the shortest

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.780
amount of time in NFL history.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.970
Again, he took it from
the worst franchise

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.860
to the best franchise
in three seasons.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.210
This is unheard of.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:45.100
And yet, Bill Walsh--
even at that time--

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.000
there's a famous
article where they're

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.770
talking about his
response to the victory.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.291
What he was-- the announcer
says, oh, he must be numb.

00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:57.790
Because he was sitting there,
not looking, on the sidelines.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.290
In fact, Bill Walsh
told the announcer later

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.290
that he was just thinking
about the next season.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:09.200
But he's quickly decried as
the greatest name in football.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.660
And he put all that aside.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.810
He ignored that label.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.600
And he not only
ignored the narrative

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.940
of taking it from the worst
to the best at the time,

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.300
but even when he writes
his memoirs years later,

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.280
he's still resisting that.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.540
And the reason is, he knew that
what was actually responsible

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.490
for the 49ers winning
was what he called

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.670
the standard of performance.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.580
And this was the standard
that he put on his players

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.900
at the time.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.610
And they were pretty stringent.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.995
There was no sitting
on the playing fields,

00:09:42.995 --> 00:09:45.490
coaches had to wear
a suit and ties,

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:50.030
sportsmanship was stressed
almost to an absurd degree,

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.580
work ethic was prized
above all things.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.910
No fighting, no swearing.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.370
All these things were banned.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.550
Linemen were drilled on
these 30 different drills,

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.390
which is a lot for linemen.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.140
Passing routes for
receivers were actually

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.830
measured down to the inch.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.650
And the practices were
scheduled down to the minute.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.660
And so what Walsh
had always said

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:18.370
is that if we adhere to these
standards of performance--

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:21.900
if we take care of them-- the
score will take care of itself.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.510
And so what he was
focused on, then,

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.060
was not turning
around this franchise.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.070
He said that the first question
he was asked by reporters

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.370
was always, what's your
timetable for turning

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:33.590
around the 49ers?

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:34.790
And what he would say,
over and over again,

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.000
is I don't have a timetable.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.958
And he really meant it.

00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.630
One of the assistant
coaches at the time

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.312
actually complained
to the boss that Walsh

00:10:44.312 --> 00:10:45.770
didn't have a
timetable and that it

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.061
wasn't going to be fast enough.

00:10:47.061 --> 00:10:48.360
And Walsh fired him.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.630
So Walsh's point was,
actually, I don't

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.580
know when we're going to win.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.850
And I don't know how
long it's going to take.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.820
All I know is that if we adhere
to these standards, eventually,

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.540
we will win.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.560
He said that the
job of a coach is

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.670
to help a team make a
base camp near the summit.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.630
And so if you sketch that
metaphor out a little bit, what

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.270
he's saying is you make
base camp near the summit,

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.240
and then only
weather permitting,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.450
do you make that run.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.810
And so it just happened,
as he understood it,

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.190
that the run to the
summit-- to the Super Bowl--

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:25.100
was within three seasons instead
of seven seasons, or even

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.170
one season.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:28.210
And so what he was
resisting, then,

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:30.310
because he was actually
there at the time--

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:34.180
he knew that it wasn't
so simple as worst team

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.360
in football to best
team in football.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.400
And he knew that the
story, telling himself

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.317
that he was a genius, or that
the team might tell itself

00:11:41.317 --> 00:11:43.650
a story that they were the
best-- that they were somehow

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.180
special-- that this was a
very dangerous thing to do.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.500
And in fact, the
next two seasons,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.240
the Super Bowl-- as
often happens to teams,

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.640
when they win,
they start to be--

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.340
the bonds that bring the
team together start to fray,

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.236
egos start to come in.

00:11:59.236 --> 00:12:04.420
The 49ers lost 12 of
the next 22 games.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.410
But Walsh stuck
with what he thought

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.010
was important, which was these
standards of performance.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.020
And so what happens, though,
when you're successful,

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:17.127
is that other people try
to remove that context--

00:12:17.127 --> 00:12:18.210
that sort of nitty gritty.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.240
The idea that he
almost quit halfway

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.240
through because he didn't
think it was working

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.630
or that it was the little
things that mattered and not

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.760
his bold, audacious plans.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.600
The narrative that's
built around you

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.300
and that you build
around yourself

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.900
starts to overpower the
reality of your situation.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.450
Tobias Wolff-- who's actually
a professor at Stanford

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.290
and a brilliant
short story writer--

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.150
he's saying that, all of
this gets cobbled together

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.320
later, and sincerely so,
and after the stories get

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.334
repeated enough times, they
put on the badge of memory

00:12:50.334 --> 00:12:51.750
and-- this is the
important part--

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.810
they block the routes
of exploration.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:59.630
So you stop being able to see
your own life objectively.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.570
You've repeated this
story enough times

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.000
that it starts to become true.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.620
And so that's what
Walsh was resisting,

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.010
not only at the time,
but then decades later.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:13.746
And the reason is--
again-- is that stories,

00:13:13.746 --> 00:13:14.870
they don't change the past.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.161
You can tell yourself whatever
you want about the past.

00:13:17.161 --> 00:13:20.480
The problem is that what you
tell yourself about the past,

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.180
particularly if it's
a flattering way,

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.760
it can change your future.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.840
It changes how you
respond to things.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.760
So it's about making sure that
we learn the right lessons

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.710
from our stories.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.470
That we're telling
ourselves the right stories.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:37.610
And a few years ago
I worked on a book

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.755
with Peter Diamandis
and Steven Kotler.

00:13:39.755 --> 00:13:40.880
I did the marketing for it.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.546
And as I was watching
some of the videos

00:13:42.546 --> 00:13:44.770
that they had produced,
there was a video

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.350
that Peter had
hosted at Singularity

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:53.640
University and your CEO and
brilliant co-founder-- he

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.460
spoke at.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.467
And he said this line
on stage and I thought

00:13:56.467 --> 00:13:57.550
it was really interesting.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.300
He said, "I now have a
very simple metric I use."

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.700
And this is for companies that
he invests in or acquires.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.180
He's saying, "Are you
working on something

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.510
that can change the world?

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:07.250
Yes or no?"

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.720
And this is a very
inspiring thing.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.590
And I remember when I saw it,
I was like that's awesome.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:14.830
And then I thought a
little bit more about it

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:19.070
and I wondered if there isn't a
little bit of that storytelling

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:23.050
going on the way that we can
look backwards at ourselves

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:27.320
and create clarity or vision
that wasn't necessarily there.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:32.340
And it struck me that I'm not
sure some of Google's biggest

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.360
successes would
meet that criteria.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.290
Not at the time.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:43.990
Here's the Stanford PhD
paper that Larry and Sergey

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.480
wrote together.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.970
They weren't trying necessarily
to create a company that

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:48.928
would change the world.

00:14:48.928 --> 00:14:51.790
It wasn't this bold,
brilliant vision

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.860
to create billions and billions
of dollars worth of wealth

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.940
and employ thousands
of thousands of people,

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.530
and create all these different,
interesting products.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:05.200
It was exploring,
theoretically, an idea of how

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.810
search might be organized.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.875
Or if you look at YouTube.

00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:10.550
People forget
because the narrative

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:14.610
that the media tells
glosses over this.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.157
In fact, even the
YouTube founders

00:15:16.157 --> 00:15:17.240
talk about it differently.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.870
But YouTube started
as a dating site.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.630
And this is the first video
ever uploaded on YouTube.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:28.360
And you can see this
cool-- he's at the zoo,

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.798
I guess, talking about how
he likes to go to the zoo

00:15:30.798 --> 00:15:33.860
and maybe you would want to
come to the zoo with him.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.299
And so here's a quote from him.

00:15:37.299 --> 00:15:38.840
He's saying, "We
didn't even know how

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.610
to describe our new product.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.480
To generate interest,
we just said that it

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.090
was a new kind of dating site.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.970
We even had a slogan for
it-- tune in, hook up."

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:51.320
So obviously, what YouTube
is now and what it's done

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.340
is almost unbelievable.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:58.250
But it can be easy to
forget what it actually

00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.110
was when it started.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.640
And I think Gmail the same way.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.180
I've heard some
conflicting reports

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.120
that the idea was
always to do Gmail

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.942
or really it was a
Google 20% project.

00:16:07.942 --> 00:16:09.317
In any case, not
everyone thought

00:16:09.317 --> 00:16:11.375
it was a good idea at the time.

00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:12.694
Here's Paul, who created Gmail.

00:16:12.694 --> 00:16:14.235
He's saying, "A lot
of people thought

00:16:14.235 --> 00:16:16.430
it was a very bad idea,
both from a product

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:17.900
and a strategic standpoint."

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.900
They thought maybe it
would piss off competitors

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.570
or that it wouldn't work.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:24.190
That it was outside search.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:27.371
And then Brian Rakowski, who
was the first project manager

00:16:27.371 --> 00:16:30.191
on Gmail-- he's saying "It
didn't look anything like what

00:16:30.191 --> 00:16:33.364
Gmail does now or
even what it looked"--

00:16:33.364 --> 00:16:36.330
that it was just
radically different.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.791
And here's a screenshot.

00:16:37.791 --> 00:16:39.290
My favorite part
of this screenshot.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.320
Can I do a laser point?

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.100
If you see-- whoever
took this screenshot

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.033
was also on something awful.

00:16:46.033 --> 00:16:47.917
But I think it's pretty awesome.

00:16:47.917 --> 00:16:49.801
This is Gmail when it launched.

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:52.275
It's radically different
than what it was.

00:16:52.275 --> 00:16:54.775
And actually, Jeff Bezos has
talked about this a little bit,

00:16:54.775 --> 00:16:55.275
too.

00:16:55.275 --> 00:16:57.340
He has to remind himself
over and over again--

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.090
because it's what
reporters want to hear--

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:03.310
that there was no aha moment
in the creation of Amazon.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:07.640
That the aha moment is what
makes for a compelling story.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.970
We heard was created to sell Pez
dispensers, which is also not

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:13.219
true.

00:17:13.219 --> 00:17:16.910
That if you apply,
retroactively,

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:22.200
a certain clarity of
vision that wasn't there,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.730
it makes it harder when you do
ambitious things in the future.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.667
And so Paul Graham has
two wonderful essays.

00:17:29.667 --> 00:17:32.250
Actually, the original title of
the book that I was working on

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.050
was "Keep Your Identity Small."

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.080
He's saying you have to
keep your identity small

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.460
because information
is constantly

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.340
changing in the world
and you're constantly

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.600
being put in new situations.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.020
And if you have this
overwhelming identity,

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.780
or if you have this big
ego, it makes it hard

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.810
for you to be flexible,
to try different things,

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:54.230
to see things objectively,
and not through your, again,

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.580
overwhelming lens of the world.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.070
And his other essay on-- I
think it's called "Frighteningly

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:03.610
Ambitious Startup Ideas"-- he's
saying that "The way to really

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:07.760
big things seems to actually be
to start with deceptively small

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.420
things."

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.870
And I think this is
true for most successes.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:13.740
It's not that it's accidental.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:19.110
It's that to have thought,
when they were writing that PhD

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.800
dissertation or thesis,
that the end outcome of it

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.707
would be one of the world's
most valuable companies

00:18:25.707 --> 00:18:28.196
and they'd all be billionaires,
that would be preposterous.

00:18:28.196 --> 00:18:31.660
This would be preposterously
conceited and dilusional.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.920
And so that wasn't what
they were thinking.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.980
What they were thinking about
is the immediate task at hand.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.480
And so as you go
out into the world

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.005
and try to do new
ambitious things,

00:18:43.005 --> 00:18:45.490
it requires that you
suppress that ego

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.630
so you can see them
clearly and objectively,

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.380
and not through
the lens of a story

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.527
that you tell
yourself or an image

00:18:51.527 --> 00:18:52.610
that you have of yourself.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.610
And so I don't
mean to rub it in,

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.098
but you look at Google Glass.

00:18:57.098 --> 00:18:59.580
And some of the failures
of Google Glass,

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.200
and I think some of
Google's other problems,

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.930
have come from the fact that--
being an incredibly successful

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.330
company that has built all these
transformational products-- you

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.716
start to try to take some
shortcuts and you say, well,

00:19:11.716 --> 00:19:14.700
can't we just start with
a transformational idea?

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.210
Or you say, this is certainly
going to be transformational,

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.150
so let's put tons of
resources behind it.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.366
So what you get away
from is what Paul Graham

00:19:23.366 --> 00:19:26.729
is saying-- is you get away from
the deceptively small things.

00:19:26.729 --> 00:19:29.020
And this is Bill Walsh was
worried about-- it's getting

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.320
away from the deceptively
small things that

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.275
actually matter a great deal.

00:19:33.275 --> 00:19:35.900
It's having pride or
sportsmanship-- pride

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.880
in doing good work-- having
the right work ethic,

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.180
holding yourself to a certain
standard of excellence.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.695
These are the things
that win games.

00:19:44.695 --> 00:19:47.170
or that put you in a
position to win games.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.170
And you want to make sure
that the fact that you

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.260
have won a game
doesn't lead to you

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.900
abandoning those principles.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.380
And this happens
time and time again.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.540
And so what I'm
talking about, then,

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:01.760
is learning the right
lessons from your past.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.267
And there's a wonderful quote
from Elizabeth Newell-Newman.

00:20:06.267 --> 00:20:11.610
She's an artist and she talks
about one of my favorite books

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.059
on creativity.

00:20:13.059 --> 00:20:14.975
Actually, the book is
just called "Creativity"

00:20:14.975 --> 00:20:16.987
and it's by Mihaly--
I'm not even

00:20:16.987 --> 00:20:19.040
going to begin to
butcher his last name.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.410
But if you just look it
up on Amazon or Google it,

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:22.630
it's wonderful.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.440
But she's saying,
"I never look back

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.760
except to look at mistakes.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.240
There's only danger in
looking back at things

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.250
that you're proud of."

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.690
So what I'm talking about,
then-- what I think suppresses

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:37.100
the ego-- is looking
at events retroactively

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.690
to find out not what
you did amazingly well

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.770
or what's says something
about you as a person,

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:45.190
but instead, where you need
to and where you can improve.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:49.200
And so, hopefully you'll humor
me for another football story.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.970
This is Tom Brady on draft day.

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:59.030
Tom Brady was drafted 199th in
the NFL draft in the year 2000.

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.200
He was drafted in
the sixth round.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.510
And so, in terms of
pure performance, or ROI

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.710
this is undoubtedly
the greatest draft pick

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.780
in the history of football.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.245
He starts for 14 seasons.

00:21:13.245 --> 00:21:15.530
He'll be starting
for his 14th season.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.020
He's been to six Super Bowls.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.740
He's won four times.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.804
Three Super Bowl MVPs.

00:21:20.804 --> 00:21:24.830
He's been to the
Pro-Bowl 12 times.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.470
He's thrown for,
like, 60,000 yards.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:32.870
It's an absurd track record
for a singular quarterback.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.340
He's played all his
years on the same team

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.400
and built, probably, the
most dominant franchise

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.200
in the history of
football, as well.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.230
But he was drafted
in the sixth round.

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:44.282
Sixth round-- so
it becomes this--

00:21:44.282 --> 00:21:46.240
we're going to do all
these other things first,

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.220
and maybe, and then
it leads to this.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.170
And so you would think
that the Patriots would

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.780
see this as a massive success.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.720
That they got this steal.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.310
But that's actually
not the lesson

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.120
that they took from this.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.536
What they took
from it, instead, I

00:22:02.536 --> 00:22:04.750
think is a very humble
lesson, and one I

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.490
try to apply in my
own life, as well.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:07.872
They were upset.

00:22:07.872 --> 00:22:09.330
Not because they're
perfectionists,

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:12.170
but because the
lesson that Belichick

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:14.577
and his head of
personnel-- his name

00:22:14.577 --> 00:22:16.285
was Scott-- no longer
with the Patriots--

00:22:16.285 --> 00:22:20.330
but what they took from this
is we were really wrong.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:24.950
How could we have let
this superstar wait

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.160
until the sixth round?

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.882
Somebody else could
have taken him.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.730
So what they're seeing, then,
is not that they got this steal,

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.620
but how fortuitous that it
worked out in their favor was

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.690
and how easily it could
have not gone that way.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.340
Because not only did
they draft him 199th,

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.105
but he was set to be the
third-string quarterback.

00:22:46.105 --> 00:22:48.540
He barely beat the
second-string quarterback.

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.430
And it was only when the
Patriots' starter, Drew

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.760
Bledsoe, injured himself in
the Brady's second season,

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.630
that Tom Brady was
able to get his shot.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.140
And then he did
so amazingly well,

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.098
they ended up winning
the Super Bowl that year.

00:23:01.098 --> 00:23:05.400
And so, what the Patriots saw
is how easily this all could

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.342
have gone the other direction.

00:23:07.342 --> 00:23:08.800
And so I think this
is the opposite

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.883
of being full of yourself.

00:23:09.883 --> 00:23:12.450
This is-- as I would say,
it's looking for the failure

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:13.960
inside the success.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.260
This is preventing those
things from going to your head.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.580
One of my favorite lines
in the children's book

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.610
"The Little Prince"
is he says, "Vain men

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.140
never hear anything but praise."

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:25.280
And that's the problem.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.380
If your vanity or
ego is there, all

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.960
you're going to
see in your story

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.447
is the things that
have gone well.

00:23:30.447 --> 00:23:32.030
And you're not going
to see the things

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.600
that could have gone better
or that you lucked out.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.690
Again, for some
football, Vince Lombardi

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.630
says, nobody ever
wins a championship

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.830
and then looks
backwards and says,

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.282
man, if the ref
hadn't blown that call

00:23:44.282 --> 00:23:46.740
in the middle of the season,
we never would have been here.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:51.427
Or that if that ball had bounced
inbounds instead out of bounds,

00:23:51.427 --> 00:23:53.010
it would be a totally
different story.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.920
We tend to only
look and make it--

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.031
we only look at it in our favor.

00:23:59.031 --> 00:24:00.780
And so one of the
things the Patriots did,

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:04.210
as a reminder of this-- Scott
Pioli-- he had on his desk--

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:08.470
he had a picture of Dave's-- I
don't want to butcher his name

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:12.630
either-- Stachelski-- he had
a picture of him on his desk

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:16.050
for his rest of the time at
the Patriots because this is

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:19.080
the player that the Patriots
drafted over Tom Brady.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.850
They drafted him
in the fifth round

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:22.940
and he didn't even make
it through training camp.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.110
He ended up having a career
with a couple other teams,

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:29.600
but the guy that they
thought they were confidently

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.390
picking in the
fifth round ended up

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.274
being not even
remotely close to good

00:24:33.274 --> 00:24:35.440
as the guy they got lucky
to get in the sixth round.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.070
So it's this reminder.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.050
Again, it's not
looking backwards

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.550
to see what your proud of.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:42.374
It's looking
backwards to see what

00:24:42.374 --> 00:24:44.540
mistakes you might have
made and the things that you

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.260
could do better.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.282
I'll give you an
example of my own life.

00:24:48.282 --> 00:24:49.740
I wrote a book two
years ago called

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.050
"The Obstacle is the Way."

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:54.630
And I think I did
a pretty good job.

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:59.030
But I was not thinking
that this would happen.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.760
I would not think that this
book about ancient philosophy

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.300
would somehow make its way
through professional sports.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.766
Coincidentally, also
to the Patriots.

00:25:06.766 --> 00:25:08.140
This was not what
I was thinking.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.010
So that's lesson number one.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.640
I was not-- I was--
I have to remember

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.000
very vividly that my
intention was to write

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.755
a book for business people.

00:25:16.755 --> 00:25:17.880
That's what I was thinking.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.880
Or just for people who
are interested in history

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.730
and business.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.160
I wanted to write
a book for them.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.590
And it just happened
that it accidentally

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:28.470
made its way into this circle.

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:30.190
So that was lesson number one.

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.510
The bigger lesson for me
is that of all the things,

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.396
the book has sold pretty well.

00:25:35.396 --> 00:25:39.530
But I have to be-- as
I'm launching this book,

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.950
I was trying to think, why
was that book successful?

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:44.150
And why did it sell well?

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.930
And looking back at
the sales record,

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.580
this is-- have you guys
ever heard of BookBub?

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.930
It's this cool newsletter
and they recommend

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.775
discounted e-books once a day.

00:25:56.775 --> 00:25:58.400
So it's sort of like
Groupon for books,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.983
although you don't
buy them from them,

00:25:59.983 --> 00:26:03.450
you buy them from
Amazon or any retailer.

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:07.134
So we did-- about three weeks
after the book came out,

00:26:07.134 --> 00:26:09.950
I had suggested to my
publisher that we try

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:11.400
this new thing called BookBub.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.734
It wasn't super huge then.

00:26:12.734 --> 00:26:13.400
And we tried it.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.500
So we discounted the e-book
from $12.99, or whatever it was,

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.490
to $3.99 and it was
supposed to run for a week.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.310
And it ran for a week and it
had a nice spike in sales.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:25.400
And then-- still don't totally
know how this happened,

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.980
but Amazon kept the discount.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:32.080
And they kept the
discount for 11 months.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.080
We all know that discounting,
in the short term,

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.130
can be really great.

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:36.921
The reason you don't
do it in the long term

00:26:36.921 --> 00:26:41.400
is it can reduce the
overall amount of revenue.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.350
But Amazon not
only discounted it,

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:48.150
but they discounted it and
they paid the full royalty

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:49.450
the whole time.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:53.120
So it was just-- I don't know
how it happened, honestly.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.660
I'm very grateful, obviously.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.510
But what I think happened
is we did this service

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.470
and it created a spike
in Amazon's algorithm,

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:05.380
and then Amazon-- just like you
guys-- is very smart with data.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.297
And they saw, hey, if we
keep this artificially low,

00:27:08.297 --> 00:27:09.630
it will sell over the long term.

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:10.680
And maybe they forgot about it.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.804
I don't know what happened.

00:27:11.804 --> 00:27:16.320
But for 11 months, my book was
basically sold as a loss leader

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.240
by the biggest
retailer in the world.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.210
And obviously, this contributed
to sales in a huge way.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.080
If I look at the data,
e-book sold way more

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.870
than audio book--
or, sorry, e-book

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:28.170
sold way more than audio-- agh.

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:30.880
E-book sold way
more than physical.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.140
And usually,
they're about 60-40.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.250
It was flipped.

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.059
And this was a result
of the discounting.

00:27:36.059 --> 00:27:38.100
So basically, the book
was able to be discovered,

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.130
or people were able to
take a chance on it,

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:41.744
in a way that worked
out very well.

00:27:41.744 --> 00:27:43.410
But again, it was
totally unintentional.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.110
So I have to look
at that lesson.

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:49.260
As I'm launching the next book,
I'm not thinking, oh, well,

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.880
the baseline is I'm going
to sell as many copies

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.410
as the last one.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:56.430
You have to say, if this
fortuitous event does not

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.537
occur again, how is that
going to work out for me?

00:27:58.537 --> 00:28:00.370
You don't want to take
for granted something

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:01.990
that you didn't have
anything to do with.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:03.823
At the same time, the
right lesson, I think,

00:28:03.823 --> 00:28:06.380
you take from that is
experimenting and trying

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.990
new things can often
work out really well.

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:13.032
And that there can be upsides
that you can't anticipate

00:28:13.032 --> 00:28:16.520
for doing things that, maybe,
other people are afraid to do.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.780
And then, also, when
you get a lucky break,

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.705
ride that thing for
as long as you can.

00:28:22.705 --> 00:28:24.960
We didn't send Amazon
an email and say, hey,

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.948
we don't want this.

00:28:27.948 --> 00:28:29.860
They opened the door
and we walked through it

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.460
and we stayed on the other
side for as long as possible.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:38.290
And you learn, OK, with books,
there is a price elasticity

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:41.160
in book sales and that
targeted discounting

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.960
can be good for discovery.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.220
Again, it's taking
the right lessons

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:49.420
and making sure-- the difference
between-- an objective event

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.150
happens.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:53.050
You win a Super Bowl or
your book sells well.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:57.560
Or you acquire a site and
it becomes the destination

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.310
for all the video in the world.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:05.040
Or your Stanford thesis becomes
a billion-dollar company.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.470
An objective event
happens-- I would

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:12.590
say learning the right lesson
from that objective event--

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.450
to me, evil is the
swing vote there.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:19.490
Ego-- if you look through the
world with an egotistical lens,

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:20.990
you're going to be
telling yourself,

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.270
of course, that this
says something about you

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:23.860
as a person.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:26.880
That it says you are a genius
or you're a great marketer.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.830
It says this thing about you.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.570
And not only is that dangerous
because it's not true,

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:36.290
but the other side of that coin
is that when things go poorly,

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:37.757
you tell yourself
the same thing.

00:29:37.757 --> 00:29:39.340
You tell yourself,
this says something

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.820
about me as a person-- that
I'm a failure because my thing

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.210
failed and my
company's a failure

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:45.720
because this project failed.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:50.920
And so it might be nice
when you're on top,

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.360
but it's particularly vicious
when fate turns against you.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.292
And my last book
was about stoicism

00:29:56.292 --> 00:29:57.930
and the stoics
are always talking

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:01.042
about having an attitude
that's resilient,

00:30:01.042 --> 00:30:03.110
in case that always happens.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:04.991
So ego is that difference.

00:30:04.991 --> 00:30:06.990
My favorite stoic quote
is from Marcus Aurelius.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:10.590
He's saying, "To accept
it without arrogance

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.654
and to let it go
with indifference."

00:30:12.654 --> 00:30:14.320
And that's what we're
talking about when

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.950
it comes to these stories.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.539
Know what's actually
happening, don't

00:30:19.539 --> 00:30:21.830
let it puff you up and make
you more than what you are.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:25.840
But also, when things go
poorly or there's mistakes

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.190
or there's problems, or
hey, you write a book

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:31.700
and some news event
interrupts and people

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.980
aren't buying books
that week-- that you

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.980
know that it's the
standard of performance

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:39.591
that you adhere to that
make this thing quality

00:30:39.591 --> 00:30:41.090
and that it will
prevail in the end.

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:43.320
Or whatever that is.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.190
I wanted to leave you
guys with that today.

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:49.790
One meditation on how ego can
manifest itself in success

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:53.364
and how you have to be
on guard against it.

00:30:53.364 --> 00:30:55.945
And on a lighter note,
so you didn't think

00:30:55.945 --> 00:30:57.360
I was lecturing like that.

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:57.930
Oh, sorry.

00:30:57.930 --> 00:30:59.910
This is one of my
favorite quotes.

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:01.960
Sorry, but it goes
to the same point.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.641
This is from Marina
Abramovic and she's

00:31:03.641 --> 00:31:05.890
saying, "If you start believing
in your own greatness,

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:07.510
it is the death of
your creativity."

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.301
It's not just the death
of your creativity,

00:31:09.301 --> 00:31:11.160
I think it's also the
death of the work that

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:15.080
needs to go into bring a
creative thing into the world,

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.170
and then into the market.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:18.494
So ego is that swing vote.

00:31:18.494 --> 00:31:19.910
Believing in your
own greatness is

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:21.840
whether you're going to
learn the right lesson,

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.756
you're going to tell
yourself the right story.

00:31:23.756 --> 00:31:25.960
And humility and
self-awareness is

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.074
going to determine whether you
tell yourself the right story.

00:31:29.074 --> 00:31:31.490
And I thought I'd leave you
with this picture of my donkey

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.580
eating a copy of the book.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:35.950
But anyway, that's it for me.

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.294
Thank you guys for having me.

00:31:37.294 --> 00:31:38.242
We can do questions.

00:31:38.242 --> 00:31:40.138
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:42.982 --> 00:31:44.804
SPEAKER: We've got mics.

00:31:44.804 --> 00:31:47.220
RYAN HOLIDAY: Or you can throw
me out for daring to insult

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:47.720
Google.

00:31:54.776 --> 00:31:55.760
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.654
Thanks for coming.

00:31:56.654 --> 00:31:58.167
RYAN HOLIDAY: Thanks
for having me.

00:31:58.167 --> 00:32:00.250
AUDIENCE: I don't know if
you've heard about this,

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:02.826
but I think all Newglers
know about this.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.500
And it's imposter syndrome.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.010
It's this kind of
well known fact

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.660
that people who
start working here

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.220
don't feel like
they belong here,

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.560
or that they deserve
to be working here.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.570
I'm just curious what your
thoughts are about that

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:23.700
in relation to the things
that you just talked about.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.204
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:32:25.204 --> 00:32:27.120
I've gone through a
little bit of that myself,

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:27.786
so I understand.

00:32:27.786 --> 00:32:32.230
I guess, objectively, what
you tell yourself is look,

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:35.179
the people who hire at
Google are pretty smart.

00:32:35.179 --> 00:32:37.470
They're not really in the
business of hiring people who

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:39.650
don't deserve to work there.

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:44.330
And so they're probably right,
even if you might doubt it.

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.330
But one of the things I
talk about in the book--

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:48.970
because I think people
sometimes think that ego

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:50.944
is the opposite of humility.

00:32:50.944 --> 00:32:52.360
And I'm not sure
that that's true.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.090
I talk in the book-- Aristotle's
golden mean basically

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:58.470
says that all virtues are
a midpoint between two

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:00.030
vices, or two extremes.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:05.880
So he's saying,
courage is a midpoint

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:12.440
between brashness on
one side and, say,

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.100
cowardice on the other.

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.710
And so I think
what you're trying

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:19.370
to develop as a human
being-- competence,

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:24.920
then, is a mid-point between
egotism and delusion,

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.935
and on the other
hand, self-loathing

00:33:26.935 --> 00:33:29.050
and crippling self-doubt.

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:34.780
And I think you get that
confidence not by saying,

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.480
oh, this job is important
and I'm not important.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.940
And so therefore,
I'm an imposter.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.970
I think what you look at is you
look at your accomplishments.

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:46.950
You look at the work that went
into getting you where you are.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:49.630
And again, this is telling
yourself the right story.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:53.839
It's, I got hired by Google
because I worked hard

00:33:53.839 --> 00:33:55.630
in high school and I
got into this college.

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:59.230
And I did well in this school
when other people were doing x.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:01.147
And I built these
projects on the side,

00:34:01.147 --> 00:34:02.230
or I did all these things.

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:05.020
So it's making sure
that you're taking pride

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:09.580
not in the fact that you work
at an amazing, elite company.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.400
It's that you're taking
pride in the work that you do

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.640
and who you are and what
you bring to the table.

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.098
Does that make sense?

00:34:16.098 --> 00:34:16.889
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:17.260
RYAN HOLIDAY: Awesome.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.051
AUDIENCE: For sure.

00:34:18.051 --> 00:34:19.105
Thank you.

00:34:19.105 --> 00:34:21.085
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:34:21.085 --> 00:34:22.570
AUDIENCE: Two question.

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:26.310
One, I was just curious how you
ended up thinking and writing

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:28.974
about this stuff.

00:34:28.974 --> 00:34:32.880
And the other is do you have
any comments mostly Elon Musk?

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.130
RYAN HOLIDAY: I think Elon
Musk is really fascinating.

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:38.210
And the whole second
section of the book

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:40.730
opens with the story
of Howard Hughes, who

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:42.752
I find to be fascinating.

00:34:42.752 --> 00:34:44.489
He's probably the--
although he was

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:46.670
a brilliant creative
visionary-- probably,

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:49.670
though, single worst
businessman of the 21st century.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:52.395
He just happened to
inherit a company that

00:34:52.395 --> 00:34:54.270
had a monopoly on oil
drilling and funded all

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:55.353
these ridiculous projects.

00:34:55.353 --> 00:35:00.011
But actually, I'd always
known about Howard Hughes.

00:35:00.011 --> 00:35:01.510
And I'd read a
little bit about him.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:03.350
But I thought of
him for this book

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:06.295
because I'd read an interview
with Elon Musk where

00:35:06.295 --> 00:35:08.570
he said that he'd been
reading about Howard

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:10.572
Hughes as a cautionary tale.

00:35:10.572 --> 00:35:12.780
And I think that's really
interesting because they're

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.471
both brilliant--
obviously, they're both

00:35:14.471 --> 00:35:16.720
fascinated by aviation and
they're both entrepreneurs.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.590
They both created
multiple companies.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:24.120
But Howard Hughes died
in self-exile and misery

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.640
and addiction and insanity.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.710
And so I liked that
he was studying that.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:32.290
Although, I saw
the news yesterday

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:33.873
about him announcing
that he was going

00:35:33.873 --> 00:35:35.480
to acquire one of
his own companies

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.110
and being somewhat
mystified that people

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:41.320
would be skeptical of this,
or suspicious of this.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:46.260
And I think one of the things
that ego makes very difficult

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.480
is empathy.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:51.970
And even if not just empathy--
like, understanding optics.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:55.000
And so, often, when
you are egotistical

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.760
and you're surrounded by people
who are dependent on you,

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.290
it becomes very hard for
you to see the world the way

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.390
other people who are not
you would see the world.

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:06.620
But that is an essential
skill when you are managing,

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:09.390
not just multiple companies,
but the high wire act

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.672
of public relations and
branding involved in the kinds

00:36:12.672 --> 00:36:13.880
of companies that he's doing.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.864
So I think Elon Musk
is really interesting.

00:36:15.864 --> 00:36:18.030
I don't know him personally
or know enough about him

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:19.960
to make any judgments
one way or another.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.620
But I was fascinated by
ego-- so my last book

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.330
was about external obstacles.

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:28.834
And I wanted to write--
I hope I'm not making up

00:36:28.834 --> 00:36:31.250
a story here-- I wanted to
write about internal ob-- like,

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.680
what makes those
things impossible?

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.190
And I found that
self-awareness was

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:39.410
essential in the kind of
objectivity and perseverance

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:39.910
required.

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:41.100
So I was interested in that.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:46.832
And also, I put my email
in all my books and stuff,

00:36:46.832 --> 00:36:48.540
and so I get a lot of
emails from people.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:52.830
And I tend to find that the
vast majority of the problems

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:54.600
that people are coming
to me with-- it's

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.310
clear that it's a completely
self-inflicted problem.

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:01.340
It's just they're not able
to see their own situation

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.560
with any sort of objectivity.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:03.970
They don't see how they're
making things worse

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:05.020
for themselves.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:09.840
And so I wanted to write about
self-awareness and humility.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.380
And actually, I also was
interested in the way

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:18.574
that social media creates a
sort of weird performance art

00:37:18.574 --> 00:37:20.740
where we're all pretending
we're better than we are.

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.989
So it was those sort of
things that led into the book.

00:37:30.858 --> 00:37:31.840
AUDIENCE: Hey, Ryan.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.590
Thanks for coming.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:33.651
Big fan.

00:37:33.651 --> 00:37:34.650
RYAN HOLIDAY: Thank you.

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:36.358
AUDIENCE: One of the
things that I really

00:37:36.358 --> 00:37:38.800
liked about Malcolm
Gladwell's "Outliers"

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:42.410
is that he talks about the story
of the Beatles and Bill Gates

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:47.097
and how we, as a society,
love to feed those egos

00:37:47.097 --> 00:37:48.180
and build those things up.

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.710
But he talks about how it really
just takes a lot of hard work

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:51.473
and a lot of luck.

00:37:51.473 --> 00:37:52.300
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:55.390
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious to
get your perspectives on what

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.230
it is that gives us
a tendency to want

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:01.050
to feed other people's egos.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.030
RYAN HOLIDAY: I think
we like those stories

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:05.650
because then-- we're all
trying to do something.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:10.180
And so it's like, oh, if they
were just brilliant or creative

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.970
or if they got this lucky break,
then that bodes well for us.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:17.810
Or conversely, we use it as
a rationalization for why

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:19.700
we're not pursuing something.

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:24.510
So it's like, oh, they-- that
didn't happen to me so that's

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.990
why I'm not successful at
whatever it is that I'm doing.

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:31.070
So you could tell yourself the
wrong story in both directions.

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:35.100
I think a lot of it,
also, is like-- I

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.730
read this book a couple years
ago called "The Accidental

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:39.810
City," which is a
history of New Orleans

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:42.430
and how it became
what it became.

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:45.120
And I remember, like, halfway
through, I just quit reading.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.480
I was like, there's
no narrative here.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.770
And it's the whole point
is that it's accidental

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:52.040
and there was no narrative.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.797
But it just made for really
not super exciting reading.

00:38:54.797 --> 00:38:57.130
And so I think the other thing
is that, as human beings,

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:59.330
we're hardwired for narrative.

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:00.740
It's how our brains work.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:04.670
So we gravitate toward
simplifying things and making

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:09.890
them more fated or
ordained or exciting

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:11.230
than they actually were.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.290
I think it's interesting.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:14.200
I really like Malcolm
Gladwell's stuff, too.

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:19.410
And I think the 10,000 hours
thing is very well supported.

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:21.810
I worked on a book with Robert
Greene called "Mastery,"

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:24.634
and he says it's actually
more like 20,000 hours.

00:39:24.634 --> 00:39:26.550
One of the things-- I
have a line in the book.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:27.800
It's more of a throwaway line.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.700
But I think one
of the hard parts

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:33.520
we see-- even that, we go, oh,
so it just takes 10,000 hours.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.390
And then, we think it's like,
oh, I just check off an hour.

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:40.330
It's not-- it's much more
complicated than that.

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:40.910
Yes.

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:42.560
It took 10,000 hours
for the Beatles

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.530
to be great as the Beatles, but
also because of where they were

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:48.660
and the time, and
the influences--

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:51.060
they were making a
living, probably,

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.320
before they got 10,000 hours.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.060
Or maybe that's what
it takes for music,

00:39:56.060 --> 00:40:00.490
but to be a computer programmer,
it takes 22,000 hours.

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:03.220
There's not some magical
number that you hit

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:07.200
and it's like-- if you run
26.2 miles, that's a marathon.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.710
That's not how it works
for mastering something.

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:12.200
It's like it takes
a really long time,

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.739
and then you get pretty good.

00:40:13.739 --> 00:40:15.530
And then it still takes
a really long time.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:19.349
And maybe you never--
there's no finish line.

00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:20.640
Does that answer your question?

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.134
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:21.134 --> 00:40:22.134
RYAN HOLIDAY: All right.

00:40:27.062 --> 00:40:30.020
Hal?

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.090
AUDIENCE: Quick question
on the perceived values.

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:35.350
We're all in the
business of creating

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.160
a perceived value of ourselves.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.149
All of us here, we go to
[INAUDIBLE] et cetera.

00:40:39.149 --> 00:40:39.940
RYAN HOLIDAY: Sure.

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:40.648
AUDIENCE: So we--

00:40:40.648 --> 00:40:41.950
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:42.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.790
We reflect on our own,
for our egos, et cetera,

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:45.820
and try to grow.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:46.611
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:40:46.611 --> 00:40:48.970
AUDIENCE: But, including
yourself as an author,

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.230
you are portraying, like--

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:52.110
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yes.

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:53.026
AUDIENCE: --a certain.

00:40:53.026 --> 00:40:55.440
So how do you see that
balancing out and that conflict?

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.190
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well,
one of the things

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.660
that I think is so interesting
that really motivated

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.810
me to write the book is
like, OK-- a friend of mine

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:02.410
said this.

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:06.910
He was like, 20 years ago, only
cult leaders had followers.

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:09.460
Now everyone has followers.

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.280
Because we all have
Twitter accounts.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:16.354
And so in the way that social
media and the way the world

00:41:16.354 --> 00:41:17.770
works now, it's
like, everyone has

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:19.250
to have this personal brand.

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:23.960
So it used to be that only
an author or-- even CEOs were

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.550
mostly private people.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:28.490
You didn't know who
ran General Motors.

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:32.660
He's not on Squawk
Box 50 years ago.

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.820
So the way in which
we now all have

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.940
to have these
personal brands means

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:40.130
that we're all susceptible
to what was once

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.930
the temptations and
seductions of fame

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:46.320
for celebrities or performers.

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.940
And I could pull up my
Instagram feed right now

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:54.560
and it's going to present
my life in a much more

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.100
glamorous way than
whatever happens in

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.300
between those photos.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.940
And so we're all
performing in that way.

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.660
Sometimes we're
performing in that way--

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:06.020
I might tell myself it's because
I have fought-- sometimes

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.040
you tell yourself that
it's part of the branding

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.040
or the personal brand
that you're maintaining.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:13.050
And other times,
it's just you chasing

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:17.534
internet points or
likes and retweets

00:42:17.534 --> 00:42:19.450
and hearts and favorites
and all these things.

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:23.370
So I think one of the things
you learn as a marketer is

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:28.760
that there is a distinction
between the distilled message

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:32.700
or campaign that you're doing
and then the complex reality

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.080
that is the product
or the company.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:38.450
And I think people have to
develop a bit of that sense,

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:39.055
too.

00:42:39.055 --> 00:42:41.250
That the person you
are at a job interview

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:45.260
is not who you are Sunday
night at home on the couch.

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:51.350
And making sure that
you are not-- the tail

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:53.500
is not wagging the
dog, so to speak.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:56.320
That the branding and the
marketing-- the illusions

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.110
that you're creating to advance
whatever your career are,

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.890
or a message that
you have, are not

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:05.340
changing your
perception of yourself.

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:10.550
Because that's-- it's a short
throw from there to living

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:15.164
in a Trumpian fantasy world
where you're qualified to be

00:43:15.164 --> 00:43:16.080
president [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:21.004 --> 00:43:22.170
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:23.336
RYAN HOLIDAY: Oh, all right.

00:43:23.336 --> 00:43:25.650
AUDIENCE: Let me see if
I can phrase this well.

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:28.370
A lot of your examples were
about achieving success

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:31.610
and people who have been
successful and many of them

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:33.636
start from the
sea of aspiration.

00:43:33.636 --> 00:43:38.395
And it almost seems like, why
is ego-- the topic of ego--

00:43:38.395 --> 00:43:39.270
coupled with success?

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:43.170
It seems like you're framing
the idea of not having an ego

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:45.580
as a service to
achieving success.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:48.280
And that kind of confuses
me because if you

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.430
come from stoicism
or Buddhism, they

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:53.830
say the desire is the
[INAUDIBLE] of suffering

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:54.740
in you.

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:55.636
Things like that.

00:43:55.636 --> 00:43:56.550
RYAN HOLIDAY: Sure.

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:59.240
AUDIENCE: So is aspiration
itself caused from the ego?

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:02.730
Who's to say that-- Mother
Teresa did amazing work.

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:04.464
How do you know that's
not driven by ego?

00:44:04.464 --> 00:44:06.380
But how do you know that
what Steve Jobs did--

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.920
that was driven by ego
or not driven by his ego?

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.032
How do you-- where do
you draw that line?

00:44:11.032 --> 00:44:13.490
RYAN HOLIDAY: No, I think it's
a very interesting question.

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:17.220
Obviously, I think these
topics are fascinating to me

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.810
personally and they're
how I try to live my life.

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:24.326
The reality is also
that we live in a world

00:44:24.326 --> 00:44:26.200
where people are trying
to accomplish things.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:30.000
We have individual goals,
we have families to feed,

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.060
we have beliefs that we
hold to be very important,

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:36.880
and we are trying to do things.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.480
And so I decided in
this specific book

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:43.880
to look at the
ways that ego makes

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:47.210
what we are trying to do more
difficult than it already is.

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:51.580
Now, also personally, I
think ego makes relationships

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:56.480
very difficult. And it
makes-- ironically--

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.700
let's say that ego was only
a minor problem, in terms

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:02.367
of achieving success.

00:45:02.367 --> 00:45:03.950
Ego is also a
[INAUDIBLE] in the sense

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:05.560
that it makes it
impossible for you

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:08.250
to feel like your
success is ever enough.

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:10.000
These things are interrelated.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.650
I'm just focusing on
one specific part.

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:17.060
I came to this on
the stoicism book.

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.990
I'm really interested
in philosophy,

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:21.280
but most people don't
wake up and think,

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.850
I would like to
study philosophy.

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:24.520
I'm like that, maybe
you're like that.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:28.190
Most people wake up and
they think, I'm bankrupt

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:32.170
or I'm overweight or I
have a number of problems

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:35.400
and I'm depressed, I'm adrift.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.230
Whatever it is.

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:38.580
I need help with that problem.

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:41.270
And my understanding of
these ancient philosophies

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:44.380
is that they are designed
to help with those things.

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.890
Certainly, stoicism is a
much more Western philosophy,

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:55.505
so unlike-- the image
of the stoic philosopher

00:45:55.505 --> 00:45:58.600
is not-- in the way
that a Buddhist might

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:02.040
be in a beautiful temple
on top of a rocky mountain

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.520
or in a lush garden.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.390
The stoic philosopher is
the man in the marketplace,

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:10.570
the emperor, the general.

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:14.490
Someone who has a job
that they have to do

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:17.340
and they're looking for guidance
on how to do that thing well.

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:19.280
So I think you
raise a great point.

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.752
This is not just about how
to aspire and achieve things.

00:46:22.752 --> 00:46:24.210
And you want to
make sure that when

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:25.738
you are driven--
when you are trying

00:46:25.738 --> 00:46:27.154
to do those things--
that it's not

00:46:27.154 --> 00:46:28.700
out of ego in and of itself.

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:33.760
But plenty of divorces
are caused by ego

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.150
and plenty of
miserable childhoods

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:38.830
are the result of
egotistical parents,

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:39.880
and so on and so forth.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.434
So I think they're very related.

00:46:41.434 --> 00:46:43.100
But that's just what
this book is about.

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:43.740
AUDIENCE: Well, thank you.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:45.201
I loved your last
book, by the way.

00:46:45.201 --> 00:46:46.659
I look forward to
reading this one.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.906
SPEAKER: I think that's
all the time we have.

00:46:50.906 --> 00:46:51.332
RYAN HOLIDAY: Cool.

00:46:51.332 --> 00:46:52.890
SPEAKER: Let's give Ryan
another round of applause.

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:54.640
RYAN HOLIDAY: Thank you, guys.
