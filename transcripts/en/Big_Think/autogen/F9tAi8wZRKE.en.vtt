would energize them to support science
 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.740
would energize them to support science
even more than we support it because

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750
even more than we support it because
 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.730

really is an extraordinary role model so
 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.920
really is an extraordinary role model so
I would say that that is one person

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930
I would say that that is one person
 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.520
I would say that that is one person
among many relatively unsung people who

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530
among many relatively unsung people who
 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.650
among many relatively unsung people who
who I think really a different have done

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660
