00:00:00.524 --> 00:00:02.679
- She's gonna be making a
dish, what in Thai is called

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:07.049
Pad phet and that essentially
means like stir-fry chili.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.468
The meat stir fried with
a bunch of curry paste

00:00:09.468 --> 00:00:11.946
and chilies and herbs.

00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:13.279
Oh, that's good.

00:00:19.376 --> 00:00:20.592
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:20.592 --> 00:00:23.548
It's Mark Wiens with Migrationology.com.

00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:25.770
It's about seven a.m. in Bangkok

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.657
and we are walking to the market.

00:00:28.657 --> 00:00:31.746
My mother-in-law is
going to make a Thai dish

00:00:31.746 --> 00:00:35.631
that I really love and that's
very unique and very spicy.

00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:37.283
So, my mother-in-law is
cooking and I'm gonna

00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:39.950
share the recipe with you today.

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.319
At typical morning markets
in Bangkok, you have

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:47.872
many, many normal stalls
selling all sorts of different

00:00:47.872 --> 00:00:52.823
vegetables and chicken and pork
and beef and seafood vendors

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:54.875
and then usually also at Bangkok markets,

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:58.714
they have one or two stalls
that serve jungle ingredients,

00:00:58.714 --> 00:01:02.284
real, real country-side
herbs and ingredients

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:06.451
and we are going to the country
stall, the jungle stall.

00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:21.069
We are in luck.

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:22.606
My mother-in-law wasn't
sure if they were gonna have

00:01:22.606 --> 00:01:27.085
these wild ducks, which in
Thai are called nuk phet nahm

00:01:27.085 --> 00:01:29.291
but luckily they do so
she has already piled

00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:32.910
two wild ducks into the
basket and we're gonna get

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.019
two wild ducks and then
they have just all sorts of

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:37.817
wild jungle ingredients here.

00:01:37.817 --> 00:01:40.778
There are crickets and
all sorts of mushrooms.

00:01:40.778 --> 00:01:42.013
There's silkworms.

00:01:42.013 --> 00:01:43.274
There are herbs.

00:01:43.274 --> 00:01:44.318
It all depends.

00:01:44.318 --> 00:01:47.155
We're not sure what they
have every week or every day.

00:01:47.155 --> 00:01:49.114
They have a different
selection of wild animals,

00:01:49.114 --> 00:01:53.154
wild birds, and ingredients,
so today I'm pretty happy

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:55.274
that we got the wild ducks.

00:01:55.274 --> 00:01:58.703
I do enjoy cooking sometimes
but I'm not even close,

00:01:58.703 --> 00:02:00.667
not even comparable to how good

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:02.238
my mother-in-law is at cooking.

00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:05.669
She's one of the best cooks
I know in the entire world.

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:09.502
So, I'm gonna, Micah and
I are gonna watch mom

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.915
as she cooks and then I'm just gonna

00:02:12.915 --> 00:02:14.998
narrate the whole recipe.

00:02:18.782 --> 00:02:20.742
And as I'm standing here,
I'm just seeing that she's

00:02:20.742 --> 00:02:23.116
making some dried fish.

00:02:23.116 --> 00:02:25.869
I think these are mullet,
little mullet fish

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.886
and last night she
rinsed them in salt water

00:02:28.886 --> 00:02:30.497
and now she's drying them in the sun.

00:02:30.497 --> 00:02:32.741
She makes all kinds of
awesome food at this house.

00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:34.824
Okay, so we got the ducks

00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:45.808
She wants to just roast it over the fire

00:02:45.808 --> 00:02:47.891
to take off all the hair.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.393
That already smells good.

00:02:56.393 --> 00:02:58.560
It smells like roast duck.

00:03:02.563 --> 00:03:04.638
In Thai, they are called nuk phet nam,

00:03:04.638 --> 00:03:07.772
which are, I think it's
some kind of wild duck.

00:03:07.772 --> 00:03:12.597
In Thai it would translate
directly to "water duck"

00:03:12.597 --> 00:03:14.472
and I would also say that you could,

00:03:14.472 --> 00:03:16.376
whatever recipe she's gonna make right now

00:03:16.376 --> 00:03:18.400
which we're all about to
find out all the ingredients

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.423
she adds to it, but you could
probably substitute any kind

00:03:21.423 --> 00:03:24.784
of meat, whether you want
chicken or beef or anything

00:03:24.784 --> 00:03:27.368
'cause we're gonna mince them up.

00:03:27.368 --> 00:03:29.635
And now, after roasting all the
feather stubs off the ducks,

00:03:29.635 --> 00:03:31.435
now comes the time where she's gonna

00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:33.499
rinse off the ducks and clean them.

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.124
She's going the extra mile with tweezers

00:03:37.124 --> 00:03:39.027
to pull out all of the feathers.

00:03:39.027 --> 00:03:42.444
You don't wanna bite into a hard feather.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.749
She's about to chop off that head.

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:55.925
I probably won't show too many details.

00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:58.325
It got a little bloody but basically she

00:03:58.325 --> 00:04:01.534
took out all of the organs of the duck

00:04:01.534 --> 00:04:04.709
and kind of took out
everything from the cavity.

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.001
The last time she made this recipe,

00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:07.975
she included all the bones.

00:04:07.975 --> 00:04:12.215
Like, the entire duck, apart
from the head, I think.

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:14.290
Chopped it all up, minced it all up,

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.637
but it was pretty kinda
on the crunchy side.

00:04:16.637 --> 00:04:19.492
I got some bone shards stuck in my teeth

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:22.177
so this time I asked her to
take out the bigger bones

00:04:22.177 --> 00:04:24.169
but she said she's still
gonna mince up the,

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.495
I think the rib cage and smaller bones.

00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:27.773
And then after she finishes doing that,

00:04:27.773 --> 00:04:30.086
we'll be ready to stir fry
it up with all the spices

00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:31.753
and all the chilies.

00:04:42.132 --> 00:04:44.042
Okay, 15 minutes later.

00:04:44.042 --> 00:04:47.571
The ducks have been
transformed into a full mince

00:04:47.571 --> 00:04:50.230
and we are moving back over
to the street food cart.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.950
The first step is the mei phakchÄ«,

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.117
which are coriander seeds.

00:04:56.052 --> 00:04:58.302
She's just gonna dry roast.

00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:08.278
And then also some yihra, cumin.

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:13.911
Oh, yes the aroma of that
dry roasting yihra or cumin

00:05:13.911 --> 00:05:15.244
is just amazing.

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:18.090
And again, all of these ingredients,

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.115
I'm gonna write all of
these in full recipe

00:05:20.115 --> 00:05:23.230
but we've also got, this is called bayira.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.849
I think they might also
be called tree basil

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:28.903
and then we've also got some galangal.

00:05:28.903 --> 00:05:30.484
This is young galangal.

00:05:30.484 --> 00:05:33.243
Oh, and as I'm speaking,
she is finished roasting

00:05:33.243 --> 00:05:37.410
those spices and she's
dumping them into the mortar.

00:05:43.205 --> 00:05:45.940
And then set aside those dry spices

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.357
and next step is to take that minced meat

00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:53.235
and just stir fry it.

00:05:57.406 --> 00:05:58.487
Oh, that smells delicious.

00:05:58.487 --> 00:06:00.987
That smells like cooking duck.

00:06:02.888 --> 00:06:04.570
A little bit of a gamey smell to it.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.804
What we're gonna do for this recipe,

00:06:05.804 --> 00:06:08.917
is we're gonna prepare all of
the ingredients separately.

00:06:08.917 --> 00:06:11.741
So, stir fry the meat,
get all the spices ready,

00:06:11.741 --> 00:06:14.375
and then after that, we're
gonna assemble the entire thing

00:06:14.375 --> 00:06:16.607
by stir frying it all together.

00:06:16.607 --> 00:06:17.906
The duck is finished stir frying

00:06:17.906 --> 00:06:20.120
and she's draining out all that oil.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.124
You can see it.

00:06:22.124 --> 00:06:23.866
Down below there is all the oil

00:06:23.866 --> 00:06:27.216
but we just want the meat, the dry meat.

00:06:27.216 --> 00:06:31.216
Next step it to pound up
the garlic and chilies.

00:06:47.551 --> 00:06:51.551
And she's gonna put in a
big handful of chilies.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.229
So you just wanna pull off those stems

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:59.020
and then drop them into
the mortar with the garlic

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.603
and pound those up.

00:07:09.075 --> 00:07:11.366
You wanna just pound up
the garlic and chilies

00:07:11.366 --> 00:07:15.855
until you've got kind of
a coarse grind to them.

00:07:15.855 --> 00:07:17.438
Just no big chunks.

00:07:18.844 --> 00:07:21.497
For the next step, she's
taking young galangal

00:07:21.497 --> 00:07:23.300
and slicing it up really thin

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.467
and she's gonna add it to this recipe.

00:07:28.078 --> 00:07:30.641
I would say that in the
majority of Thai recipes,

00:07:30.641 --> 00:07:35.172
galangal is normally used
just to be included with soups

00:07:35.172 --> 00:07:37.130
and then it's boiled and
the flavor's extracted

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.181
and you don't eat it but in this recipe,

00:07:39.181 --> 00:07:41.554
since it's young galangal,
we're gonna eat it

00:07:41.554 --> 00:07:43.176
as long as it's chopped up small like that

00:07:43.176 --> 00:07:45.177
and it provides some awesome flavor.

00:07:45.177 --> 00:07:47.945
Today, for this recipe,
we have some bayira

00:07:47.945 --> 00:07:50.312
but you could also make
this recipe with basil.

00:07:50.312 --> 00:07:52.006
Holy basil is really good also

00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:54.963
but I'm really loving these
jeera leaves right now.

00:07:54.963 --> 00:07:59.526
Kind of almost like licoricey
but sweet and kind of,

00:07:59.526 --> 00:08:04.517
yeah, just a unique wonderful
herb flavor to them.

00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:06.654
They are delicious and I can
actually smell them right now

00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:09.737
as she's breaking them off the stems.

00:08:11.178 --> 00:08:13.676
And then one more awesome
ingredient we have over here

00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:15.155
are green peppercorns,

00:08:15.155 --> 00:08:18.747
which are another powerful flavor enhancer

00:08:18.747 --> 00:08:22.580
and she's just rinsing
off those jeera leaves.

00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:32.004
And I think just because they're so big,

00:08:32.004 --> 00:08:34.507
she's gonna give it a coarse chop.

00:08:34.507 --> 00:08:37.262
Otherwise, you could
just leave them whole.

00:08:37.262 --> 00:08:39.171
And then in go those green peppercorns.

00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:41.652
Give them a quick wash and then she's just

00:08:41.652 --> 00:08:44.152
lightly chopping them as well,

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:48.419
just so you don't get an
entire strand of peppercorns

00:08:48.419 --> 00:08:50.320
in your mouth at once in one bite.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.964
Everything's prepared.

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:54.182
Oh, she's about to add
in the oil right now

00:08:54.182 --> 00:08:56.003
but we've got, she's gonna add in some oil

00:08:56.003 --> 00:08:58.351
and then we're just gonna
assemble everything,

00:08:58.351 --> 00:09:00.018
including that duck.

00:09:00.893 --> 00:09:04.610
And then, first inside
the oil goes in all of the

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.484
chilies and garlic that we pounded up.

00:09:08.484 --> 00:09:13.395
If it gets too dry, you can
add in a little bit of water.

00:09:13.395 --> 00:09:16.395
This is a Southern Thai curry paste.

00:09:19.266 --> 00:09:23.433
And that's a good, like, three
or four tablespoons, I think.

00:09:31.227 --> 00:09:32.595
And then again, if that gets too dry,

00:09:32.595 --> 00:09:34.990
you can add in a little bit of water.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:39.157
And next step is to add all
that duck, that minced meat.

00:09:46.773 --> 00:09:48.773
Oh, that smells so good.

00:09:52.722 --> 00:09:55.472
Next goes in all of the galangal.

00:09:57.137 --> 00:09:59.765
And then those dried spices,
which is the coriander seeds

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:03.932
and the jeera, cumin and then
just stir fry all that up.

00:10:06.543 --> 00:10:08.126
One of the beauties of
this dish is that you

00:10:08.126 --> 00:10:10.370
have all of the ingredients prepared

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.621
and so then when you're
cooking it, you basically just

00:10:12.621 --> 00:10:15.679
assemble everything and you
stir fry it pretty quickly.

00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:18.096
And now for the jeera leaves.

00:10:20.048 --> 00:10:21.633
And you wanna put those in at the very end

00:10:21.633 --> 00:10:24.015
'cause you don't want
to cook them very long.

00:10:24.015 --> 00:10:26.251
You want them to remain
fresh and just have all of

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:30.476
their natural flavor but
just wilt them into the dish.

00:10:30.476 --> 00:10:33.803
You can really smell the
aroma of the jeera leaves,

00:10:33.803 --> 00:10:35.663
as soon as she adds it in there.

00:10:35.663 --> 00:10:36.496
Oh, it's beautiful.

00:10:36.496 --> 00:10:40.579
It's like a sweet, licoricy
but like spicy aroma.

00:10:48.744 --> 00:10:51.411
Okay, here's my taste test time.

00:11:00.588 --> 00:11:02.445
Oh, that's good.

00:11:02.445 --> 00:11:06.299
Oh and then final step is to
add in some Kaffir lime leaves.

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:10.466
She just wrapped them up and
is really finely slicing them.

00:11:26.128 --> 00:11:27.038
And that was the final step.

00:11:27.038 --> 00:11:28.878
She just threw in the Kaffir lime leaves

00:11:28.878 --> 00:11:32.215
and just stir fried it just
for a couple more seconds.

00:11:32.215 --> 00:11:33.465
Oh, that spoon.

00:11:42.206 --> 00:11:44.762
This guy, Micah, slept
through the entire recipe.

00:11:44.762 --> 00:11:46.494
One more thing that my
mother-in-law just mentioned

00:11:46.494 --> 00:11:50.510
is that she didn't need to add
any extra fish sauce or salt

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.530
because the curry paste
already had salt in it

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.510
and I think probably it
also had shrimp paste in it

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.481
which gave it some saltiness.

00:11:58.481 --> 00:12:00.130
But you gotta taste test.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.908
There's no way of making Thai
food without taste testing.

00:12:03.908 --> 00:12:05.747
If you do need to add,

00:12:05.747 --> 00:12:08.815
if it needs more salt,
add in some fish sauce.

00:12:08.815 --> 00:12:11.841
My mother-in-law also
cooked a few other dishes,

00:12:11.841 --> 00:12:13.493
including that dried fish that was

00:12:13.493 --> 00:12:14.784
drying earlier in the morning.

00:12:14.784 --> 00:12:16.311
She fried a couple of those up.

00:12:16.311 --> 00:12:19.622
And then have the pad
phet, the main duck dish

00:12:19.622 --> 00:12:23.108
and then also a curry,
gang, I think yÃ¹ak glÃ»ay,

00:12:23.108 --> 00:12:24.941
which is banana trunk.

00:12:26.432 --> 00:12:28.659
It's a banana trunk curry with a gangate,

00:12:28.659 --> 00:12:30.082
which is a coconut milk curry.

00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:33.045
And I have to begin with
the nuk bet nahm pad phet,

00:12:33.045 --> 00:12:38.022
which is the fried curry herbal
everything duck, wild duck.

00:12:38.022 --> 00:12:38.855
You gotta just come take a

00:12:38.855 --> 00:12:41.042
really, really close up look at this.

00:12:41.042 --> 00:12:43.589
You can just see the
seeds of all the chilies.

00:12:43.589 --> 00:12:45.670
You can see the herbs in there,

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.677
the little chunks of galangal in there.

00:12:47.677 --> 00:12:51.156
It is just an absolutely beautiful sight.

00:12:51.156 --> 00:12:51.989
Oh, yes.

00:12:54.623 --> 00:12:58.456
Okay, I'm going in for
that immediately first.

00:13:07.371 --> 00:13:08.454
It's amazing.

00:13:09.762 --> 00:13:12.262
The flavor density is so high.

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.204
So many flavors going on in there.

00:13:15.204 --> 00:13:17.461
I can taste those little
chunks of galangal.

00:13:17.461 --> 00:13:20.878
I can also really taste the jeera leaves.

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.863
Those are absolutely delicious

00:13:25.863 --> 00:13:27.734
and they have a different
twist of a flavor

00:13:27.734 --> 00:13:30.815
from sweet basil or a holy basil.

00:13:30.815 --> 00:13:34.148
It's spicy and then the actual wild duck

00:13:35.779 --> 00:13:38.346
tastes similar to a
normal duck but with maybe

00:13:38.346 --> 00:13:42.409
a little bit of a gamier,
just slightly gamier,

00:13:42.409 --> 00:13:44.735
actually most of the
gaminess is kinda masked by

00:13:44.735 --> 00:13:47.077
all those herbs and spices.

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:48.754
That is just awesome.

00:13:48.754 --> 00:13:51.077
And next up for the curry.

00:13:51.077 --> 00:13:53.455
These are the pieces of the banana stalk

00:13:53.455 --> 00:13:56.144
and then I think there's chicken in here.

00:13:56.144 --> 00:13:58.977
Stick this onto my rice over here.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.393
Those banana stalks,
they're a little bit chewy

00:14:10.393 --> 00:14:12.393
and slightly like slimy.

00:14:13.968 --> 00:14:16.116
Finally, let me grab
one of those fried fish,

00:14:16.116 --> 00:14:17.533
fried dried fish.

00:14:21.535 --> 00:14:22.834
Oh yeah.

00:14:22.834 --> 00:14:26.307
Yeah, it's nice and salty and then crispy.

00:14:26.307 --> 00:14:29.898
Oh, she made it really, really good.

00:14:29.898 --> 00:14:32.731
Let me get that head in this bite.

00:14:35.512 --> 00:14:36.616
Oh yeah.

00:14:36.616 --> 00:14:40.035
Thank you very much to my
mother-in-law for making the food

00:14:40.035 --> 00:14:42.122

00:14:45.054 --> 00:14:47.353

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:49.808
ultimate favorite Thai dishes.

00:14:49.808 --> 00:14:51.099
There's so much,

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:54.626

fry dish that you can make

00:14:54.626 --> 00:14:57.851
