00:00:06.624 --> 00:00:08.344
“It was a pleasure to burn.

00:00:08.344 --> 00:00:11.144
It was a special pleasure
to see things eaten,

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.944
to see things blackened and changed.”

00:00:13.944 --> 00:00:18.844
Fahrenheit 451 opens in a blissful blaze
- and before long,

00:00:18.844 --> 00:00:21.894
we learn what’s going up in flames.

00:00:21.894 --> 00:00:24.394
Ray Bradbury’s novel imagines a world

00:00:24.394 --> 00:00:28.304
where books are banned 
from all areas of life -

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:32.184
and possessing, let alone 
reading them, is forbidden.

00:00:32.184 --> 00:00:37.504
The protagonist, Montag, is a fireman
responsible for destroying what remains.

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:39.794
But as his pleasure gives way to doubt,

00:00:39.794 --> 00:00:44.684
the story raises critical questions
of how to preserve one’s mind in a society

00:00:44.684 --> 00:00:49.884
where free will, self-expression,
and curiosity are under fire.

00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:54.054
In Montag’s world, mass media
has a monopoly on information,

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.734
erasing almost all ability
for independent thought.

00:00:57.734 --> 00:01:01.174
On the subway, ads blast out of the walls.

00:01:01.174 --> 00:01:05.854
At home, Montag’s wife Mildred listens to
the radio around the clock,

00:01:05.854 --> 00:01:10.054
and three of their parlor walls
are plastered with screens.

00:01:10.054 --> 00:01:14.244
At work, the smell of kerosene
hangs over Montag’s colleagues, 

00:01:14.244 --> 00:01:19.234
who smoke and set their mechanical
hound after rats to pass the time.

00:01:19.234 --> 00:01:23.474
When the alarm sounds they surge
out in salamander-shaped vehicles,

00:01:23.474 --> 00:01:27.054
sometimes to burn whole
libraries to the ground.

00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:31.404
But as he sets tomes ablaze day
after day like “black butterflies,”

00:01:31.404 --> 00:01:37.274
Montag’s mind occasionally wanders to the
contraband that lies hidden in his home.

00:01:37.274 --> 00:01:40.414
Gradually, he begins to question
the basis of his work.

00:01:40.414 --> 00:01:43.634
Montag realizes he’s always felt uneasy -

00:01:43.634 --> 00:01:48.034
but has lacked the descriptive words
to express his feelings in a society

00:01:48.034 --> 00:01:52.584
where even uttering the phrase
“once upon a time” can be fatal.

00:01:52.584 --> 00:01:55.314
Fahrenheit 451 depicts a world governed

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:59.094
by surveillance, robotics, 
and virtual reality-

00:01:59.094 --> 00:02:04.394
a vision that proved remarkably prescient,
but also spoke to the concerns of the time.

00:02:04.394 --> 00:02:09.354
The novel was published in 1953,
at the height of the Cold War.

00:02:09.354 --> 00:02:12.844
This era kindled widespread 
paranoia and fear

00:02:12.844 --> 00:02:16.154
throughout Bradbury’s home 
country of the United States,

00:02:16.154 --> 00:02:21.254
amplified by the suppression of information
and brutal government investigations.

00:02:21.254 --> 00:02:23.904
In particular, this witch hunt mentality

00:02:23.904 --> 00:02:28.734
targeted artists and writers who
were suspected of Communist sympathies.

00:02:28.734 --> 00:02:31.934
Bradbury was alarmed at
this cultural crackdown.

00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:35.554
He believed it set a dangerous 
precedent for further censorship,

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:38.924
and was reminded of the destruction of
the Library of Alexandria

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:41.994
and the book-burning of Fascist regimes.

00:02:41.994 --> 00:02:45.914
He explored these chilling 
connections in Fahrenheit 451,

00:02:45.914 --> 00:02:49.224
titled after the temperature 
at which paper burns.

00:02:49.224 --> 00:02:52.684
The accuracy of that temperature
has been called into question,

00:02:52.684 --> 00:02:55.014
but that doesn’t diminish the novel’s 
standing

00:02:55.014 --> 00:02:57.764
as a masterpiece of dystopian fiction.

00:02:57.764 --> 00:03:03.064
Dystopian fiction as a genre amplifies
troubling features of the world around us

00:03:03.064 --> 00:03:07.144
and imagines the consequences
of taking them to an extreme.

00:03:07.144 --> 00:03:08.854
In many dystopian stories, 

00:03:08.854 --> 00:03:12.804
the government imposes constrictions
onto unwilling subjects.

00:03:12.804 --> 00:03:14.974
But in Fahrenheit 451,

00:03:14.974 --> 00:03:17.934
Montag learns that it was
the apathy of the masses

00:03:17.934 --> 00:03:20.344
that gave rise to the current regime.

00:03:20.344 --> 00:03:23.284
The government merely capitalized on
short attention spans

00:03:23.284 --> 00:03:25.834
and the appetite for 
mindless entertainment,

00:03:25.834 --> 00:03:29.364
reducing the circulation of ideas to ash.

00:03:29.364 --> 00:03:33.714
As culture disappears,
imagination and self-expression follow.

00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:36.404
Even the way people talk
is short-circuited

00:03:36.404 --> 00:03:42.294
- such as when Montag’s boss Captain Beatty
describes the acceleration of mass culture:

00:03:42.294 --> 00:03:47.234
"Speed up the film, Montag, quick.
Click? Pic? Look, Eye, Now, Flick, Here,

00:03:47.234 --> 00:03:52.774
There, Swift, Pace, Up, Down, In, Out,
Why, How, Who, What, Where, Eh? Uh!

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:58.484
Bang! Smack! Wallop, Bing, Bong, Boom!
Digest-digests, digest-digest-digests.

00:03:58.484 --> 00:04:03.634
Politics? One column, two sentences, a
headline! Then, in mid-air, all vanishes!"

00:04:03.634 --> 00:04:08.254
In this barren world, Montag learns
how difficult it is to resist when

00:04:08.254 --> 00:04:10.704
there's nothing left to hold on to.

00:04:10.704 --> 00:04:15.014
Altogether, Fahrenheit 451 is a portrait
of independent thought

00:04:15.014 --> 00:04:16.434
on the brink of extinction -

00:04:16.434 --> 00:04:19.824
and a parable about a
society which is complicit

00:04:19.824 --> 00:04:21.984
in its own combustion.
