00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:09.491
Humans have observed comets 
for thousands of years

00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:13.256
as their orbits have brought them within
visible distance of Earth.

00:00:13.256 --> 00:00:15.243
Appearing throughout historical records,

00:00:15.243 --> 00:00:17.782
these mysterious lights that 
came out of nowhere

00:00:17.782 --> 00:00:19.878
and disappeared after a short while

00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:22.697
were thought to be ill omens of
war and famine,

00:00:22.697 --> 00:00:24.426
or the wrath of gods.

00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:28.600
But recent research has revealed that
comets may be even more deeply connected

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.582
to humanity and our presence on Earth

00:00:30.582 --> 00:00:34.122
than any of these mythical 
explanations suggested.

00:00:34.122 --> 00:00:37.382
When you think of our Solar System,
you probably imagine the nine,

00:00:37.382 --> 00:00:40.589
sorry eight, planets orbiting the Sun.

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.821
But beyond Neptune,
far from the heat of the Sun,

00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:46.483
there is a sparse ring found 
formed by icy chunks

00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:50.661
ranging from the size 
of marbles to that of small planets.

00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:54.153
And thousands of times farther at the
outer reaches of the Solar System

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:57.833
lies a spherical cloud of small 
fragments and gases.

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:01.267
Many of these ancient clumps of stardust
are leftovers from the formation

00:01:01.267 --> 00:01:05.013
of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago,

00:01:05.013 --> 00:01:09.258
while some of the most distant may even
come from a neighboring system.

00:01:09.258 --> 00:01:12.340
But sometimes the gravity from 
passing planets or stars

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.381
pulls them toward our sun,

00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:17.766
beginning a journey that can take up to
millions of years.

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:21.198
As the frozen object travels further
into the Solar System,

00:01:21.198 --> 00:01:24.012
the sun grows from a distant spark
to an inferno,

00:01:24.012 --> 00:01:27.612
melting the ice for the first time
in billions of years.

00:01:27.612 --> 00:01:29.865
Gas and steam eject dust into space,

00:01:29.865 --> 00:01:32.881
forming a bright surrounding cloud,
called a coma,

00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:35.973
that can grow even larger than
the sun itself.

00:01:35.973 --> 00:01:38.835
Meanwhile, the intense stream of 
high-energy particles

00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:42.333
constantly emitted by the Sun,
known as the solar wind,

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:45.070
blows particles away from 
the comet's core,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.791
forming a trail of debris up to millions
of miles long.

00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:52.597
The ice, gas and dust reflect 
light glowing brightly.

00:01:52.597 --> 00:01:56.403
A comet is born, now orbiting the sun
along with the rest of the objects

00:01:56.403 --> 00:01:58.804
in our Solar System.

00:01:58.804 --> 00:02:01.318
But as the comet travels through
the Solar System,

00:02:01.318 --> 00:02:06.897
the solar wind tears apart and recombines
molecules into various compounds.

00:02:06.897 --> 00:02:09.456
In some of the compounds that
scientists found,

00:02:09.456 --> 00:02:13.981
first in the rubble left by a meteorite
that disintegrated above northern Canada,

00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:17.897
and then in samples collected by a space
craft from a passing comet's tail,

00:02:17.897 --> 00:02:21.322
were nothing less important than
amino acids.

00:02:21.322 --> 00:02:25.914
Coming together to form proteins
according to the instructs encoded in DNA,

00:02:25.914 --> 00:02:29.149
these are the main active components
in all living cells,

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.450
from bacteria to blue whales.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.197
If comets are where these building blocks
of life were first formed,

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:37.844
then they are the ultimate source of
life on Earth,

00:02:37.844 --> 00:02:41.477
and, perhaps, some of the other places
they visited as well.

00:02:41.477 --> 00:02:44.763
We know that planets orbit nearly every
star in the night sky,

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:49.489
with one in five having a planet
similar to Earth in size and temperature.

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.699
If Earth-like planets and the molecules
found in DNA are not anomalies,

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.194
we may be only one 
example of what's possible

00:02:56.194 --> 00:03:00.335
when a planet under the right conditions
is seeded with organic molecules

00:03:00.335 --> 00:03:02.123
by a passing comet.

00:03:02.123 --> 00:03:04.271
So, rather than an omen of death,

00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:06.856
the comet that first brought 
amino acids to Earth

00:03:06.856 --> 00:03:09.435
could have been a portent of life,

00:03:09.435 --> 00:03:12.884
a prediction of a distant future,
where creatures of stardust

00:03:12.884 --> 00:03:17.258
would return to space to find 
the mysteries of where they came from.
