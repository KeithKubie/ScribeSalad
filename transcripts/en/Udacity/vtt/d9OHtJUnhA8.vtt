00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So we just filled out that previous code integrating our HTML interpreter

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
with our JavaScript interpreter,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
assuming that our JavaScript interpreter returns a string.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The basic idea is that if the embedded JavaScript code called document.write(x),

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we'd notice that x and save it and return it back to you.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Unfortunately, there is an evil problem.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is a little more complicated than it looks.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is totally legitimate JavaScript code.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Note that I have 1 call to document.write and then another call to document.write.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Somehow I'm going to need to paste together "hello" and "world" and return both of them.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So the basic problem here is that there may not be just 1 call to write.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
There may be many more or actually there may be 0,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but we want to get out of this "hello-space-world!"

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So we have to store text printed by write,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but we may find that as we execute or interpret the JavaScript program,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the amount of output grows.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Well, if we want to store values that may change--

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
boy, if only we already had some way to do that--oh wait! We totally do.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We went to all that trouble to learn about how environments work

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
in nested environments and variable updates.

00:01:10.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Let's reuse that. That was really powerful!
