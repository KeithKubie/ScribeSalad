00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.120
NARRATOR: "We hold
these truths to be

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.170
self-evident that all men,
and women, are created equal."

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.290
No, that's not the
Declaration of Independence.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.380
It's actually from the
Declaration of Sentiments,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.210
a document signed at the first
ever Women's Rights Convention

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.830
in 1848.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.540
Back then, women in the US
weren't allowed to do a lot

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.920
of things men were, like vote.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.330
And it would take them
another 70 years to be

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.580
granted that fundamental right.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.330
Why?

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.080
Well, many thought encouraging
women's involvement in politics

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.330
would undermine society.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.920
The prospect of women voting
was threatening to the white men

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.580
who held power.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.170
In 1848, Elizabeth Cady
Stanton and Lucretia Mott

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.080
decided to organize
factions across the country

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.580
that were campaigning for
suffrage or the right to vote.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.920
The convention at
Seneca Falls, New York

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.080
addressed women's
rights and inspired

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.920
other conventions and meetings.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.080
Stanton considered
it the beginning

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.250
of the women's rights movement.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.960
After the Civil War,
the 15th Amendment

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.420
was introduced, which
would give black men,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.250
but not women of any
color, the right to vote.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.290
Suffragists were split.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.960
Stanton and Susan B. Anthony
opposed the amendment,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.290
objecting to the
exclusion of women.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.080
They formed the National
Women's Suffrage Association,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.380
hoping to pass a constitutional
amendment that included women.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.790
Others, like abolitionists
Lucy Stone and Henry Blackwell

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.120
supported the 15th Amendment.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.210
They founded the American
Women's Suffrage Association

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.290
and lobbied for the women's
right to vote on a state level

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.960
instead of through a
national amendment.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.080
The 15th Amendment
was ratified in 1870.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.750
Black men could vote,
but women still couldn't.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.420
In 1878, a women's
suffrage amendment

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.580
penned by Susan B. Anthony was
finally proposed in Congress.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.580
But it was defeated on
the Senate floor in 1887.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.170
In 1890, the separate
suffrage movements

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.290
merged, opting to
tackle suffrage

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.460
by state in the wake of the
federal Amendment's defeat.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.290
Within six years, Colorado,
Utah, and Idaho granted

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.580
women the right to vote.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.500
Wyoming had already
done it in 1869.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.170
Around the same time,
the National Association

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.920
of Colored Women was formed,
bringing together more than 100

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.500
black women's clubs.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.000
It included leaders Mary Church
Terrell, Josephine Silone

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.710
Yates, and Anna Julia Cooper.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.880
By the turn of the 20th century,
the women's suffrage movement

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.960
had gained renewed momentum.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.880
Parades, marches,
and pickets drew

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.960
great attention to the cause.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.210
Between 1910 and 1918, a number
of states and territories

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.380
expanded voting rights to women.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.710
In 1912, 15,000 suffrage
supporters took to the streets

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.000
of New York City.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.620
But as women's
political power grew,

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.500
so did the danger they faced.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.120
In 1913, on the eve of President
Woodrow Wilson's inauguration,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.540
hundreds of women were
injured in a massive suffrage

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.710
parade in the nation's capital.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.000
In November of 1917, 33
suffragists were arrested

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.750
outside the White House.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.880
The women were clubbed, beaten,
and tortured by prison guards

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.580
at the Occoquan Workhouse.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.920
One of the movement's
leaders, Alice Paul,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.580
founder of what became the
National Woman's Party,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.920
was placed in
solitary confinement

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.500
in order to break her will
and undermine her credibility.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.040
But press coverage of
the women's treatment

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.040
increased sympathy
for their plight.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.670
And in 1918, Representative
Jeannette Rankin,

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.000
the first woman in Congress,
opened congressional debate on

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.670
a woman's suffrage amendment.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.420
The resolution failed.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.000
In 1918,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.750
President Wilson also came
out in favor of suffrage,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.380
declaring it was needed
as a war measure.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.710
Wilson argued that women had
been providing vital roles

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.750
during World War I
and that their votes

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.580
should be counted
in order to make

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.920
the world safe for democracy.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.880
Finally, in 1919, the Federal
Women's Suffrage Amendment,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.920
the same one written by Susan
B. Anthony back in 1878,

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.580
was passed by the
House and the Senate.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.460
And on August 26, 1920,
the 19th Amendment

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.080
was officially incorporated
into the US Constitution,

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.960
prohibiting denying the vote to
a US citizen based on gender,

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.250
although states could
still deny voting

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.080
rights based on other things.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.290
It would take another four
years for Native American women

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.710
and men to get the right to
vote and more than 30 years

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.670
before major restrictions were
lifted on Asian-American voting

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.500
rights.
