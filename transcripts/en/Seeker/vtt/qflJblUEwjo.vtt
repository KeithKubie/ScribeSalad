00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.189
There’s a cold spot at the edge of our observable
universe and I’m HOPING that it’s evidence

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.730
for ANOTHER universe invading our personal
space.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.990
Hello!

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.860
I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer for Discovery
News, and I wanted to chat about a cosmic

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.789
peculiarity that has fascinated me for years.

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.310
In an effort to understand the Big Bang, the
scale of the universe and the very nature

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.970
of space-time, cosmologists look to the furthest
reaches of our observable universe.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.210
Waaaaaaay out there is a faint afterglow,
basically what astronomers interpret as the

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.250
“echo” of the Big Bang that occurred over
14 billion years ago.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.940
This signal is known as the Cosmic Microwave
Background, or CMB.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.570
It exhibits very slight temperature variations
known as anisotropies (“an-isOtr’pees.”)

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.070
In recent years, increasingly advanced observatories
have been able to measure these temperature

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.500
variations to extremely high precision.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.540
Most recently, you may remember the big debate
over whether or not the BICEP2 telescope at

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.430
the South Pole had detected gravitational
waves etched in the CMB.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.890
Unfortunately that result has been called
into doubt by the European Planck Space Telescope,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.629
but that doesn’t mean gravitational waves
aren’t out there, we just need to look a

00:00:58.629 --> 00:00:59.629
bit harder.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.890
As you may have guessed, reading patterns
in the CMB is a tricky affair.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.549
When measuring tiny variations in CMB temperature,
all kinds of complex statistical algorithms

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.880
are needed to help us understand whether or
not the anomalies we see in the CMB are real

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.319
or just noisy data.

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:17.649
So that brings me to the infamous CMB “Cold
Spot”, which could be one of the most mindblowing

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.729
features EVER discovered in the cosmos.

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:20.729
Or it could just be a glitch.

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.929
So it might be nothing... but it could be
EVERYTHING!

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:24.479
Cosmology certainly loves extremes!

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.849
The CMB cold spot was first uncovered by the
NASA WMAP mission that mapped the entire sky

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:30.709
for CMB temperature variations.

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.240
And there it was, a conspicuous cold blob
in the direction of the southern constellation

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.240
of Eridinus.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.359
Then, in 2013, there was an “oh shit”
moment when Planck ALSO detected the cold

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.999
spot, ruling out instrumental error as a possible
cause of the WMAP anomaly.

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:46.739
This thing is huge -- covering 10 degrees
of the sky -- and if it’s real, it would

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:49.709
be the biggest astronomical structure in the
known universe.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:50.759
So what is it?

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.649
In a nutshell, WE HAVE NO IDEA.

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.649
And this is why it’s so awesome.

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.049
But there are theories.

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.329
Probably the most down-to-earth theory is
that the cold spot is being caused by a huge

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.789
void inside our universe between us and the
CMB’s source.

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.549
We know that the universe is composed of a
complex web of galaxies beaded along vast

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.849
dark matter structures.

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:09.319
But between these structures are voids of
very little matter.

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.860
As the radiation from the CMB travels through
these voids, its properties are tweaked by

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.110
the so-called Sachs-Wolfe effect indicating
that a “supervoid” is creating a cold

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.480
spot that isn’t really there.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.219
BUT, the most extreme and possibly most exciting
explanation suggests the cold spot is actually

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.719
evidence of ANOTHER UNIVERSE pushing up against
our own.

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.470
Naturally, cosmologists, physicists and astronomers
are divided over this explanation, but it

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.530
would be cool.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.650
If all other explanations are ruled out, and
this one remains, it could support the “multiverse

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.900
hypothesis” -- where our universe is like
one of countless bubbles floating in a multi-universe

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.900
soup.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.099
But most recently, astronomers analyzing the
new Planck data suggest the cold spot might

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.130
actually just be an artifact in how we correct
for extraneous sources of microwaves, and

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.719
if we account for the motion of our galaxy,
the cold spot fades away into the noisy background.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:54.719
Boo.

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:58.319
So, for the sake of awesomeness, I’m hoping
it’s being caused by a nosey parallel universe

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.319
neighbor.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.420
Do you think there’s another universe out
there?
