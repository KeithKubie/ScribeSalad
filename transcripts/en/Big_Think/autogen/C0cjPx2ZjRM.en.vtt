the decline that got everyone so upset

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519
the decline that got everyone so upset
 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.480
the decline that got everyone so upset
to begin with now what's odd is the

so on the increase has been called

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210
so on the increase has been called

is relatively flat performance and

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020
is relatively flat performance and
