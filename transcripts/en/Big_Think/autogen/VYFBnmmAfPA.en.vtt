Oh

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799
 
 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.860
 
it's almost impossible to guess the

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870
it's almost impossible to guess the
 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.150
it's almost impossible to guess the
number of communicating civilizations

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160
number of communicating civilizations
 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.250
number of communicating civilizations
that are out there because as I've

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260
that are out there because as I've

described the fraction of planets on

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650
described the fraction of planets on
 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.190
described the fraction of planets on
which life emerges is not known it could

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200
which life emerges is not known it could
 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.710
which life emerges is not known it could
be anything from zero to well and so

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720
be anything from zero to well and so
 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.679
be anything from zero to well and so
they the uncertainties in that number

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689
they the uncertainties in that number
 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.200
they the uncertainties in that number
really mean that it's a fool's errand

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210
really mean that it's a fool's errand
 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.320
really mean that it's a fool's errand
trying to estimate the further

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330
trying to estimate the further
 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.310
trying to estimate the further
consequences of their being intelligent

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320
consequences of their being intelligent
 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.669
consequences of their being intelligent
life and communicating civilizations but

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679
life and communicating civilizations but
 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.680
life and communicating civilizations but
you can of course go to an optimist and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
you can of course go to an optimist and
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.780
you can of course go to an optimist and
I guess there's no one more optimistic

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790
I guess there's no one more optimistic
 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.759
I guess there's no one more optimistic
than Frank Drake himself and say how

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769
than Frank Drake himself and say how
 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:39.500
than Frank Drake himself and say how
many do you think are out there in the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510
many do you think are out there in the
 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.039
many do you think are out there in the
galaxy and he reckons 10,000 that's his

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:42.049
galaxy and he reckons 10,000 that's his
 

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:47.180
galaxy and he reckons 10,000 that's his
currently best guess well there is so

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
currently best guess well there is so
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.310
currently best guess well there is so
you can then ask well then how close is

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320
you can then ask well then how close is
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.130
you can then ask well then how close is
the nearest one likely to be to us and

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140
the nearest one likely to be to us and
 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.600
the nearest one likely to be to us and
it's going to be a few hundred light

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610
it's going to be a few hundred light
 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.039
it's going to be a few hundred light
years so let's take a thousand light

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:55.049
years so let's take a thousand light
 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:57.740
years so let's take a thousand light
years as the round bigger now the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750
years as the round bigger now the
 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.509
years as the round bigger now the
problem here is that a civilization

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519
problem here is that a civilization
 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.579
problem here is that a civilization
that's a thousand light years away

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589
that's a thousand light years away
 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.950
that's a thousand light years away
doesn't know we exist they don't know

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
doesn't know we exist they don't know
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.260
doesn't know we exist they don't know
that we have radio telescopes here on

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270
that we have radio telescopes here on
 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.539
that we have radio telescopes here on
earth because they see earth as it was a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
earth because they see earth as it was a
 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.910
earth because they see earth as it was a
thousand years ago nothing can travel

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
thousand years ago nothing can travel
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.490
thousand years ago nothing can travel
faster than light so however good their

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
faster than light so however good their
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.819
faster than light so however good their
instruments they can't see in effect the

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829
instruments they can't see in effect the
 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:18.980
instruments they can't see in effect the
future they can only see earth as it was

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
future they can only see earth as it was
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.139
future they can only see earth as it was
a thousand years ago so there's no

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149
a thousand years ago so there's no
 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:22.520
a thousand years ago so there's no
particular reason they should be sending

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530
particular reason they should be sending
 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.389
particular reason they should be sending
us messages at this time and if you put

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399
us messages at this time and if you put
 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.669
us messages at this time and if you put

planet going to a granting agency and
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.319
planet going to a granting agency and
saying there's a really interesting

saying there's a really interesting
planet over there earth that we've

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
planet over there earth that we've
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.279
planet over there earth that we've
studied it very carefully and we can see

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289
studied it very carefully and we can see
 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:41.749
studied it very carefully and we can see
they built huge structures like the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
they built huge structures like the
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.440
they built huge structures like the
pyramids on this great wall in China we

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450
pyramids on this great wall in China we
 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.719
pyramids on this great wall in China we
think some millenium soon they may have

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729
think some millenium soon they may have
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.520
think some millenium soon they may have
radio telescopes could we have some

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530
radio telescopes could we have some
 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.039
radio telescopes could we have some
money to start broadcasting and I can

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049
money to start broadcasting and I can
 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:52.459
money to start broadcasting and I can
tell you

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469
tell you
 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.830
tell you
well the grant agency would say it would

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840
well the grant agency would say it would
 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.349
well the grant agency would say it would
say that's a great idea you come back in

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359
say that's a great idea you come back in
 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:58.639
say that's a great idea you come back in
a few thousand years when you know

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
a few thousand years when you know
 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.709
a few thousand years when you know
they're actually on the air and would

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719
they're actually on the air and would
 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.209
they're actually on the air and would
give you the money to send them some

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
give you the money to send them some
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.739
give you the money to send them some
messages and and that's a situation

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:03.749
messages and and that's a situation
 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:06.440
messages and and that's a situation
we're in so I think it's a bit of a

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
we're in so I think it's a bit of a
 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.830
we're in so I think it's a bit of a
fool's errand to be looking for

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
fool's errand to be looking for
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.559
fool's errand to be looking for
deliberately beamed messages we might

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569
deliberately beamed messages we might
 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.600
deliberately beamed messages we might
stumble across a message intended for

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610
stumble across a message intended for
 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.380
stumble across a message intended for
somebody else or it may be that

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390
somebody else or it may be that
 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.940
somebody else or it may be that
we see a beak on us or something like

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950
we see a beak on us or something like
 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.210
we see a beak on us or something like
that

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220
that
 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.240
that
these things are long shots and so my

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250
these things are long shots and so my
 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.470
these things are long shots and so my
feeling is well we should carry on

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480
feeling is well we should carry on
 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.790
feeling is well we should carry on
trying because who knows what's out

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800
trying because who knows what's out
 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.670
trying because who knows what's out
there but meanwhile we should be finding

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680
there but meanwhile we should be finding
 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.250
there but meanwhile we should be finding
other ways of looking for easy

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260
 
 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.010
 
the history of the galaxy is pretty well

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020
the history of the galaxy is pretty well
 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.070
the history of the galaxy is pretty well
understood and the Stars started forming

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080
understood and the Stars started forming
 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.320
understood and the Stars started forming
towards the center first the age of the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330
towards the center first the age of the
 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.780
towards the center first the age of the
galaxy is a little over thirteen billion

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790
galaxy is a little over thirteen billion
 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.940
galaxy is a little over thirteen billion
years earth is only four-and-a-half

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950
years earth is only four-and-a-half
 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.759
years earth is only four-and-a-half
billion years the very earliest stars

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769
billion years the very earliest stars
 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.790
billion years the very earliest stars
didn't have the sort of heavier elements

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800
didn't have the sort of heavier elements
 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.860
didn't have the sort of heavier elements
like carbon and oxygen and so on that

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870
like carbon and oxygen and so on that
 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.979
like carbon and oxygen and so on that
are necessary for life but after a short

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989
are necessary for life but after a short
 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.470
are necessary for life but after a short
period of time these elements were

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480
period of time these elements were
 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.570
period of time these elements were
manufactured when the first stars made

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580
manufactured when the first stars made
 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.949
manufactured when the first stars made
them and then blow up and spread them

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959
them and then blow up and spread them
 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.030
them and then blow up and spread them
around and so in the early days the the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040
around and so in the early days the the
 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.130
around and so in the early days the the
main action was towards the center of

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140
main action was towards the center of
 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.650
main action was towards the center of
the galaxy where these superstars had

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660
the galaxy where these superstars had
 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.270
the galaxy where these superstars had
exploded and then right out on the edges

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280
exploded and then right out on the edges
 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.410
exploded and then right out on the edges
of the galaxy there was a positive these

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420
of the galaxy there was a positive these
 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.110
of the galaxy there was a positive these
heavy elements and so over time what has

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120
heavy elements and so over time what has
 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.900
heavy elements and so over time what has
happened is that this Goldilocks zone

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910
happened is that this Goldilocks zone
 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.930
happened is that this Goldilocks zone
which could support life has expanded

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940
which could support life has expanded
 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.589
which could support life has expanded
out and where some way in in the middle

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599
out and where some way in in the middle
 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.620
out and where some way in in the middle
suburbs of our Milky Way galaxy the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630
suburbs of our Milky Way galaxy the
 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.809
suburbs of our Milky Way galaxy the
Goldilocks zone is is now moved out to

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819
Goldilocks zone is is now moved out to
 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.410
Goldilocks zone is is now moved out to
here and but that's because of course

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420
here and but that's because of course
 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.050
here and but that's because of course
we've where earth and the solar system

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060
we've where earth and the solar system
 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.690
we've where earth and the solar system
is only about 1/2 or 1/3 as old as the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700
is only about 1/2 or 1/3 as old as the
 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.670
is only about 1/2 or 1/3 as old as the
