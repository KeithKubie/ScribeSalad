00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now Dave wants to communicate with Alice

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
without anyone being able to know they're communicating,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and we have a set of routers. These are like our friends in the example of the envelopes.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's say I know about five routers. We'll call them R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The routers are all connected. They can all talk to each other.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
They can all talk to Alice, and they can all talk to me.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We're assuming we have a fully connected network here.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I haven't drawn all the connections, because that would get kind of messy.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We'll assume we have a fully-connected network here,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and we don't need to have a physically fully-connected network.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
There could be other nodes in between these.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We're assuming we have secure channels between each of the routers,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and we  can set up those channels using TLS,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
so we have these secure channels between all of the routers

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and between all the participants, including myself and Alice.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We'll select some random sequence of the routers.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Each of these i values is one of the values that identifies a router,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and I want to send a message into this network.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Let's assume for now that the last router that I select is R4.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I want it to be the case that R4 sends the final message to Alice that Alice can read.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The question is what message should R4 receive?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The answers are encrypted with Alice's public key.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The message to Alice in clear concatenated with the message--

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
this is the message Dave wants to send to Alice

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
encrypted using the public key of R4.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Encrypted using the public key of R4, the message to Alice concatenated with

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the message encrypted with Alice's public key.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Encrypted using the private key of Bob, the message to Alice concatenated with

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the message encrypted with the public key of R4.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Or the message to Alice concatenated with the message encrypted with

00:01:47.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the public key of Alice all encrypted with the public key of Bob.
