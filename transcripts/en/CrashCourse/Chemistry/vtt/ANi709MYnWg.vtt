00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
All right, so you're studying Chemistry, what's
the worst that could happen?

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.660
In most classes, the worst that can happen
is just abject, total failure.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.780
You're just like failing the test, failing
the class, having to rethink your life choices,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.210
maybe even quit, drop out of school, get a
job at a diner, and start smoking Lucky Strikes.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.250
But in Chemistry, the worst thing that can
happen is death.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.270
And I don't want to make light of this; labs
are dangerous places.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.280
Chemists die younger than the average person,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.220
both because of workplace accidents and cancer
caused by exposure to chemicals.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.769
But chemists have also done more to increase
the average lifespan of humans on earth than,

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.759
in my opinion, any other profession.

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.790
So, it's a necessary hazard.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.150
Last week we talked about stuff mixing together,
and that's important for sure.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.010
But today and for the next few weeks, we're gonna talk about the actual reactions happening in those solutions.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.140
Dangerous reactions: atoms reorganizing themselves
to create whole new substances.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.890
These are the processes that make our world
the world that we know and love.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.150
Some of them are benign and beautiful, some
of them are face-meltingly terrifying.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.830
And that's not hyperbole, I mean actual melted
faces.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:09.250
[Theme Music]

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.240
Captain John Mullen, there,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.280
he blazed the first wagon trail across the Rocky Mountains into the interior Pacific Northwest.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.760
The Captain's only been standing in this spot right here for about 75 years.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.670
And look what's happened to his face.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.070
I know this maybe isn't the face melting you
were expecting,

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.420
but we're not so gruesome here at Crash Course
Chemistry.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.640
The sorry state of Mr. Mullen's face here
is the result of an acid-base reaction,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.700
one of the three major types of reactions
that happen in solution,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.060
that we'll be talking about here at Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.470
And the acid that did this, was mostly sulfuric
acid.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.390
Now you may be wondering, who's been coming
by and throwing sulfuric acid on statues?

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.500
Well actually, what's been doing the throwing
is clouds, the sky,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.770
though the actual source of the sulfuric acid,

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.020
that's 400 miles away at the Colstrip Power
Plant in Colstrip, Montana,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.229
and also at coal fired power plants all over
the United States.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.310
The United States of America burns about a
billion tons of coal per year,

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.020
and most of that coal, is mined right here
in the U.S.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.409
Montana, where I live, is home to the Powder
River Basin,

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.819
a geographical location responsible for 40%
of America's coal output.

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.720
Between fifty and seventy freight trains ship
out of the Powder River Basin every day.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.890
Each train has at least 115 coal cars and
is more than a mile and a half long.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.180
And all of this coal burning, it has effects,
significant effects, acidic effects.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:34.580
But first, like, what exactly are acids and
bases. Well acids...uhh...sour.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.120
So sour, that's the first thing that we learned
about acids,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.560
actually, and that's why acid...uuhh...actually
means sour in Greek or Latin...Latin.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.080
Acids are excellent at dissolving stuff; they
kill things and melt your face.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.220
What about bases?

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.180
You might have some idea about what a base is: bitter tasting, slippery like soap; soap is in fact a base.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.670
And bases, like acids, are totally dangerous
and can melt off your face.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.599
They're also like the anti-acid basically.
In fact, they're in antacids.

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.870
If you mix acids and bases together they neutralize
each other.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.599
But as with most things in chemistry and in
life,

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.950
when it comes right down to trying to define
exactly what something is,

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.170
it gets weird and messy and confusing and
terrible.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.750
So, forget everything you ever learned about acids, wipe the slate clean, the most common acid on earth is water.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.760
Wuh? And water is the most common base, and
am I saying this purely to confuse you? Yes!

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.640
Well, mostly to convince you that the world is way more complicated than you thought it was.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.380
In 1923, two guys simultaneously defined acids
and bases in the exact same way.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.520
Bronsted and Lowry defined them; they didn't
classify them by how they acted

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.629
or what they tasted like or even what they
were made of, they defined them.

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.069
And this was an impressive feat because a
huge class of molecules,

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.030
to some extent or another, act as acids and
bases.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.560
So to come up with a definition that fit all
of them, that was not so simple.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.280
Bronsted and Lowry defined an acid as being
anything that donates a proton

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.010
and a base as being anything that accepts
a proton.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.160
And when we say proton, what we're talking about here is a hydrogen atom without its electron.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.989
Usually this is happening in water, acids
and bases can react in gas,

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.730
but almost always they're in an aqueous solution,

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.029
and when a proton gets donated in water, it
is accepted by water.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.879
And H2O is converted into H3O+, the hydronium
ion.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.780
So when an acid is added to water, it dissociates, like any other ionic compound, forming H3O+ and a negative ion.

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.489
The acid has donated a proton to the water.

00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:36.520
Also a little chemistry terminology thing:

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.340
we usually just write H+ or say "protons in solution" when in fact we are referring to hydronium ions.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.920
It's just a short hand. In reality, H+ in
aqueous solution is always H3O+.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.620
Let's take a look at the dissociation of hydrochloric
acid for some more terminology bits here.

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:55.710
You see right off the bat that the HCl is
donating a proton.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.210
But with many acids, particularly weaker acids,

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.559
the reaction can actually go back the other
way, with H3O+ donating it's proton.

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:05.619
So in this situation, every chemical in the
reaction,

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:09.589
also sometimes the major species, can be called
an acid or a base.

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:15.760
On the left hand side, the water is accepting the proton so it's the base, and HCl is donating it, so it's the acid.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.540
And on the left hand side, the Cl- would be
accepting the proton,

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.339
so that would be the conjugate base, and the
hydronium ion is the conjugate acid.

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:25.779
The phrase conjugate acid always used to confuse me

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:28.219
because I thought it had something to do with
conjugating verbs.

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:30.749
But it's actually the older, original sense
of the word:

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:37.460
the one where conjugal, or marriage related visits for prisoners, come from, which means joined together.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.560
For every acid, there is a conjugate base
and for every base there is a conjugate acid.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.599
Previous definitions of acids and bases,

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:50.119
particularly the one proposed by our old friend
Arrhenius, relied on specific major species.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.920
Most notably our friend the OH or hydroxide
ion.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.249
And while hydroxide is in most bases, it's
not in all of them.

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:02.200
For example, ammonia acts as a base when it reacts with hydrochloric acid to form ammonium chloride.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.400
There's no hydroxide but there is definitely
proton donation and acceptance going on.

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.779
Now acids and bases are not all created equal.

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:12.740
Certain acids really like to get rid of their
protons

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.349
and will only reluctantly convert back to
their conjugate base by accepting a proton.

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:21.729
We call them strong acids, and the conjugate
base is a weak base.

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.260
The same can be said for strong bases and
their weak conjugate acids.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.680
The reason why all of the most interesting
acid-base chemistry happens in water

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:36.159
is that dihydrogen oxide is really great at being either a base, accepting a proton from an acid,

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:39.039
or an acid, donating a proton to a base.

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:44.619
Thus water is the world's most common acid
and also the most common base.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.760
So, what does any of this have to do with
power plants and John Mullen's face?

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.850
When coal is burned the sulfur in it reacts
with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:00.220
That sulfur dioxide then reacts with water
and oxygen in the air to form sulfuric acid.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.220
When that sulfuric acid rains down, a set of acid-base reactions take place that damages limestone and metal,

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:12.400
and acidifies the water supply, making life harder for fish, coral, salamanders, and pretty much everything else.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.679
Limestone is mostly made of a chemical called
calcium carbonate.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.559
The carbonate acts as the base, accepting sulfuric acid's protons and converting them to carbonic acid:

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:24.869
the conjugate acid, which breaks down into
CO2 and water.

00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:29.089
Calcium and sulfate ions may precipitate as
a salt that's more commonly known as gypsum.

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:33.580
OK, so the average ton of coal in America
is about 3% sulfur.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.180
Supposing a hundred percent of those 30 kilograms
of sulfur leaves the smoke stack

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:42.119
and converts to sulfuric acid, how much limestone
could that completely wash away?

00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:44.969
As I've said before, just follow the units.

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:49.349
30 kilograms of sulfur multiplied by 1000
grams per kilogram,

00:07:49.349 --> 00:07:58.080
multiply that by 1 mole over 32.1 grams of sulfur to get 935 moles of sulfur in every ton of coal burnt.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.679
Now, if every mole of that sulfur is converted
to H2SO4

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.819
and every mole of that sulfuric acid reacts with a mole of limestone converting it to a mole of gypsum,

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:09.579
then that's 935 moles of limestone dissolved.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.899
There are 100.1 grams of calcium carbonate
per mole.

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:19.749
If we multiply that by 935 moles we get 93,600
grams or 93.6 kilograms.

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:25.020
So each ton of coal burnt by a U.S. power
plant produces enough sulfuric acid

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.180
to dissolve about 94 kilograms of limestone.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.039
And as we burn about a billion tons of coal
per year,

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:37.510
it's safe to say that no statue is safe, except
for ones built of materials immune to acids,

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.510
particularly oxidized copper, which will last
pretty much forever.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.890
Hence, Lady Liberty's hand presiding over
the Planet of the Apes.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.950
So, this is clearly a problem. I mean not
just for statues, but acid rain has killed

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.280
or harmed huge swaths of forests.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:57.400
At the peak of acid rain problems in the U.S. the highest recorded acidity was around that of lemon juice,

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.910
which I can tell you, is pretty acidic: high
enough to irritate human skin.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:06.480
This first became an issue for the power generation
when the British House of Lords, in 1929,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.270
ruled that a power station was liable to damages
caused to nearby crops by acid rain.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.130
So something had to be done, but what?

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:19.290
Well, we already know one very common chemical
that reacts easily with sulfuric acid:

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:24.000
good old limestone, and in England, there
is lots of limestone.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:27.110
By passing the smoke stack gases through a
limestone slurry,

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:33.470
the SO2 converts to an acid and then reacts with the limestone forming CaSO3, calcium sulfate.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.660
Now we're gonna do something a little different
for those of you who want to go the extra mile.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:43.200
Assuming that one billion metric tons of 3%
sulfur coal was burnt in America every year,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:50.320
and all of it is converted to SO2, how many tons of limestone would we need to scrub out 100% of that sulfur.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.260
Answer us down below in the comments.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.410
The limestone scrubber is a good system, but
it's not perfect.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.890
Many other flue gas desulfurization systems
have been developed,

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:03.100
and now through a combination of good policy,
good science, and hard work,

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:08.220
about 95% of sulfur produced in coal fired
power plants in the U.S. is removed

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.920
before it leaves the smoke stack.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:15.040
And through some even smarter chemistry, some of that SO2 is actually converted to industrially useful chemicals.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.180
For example, pure sulfuric acid,

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:22.260
which is used in paper mills, iron and steel
making, industrial cleaner, and chemical synthesis.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.400
Chemistry! Causing problems but also fixing
them.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.620
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.930
If you were paying attention, you may have
learned that Chemistry can cause death,

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.680
that acids and bases are more complicated
than you thought they were,

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.020
and that acid donates protons while a base
accepts them.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.420
You also should have learned that when an
acid donates a proton it forms a conjugate base

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.320
and when a base donates a proton it forms
a conjugate acid.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.500
Also, we did a little bit of acid-base stoichiometry.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.920
