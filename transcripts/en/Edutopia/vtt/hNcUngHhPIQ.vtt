00:00:08.326 --> 00:00:09.996
&gt;&gt;Ashleigh: I dropped out when
I was about in the ninth grade,

00:00:10.836 --> 00:00:13.386
kind of like just to hang
out and socialize, you know,

00:00:13.386 --> 00:00:14.956
and do drugs, party, whatever.

00:00:15.336 --> 00:00:18.586
And I decided when I got
pregnant that I wanted

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:21.646
to get my life straight, have a life.

00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:24.006
I heard about Sunset.

00:00:24.436 --> 00:00:27.406
I came on down, and I got enrolled.

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:31.066
And I basically went
from being a ninth-grader

00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:34.816
to almost being an eleventh-grader,
and that's only in one year.

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:39.786
&gt;&gt;Teacher: If he's uphill, you're
going to have positive slopes, okay?

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Like many
of her fellow students,

00:00:41.946 --> 00:00:46.326
Ashleigh Scholler is making the most
of her second chance at Sunset South,

00:00:46.496 --> 00:00:49.546
a unique Clark County high
school that caters to the needs

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:53.226
of some 500 students who
might otherwise drop out.

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.906
&gt;&gt;Come here, Haley.

00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:59.786
&gt;&gt;Kay: We have a day nursery with
our school, which allows the father

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:02.856
and the mother to come to school

00:01:03.136 --> 00:01:06.416
and have their child
on-campus and safely cared for.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:09.756
We have kids that work
early-morning construction.

00:01:09.996 --> 00:01:12.886
We have kids that work
late-night at casinos.

00:01:13.176 --> 00:01:17.556
And so the high school that goes
from 2:00 in the afternoon to 9:00

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:19.996
in the evening is perfect
for these kids.

00:01:20.356 --> 00:01:23.806
&gt;&gt;Ashleigh: Does this have anything
to do with a negative and a positive

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:24.716
when you've got to find the--

00:01:24.716 --> 00:01:25.646
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It sure does.

00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:28.286
&gt;&gt;Kay: They don't have to
give up their education

00:01:28.286 --> 00:01:31.196
if they need money
and they need a job.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.126
&gt;&gt;How is school going?

00:01:32.406 --> 00:01:32.966
&gt;&gt;It's going good.

00:01:33.616 --> 00:01:37.496
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Before he enrolled at
Sunset, Joe Paterna was parking cars.

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:39.786
&gt;&gt;Joe: Then I got the
opportunity to get the valet job,

00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:41.226
so I started working valet.

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:44.246
I was making pretty good
money, so I just kind of said,

00:01:44.246 --> 00:01:47.206
"I'll get my G.E.D., and I'll just do
valet because I'm making good money."

00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:47.886
&gt;&gt;Have a good night.

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:51.726
&gt;&gt;Joe: I think I can make up to 130
dollars a night on the weekends,

00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:54.786
maybe, and it's real easy because
you don't need the education

00:01:54.786 --> 00:01:55.416
to make the money.

00:01:56.196 --> 00:02:01.126
&gt;&gt;Kay: In Las Vegas, there are a lot
of jobs that pay a lot for busboys

00:02:01.446 --> 00:02:05.836
and valets and such at the
beginning, but as they get older,

00:02:05.886 --> 00:02:10.266
who wants to be a 45-year-old
busboy or a 50-year-old valet?

00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:12.686
So if they're going to
go up in management,

00:02:13.036 --> 00:02:17.246
they need to get more
skills and more education.

00:02:18.436 --> 00:02:20.076
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Without an education,

00:02:20.076 --> 00:02:21.486
there's really not
much out there for you.

00:02:21.486 --> 00:02:24.756
At least he'll have the education
to fall back on if this doesn't pan

00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:28.206
out for him, or if he moves on into a
different field, it's there for him.

00:02:28.376 --> 00:02:29.866
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're going to
be doing graphing of a line.

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:31.546
&gt;&gt;Joe: It's a different environment.

00:02:31.746 --> 00:02:34.126
The teachers are a lot
more understanding.

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:35.296
They help you out more.

00:02:35.526 --> 00:02:38.016
It's a good school to come to
because they know your needs.

00:02:38.016 --> 00:02:40.836
They know you're working, so
they really reward you for that.

00:02:41.206 --> 00:02:43.636
Everyone's pretty motivated because
this is like your last shot here,

00:02:43.636 --> 00:02:47.216
basically, so everyone's just trying
to get out and get the diploma.

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:50.646
&gt;&gt;Kay: Last year we
had 100 graduates,

00:02:50.646 --> 00:02:55.356
and I think my biggest joy is
seeing someone who came hesitatingly

00:02:56.026 --> 00:03:00.106
to our school and makes
the honor roll and says,

00:03:00.106 --> 00:03:01.436
"Hey, I am going to graduate.

00:03:01.436 --> 00:03:02.446
I can do it."

00:03:03.076 --> 00:03:05.846
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Before the semester
ended, Ashleigh Scholler withdrew

00:03:05.846 --> 00:03:10.266
from Sunset for personal reasons,
and Joe Paterna lost his job

00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:12.916
when Binion's Casino was
temporarily shut down.

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:17.656
He is focusing on his studies
and graduated in June 2004.

00:03:18.346 --> 00:03:21.986
