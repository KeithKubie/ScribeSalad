00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington DC.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:22.920
[ Silence ]

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.720
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Hi there,
my name is Nicholas Brown

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.080
and I'm a music specialist
with the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.380
It's my great pleasure to
introduce you to Thomas Wilkins

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.930
who is the music director
of the Omaha Symphony

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.740
and principal conductor of
the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.140
Thank you [inaudible]
for being here.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.440
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: No problem.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.270
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: We are here today
commemorating the Shift Festival

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.570
of American Orchestras.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.870
Could you tell us a bit about that

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.170
and your involvement
in the festival?

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.920
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: I was just
asked to serve on a panel

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.460
to discuss really one of
the things that Shift is all

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.100
about is redefining or shifting
if you will, the orchestra's role

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.580
in the communities that they serve.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.180
And with the hopes that in each
case specific to the community

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.630 position:56%
that they're in that it would
extend beyond just playing concerts.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.010
And the orchestras that I have
been involved in, involved with,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.910
and even now, we have
always been about that.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.700
And so they thought perhaps I
was a good person to come in

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.000
and make up some answers.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.300
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Great.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.610
So the festival is being
co-presented by the Kennedy Center

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.480
and also the Washington Arts

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.380
and the Library was a partner
today for the symposium.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.720
What is your impression of these,
that your principal presenters

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.520
at the festival and the
impact that they're having

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.480
with changing the narrative
about orchestras in this country?

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.920
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: I think the fact
that they actually are big voices

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.680 position:56%
in the industry is really important.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.500
You know, they're, in
some parts of a country

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.840
where orchestras are
small, and they have quote

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.660
on quote the services, the burn.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.830
By that what I mean is they
have plenty of musician time

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.610
that they can do things
more creatively sometimes

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.170
in a larger organization,
larger organizations

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.370 position:56%
with major orchestras really haven't
had to do those things before.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.400
So now that we are all
figuring out that no one needs

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.420
to be left behind regardless of
what size setting that you're from,

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.610
I think it's really important

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.130
that the major players are also the
ones waiving the banners as well.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.510
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Can you
tell us a little bit

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.770 position:56%
about what you're doing specifically
in Omaha and with Hollywood Bowl

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.890
in terms of engaging new audiences

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.820
and perhaps changing the public's
perception about orchestra music?

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:41.120
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: For me it
starts with, from the basic premise

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.000
that music is life
altering and life affirming.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.090
You know as I said to the
group earlier I was a kid born

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.780
to a single mother on welfare in a
housing project, no predisposition

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.680
to classical music whatsoever.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.280
So that when I heard the
orchestra for the first time

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.660
at eight years old, that
was what I wanted to do.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.820
I didn't have words to describe
how impacted I was but it meant

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.770
that all the critical life choice
questions that kids are faced

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.780
with today were answered
for me by default

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.690
because I had fallen
in love with music.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.150
Do I go to college?

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.300
What's the nature of my friends?

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.910
Where do I find myself when
there's no adult supervision?

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.670
All of those questions were
answered because of music.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.750
So if I believe and incidentally
that that says more about the power

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.090
of music than it does about me.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.970
So if I believe that, then
that gift of the power

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.050
of music should be
handed to as many people

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.090
in as many possible ways
as we can come up with.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.790
And so we've always done, we've
always had, especially in a place

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.950
like Omaha, community
partners that range anywhere

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.700
from the Omaha Housing Authority
to Girls Inc to University

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.290
of Nebraska Medical Center to
hospice care and we don't walk

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.910 position:56%
with a program that says, here we're

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.130
from the government,
we're here to help.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.260 position:56%
We want to know what your needs are.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.500
And in some of those cases
it's just about access

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.600
to a place that's different
from the place

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.900
that they spend more of their time.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.350
And that place for us happens
to be the concert hall.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.490
And low and behold, in that
place they get the gift of music,

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.930
a world that they didn't think had
any relation to them whatsoever.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.530
So those are the kinds of things
that we do in Omaha and of course

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.330
at the Hollywood Bowl we are very
much committed to our YOLA program,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.690
Youth Orchestra of Los Angeles, and
now we've been doing it for so long

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.530
that we've actually seen
kids graduate and they're off

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.790
to college and doing great things.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.060
So it's, that's a neat experience.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.360
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Wonderful.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.950
So in those projects
that you're working on,

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.070
do you see that they're now
different or new opportunities

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.800
for youth to get involved with
classical music as opposed

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.100
to when you were growing up?

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.150
Or is it just new packaging for
the same types of engagement?

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.320
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins:
That's a good question.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.680
I, well, the problem with,
the problem I didn't have

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.620
when I was growing up was
I didn't have the challenge

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.330
of their being too
many options for me.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.300
None of us kids did, you know?

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.380
And nowadays a lot of
things have happened

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.800
that has almost exacerbated the
problem of trying to get kids

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.690
to music, one of which seems to
be preparing them for college.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.890
You know, there are all of
these other kinds of things.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.450
I'm really glad that the folks
who came up with the idea

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.520
of stem [assumed], I'm starting
to believe that it really needs

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.130
to be steam, that there needs
to be an arts component.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.480
But, so I didn't have all of
those obstacles as they were,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.230
so I had plenty of time for music.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.530
I think, and it's, beyond obstacles

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.080
in the 21st century
it's just believing

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.360
that this music has some
application to your life.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.550
And I've always been
about, if a kid comes to one

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.710
of my childrens' concerts
for example,

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.980
there's a couple things
that I want them to see.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.330
I want them to see that the
orchestra is probably one

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.750
of the best representations
of a community that exists

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.710
in our society, all different
instruments, all different voices,

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:32.460
all different sizes, all different
levels of power and strength,

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.810
and weakness, and yet they
figure out a way to work together

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.880
so that this incredible, powerful,
beautiful product happens.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.460
You know that the diverse group

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.630
of individuals working
together for a common good.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.620
So I want them to see that first

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.070 position:56%
and that their families can work the
same way as an orchestra can work

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.260
and their classrooms
can work the same

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.070
or their neighborhoods can work
the same way as an orchestra does.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.400
The other thing that I
want them to understand is

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.500
that this music has
a direct relationship

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.800
to their everyday lives.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.800
And so if I do a program
that's about Meter

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.200
and Paulson [assumed] music,
it's really about perseverance.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.320
If I do a program that's
built around the idea

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.180
of orchestration, it's
about teamwork.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.970
So those kinds of things happen.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.520
And then I want them to
understand that this orchestra

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.020
on stage is theirs, that
this room is theirs.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.880
They are welcome at any time.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.570
In fact I make a habit
now of even in Omaha

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.090
at subscription concerts I
am seeing young children.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.580
Right? And if they're
sitting in the first row,

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.280
they get a fist bump
from me on the way out.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.210
You know, I give them
some wow goofy eye,

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.230 position:56%
because they though they were coming
to one of these [inaudible] and all

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.180
of the sudden the conductor's
fist bumping them at a concert?

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.480
Where's the decorum in that?

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.860
Well I don't care where it is,
I want them to feel welcome.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.810
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Well
it's very refreshing.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.990 position:56%
I'm appreciative as a concert goer
and musician myself of that attitude

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:03.890
because I go in to concerts and I
experience people getting chastised

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.110
because they're sharing with their
friend how much they enjoy it.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.800
And of course there are rules
that should be respected

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.490
like not interrupting your
neighbor and that kind of business

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.530 position:56%
but breaking that wall and making it
a collaborative experience I think

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.040
is such a huge part of it.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.340
So thank you for that.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.450
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: I
actually, one time, we did,

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:29.100
I did a set of it was a long
sweep of like 12 movements.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.400
It could have been [foreign name]

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.170
but the piece is not
coming to mind just yet.

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.320 position:56%
And I explained to the audience
before that there were 12 movements.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.950
And the panic on their faces.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.220
But I said they were short, and in
some instances they were really,

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.540
really short, and so we get to
the end of the first movement

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:50.340
in the concert and I turn to
the audience and I said, one!

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.000
And then that was all
that was required.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.250
It was just break the ice
and now let's have some fun.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.960
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: So in your
own growing up with music,

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.850
you said when you were
eight years old was

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.270
when you first experienced an
orchestra, was that the moment

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.960
where you said I want to
be a conductor or just

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.260
that I want to be in music?

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Isn't that funny?

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.860
That's the moment I said that
I want to be a conductor.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.350
There was something about this man,

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.650
Russell Stanger [assumed]
was his name,

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.000
this was the Norfolk
Symphony Orchestra,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.850
now it's the Virginia
Symphony, Joanne's [inaudible],

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:20.690
there was something about
the sound first of all,

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.040
I had never heard an
orchestra before.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:30.800
But then maybe it was his movements
or whatever his exuberance,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.960 position:56%
whatever it was, there was
something about him that said to me,

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.440
that's the fun spot down there.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.490
That's the spot that's
closest to all of that sound.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.440
It's not the guy with the long
blonde hair playing the snare drum.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.080
Although that looks pretty cool.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.850
But this guy was just you know,
all over the place with this music.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:55.780
And I like now to in
McDonald's the restaurant a lot

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.230
of McDonald's play lands
they would have those pits

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.680
with all plastic colored
balls and nets around it.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.680
And my kids would love to go in
there and get under them and dive

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.680
and hide and I said for me
that's what sound is like.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.220 position:56%
That's what it's like being on the
podium is like being on one of those

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.020
and you're just surrounded
by sound and so

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.320
that was the thing
that got me right away.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.280
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: So how did you get
from that eight year old person

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.340
with a vision and sort of idea
of the future for themselves

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.360
to being a professional conductor?

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.530
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: At the very
beginning, and when I talk

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.760
to grown ups about how we relate
to children, one of the things

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.750
that I make note of with them is
that when I came home and said

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.880
in my neighborhood, in the hood,
that I wanted to be a conductor,

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.670
no one ever looked at
me and said no dude.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.560
Young black boys don't
grow up to be conductors.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.950
Nobody ever said that to me.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.840
In fact, you know a
lot of times I got oh,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.040
you're going to be the first
black Leonard Bernstein.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.340
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Nice.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.640
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: You
know, I was showed,

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.270
but that tells you
something Bernstein's impact,

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.490
that even in that neighborhood
people knew that name.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.420
And so we have to be careful
what words we use when we talk

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.330
to children about their dreams and
about their goals in their lives

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.680
and no one clipped
my wings as it were.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.640
So that was the first
thing that happened.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:22.950
But then it, the very next year was
fourth grade and that was the year

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.130
that could start to play
an instrument, and so,

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:26.690 position:56%
but everyone had to start on violin.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:27.990
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Oh, really?

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.180
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: And
this was pre-desegretation.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:37.740
And what I learned later as a grown
up, talk about fortuitousness,

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:43.950 position:56%
I made that word up, but I went back

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:45.780
to visit my elementary
school principal

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.870
as a grown up, she's
now an old lady.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:52.350
And she recounted the story of how
she, and she was a little lady,

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.560
you know like this, Miss Robertson,

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.070
and she went down to the school
board and she said you're going

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.380
to put strings in those
white school,

00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.680
you're going to put
them in my school!

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.980
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Wow.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.960
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: And they
just could not say no to her.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.090
And had she not done that,

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:07.440
that violin wouldn't
have been there for me.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.740
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: That's amazing.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.040
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Yes!

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.150
So that was fourth grade and then
we could switch in fifth grade

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.850
and I switched to cello, that sort
of became my principle instrument.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.870
And then in seventh grade, so I
played cello in the orchestra.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:25.920
Seventh grade I wanted
to get a band uniform

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.320 position:56%
because I thought the band uniforms
looked cool, the girls are attracted

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.800
to the band uniforms,
I've got to figure

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.390 position:56%
out a way how to get a band uniform.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:37.430
So during the school year I
taught myself trumpet fingerings.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.480
So that I could go to summer
band camp and then sort

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.200
of be already be prepared and
so I went to summer band camp.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.740
And the band director at one point
said you know if you switched

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.410
to tuba I'll let you
keep one at your house.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.710
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Oh!

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.010
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Bam!

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.310
Done!

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.610
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Were
you tall back then?

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:56.910
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: I guess so,

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.970
but the fact that I could
have an instrument in my home,

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.570
it must [inaudible] of all my
neighbors probably, you know,

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:03.870
there I was with my tubas.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.820
And I played cello in the
orchestra, tuba in the band.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.080
And also what had happened
in that seventh grade year,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:15.680
was my string orchestra teacher
asked who wanted to try to conduct.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.670
And I raised my hand of course
and I got up and I remember I was

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.650
in three four time and
three four is an art

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.140 position:56%
so there's an extra motion there
that you don't know what to do with.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.270
So I couldn't get right, and I
said that's alright I don't want

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.570
to do it.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:27.870
And he goes no, no, no.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.170
And he grabbed my hand and he
showed me and then he's like oh.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.100
So that was my first
conductor experience.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.700
I mean, outside of
when I was really small

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.230
and I would take my army
soldiers, plastic army soldiers,

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.580
and set them up like an orchestra
and conduct them in my bedroom.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.880
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Oh really?

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.180
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: I
used to tell people

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.810
that my first conducting job
was as as a military band.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.110
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Awesome.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:47.410
Cool.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.710
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: But you know,

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.080
then I ultimately chose my
undergraduate school based

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.850
on the ability to have
opportunity to conduct

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.270
that was [inaudible] territory.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:03.010
I had gone, I had played every
summer I got to go to band camp

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.250
in Williamsburg playing tuba
and orchestra camp later

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.830
in the summer playing cello.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.060
Well, I wanted to go to
orchestra camp playing tuba

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.980
so I could be the only person
playing the instrument.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:17.540
So sure enough summer of my junior
year I got to go playing tuba.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:21.840
And I met the tuba teacher
at Shenandoah Conservatory,

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.340
Fred Marzan [assumed] and he said,
you know if you come to Shenandoah

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.560
as a tuba major instead of cello
I'll let you be the student

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.170
conductor of my brass choir.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:34.330
Done! And so it was kind of
a neat little ride there.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.220
And then it was a school
small enough

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.800
that all the ensembles
had student conductors.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.970
So every year I was a student
conductor of some ensemeble.

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:45.540
And actually got to do
a conducting recital

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.210 position:56%
which no one had ever done before
so it was a really neat opportunity.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:50.510
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Excellent.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.810
Growing up and kind of through
your undergraduate period,

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:55.040
were they any specific pieces
that really clicked for you

00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:01.190 position:56%
or specific composers who made you
realize you were doing what you were

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:02.490
meant to do?

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:03.790
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Yes.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:11.350
Oh. One in particular was the hymn
that's in Jupiter, that's embedded

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.820
in Gustav Holst's Jupiter, you know

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.050
that beautiful hymn that's
just sort of stuck there.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:20.920
That always transformed me,
transported me to another place.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:26.010
The same thing with that same
kind of music in Gershwin Rhapsody

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:30.780
and blue for example, it always
sent me some place really special.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:35.860
And then the slow section
of the last movement

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.210
of Moller's First Symphony.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:43.040
You know, Beethoven said that
music is the one incorporeal,

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.870
intangible entrance into the
higher world of knowledge,

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:49.600
which understands man kind but
which man kind can not understand.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.940
He's basically saying it knows
us though we know it not.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:59.420
To extend that out I always
say that we spend our lives

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.980
as artists working on that
the substance of music

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.760
so that we can try to get
to the essence of music,

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.290 position:56%
but we will never be able to put the
essence of music really into words.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:11.590
You know? It's not enough

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.220
to say forte means strong,
forte means confident.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.080
It still won't get you to
what, to one of those moments.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.960
And so those were moments and
then they remain moments for me.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.860
And in many instances they're
worshipful moments for me.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.510
It is my favorite time to
worship is when I'm conducting.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.760
So it's, yes, there have
always been places like that.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.580
And when I come back to
them now as a grown up,

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.710
they have an extra meaning
because they are a part

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:47.150
of my aesthetic history as
much as they are just you know,

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.550
a piece that I'm working on.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Do you ever associate
those or other pieces with sort

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:56.830
of milestone life events?

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.130
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: There
are moments like that,

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:02.770
I think for example the first time
I heard the opera Dido Aeneas.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.670
I sat in the library and
New England Conservatory,

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.370
you know what library
I'm talking about.

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:09.830
And I wept like a baby.

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:11.130
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Oh wow!

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:16.100
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: I had the
head phones on and I'm just.

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:20.320
So I know exactly where I
was at that moment you know

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:24.200
and there are other
places like that.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:31.380
In fact there was a moment
during the, doing the planets,

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.590
the Venus Movement by
the way is another one

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.900
of those exquisite moments for me.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:41.080
But during that Jupiter, during
that hymn in that Jupiter, I was,

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.460
I didn't do it on purpose but, and
I was guest conducting somewhere

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.760
and my wife and my father

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.990
in law were sitting
together in the audience.

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:52.480
And during that moment when it got

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.890
to its grandest place I just
let go of the orchestra.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.190
I didn't wave my arms.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.820
I just stayed in that
position and I think I was,

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.940
what I was saying is look at how
much bigger than we are this is.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.640
And there was no movement that
was, that seemed to be necessary.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.940
And they got it!

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.240
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Wow!

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.870
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: And my father in
law said look at what he's doing.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:15.260
And my wife said oh he's gone.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.180
She told me that later.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.830
She's like he's gone.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.130
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Very cool.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:27.100
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: And there,
engima, the nimrod variations,

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:31.010
I remember being at a
conducting camp which sounds

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:34.090
like the biggest nerd
festival you can ever imagine.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:38.300
And it was, I wasn't conducting at
the time, but it was being played

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.330 position:56%
in the room and I thought to myself,
I was already married by then,

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.980
and I thought to myself,

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.220
that describes how much I
love my wife right there.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.650
And I told her that later.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:53.020
So whenever I'm in that music
I think about that moment

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.730
that I just made that
sort of discovery.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:59.250
You know, at summer
music camp for grown ups.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.120
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: What was
her response to that?

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.420
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Oh it
got me some major points.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.720
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Oh great.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.370
Did she ever request it on the
CD player or something like that?

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:09.280
No? Or did you surprise it?

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.940
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: No, she doesn't
but often I will share music

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:19.560
with her if I'm some place else
that speaks of our relationship.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.140
If it touches me in a certain
way I will send her a link

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.080
to it and you know.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.580
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Neat.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.880
Yes.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.180
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Romantic.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.480
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Wonderful.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.990
So after you did grad school,
what was the path from there?

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:35.290
Were you an assistant?

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.590
Did you do festivals?

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:37.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: It's interesting.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.190
I didn't have, you know
there is no rhyme or reason,

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:44.450
there's no prescribed
route in this country.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.570
You know, you don't, your not a
repetiteur one point and then all

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:51.870
of the sudden you're,
you get your chance.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:56.100
My first job out of graduate school
was at a small college in Chicago,

00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.250 position:56%
North Park College is now North Park
University, small Christian college.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.580
Which is, believe it or
not where I met my wife.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:09.030
And it was, it was a
liberal arts college.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.840
You know? I think, first

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.970
of all there was only eight
people on the music faculty.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:18.240
So it meant that I did a
lot of stuff, you know,

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.770
taught orchestration, I taught
sophomore theory one year,

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:23.870
I taught conduct, all three levels
of conducting, brass methods,

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:25.780
string methods because
I played both.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.300 position:56%
One year I taught percussion methods
because I was the youngest person

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.130
on the faculty and therefore
the person most likely

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.560
to have remembered it from college.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.540
It was pretty funny.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.040
But when I called my teacher back

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.590
in New England said oh
my gosh you're not going

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.810
to believe what they have
me doing for $15,000 a year.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:43.220
He said what are you talking about?

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.520
That's a great job for you!

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.570
You're not going to always
be a friend or your fellow,

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.660
you need to learn how to
teach people to play better.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.170
You know, and he was right.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:54.290
So it was, it wasn't a
crummy job, it was just not,

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.290
it wasn't the New England
Conservatory,

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.710
where I had just graduated from.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:01.510
And that was a whole different
level of student musicians.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.360
But it was good for me to be there.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.610
And I've always, not always
believed but certainly much

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.160
of my life I believe that you
bloom where you're planted.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.070
And you try to grow
wherever you are,

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:16.620
contribute whatever you
can while you're there.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.370
But to not let a day go by
where you don't learn something.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:25.570 position:56%
And I had always said that, excuse
me, that more than anything I wanted

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.150
to be prepared for the next thing.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.890
So, you know, that job led
to another university job

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.970
at the University of Tennessee in
Chattanooga and I was only there

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:36.110
for two years because I taken
a Richmond Symphony audition.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:40.690
The assistant conductor audition.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:45.680
And I made finals and
then didn't hear anything.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.710
And it just so happened that Marian
Alsip is a very good friend of mine

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.380 position:56%
and she had also taken the audition.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.600
And so after a while I called
Marian and I said Marian,

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.370
I haven't heard a thing
from Richmond, have you?

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.610
She goes, yes, they hired me.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:58.910
I went oh!

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.210
Congratulations!

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:04.130
We still crack up about that.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:09.120
And then her career
took off and she left.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.190
She was leaving, preparing to
leave, and so they called me

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:14.980
and said you know, we don't
want to do another audition,

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.830
quite frankly you were
our second choice anyway,

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.230
if you want the job,
the job is yours.

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:19.530
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Wow.

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.060
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: So sure enough
I got that job and I was there

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.240
for I don't know how long,
five, six, seven years maybe.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.130
And then I got a job with
the Florida Orchestra

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:31.000
as the resident conductor there.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.050
And that was great.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:36.590
And the best thing about that
job was that believe it or not,

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:39.740
was that the music director
was hardly ever there.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:44.880 position:56%
So I got to learn how to do a lot of
music director stuff, meet people,

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:51.120
engage people, go on, ask
for you know for funding.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.940
I became really an integral part
of the community getting on boards

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.540
and involved in the life

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.360
of the community outside
of the concert hall.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.250
And that was really the formative
years for me of learning how

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.070
to be a conductor was really
learning how to be an artist

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.670
in a community and
how important it was.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:13.550
You know, when I left Florida
to go to Detroit, I guess that's

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:17.960
where we went next, I was
just walking down the street

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.840
and a lady stops at a red light.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.140
Gets out of her car.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.090
And comes and hugs me and goes
oh I'm going to miss you so much.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.390
I don't know who that lady was.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:25.690
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Wow.

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:27.340
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Yes, it
was a really neat thing.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.580
And it wasn't because I'm the
greatest conductor they have ever

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.650
seen but it was because they
had someone who really cared

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.650
about their lives and their
childrens' lives and wanted

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:42.440 position:56%
to be partners with them in the
raising of their children and wanted

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.740
to be partners with them
in enhancing the quality

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.040
of life in their community.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.030
That's what they saw,
that's what they loved more

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.750
than anything else I think.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:55.550
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: So how do you try
to teach that kind of set of values

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:59.620
to younger conducting colleagues
or students or even you know,

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.820
relatives who are young
growing up or your kids as well?

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.700
Because I think a lot of those
things that conductors deal

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.090
with are life skills that
maybe not everyone realizes.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:12.200 position:56%
So you can go be a leader in your
community whether you're a conductor

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.270
or you're a business
person or whatever else.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:17.720
But yes, I'd love to
just hear your thoughts.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.880
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Well you know
people don't follow great leaders

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.340
because they're necessarily
great people.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:29.520
Great leaders present visions of
things that are larger than us

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.160
that we want to be a part of.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.860
And I think first and foremost
you have to live your life

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.760
in a way that's reverent.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:43.420
So that no one ever
gets, no one ever thinks

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.610
that you think you are more
important than the music.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:50.320
And I think part of the success
that I've had as a conductor is

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.310
that when I'm in front of an
orchestra they all understand

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:57.810
that together we are fortunate
first of all to be in this room,

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.950
and that we could be flipping
hamburgers but we're not.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.740 position:56%
We are doing something that's really
beyond all of us and I say to them,

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:10.810
you know you have to realize that
this music was here long before us

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.700
and it'll be here long
after we're gone.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.380
We will never measure
up to this music.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:21.440
But it's in the trying to
measure up that we become artists.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.750
And the moment that we understand
those parameters and we try

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:27.780
to measure up not only
do we become artists

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.910
but hopefully we will
become servants.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:32.240
So that we are really the conduits.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.760
So that this music
can get communicated

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.120
because these composers
don't write music

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.800
to demonstrate their
skill at music theory.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.630
They write for, to help us
understand that we were made

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:48.900
to be better than what we
may have thought we were.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.870
So all of that attitude comes out
in the kinds of words you choose

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:55.370
and the way that you treat people.

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:59.730
You know I make it a habit to
learn the names of the members

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:02.840
of the orchestra before my
first rehearsal so I can,

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.250
I don't call them by their
label, or by their function.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:06.550
I call them by their name.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:09.840
And when you do that it says
I value you as a human being.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.550
I have had on more than one
occasion someone in the orchestra,

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:20.710
I'm not going to say the orchestra
but someone recently came to me

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:24.290 position:56%
and knocked on my dressing room door
and said you know we always love it,

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:25.590
making music when you're here.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.490
She says but this week
everyone seems to be remark,

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:31.090
because I was there for
two weeks, a long period.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.510
And she said everyone
seems to be talking

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:35.990
about how kind you are to us.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.070
And I tried to blow it off, you
know oh, I'm just a nice guy.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:40.870
She says no, no, no
you don't understand.

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:44.150
It makes us treat each
other differently.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:50.470
So that's the job of leadership
is to help usher people

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.170
and to become better human beings.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.780
We want our audience to walk
away better human beings

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.830
and we want our players to
walk away better human beings.

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:02.850
And if we put ourselves in front
of that, it will never happen.

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:06.530
And so I think first and foremost,

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:10.830
it's a really walk
the talk as it were.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:15.810
Live the life of a person
who honors other people.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:17.270
It doesn't mean I'm not their boss.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:22.940
No one in my orchestra is mistaken
about that but they also know

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.730
that I love them dearly as human
beings and I love their families

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:27.220
and I pray for them
on a regular basis.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.800
That kind of stuff, I mean you
don't have to pray for them,

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.100
but you know what I mean.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:36.270
That kind of, that level of
care for them I think has

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:45.790
to be demonstrated first so that my
assistants and our staff they sort

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:49.320
of get the cue from me as to how
we're all going to treat each other

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:54.600
because their boss treats them
in such a way that they compelled

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.900
to treat other people that way.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:59.200
So it's a, I'm happy to say
like in Omaha for example,

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.710
it's a great team of people.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:06.360
And we want nothing but
the best for each other.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.440
I had a young man send me a letter
once, he had seen me conduct

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:15.140
and he wanted to, he wanted some
advice on how to have a career.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.610
And he said in his e-mail
to me that his dream was

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:23.850
to become the next renowned black
conductor, you know, on the globe.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:27.830
And it just, I was so ticked off.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.050
You know? And I just sat on
the e-mail for a few days

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.970
and I didn't answer and then
finally one day I just sat

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:34.870
down and started typing.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:40.310
And I said okay, if I can give you
any advice here's my first piece

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.610
of advice.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:42.940
Don't ever say that again.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:47.340 position:56%
You can dream it, you can desire it,
but don't ever say it out loud again

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:48.920
because you're going to
give people the impression

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.420
that this is all about you.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.390
Those people who are in your
audience are real people

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:57.430 position:56%
with real challenges and real dreams
and real hopes and real obstacles

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:00.270 position:56%
and the whole reason that they come
to you is so that you can equip them

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:03.180
to leave the room better
than the way they came in.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.480
And guess what?

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.550
The players in your orchestra
are the exact same people.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:10.060
And your job is to equip them
to be better human beings

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.500
when you leave you than
when they came to you.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:17.980
And duh, duh, duh, duh, duh
and to his credit he wrote back

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.710
and said you know no one has ever
spoken to me like that before.

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:24.200
No one has ever said, mentioned
the word servant and leadership

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.520
in the same sentence ever before.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:33.840 position:56%
So yes, I think that's, it's, I said
to him one night I thought of one

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.350
of my best friends who's a lawyer.

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:41.080
Actually he's now sort
of a lobbyist.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.420
He, we are sort of
accountability buddies, you know?

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.970 position:56%
We're both successful, both love our
families and our children and duh,

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.990
duh, dah, dah but we're
both proud of each other

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:52.460
but we're not impressed
with each other.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.240
You know? So you have
to have partners,

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.700
you have to have friends like that.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:30:01.240
I said to him the other day, and he
just turned 65 and I just turned 60

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.410 position:56%
and your head goes through all kinds
of junk, you know, in the process.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.710
And I feel great!

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:08.350
I mean I exercise, I play
golf, duh, duh, dah, dah,

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.350
but there's still stuff
that messes with your head.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:16.110
So I said Jeff, I don't want
to be the smart guy anymore.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.090
I don't want to be the
guy handing out advice.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.390
I want to be dumb again.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:22.590
You know? But anyway.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:23.890
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Well, I'm sure

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.980
that gentleman appreciated your
giving him the lesson because.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.280
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: I think he did.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.580
I hope he did.

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:29.880
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Because I'm sure
he realizes that you're someone

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:34.240
who is not going to
share insights lightly

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.030
and that can have a
significant positive impact

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:38.330
on his own trajectory.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:42.430
So that kind of opens a
question about mentorship.

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:45.220
What, do you get involved
in mentoring your assistants

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.350
or other musicians in the
orchestras or do you kind

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.350
of just do it more informally?

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:52.710
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: It's
almost, well it's both.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:57.910
Because we have a fellow at our,
in Omaha, who's now actually,

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:02.650
we have recently promoted him to
being on staff as a conductor.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:03.950
Excuse me.

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:10.290
And part of the part of my
agreement with him and them was

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:13.180
that he would have to study with
me during the course of the time

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.700
that he's there and
now it's just he meets

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.000
with me and he brings questions.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.880
Often they are conductorial
questions but sometimes

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.690
in fact I just got a text
from him a couple days ago

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:28.510
because he had an audition
somewhere and he took the time

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:31.410
to learn the major players'
names in the orchestra.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:35.350
And he talked about how
well they responded to that.

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:42.520
You know. So it's all
kinds of advice.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:50.280 position:56%
And players come sometimes for, they
want a lesson or they want to talk

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.970 position:56%
about how to exist in this business.

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:59.040
Or you know, how to learn
a, I have people you know

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.630
to this day I will still, I
have colleagues that I will call

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.560 position:56%
and say you know I'm thinking about
this starting this movement in four,

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.870
and then Leonard Slackhen [assumed]
is one that I always call or e-mail

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:10.430
and say I'm thinking about
doing this, is it crazy?

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:11.730
He says you know no, no, no,

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:13.070
that's the way I'd do it
too or something like that.

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:17.800 position:56%
So I think not to get hyper biblical
on you but I think every person,

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.370 position:56%
every person needs a Paul, a
Timothy and a Barnabus in your life,

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:25.410
you know, you just sort of
need, you need someone to teach,

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.960
someone to learn from,
and then someone

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.420
who thinks you're not all that hot.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.850
You know? So.

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:36.580
But so when the opportunity
presents itself I never,

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.650
I try never to shy away from it.

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:40.270
Nick Brown: Great.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:43.860
Are there any sort of areas
in the standard repertoire

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.900 position:56%
or contemporary repertoire that you
haven't delved into as much as you'd

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:51.270
like to and what are they and
when do you plan to get to them?

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.600
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: That's
the cool part I think is

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:56.460
that there's always stuff
you haven't done yet.

00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:00.400
And I've always been a big
American music proponent.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:05.350
And so I've spent a lot of
time doing American music.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:14.960
I would say I haven't spent enough
time with French repertoire.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:21.890
And sometimes it's because if
I look at my season and realize

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:24.800
that the orchestra doesn't
have enough of something on it,

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.910
I will often invite someone who,
for whom that's their expertise,

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:32.060
because you want someone who's
going to bring something to it

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.910
that you won't bring to it
just by having learned it.

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:39.250
So sometimes that keeps me
from getting the repertoire.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:44.680
But no, I, there's
nothing in particular

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.440
that I think I want
to get to except that.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:57.020
I want to get sort of making
music outside the box more often.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.630
I want to, I want hip
hop brought to the stage.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:06.320
You know I live in the land
of Saddle Creek Records,

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:12.680
so the whole Indie Rock
thing is still going strong

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:17.270
and I didn't even know it until my
nephew had to tell me, you know.

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:21.630
But I just love, and
that's part of the fun

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:23.760
that I have the Hollywood Bowl is

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:29.310
that we can do I mean we literally
did Sacrifical Dance from the Right

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:32.850
of Spring to open the
show and then John Legend

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.340
and Stevie Wonder were
the next things on stage.

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.070
I mean, I love that.

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:41.730
And to have the opportunity to
do more of that kind of stuff

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:45.140
and that's kind of the
fun part of my career.

00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.080
That means the fun for me is that
the fun thing about my career is

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.960 position:56%
that no two weeks are ever the same.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.640
I could be doing you know
Shastakovich one night

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:57.450
and then you know Pink Martini the
next night Ben Folds the next night

00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:01.030
and Mozart the next night and a
children's concert the next night

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:05.850 position:56%
so no, it's, I don't know, maybe
it's something that keeps me excited

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:07.850
about it is that nothing's
ever the same.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.880
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: On those programs
where juxtapose different genres,

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.370
what kind of feedback do
you get from the folks

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:15.310
who might have just come for
Stevie and then heard Right

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:16.610
of Spring for the first time?

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:17.910
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Well look

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:23.320
at the Hollywood Bowl the audience
understands that the night is going

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.770
to be like that and they
expect it to be like that

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:29.820
and they are always open
to all kinds of things.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:33.540
But I think you know Duke Ellingson
there's only two kinds of music,

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.400
good music and bad music.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.620
I think if because I talk to
all of our audiences if I'm sort

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:47.280
of the thread for them that
connects one piece to the next,

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.510
and I can be professorial at one
moment or I can be a comedian.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.880
Or a story teller.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:58.400
Whatever it feels like, whatever
seems to be necessary at the time

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:03.580
and it sort of helps people receive
whatever it is that we're doing.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:09.480
And so it sort of mitigates
some of their angst I think.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:14.220
But I for the most part I
think people are excited.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:19.530
And we haven't, we sort
of haven't had any issues

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.630
where people are you
know, storming the steel.

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:25.700
What I'll tell you though
it was the coolest thing

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.410
that happened was the first thing

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:32.400
out of Stevie Wonder's mouth was
oh man that's too risky killed.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.670
So you know I have a friend who
is, James Carter, who you may know,

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:37.980
he's a jazz saxophone player,

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:42.010 position:56%
one of the most compelling musicians
I've ever been on stage with.

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:45.220
He, we in Detroit were part
of a commission of concerto

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:47.800
for saxophones, of Roberto Sierra,

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.240
and one moment he's playing tenor
sax the next he's playing soprano.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.570
The orchestra's a classical
orchestra that he persuades

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:55.410
to become a jazz orchestra
then they persuade him

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.850
to become a classic
saxophonist, I mean it's really,

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:59.150
and that's my perception.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:01.520
But it's a really cool piece.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.930
But when we did it in Omaha,
we did it with [inaudible] four

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:07.010
for obvious reasons
because no one had heard

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:10.230
of Roberto Sierra's concerto
for saxophones, right?

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:13.830
So we did a talk back afterwards.

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:17.870
And the, on stage, and so there's
all these jazzards who came

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:20.400
to see James Carter because
they were like James Carter,

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.030
Omaha Symphony, what's that about?

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:25.980
You know. So now they see James
Carter and they come up on stage

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:29.490
for the talk back afterwards
and so one of them said so James

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:33.630
and he was, you know a little grin
on his face, what was it like being

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:36.390
on a concert that also had
[foreign name] four symphony on it?

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:40.350
And James said, man I was as
stoked about hearing [inaudible]

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:41.950
as I was about playing my piece!

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:44.860
He goes so many people go to the
parade and all they do is wait

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:46.160
for the Miss America float.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.010
I want to see the whole parade!

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.480
I love that statement!

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.900
You know, right, it's,
music is music, come on man!

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.200
You know?

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:58.150
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: So how do
we invite people to be open

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.300
to changing their preconceptions
about genres

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:04.220
or classical concert etiquette
or entering a new space,

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.720
picking up a new recording,
checking out a new radio station?

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:12.120
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: I
think it starts with us.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:19.230
I alluded to this earlier today in
another conversation that I think

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:23.070
as American artists, because
as American classical artists,

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.290
because we operate in a western,

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:30.330
primarily a western European
tradition, that we are afraid

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:34.380
that if we do anything that doesn't
look like something [foreign name]

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:35.680
or [foreign name] or Brams
[assumed] would approve,

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.110
people aren't going
to take us seriously.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:44.780
When in reality, you know I did a
program in at the Hollywood Bowl

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:49.540
where we invited over
the Moulin Rouge dancers.

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.590
And so I did a classical
music first half of composers

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:54.400
who probably hung out
at the Moulin Rouge.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.920 position:56%
You know? Because they probably did.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.900
You know? They weren't
stuck in some cave somewhere

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:04.350
where you know just writing.

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:09.400
My point is that we
don't have to apologize

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.910
for being an American orchestra.

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:14.870
We don't have to apologize for
being American and we don't have

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:16.570 position:56%
to apologize for being an orchestra.

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:21.810 position:56%
And an orchestra by its very nature
is one of the most diverse ensembles

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:25.940
or versatile ensembles rather in
existence because we can become,

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.490
we can become a chamber
orchestra, we can become a quintet,

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:32.600
we can become an octet, we
can become anything out of

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:36.510
that large thing, contraption
called the orchestra.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:39.430
And so we should run towards
our versatility and not away

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:42.250
from our versatility because
we can be different things

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:44.220
for different people.

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:47.740
If we take ourselves more
seriously than we take our art

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.330
and by our art I mean all
of this stuff, you know.

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:53.450
If you listen to Niama
[assumed] John Coltrain

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:59.670
and you think that's not
as poignant as any symphony

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:02.240
of Beethoven you are
out of your mind.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.700
If you listen to Miles
Davis you think,

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:09.400
basically it was a trumpet player
who missed notes, you are nuts!

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:15.750
And so we as artists have to be
the voice for that versatility.

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:19.200
But we think if we play in,
and we, and this generation

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:23.510 position:56%
of musicians doesn't think that way
by any stretch, which is really cool

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:28.240
because they're playing in
rock and roll bars where some

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.600
of them are even playing
rock and roll.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.690
You know, a colleague Joshua
Roman is a great example.

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:38.590
He just played Divorsia
[assumed] with me in Omaha

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:42.460
because my soloist got, hurt
his hand, he was a pianist.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:46.480 position:56%
And Joshua had just been there doing
Erin J Kernist [assumed] congerital

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.330
[assumed] which involves a pic,
I mean it's jazz and all kinds

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:51.280
of stuff, on another series.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:56.140
And so and he got snowed in, I
mean he basically couldn't get back

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:59.180
to New York so we had him
stay and do the Divorsia.

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:03.360
But he's a great example of
someone who has removed the labels

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:10.530
from music and this is not to say
that there should not be nights

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:18.500 position:56%
where you hear a Beethoven, a Mozart
and Haydn or Brams and Shuvert

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.380
or a Moller on a program.

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:23.970
This is not to suggest that
at all, it's just to say

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:29.560
that in the process let me see
how much I can move you along

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.970
to try something else.

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:36.320
Because it's very possible that
you're going to like this, too.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:40.860
And part of it too is
also a matter of trust.

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.160
I had a Russian pianist
say to me once,

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:49.940 position:56%
how come American orchestras have so
much trouble with the word groove?

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:56.220
And I said how come a Russian
pianist is asking me that question?

00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:00.760
You know? How weird is that that
you're asking me why my orchestra

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:04.070
has a trouble with the constant,
Beethoven knew what a groove was.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.530
You listen to the movement
of Beethoven's seven,

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:08.750
you tell me that's not a
groove for crying out loud?

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:13.470
He wouldn't have used that word
but he understood the sensation

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:16.810
and if we can make those kinds
of connections with people,

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:20.970
you know I think we are better off.

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:22.350
You know I grew up with guys,

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:26.750
I was the only classical music
guy in my group of friends.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:30.270
You know I mean the Wooden Brothers
and Billy Drummen, those guys,

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:33.860
we'd get together on weekends and
I'm playing Tchaikovsky for them

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.370
because we had records in
those and that's how we geeked

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:37.670
out on weekends, we
would sit around,

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.020 position:56%
we sat around and listened to music.

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:42.230
They're playing Green Dolphin
Street for me and you know Four

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:44.260
and More and all this stuff.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.130
We're just sharing,
that's all, you know?

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:51.320 position:56%
I just, in fact just recently I said
one of them that had it not been

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.600
for those experiences, maybe I
wouldn't be the kind of conductor

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.580
that I am that can one
moment can do Moller

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.010
and the next moment can
do you know Stevie Wonder.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:00.310
But.

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:01.610
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Neat.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:02.910
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Yes.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:04.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: So with the community
engagement you've discussed,

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.580
there are lots of ways for the
audience and the musicians to kind

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.720
of stay engaged with the
institution of the orchestra.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.120
Outside of the concert experience.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:17.700
What do you think are the ways
of engaging with each other

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:22.250
that lend the experience to growth?

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:23.550
So like is that social media?

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:25.830
Is that attending the talk balks?

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:30.460 position:56%
Is that just seeing people out in
your community at the grocery store?

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:33.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: And by growth
you mean growth in numbers or growth

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:36.520
in humanity or growth
all of the above?

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.750
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: I think the
humanity portion especially

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:43.720
or developing a more nuance
appreciation for the institution

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.150
and that culture that
you're being part of.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:51.370
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins:
What we have said is

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:55.810
that if you mention the world music
in Omaha we want your first thought

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:57.880
to be the Omaha Symphony.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:04.210
What I've said often as an example
of to your point is if I get

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:08.610
in a taxi cab, often if I get in
a car, and I'm not being picked

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:13.250 position:56%
up by the orchestra's driver, and
they say what are you doing in town?

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:18.240 position:56%
I say I'm here to conduct the blank
blank blank but I'll say the letters

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.250
of the orchestra not the word
orchestra because I want to know,

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:22.400
do they know what I
mean when I say NSO

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.590
or you know LPO or whatever it is.

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:25.890
And if they go what's that?

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:27.190
I go rut roh.

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:31.070
You know? And I said
however, if I get in a car

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:35.270
and say do you go to concerts?

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:42.360
And the driver says no, he says
I don't really care for it,

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.000
but my goodness did they
turn my 11 year old around.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.380
Then in my mind the
orchestra's doing its job,

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.630
it's proved its quote
on quote relevancy.

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:54.140
I had a cab driver in
Omaha, I got in the cab,

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:55.970
and he had classical music on.

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:59.260
And I was going to the airport.

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:04.390
And so I just said so do you
always play classical music?

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:06.440
He goes oh yes, it just relaxes me,

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.410
I just that he says well
sometimes it'll be jazz

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:10.720 position:56%
but most often it's classical music.

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.170
I said huh.

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:15.220
And I said do you ever
go to concerts?

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:20.870
And at this point I see him looking
at me in the mirror, his eyes,

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:23.650
he kept you know on the road,
in the rear view mirror.

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:26.970
And then finally he goes,
hey you are the Maestro!

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:29.170
And does he go to concerts?

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:31.390
No he doesn't go to concerts.

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:35.970
But somehow we have entered
his life in a way that he feels

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:39.100
that this is something
he wants to be a part of.

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:43.630
So it's important to be seen in
the grocery store or Home Depot

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:49.540
which is my two, Lowe's, you know
my favorite places to hang out.

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:56.320
And you do, you know I know they're
all anecdotal, but they still count

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:59.090
because they're still
people's stories

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:00.710
and they are sharing
those stories with you.

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:04.640
You know I, standing in the
checkout line at Wal-Mart,

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:08.490
my God the cashier's tatted up
like crazy, you know his is weird,

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:11.590
not weird but it wasn't
my hair that's for sure.

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:16.180
So I had already decided
who this person was, right?

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:18.710
Wrong. Bad thing to do.

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:21.080
Sure enough I get up to the
counter and the dude said,

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.150
ma that Right of Spring
performance was really.

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:25.510
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: What!

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:34.320
[ Laughter ]

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.280
Thomas Wilkins: And
here's the thing.

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:40.470
To your earlier point about
growth and even growth in numbers

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:44.150
and making people feel
comfortable in the concert hall,

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:48.770
if we don't have diversity, if
you don't let people be diverse,

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:52.300
you've got to call
it something else.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:56.190
So if I'm going to judge the
guy who is tatted up who comes

00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:59.720
in the concert hall, not in
a suit, then shame on me.

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.280
He deserves to hear this
music, too, you know?

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:05.410
So that was a great thing.

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:09.410
Or going through the security line
at the airport, the guy looked

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:12.470
at my driver's license and said
have a good flight Maestro.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:14.360
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: In Omaha or in?

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.660
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: In Omaha!

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:16.960
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: That's cool.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.690
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: So people are
always doing that kind of thing

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:24.350
which tells me and you know, I'm
involved in so many different kinds

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:26.590
of things that have
nothing to do with music,

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:29.620
the boards that I have
served on or the groups

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.890
that I have volunteered for, or the
places that I've given speeches.

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:36.230
I gave the commencement speech
at an elementary school in Omaha.

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:41.130
It was the most fun, you know?

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:46.750
And when you do those kinds of
things, either myself or our staff

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:50.720
of conductors or musicians
playing in various places,

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:58.520
the orchestra ends up having an
imprint all across the community

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:03.480
in the rarest and sometimes
the most secluded of corners.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:06.970
And it has nothing to do with
those people ultimately coming

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:10.090
to the Holland Preforming
Arts Center for a concert.

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:16.890
It has everything to do with us
giving away this gift of sound.

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:19.390
You know, a friend of mine who's
a visual artists said it's,

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:21.600
he says, how did he put it?

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:29.100
He says outreach is about us
coming to you is like outreach

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:30.910
and you coming to us
is about marketing.

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:33.790
But us coming together,
that's about community.

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:39.520
And so that's, you know you can
be a lot different things to a lot

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:44.820
of different people and everyone is
served and everyone is made better.

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:49.680
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: So I think to
wrap this up I'd like to hear

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:56.040
from you how that ethos about
community can be instilled

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:57.760
in more conductors
and more musicians.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.420
I know we've touched upon this a
little bit but it's not something

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:02.940
that you're taught in music school.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.570 position:56%
It's not something that you're
taught by all your private teachers,

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:09.820
whether it's a conducting
teacher or an instrument.

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:11.770
Who filled that role for you?

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:16.290
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: In a lot
of instances, by not growing

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:21.290
up in a house with a father,
I had to become a sponge.

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:24.290
Why those things became important
to me I can't answer that,

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:30.400
that was just, I feel that, again
without getting hyper religious,

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.920
I do feel that this God's call
in my life, this is the thing

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.140
that I'm supposed to be doing.

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:41.210 position:56%
And so there, for me there's a
certain responsibility right off the

00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:44.860
bat, and part of that
responsibility means that there has

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:50.140
to be a certain humility because
I didn't create this talent in me.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.890
I didn't create the ability
to be a good public speaker.

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:54.550
I didn't, you know.

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:59.220
A friend of mine said that
all I did was I was obedient

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:00.520
when I was given a gift.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:04.020 position:56%
That I didn't you know throw it away

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:07.440
or that's the only thing
I can take the credit

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.420
for was that I was obedient.

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:14.070 position:56%
Again one of those friends who
don't think you're all that special.

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:22.610
But I think, by being
a sponge it meant

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:28.730
that my ears were always
open you know,

00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:32.710
I used to journal at some point.

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:38.210
And I knew that I wanted, it
helps when you have role models

00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:46.000 position:56%
and sometimes those role models
don't know they're your role models.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:52.190
But they were almost always
older men who were good fathers

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:56.910
and good husbands and you
know, you know I said you know

00:50:56.910 --> 00:51:01.990
that the best thing I can do for my
children is to love their mother.

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:06.250
And you know, one guy said to me,

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:08.280
he says you know I'll always
know what kind of man you are

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.820
by the smile on your wife's face.

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.390
He didn't I'll know what kind

00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:12.770
of husband you are he said
I'd know what kind of,

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:14.250
I'll know what kind of man you are.

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:17.550
We are good at being boys.

00:51:17.550 --> 00:51:20.540
We can boys until we're
50, you know?

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:23.610
But it takes somebody
special to come along

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:25.740
to teach us how to be men.

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.980
And I think in the process of
learning how to become a man,

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:32.450
or if you know if were
a woman a woman,

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:38.480
basically what I'm saying is
a grown up, a real grown up.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:43.560
You have to always be aware
of what you don't know.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:48.030
And so there have been, there have
just been people in my church,

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:51.150
sometimes there have been
people in our, in business,

00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:53.880
sometimes there have been
people in the music business,

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.290
but there's always been someone
who may have said something

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:57.680
or did something and made me go oh,

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.180
I've got to write that
down and keep that.

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.740
And then I'm a ponderer.

00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:10.790 position:56%
So that was for me that was what did
it was just being willing to listen

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:13.770
and to learn something
and from anybody.

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:15.950
You know? Anybody can
teach you anything.

00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:20.720
I have a mantra of the last few
years that says every day I want

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:24.920
to love something, learn something
and leave something behind.

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:32.740
And Wynton Marsalis said that he
was saying it to a group of kids,

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:38.400
he said that you know, your biggest
competitor is not the other person

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.700
in the room.

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.840
Your biggest competitor
is your ignorance.

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.240
So if you get up every day
and decide to do better

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:47.400
with your biggest competitor, then
every day you'll win something.

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.440
You know? And I think
maybe that's, that was,

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.370
you know I had a friend
who's dad was a salesman,

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:54.800
a very successful salesman.

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:59.840
So he turned me on, you know
those like, all of those sort

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:04.770
of like Robert Schuller, move
ahead with possibility of thinking,

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:07.660
the guy who invented the
round to it who's Zig Zigler.

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:10.010
You know these are guys that
business guys are reading.

00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:13.950
I'm reading those as a young
undergrad thinking there has

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:18.850
to be a route to you know
to whatever success is.

00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:27.910
And growing up in a housing
project poor, is a great motivator.

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:31.670
And I will tell this one story
of myself if you don't mind.

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:32.970
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Please, yes.

00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:35.120
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Because I still
to this day tell it to my teacher

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:38.800
at New England Conservatory,
who by the way when he came

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:42.170
to my first Boston Symphony
concert pulled me aside

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:43.920
and gave me some instructions.

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.570
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Oh who was this?

00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:46.870
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Richard Pitman.

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:48.170
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Oh yes.

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:49.470
Oh he's.

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:51.110
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: He says mind
if I tell you make a couple.

00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:53.770
Sure! You know?

00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:57.240
But so here I was I
wanted to be a conductor

00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.540
since I was eight years old.

00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:00.880
And I had all these opportunities

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:04.680
through you know high school I
was a student conductor of a band,

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.130
and my band director let
me conduct every day.

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:12.180 position:56%
And if he was going to be absent, he
would just have them hire to someone

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.170
to take roll and I
would be completely,

00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:16.380
and to all these unbelievable
opportunities

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:18.450
in college every year
in undergraduate school.

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:23.780
So I took two years off and I
don't have perfect pitch, you know,

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:29.620
so I took an audition at at
NEC, New England Conservatory.

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:32.410
There were three spots open.

00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:36.050
There were 28 people
auditioning for those three spots.

00:54:36.050 --> 00:54:40.500
And so the first part of the day
you had to conduct the orchestra.

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.840
Well, I'm so charming.

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.640
I mean I had been, I'm
comfortable on the podium,

00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.160
and I had been for a long time.

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:49.300
The orchestra stood up and
applauded at my audition.

00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:51.200
I thought, I was feeling
like really good.

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:55.370
And then in the afternoon,
seven of us at a time,

00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:59.090
we had to take the
musical skills test.

00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:03.640
And his musical skills test was
like okay, here's a G, alright,

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:07.970
now I'm going to play through
this twice, so I'm thinking, I'm,

00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:10.940
he's already done with the first
time, I'm thinking okay, G, okay,

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:13.710
so now, so [inaudible] flat,
well the piece is gone!

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:15.900
But the time I figure out
what key we're in, you know?

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:19.840
And so, and then the single line
dictation that was like boom, boop,

00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:22.860
boom, boop, stuff, this kind of
stuff, and then the piano record,

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:24.700
I didn't, my mother couldn't
afford piano lessons.

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:30.360
I never, I had like class piano
as an undergraduate, that was it.

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:34.400
So then we had personal
interviews with him.

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.160
And the seven of us went to
lunch together and we were,

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:40.630
we're all like shaking our heads
going this ain't happening.

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:45.970
You know? And so I go to lunch and
I have my personal meeting with him

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:49.650 position:56%
and he goes, you remind me of Pierre
Montour [assumed] and I went whoa,

00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:52.540
oh my gosh, he's comparing me
to somebody famous, you know?

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:56.710
He says you, he says I believe
you could get an orchestra

00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:59.800
to do anything just because
of your nature on the podium.

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:01.100
You're very charming.

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:07.170
He says, he's, and then he took out
my test, and he held it like this.

00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:08.790
He says but this.

00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:11.330
This is ridiculous.

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:13.680
And I went bloop.

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:17.950
He said look, you don't want
to be a Charleton [assumed],

00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:21.580
you have to have intellectual
integrity and artistic integrity.

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:25.520
And it turned out he was the person

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:28.120
who also demonstrated moral
integrity which was great.

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.590
Speaking of role models.

00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:32.950
He says I don't know if
I'm going to take you.

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:34.250
But I'll tell you what.

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:37.410
He says if I were to take you
and you're conducting alone,

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:40.100
I would save one of these three
spots for you right now even

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:41.700
without hearing the
last group of seven.

00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:44.710
Because the panels
in a group of seven.

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:47.400
He says but I'll tell you what.

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:51.660
If I do take you, you're going
to have to work your butt off.

00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:55.810
And if you don't, and here are
the words, I will not hesitate

00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:59.070
to kick you out of school.

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:03.610
And those are the words
that changed my life.

00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:08.700
Because to have grown up the way I
grew up, to have had that the dream

00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:14.570 position:56%
to the level that I've had it and to
be on the doorstep of the very place

00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:16.950
that could make that, turn
that dream into a reality,

00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:22.820
and to have someone say mm mm
[phonetic] that changed everything.

00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:25.910
By the following year I
was his graduate assistant.

00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:31.280
And I am a great source of
pride for him because my,

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:35.670 position:56%
when my wife first met him she goes,
you made my husband a workaholic.

00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:38.550
He goes, he said, yep!

00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:43.160
So but he really did, he said you,

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.480
this is not how you
become a conductor.

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:47.130
And so he taught me how to work.

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:50.840
And I had to be able to
play any of the Bach corrals

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:54.380
in open score if, in
order to graduate.

00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:57.790
I was like every morning,
you know, at a piano.

00:57:57.790 --> 00:58:03.150
But it was the greatest anyone
could ever give anyone and that is

00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:08.090
to say wishing without working
only leads to disappointment.

00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:09.390
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Definitely.

00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:11.280
Well I think that's a
great moment to end.

00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:13.460
And I really appreciate
you taking the time

00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:15.780
to share your story with us.

00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:19.280
And we hope that this is
the beginning of a very long

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.910
and wonderful relationship
with the Library

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:24.180 position:56%
and we appreciate your being part of
the Shift Festival, and can't wait

00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:25.610

00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:26.910
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins:
Me too, it's a great.

00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:28.210
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Thank you
Maestro, appreciate it.

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:29.510
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Take care.

00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:30.850 position:56%

00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:46.200
