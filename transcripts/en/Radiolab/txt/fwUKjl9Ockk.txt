Speaker 2:          00:26          this is radio lamb. I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich. And in this hour we've been talking about, uh, aging mostly, but now we're going to turn our attention to the end of that aging process.

Speaker 3:          00:38          Well, you're talking about dying. Yes. Maybe we've avoided that topic because that's generally how people deal with death, which is to avoid it, to deny it. Yeah. So this next piece is about actually a different way of dealing with death, I should say, before we begin it, that it does contain some graphic descriptions of the normal bodily process of aging. But if you have someone in the room who is squeamish or you don't think she'd hear these things and it's nothing, you know, terrible. It's just, it's actually quite nasty, nasty, nasty. Uh, then maybe this is the time to shoot them out of the room.

Speaker 2:          01:08          This piece was produced by Lou old Koski. It's about one family, three generations in introduce myself. This is Jeremiah the youngest. Um, Jeremiah Hagar. He's a filmmaker, so I don't know if Isaiah is, they are his dad. Isaiah is a muralist. His grandfather, I'm think Fran son of Asher's. They go, I'm sure Zayic art is a health nut. G Like, oh my shit. This is a video of him that Jeremiah shot of Astra doing his daily exercise routine. He's in his nineties. He's jumping on a trampoline and counting each jump.

Speaker 4:          01:43          How old are you now? I'm 90 90. You're in healthy man for 90 yeah. [inaudible] 91 90. [inaudible] a great, great grandfather named Dave [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          02:00          So you're going to live to 102, I don't know. But the, maybe at the age of 93, Asher began to decline

Speaker 5:          02:11          quickly. How do you deal with a man dying in your house? How do you deal with that? Well, you know, my father starts taking photos of him. One of my modes of understanding was either drawing or photographing. He was always taking pictures of my grandfather. Just see how dozens of slides. Thousands.

Speaker 2:          02:34          That's how it went for awhile. Isaiah, the dad would take care of his dad and take some photos. Wow. Grandson Jeremiah basically looked the other way. Well, I never really knew my grandfather, but then Isaiah got an idea. I thought to

Speaker 5:          02:48          self challenge this young boy to this duel who can take the most objective photographs of a dying man. It wasn't, we threw down and like I pulled my camera out of my holster and he pulled his camera out of his holster. You know, it wasn't like that. He was involved in my grandfather's death and I wasn't. And so he said, this is how I get involved. It's my senior year in high school. Um, and I was a bus boy in this restaurant down the street and I loved it. And I would bust tables till two or three in the morning and then I would get drunk with people after work and then I would come back and I would take care of my grandpa. So I would lift him up and change his sheets because otherwise his bedsore would burn more when he had this horrible bedsore you can see it in the photographs and he would hit me while I lifted him up and then I would photograph them cause I would want to sit with him.

Speaker 5:          03:40          Cause when you want to calm him down and the way you sit with them, I mean my father was right. You have the camera. I mean that's how you cope. Otherwise you're sitting with him and he's just looking at you. During the contest, Dad and son shared duties of taking care of Grandpa and at night they'd sit at the kitchen table and compare photos. As soon as I took the first picture, you knew I'm a better than my fathers because my fathers were from far away and there were snapshots and mine were like specific. Like I was fascinated with him dying. I wanted to know what it looked like. And this went on for about a month. One during which time, even Jeremiah's friends, all of his friends got involved. I had the wee hours of the night. I would wake up and I would see that they're surrounding my father or four or five young people. Sure. They were drinking beer and they were joking around, but they were there. They were there while he was there.

Speaker 6:          04:37          What I remember most was, uh, you and your friends changing his sheets and, uh, lifting him and moving him around. So like every island that it would be more. Who else did it with you? John Lincoln. He all became initiated into the most problematic event in our lives. It was an amazingly rare scene to see these teenagers attending to death. Well, this is a book of photographs. So, uh, my father, your grandfather's last week of life in this very room. So the contest was a month long. Smart Guy. I am. You're good. You know how to even contest they kept it con for one month kitchen.

Speaker 6:          05:36          Well, the feet look like they're, um, they were out in the desert that they'd been baked and cracked and dry, dry, dry doubt. I mean, look at them. They look like, I mean, look at the nail. The nail is wild, but I mean everything. It's like what? I have these same legs. Stop touching on photos. Well, I can almost feel him like feeling them. I feel you instead there. That's bed sore. That's what happens. Hello. It's awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful man who prided himself on his health. Look what happened. I just one describe that it looks like riding me. I mean they just opened wounds and you're moving them around, moving around, but still it was impossible. It's crazy to look at the colors too. Pink and then white, green and then ground where it's, well the widest, the muscle isn't, I took these photos in color because I'm black and white.

Speaker 6:          06:46          You'd never get it. You know, you'd never get how painful this must have been. His anus was all red. I mean like really red and you can see the parts of it have broken and there's just blood gushing out and it's dried. I mean the blood is dried and this is the last photo. Yeah, you can see like the cognition is gone on the mouth as a cape. He's buried in his pillow. He knew it was over. It was just a matter of time. Now that's it. That's the closest I got in dying. He wanted to live forever. Whoa. The fix was in from the beginning. The fix is that I was supposed to add. Sure, sure. How could it be any other way? I don't know. I could have taken that. I couldn't give it up. You wanted me to win. It was a subterfuge to get you to be with your grandfather as much as possible. I thought it was a fair Fairfax and wasn't, ah, can you can. They're asking you all already couldn't take a good picture. When a person is dying, it's very important that they're surrounded. Ooh.

Speaker 2:          08:01          They're surrounded by the light of life and you don't go in to the place of oblivion alone. You want me to be there? I don't know.

Speaker 6:          08:14          At this point. I don't know. I'm not, I'm not at that place yet. Well, what does that mean with the camera? I mean, just be with me. Yeah. Demon with me. Be close to me. Be Soft with me. Yeah, I guess that's what it's about. Really. Be Solid. Whoa. [inaudible] [inaudible]
