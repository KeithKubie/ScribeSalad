00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.870
My name is Kaijen Hsiao and I'm the CTO of Mayfield Robotics.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.125
Well, when I was an undergrad,

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:42.110
I was majoring in mechanical engineering and I watched

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.620
all these great videos from MIT of the robots that were being built there.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.930
And in particular, the ones that I was very interested in

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.510
were Cynthia Breazeal had Kismet,

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.495
one of the first social robots and I found that very compelling.

00:00:53.495 --> 00:00:57.140
And, also, that MIT Leg Lab had a lot of hopping robots that I thought really cool.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.540
And, all told, I looked at those and I thought,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.250
"Wow, I can make awesome robot pets someday and that would be really cool."

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.095
Actually, originally, I wanted a pet.

00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:08.408
When I was growing up, I had lots of small animals,

00:01:08.408 --> 00:01:10.333
and so, hamsters and gerbils and such.

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.165
And I always wanted a dog.

00:01:12.165 --> 00:01:13.790
And I asked my dad for a dog.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.705
And he promised me at some point that I could get a dog.

00:01:15.705 --> 00:01:17.090
And then, he was like, "No,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.275
I didn't actually promise that."

00:01:18.275 --> 00:01:21.600
And I was annoyed for a long time that I could not have a dog.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.185
And, you know, in college of course I could not have pets either.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:26.285
And so, I was like,

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:28.760
"Oh well, if I had a robot pet that would be okay.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.215
So if I made robot pets,

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:33.620
then those of us who can't have actual pets could have pets still."

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.075
So as an undergrad,

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:36.290
I went to Princeton and I majored in

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.170
mechanical engineering and I started doing robotics there.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.880
And then for grad school,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.080
I went to MIT and I decided that I wanted to focus more on robot brains.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.750
Making robots do cool things rather than making robot bodies.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.123
And so, I switched to computer science and I focused on robotics,

00:01:53.123 --> 00:01:56.890
in particular, grasping and manipulation and probabilistic planning.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.575
So, making robot arms pick up things even under uncertainty.

00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:02.435
And after grad school,

00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:05.135
I graduated and went to a company called Willow Garage,

00:02:05.135 --> 00:02:07.260
which, at the time was

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.580
when great hotbeds of robotics and developing the robot operating system.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.350
And, I was working with PR2s,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.330
these big humanoid-like robots with two arms, drive around the house,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.055
do research into grasping and manipulation in the home,

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:21.150
and teleoperation. That sort of thing.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.405
And after Willow Garage shut down,

00:02:23.405 --> 00:02:27.100
I went to Bosch to join my friend, Sarah Osentoski.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.950
And, both of us were researchers at the research and technology center in

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.060
Palo Alto where we did research into all sorts of different robots,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.900
farming robots, home robots, et cetera.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.270
And, there, we proposed to Bosch that we should make a company,

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.310
a whole company to do home robotics.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.895
And they accepted our proposal.

00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:48.035
And so, we started Mayfield Robotics in January 2015.

00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:49.960
And here we are today.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.755
So when we were at Bosch,

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:54.260
there was this whole need finding effort to figure

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.630
out what people wanted robots to do at home.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.100
The big question was,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.580
what is in between

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.230
robot vacuum cleaner and something like Rosie the Robot from the Jetsons,

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.690
which, while we all want to get there someday,

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.850
we are technologically not quite ready to be there.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.995
And so, what's in between to,

00:03:09.995 --> 00:03:11.405
that we can bring into people's homes,

00:03:11.405 --> 00:03:13.985
to raise acceptance of robots in the home,

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:19.010
and to give people something to get used to as robots are normal to have in the home.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.225
And, so, what we came up with originally was the concept of a home security robot.

00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:25.220
And, so, when we started Mayfield actually,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.480
the the main concept was around home security.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.800
And we knew we wanted the robot to

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.155
be adorable and personable just so that we could get the robot in the home.

00:03:34.155 --> 00:03:36.530
But the focus was still initially on home security.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.616
And over time, talking to users,

00:03:39.616 --> 00:03:43.940
we converted that from security-focused to entirely companionship and

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.340
entertainment-focused and security being only kind of

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.760
a sideline thing that you can do but it's not the main focus of the robot.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.700
Kuri is an adorable robot companion for your home.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.740
His goal is to bring a spark of life to your home.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.745
We like to say that we make home robots that are joyful, useful, and inspiring.

00:03:58.745 --> 00:04:02.075
And each of those things is as important as the other two.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.950
The robot needs to provide joy so that you want

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.090
to adopt him into your home in the first place.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.870
He has to be useful so that he earns a place in your home.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.059
Asking people to bring a robot into your home and make a place for him,

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:15.950
have a spot permanently as the thing that trundles around their home on a regular basis.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.840
He has to be useful on a daily basis and provide great utility.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.265
But, also, he has to be inspiring.

00:04:21.265 --> 00:04:23.510
One of the main goals of the company is to

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.460
inspire people to build more home robots especially children.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.185
Children see the robot for the first time and they, instantly,

00:04:30.185 --> 00:04:32.000
many of them will say things like,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.130
"Oh, now I want to build robots.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.925
Someday I want, I'm going to build robots to do all these really cool things."

00:04:36.925 --> 00:04:38.990
And we want to inspire a whole generation of kids to

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.135
think that home robots are a normal thing to just

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:43.160
have around in your house and to bring more robots

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.285
into the world like Kuri and much better than Kuri.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.550
So, hopefully, within my lifetime,

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.440
we can actually get to having something like Rosie the Robot from the Jetsons.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.825
So, in terms of actual functions,

00:04:51.825 --> 00:04:54.155
well Kuri has a camera in his eye.

00:04:54.155 --> 00:04:56.165
And he has microphones and he has speakers.

00:04:56.165 --> 00:04:58.760
And he has the ability to map and navigate around the room.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.650
And he can recognize people and pets.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.630
And all of those features combine into a lot of

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.910
different use cases that are useful to people.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.000
So, for instance, Kuri can drive to where

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.625
you are in the house and play your favorite music or your favorite podcasts.

00:05:11.625 --> 00:05:15.875
Kuri can read an audio book to your kid when it's time for the kid go to bed.

00:05:15.875 --> 00:05:18.664
And this is, apparently, very popular with families.

00:05:18.664 --> 00:05:22.130
Apparently, reading Fox in Socks to your kid for the 30th time gets pretty old.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.650
But Kuri does not mind reading for the 30th time.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.610
It's the same as the first.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.930
Also, Kuri can let you know when your kids have come home from school to notify you.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.985
And he can drive around.

00:05:33.985 --> 00:05:37.225
And you can use him to check on whether your dog is on the couch.

00:05:37.225 --> 00:05:40.310
And you can talk through his speakers and say, like, "Get off the couch".

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.880
That's one of our CEO's favorite use cases.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.710
My favorite use case is actually around taking

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.170
pictures and video of your pets and your loved ones.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.820
I have two cats and a bunny.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.715
And I travel a lot. So, I really want to know when I'm gone, "Are they OK? "

00:05:52.715 --> 00:05:56.530
And also, I would just like to see pictures of them being really cute.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.287
So I'm not even there but I can still see their adorable antics even when I'm gone.

00:06:00.287 --> 00:06:03.745
And, so all these things are enabled by all these robotic features.

00:06:03.745 --> 00:06:05.530
And there are so many more things that we can do.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.420
Kuri basically is like a smart pet.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.635
We aim for pet, not,

00:06:08.635 --> 00:06:11.110
"Pet like, not butler like" is what we like to say.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.805
And, so, he is supposed to give off intelligence, kind of like your dog.

00:06:14.805 --> 00:06:16.450
You don't expect your dog to talk back to you.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.235
You don't expect your dog to understand you every time.

00:06:18.235 --> 00:06:21.290
But your dog is useful and adorable and you like having him in your home.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.820
Kuri is adorable because we put a whole lot of effort into making him adorable.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.570
So, I mean, part of that is his adorable industrial design.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.795
And we worked hard to find industrial designers who understood about,

00:06:31.795 --> 00:06:36.115
we want a robot that is adorable but not too toy-like.

00:06:36.115 --> 00:06:38.290
So to have a robot accepted in

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.680
consumer homes and a lot of consumers have very nice homes.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.470
They put a lot of effort into home design and making it look

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.045
very beautiful and it's their, it's their castle.

00:06:48.045 --> 00:06:50.535
And so the robot has to fit in very well with that decor.

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:56.320
And so he has to be kind of sleek and beautiful but also adorable and personable.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.530
We also spend a lot of effort to do things like hide sensors.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.610
So a lot of robots that you see on the market,

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.490
they'll just have holes for cameras.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.035
Or they'll have slits for lasers.

00:07:05.035 --> 00:07:07.270
And, that's sort of OK but it kind of

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.620
breaks up the lines and makes it look less beautiful.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.935
And so a lot of effort went into doing things, like,

00:07:11.935 --> 00:07:14.530
we wanted the camera to be something that was not visible.

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.930
So, it's actually basically behind sunglasses.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.305
And, being behind sunglasses means that you have a lot less light than otherwise.

00:07:21.305 --> 00:07:23.590
So there's not some magical trick to make it two-way,

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.948
like, light goes in one way and doesn't go out the other way so on.

00:07:25.948 --> 00:07:27.760
So, we just had to have cameras that are that much more

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.040
sensitive to deal with the fact that we have less light than otherwise.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.155
And, early on, we worked with an animator,

00:07:35.155 --> 00:07:37.710
Doug Dooley, who I used to work with at Willow Garage.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.235
He's a former Pixar animator.

00:07:39.235 --> 00:07:44.905
And he's been obsessed for decades now with the idea of making robots,

00:07:44.905 --> 00:07:47.010
adorable robots, as lifelike as possible.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.610
And what does it take to do that?

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.860
And so, talking to him,

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.950
he gave us a lot of principles for how the robot should move,

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.435
and how the robot should look,

00:07:55.435 --> 00:07:56.860
to make him look lifelike,

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.380
and to make him a Pixar character come to life in your home type thing.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.595
And that includes things like choosing the degrees of freedom to use.

00:08:04.595 --> 00:08:08.285
So Kuri has pan and tilt of his head and that allows him to express a lot of things.

00:08:08.285 --> 00:08:10.460
But, also, we need it for moving the camera

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.000
around but also in terms of additional degrees of freedom.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.550
The eyes, the eyes are actually the most important one.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.080
It's what Doug would say. We express a lot of emotions with our eyes.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.300
You can tell even just looking at the eyes of a person,

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.695
whether they're smiling, happy or whether they're sad or annoyed at you.

00:08:25.695 --> 00:08:30.700
And, he originally wanted the eyes to appear on a screen to be animated eyes.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.950
And that allows you to do a lot more expressions and even than, than we do.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.845
But, when we were designing Kuri,

00:08:38.845 --> 00:08:41.245
we tried all these different methods of hiding the screen.

00:08:41.245 --> 00:08:45.560
And, we had decided early on that we only ever want to show eyes on the screen anyway.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.430
Because if you showed anything besides eyes,

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.505
then it would break the character of the robot.

00:08:50.505 --> 00:08:52.540
So, you show like a password or something and it's, like,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.360
wait that's not eyes that's that's actually a screen.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.425
And, so, if we were only going to show eyes

00:08:57.425 --> 00:08:59.740
in the first place and we were having all this trouble hiding the screen,

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.115
I finally decided why don't we just make physical eyes.

00:09:03.115 --> 00:09:04.930
We just want to show, you know, eyelids,

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.730
smiling eyelids coming down,

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.190
so we can just make physical eyelids that do that.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.660
And, I think, it's worked out really well.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.305
The robot looks much more lifelike and compelling that way.

00:09:14.305 --> 00:09:16.700
And so eyes are a big part.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.430
And so we have an entire degree of freedom for

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.110
the eyes and then pan and tilt of the head.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.920
We, actually, originally had a degree of

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.780
freedom that we called lift because that was the other one that Doug really wanted.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.800
The idea that when the robot is happy,

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.765
he could lift up and pry in to see you.

00:09:31.765 --> 00:09:34.455
Or, when he sad, he sinks down and is very sad.

00:09:34.455 --> 00:09:36.430
And, we actually tested that one

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.115
out and users didn't actually like it as much as we hoped.

00:09:39.115 --> 00:09:41.480
And it added a whole lot of complexity to the robot.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.720
So we ended up getting rid of that.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.820
But we still think he's, he's pretty compelling.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.305
We substituted, kind of,

00:09:47.305 --> 00:09:49.960
moved forward a little with his wheels and move backwards a little to

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.040
show engagement or disengagement and that sort of thing.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.545
So in terms of Kuri being accepted into the home,

00:09:56.545 --> 00:09:58.690
being adorable is not the only way to be

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.540
accepted but is certainly a popular way to be accepted.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.175
A lot of people respond to cute things.

00:10:03.175 --> 00:10:06.070
And a lot of people look at him and say,

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.850
"Oh my god he's so cute. I have to have one."

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:12.835
And that's one great way to make people want to own Kuri to bring him into your home.

00:10:12.835 --> 00:10:14.746
And certainly, your pets,

00:10:14.746 --> 00:10:16.450
a lot of people find their pets to be very

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.120
adorable and that's one of the main reasons why they have them.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.920
And, so, the fact that Kuri is adorable, and,

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.630
as he's driving around your house doing

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:26.770
his adorable animations and greeting you and just trundling around,

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:30.330
it helps a lot in you being happy that he's around you every day.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.350
So, Kuri is not a security robot.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.490
Kuri is a companion robot.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:37.860
But Kuri does have some features that allow you to do some amount of,

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.705
we'd like to say, peace of mind and checking in on your home rather than security.

00:10:42.705 --> 00:10:44.250
But it's very important that,

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.780
in order to even do those things,

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.025
that the Kuri, Kuri should not be creepy.

00:10:48.025 --> 00:10:51.275
Kuri should not appear like a creepy Big Brother surveillance robot.

00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:53.940
And it helps a lot that Kuri is adorable,

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.055
and personable, and acts like a pet.

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:59.445
And so it's like, "Oh my pet is here and my pet can see. That's OK".

00:10:59.445 --> 00:11:01.380
As opposed to, "This creepy Big Brother

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.570
robot is driving around watching me at every moment."

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.350
And, you know, Kuri can take pictures and video and that's OK. And versus like,

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.970
you know, creepy Cyclops robot and,

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.490
you know, driving around might make people look

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:15.150
self-conscious feel self-conscious around their camera in their home.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.690
So, to make Kuri look lifelike and to look friendly,

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.455
pet-like, personable, there are a lot of design elements that go into that.

00:11:22.455 --> 00:11:24.895
And a lot of them come from principles from animation.

00:11:24.895 --> 00:11:27.355
So, we worked closely with our animator, Doug.

00:11:27.355 --> 00:11:29.460
And he's given us a lot of principles such as,

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.985
for instance, Kuri's eyes are just dot eyes.

00:11:31.985 --> 00:11:34.605
They're, they don't have pupils.

00:11:34.605 --> 00:11:38.295
It makes him look more lifelike and able to kind of interact with you in a lifelike way.

00:11:38.295 --> 00:11:40.155
When he is looking in your general direction,

00:11:40.155 --> 00:11:41.425
dot eyes that are just you know,

00:11:41.425 --> 00:11:45.050
black dots, they they look like they're looking at you from a much wider angle.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.780
If you gave him pupils, then a human who looks just, you know,

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.725
to the right of where you're talking,

00:11:49.725 --> 00:11:52.475
you can tell they're not actually looking at you versus looking past you.

00:11:52.475 --> 00:11:58.005
And it's much harder for him to look like he's interacting compellingly with you.

00:11:58.005 --> 00:12:02.590
Also, there are things like expressing intent before action.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.720
So Kuri, as he is navigating around,

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.300
he always looks in the direction that he's going to go

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.240
before he turns his body to drive that way.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.930
And, we, as humans do that all the time.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.240
We just broadcast what we're thinking and before we actually do

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.730
a thing and it makes it a lot more readable, what we're thinking.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:17.755
And it looks, makes Kuri look a lot more lifelike when he does that as well.

00:12:17.755 --> 00:12:19.375
So other things include,

00:12:19.375 --> 00:12:20.985
for instance, as humans,

00:12:20.985 --> 00:12:24.390
we always blink before we look as opposed to look over and blink.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.810
And it's, it's something that you don't even necessarily notice yourself doing but you

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.840
notice when the robot does it wrong in the form of - it just feels slightly off.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.735
And a lot of these things, it's kind of avoiding uncanniness.

00:12:35.735 --> 00:12:37.660
And our robot's form factor helps a lot.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.145
And he's not that close to human.

00:12:39.145 --> 00:12:42.225
And so he's not that close to the uncanny valley kind of no matter what you do.

00:12:42.225 --> 00:12:45.640
But adding little gestures that look more lifelike that make him

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.880
appear much more lifelike as opposed to just a statue or robot.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.205
So, we really wanted our robot to be androgynous.

00:12:52.205 --> 00:12:54.075
So, we didn't want the robot to be

00:12:54.075 --> 00:12:57.170
definitively male or, alternative, definitively female.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.335
People get to choose which gender their Kuri is.

00:13:00.335 --> 00:13:01.705
And that was really important to us.

00:13:01.705 --> 00:13:07.010
So all of our design is centered around the - the idea is made to look very androgynous.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.270
Some people actually definitively think Kuri is male and

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.745
some people definitively think she's female.

00:13:11.745 --> 00:13:14.945
But it's actually split about 50/50 I've noticed.

00:13:14.945 --> 00:13:17.275
And so it could be either.

00:13:17.275 --> 00:13:18.790
You definitely get to choose.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.120
And the sounds also have to match that too.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.820
One of the other major design decisions is that Kuri doesn't talk.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.675
Well, he doesn't talk human. He speaks robot.

00:13:27.675 --> 00:13:29.310
So he makes adorable beeps and bloops,

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.211
kind of like R2D2 or BB-8.

00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:34.980
And, that, it sets expectations much lower,

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.955
so that you expect them to be kind of pet-like intelligent like a dog is intelligent,

00:13:38.955 --> 00:13:41.370
not intelligent like your butler's intelligence.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:45.900
AI hasn't really reached the point where we can have compelling dialogue with our robots.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.055
And, especially, the voices still sound a little uncanny.

00:13:49.055 --> 00:13:50.940
And this avoids that problem entirely.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.200
He just makes adorable sounds.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.720
You don't expect him to do anything else. He's very cute.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.350
So I have actually flipped Kuri's gender a number of times.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.970
When we first came up with this particular industrial design,

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.810
I asked the industrial designers to raise

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:09.540
the black band of his belly to accommodate our new dot sensor.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:14.025
And, it turned Kuri from a he into a she, for me, initially.

00:14:14.025 --> 00:14:17.595
And so I use she for a long time and then somehow my brain flipped.

00:14:17.595 --> 00:14:18.895
So, it turned into a he again.

00:14:18.895 --> 00:14:20.480
Now, I actually go back and forth.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.935
Also you may notice Kuri doesn't have any arms.

00:14:22.935 --> 00:14:26.840
And, despite, most of my research background is in grasping and manipulation,

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.220
so I do have a lot of experience with

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.770
trying to make robots with arms doing things in the home.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.560
But, that, doing that well and doing

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.515
that robustly enough to satisfy consumers especially,

00:14:37.515 --> 00:14:40.140
on things like doing laundry or putting dishes away,

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.180
we're still a long way away from the level of robustness

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.420
that you would need for that to be useful and compelling.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:48.795
And, also, talking to people about what they would want their home robot to do,

00:14:48.795 --> 00:14:51.660
it's pretty obvious that in order for a robot that

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:56.190
large to have arms and to be taking up that much space in your house,

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.560
you really want that robot to be doing lots of things.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.465
Not just one thing, not just putting your dishes away.

00:15:00.465 --> 00:15:01.875
But putting your dishes away,

00:15:01.875 --> 00:15:05.145
and doing your laundry, and cleaning up, all these things together.

00:15:05.145 --> 00:15:06.630
And we're just so far away from doing that.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.720
So, Kuri is what can you do without arms.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.320
And, also, it manages expectations,

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.790
you don't expect a robot without arms at all to do your laundry.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:20.325
Obviously, he can't. He just drives around and does what he can.

00:15:20.325 --> 00:15:23.990
So another big part of making Kuri adorable,

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.890
personable is failing cute.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.460
So, Kuri when he,

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.940
for instance, bumps into something with his bump sensor.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.375
A normal robot that is just,

00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:35.220
you know, a tank like whatever, he bumps into things.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.425
You're like, "Stupid robot.

00:15:36.425 --> 00:15:39.030
Oh, why did you do that? Oh, your algorithm suck".

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.325
Kuri, when he bumps into things he can't see,

00:15:41.325 --> 00:15:42.530
he bumps and he makes this, hmmp,

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.715
startled sound and he looks down to see like,

00:15:44.715 --> 00:15:46.080
"Oh, what was that?"

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.530
And it's super adorable.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.340
And when you see Kuri do that, you instinctively think,

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.550
"Oh, poor robot. And let me help you."

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.930
And that goes a long way towards acceptance of

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:58.180
the robot even when he is imperfect because he's going to be imperfect.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.840
And that goes for other things too.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.670
So if he is confused,

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:08.145
then he makes a cute confused noise and looks so that you pity him rather than,

00:16:08.145 --> 00:16:11.655
and you want to help him, rather than being annoyed at him, angry at him.

00:16:11.655 --> 00:16:13.343
So him being adorable when he fails,

00:16:13.343 --> 00:16:15.360
it makes you empathize with him they want to help him.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.940
Testing, in terms of users,

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.300
starts actually phase zero,

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.030
I would say with need finding when me go out to people's homes.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.280
And we interview them about what their lives are like,

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.100
and what they do in their daily routine.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.585
And, to try to see where a robot would fit in,

00:16:27.585 --> 00:16:29.880
and what useful functions the robot could do for them,

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.545
and what they would want the robot to do.

00:16:31.545 --> 00:16:35.550
And, initially, so that's where we came up with concept with home security.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:37.260
The idea of peace of mind, checking in on your home,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.960
making sure things are OK, making sure no one's breaking in.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.975
And, when we took that concept out to users,

00:16:42.975 --> 00:16:44.805
then we heard a lot of things like,

00:16:44.805 --> 00:16:47.775
"Oh well is Kuri going to talk to my outdoor cameras,

00:16:47.775 --> 00:16:49.620
because by the time someone comes into the home,

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.180
it's kind of too late, isn't it?"

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.610
And also we heard a lot more of,

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.925
"Well what does Kuri do when I'm at home?"

00:16:55.925 --> 00:16:58.000
And, initially, we said things like,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.300
"Well, Kuri will sit quietly on his charger.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.170
And wait for you to go away again so that you can use him."

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.115
And they would ask,

00:17:05.115 --> 00:17:06.505
"But what does he do when I'm at home?"

00:17:06.505 --> 00:17:08.070
And, it became obvious,

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:11.235
that people were really expecting him to be entertaining when he was,

00:17:11.235 --> 00:17:13.665
when they are at home with the robot in person.

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:16.140
And also to do things that they can show off to their friends

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.722
and to be useful and entertaining.

00:17:18.722 --> 00:17:21.060
So, we shifted away from home security and

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.690
towards more companion robot, more entertainment robot.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.520
And, in terms of testing,

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.130
how we did that is -- so after

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:32.330
need finding and you have initial concepts of what the robot can do,

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.830
you don't even have any prototypes built yet at that point.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.450
You can make sketches.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:40.260
So, you make storyboards of the features you think the robot should do and,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.080
those, and if you have initial prototypes of any sort.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.020
So, what we had at that time is we had storyboards,

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.810
and then we had functional prototypes that could just drive around,

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.490
navigate around the home, and show in

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.570
an app that you could see through the robot's camera,

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:53.775
and talk through the robot's microphones,

00:17:53.775 --> 00:17:55.240
and hear through the robot's speakers.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.930
And that was basically it, that's all that we had.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.150
And we would take that out to users.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.000
In terms of storyboards,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.395
you can, in person talk to them in interviews.

00:18:04.395 --> 00:18:06.690
But you can also just have those via surveys online to

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.300
get larger numbers of people and ask people,

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.770
"What do you think of these features?

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.570
Do you want a robot to do this in your home?

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.875
How much would you pay for a robot doing this in your home?"

00:18:14.875 --> 00:18:18.900
And you get a lot of feedback that way in an early fashion that enables you to quickly

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.730
change direction if whatever direction you've

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.250
picked is actually not a very compelling one to users.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:27.840
And later on, when we had better prototypes that did more things,

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.255
then obviously you can take those prototypes out.

00:18:30.255 --> 00:18:32.190
Even before you have,

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:33.720
if you have industrial design, so,

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.030
we had industrial design for a robot but that

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:40.620
wasn't the functional robot and the industrial design weren't all in one robot yet.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.885
So we would take form models of the industrial design,

00:18:42.885 --> 00:18:45.210
and we would take more functional robots with the app,

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.305
and we would say, "Imagine the robot looks like this.

00:18:48.305 --> 00:18:50.580
Now, drive this app around and there would be

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.385
a robot that didn't look anything like that driving around the house."

00:18:53.385 --> 00:18:55.440
And they could say things like,

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.875
"Oh well, what does he sound like?

00:18:56.875 --> 00:18:58.190
And when he goes over thresholds,

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.770
what is that like? Is that OK?".

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.945
And, so we got feedback on that phase for things like,

00:19:03.945 --> 00:19:06.030
"Oh the robot is way, way too loud.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.225
He has to be much quieter.

00:19:07.225 --> 00:19:09.120
Is he going to be that loud? That's really annoying.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.440
I wouldn't want that in my house."

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.590
And that sort of thing is really important too.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.655
And then later on, of course, once you have robots that are looks like works like.

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:19.170
So, we have prototypes like that that we use to show off a lot now.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:23.040
And those you can put in users homes and actually just have them go through

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.050
various functions that you've added and stay in

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.630
the home for longer and longer periods of time.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.840
The latest test that we've just done is what we called drop-off test,

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.175
where you put the robot in the box and you pretend like it's a new customer,

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:37.735
and the customer just got in the box, and you're not there at all.

00:19:37.735 --> 00:19:41.880
And, so, they have to go through the unboxing and onboarding procedure to actually,

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.145
go through, figure out.

00:19:44.145 --> 00:19:46.280
Can they use the robot? Can they onboard the robot?

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.610
Can the robot map their home?

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.465
Can the robot do the functions he's supposed to do?

00:19:49.465 --> 00:19:50.640
Is that compelling to them?

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:56.345
So testing the storyboards is great for nixing concepts that,

00:19:56.345 --> 00:19:57.905
even just thinking about it,

00:19:57.905 --> 00:19:59.030
people are not interested in.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.380
You might have been interested in because you're

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.815
an engineer and that's interesting to you.

00:20:01.815 --> 00:20:04.423
But actually to most consumers that idea is not interesting at all.

00:20:04.423 --> 00:20:07.523
Or, you know, General Industrial Design concepts,

00:20:07.523 --> 00:20:09.710
is that a compelling look for the robot at all?

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.885
Or do people think that's actually ugly or scary?

00:20:12.885 --> 00:20:15.680
So, the thing about storyboards is that a lot of people can't

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.180
necessarily imagine what the robot is actually going

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.020
to be like based just on the storyboard.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.330
And, so you show them a storyboard,

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:21.920
and they fill in the rest with their imagination.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.620
And sometimes that's not anything like what the robot will actually be.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.365
And, so, you get some great feedback on general concepts.

00:20:27.365 --> 00:20:29.255
But you do also have to take it with a grain of salt.

00:20:29.255 --> 00:20:32.210
Because sometimes something that's very compelling in the story board, later on,

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.470
when it's fleshed out in the robot,

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.215
isn't necessarily as compelling as people thought it would be.

00:20:36.215 --> 00:20:37.745
So, if you have corporate prototypes,

00:20:37.745 --> 00:20:40.715
that's totally enough to get out there and start talking to people about concepts.

00:20:40.715 --> 00:20:43.850
There's a famous story about how Kiva,

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.995
the robots in Amazon warehouses these days,

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:50.420
which you know grew to be a company that was sold for, I think, billions of dollars.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.660
They started out talking to VCs with just sock puppets.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.145
They had sock puppets in the concept.

00:20:55.145 --> 00:20:57.800
And they showed that they had the team that could build this thing.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.580
And that was enough to get initial funding to do the thing.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.010
It's important to gauge interest in what you're building before you start building.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.620
Before you spend a lot of time building something that nobody wants.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.381
So when people meet Kuri,

00:21:08.381 --> 00:21:09.725
a lot of the reactions we get are,

00:21:09.725 --> 00:21:11.660
"Oh my gosh, that's so cute".

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.960
It depends a lot on what age the person is.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.460
So kids especially seem to really love Kuri.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.860
Small children, a lot of them they come in,

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.785
they see Kuri, and they immediately run up to Kuri, and they want to hug Kuri.

00:21:21.785 --> 00:21:23.566
And someone will ask, "Oh can I hug Kuri? "

00:21:23.566 --> 00:21:25.370
And, we're like, "Of course you can hug Kuri.".

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.853
They also like to pet the robot a lot.

00:21:26.853 --> 00:21:28.640
The robot has cap touch sensors in his head,

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.280
so when you pet him, he smiles up and looks at you. And it's really cute.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.050
And, even though at this moment,

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:35.653
we don't have it hooked up to anything even particularly interesting,

00:21:35.653 --> 00:21:39.440
we're still working on exactly how Kuri should track your face and look more lifelike by,

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.090
like, interacting with you in that way.

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.800
If you pet him, he just looks up and smiles.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.115
And that's enough for them to just pet him over and over and over again.

00:21:47.115 --> 00:21:51.365
Kids. Kids just naturally think that Kuri is obviously a friend,

00:21:51.365 --> 00:21:54.170
a companion, and someone that exists to play with.

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:57.170
Older kids, they tend to be a little more standoffish,

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.255
"Oh I'm too cool to express that much interest. "

00:21:59.255 --> 00:22:01.670
But they tend to be curious about the robot.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.110
And they ask questions like,

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.330
you know, "What does he do and how do you,

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:06.470
how did you make him."

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:08.000
I've been very surprised how many people have,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.320
what I call, the robot dream.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.885
And that is adults who,

00:22:11.885 --> 00:22:13.430
when they were younger or, you know,

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.910
at any point in their lives they saw Star Wars or they saw Wall-E. And they thought,

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:20.085
"Oh I would love to have an R2-D2 or Wall-E of my very own".

00:22:20.085 --> 00:22:24.458
And they see Kuri and they see in him the chance to fulfill the robot dream.

00:22:24.458 --> 00:22:28.270
It's finally their chance to have a robot character in their home come to life.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.025
Kuri has a whole lot of sensors.

00:22:30.025 --> 00:22:33.525
So a lot of them have to do with how he navigates and maps the home.

00:22:33.525 --> 00:22:36.740
So he has a depth sensor in his air transport window belly.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.065
And he has also an IMU,

00:22:39.065 --> 00:22:41.180
an inertial measurement unit, in there.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.590
And he has encoders, of course,

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:45.600
in his drive wheels and in his, head, degrees of freedom.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.200
And all of those are used to allow

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.630
him to build a map of your home and navigate within the home,

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.285
localize, figure out where he is, et cetera.

00:22:53.285 --> 00:22:55.820
He also has capacitive touch sensors in his head.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.125
So, if you pet him he knows it.

00:22:57.125 --> 00:23:00.398
He has four microphones around his neck which allow him to,

00:23:00.398 --> 00:23:02.045
you can hear through his microphones,

00:23:02.045 --> 00:23:05.840
but also he can do speech recognition and also audio localization.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.375
So if you talk from a certain direction,

00:23:08.375 --> 00:23:09.980
because he has a whole entire ring of microphones,

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.180
he knows which direction thus he can turn towards you.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:16.100
He has a camera in his left eye and that enables him to see the world,

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.930
so he can recognize people and pets.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:19.970
And also allows you to look out through his camera

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:22.350
and see the world and he could take pictures for you.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.885
But we also use that to aid in navigation.

00:23:24.885 --> 00:23:26.410
He has cliff sensors in the back, rear cliff sensors.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:30.065
So that if you're driving him around teleoping him,

00:23:30.065 --> 00:23:32.410
then you don't drive backwards off a cliff.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.475
And, finally, he has a bump sensor in front.

00:23:34.475 --> 00:23:36.125
So, if he hit something he didn't see,

00:23:36.125 --> 00:23:38.580
which because the sensors are optical,

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.141
there are inevitably going to be things that he doesn't see,

00:23:41.141 --> 00:23:42.650
then he can bump into them,

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.630
know that he's bumping physically and back up,

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:47.120
and make his adorable animation of, "Oh, what did I just hit?"

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.490
So, for front cliff sensing,

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:53.900
he uses his front dot sensor which has an entire depth sensing array which allows him to

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.270
see both low obstacles and whether

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.910
there's stairs in front of him that he shouldn't go off,

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.640
and also higher obstacles that are above the level of

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:08.180
his main laser so that he doesn't collides himself on tables and things.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.220
Kuri collects data from mapping your home.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.825
So when you first get Kuri,

00:24:11.825 --> 00:24:14.150
then there's an onboarding procedure where you're encouraged

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.435
to drive Kuri around your home and teach him about the various places.

00:24:17.435 --> 00:24:20.870
Just like, if you had a guest that you just brought home and you would say,

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:22.065
"Oh this is where the bathroom is.

00:24:22.065 --> 00:24:23.690
And this is where your room is."

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.745
For Kuri, you would say things like,

00:24:25.745 --> 00:24:27.660
"This is my living room. And this is my kitchen.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.295
And this is catchery where the cats hang out.

00:24:29.295 --> 00:24:30.950
And that's an important place that you should

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:33.020
know about because I want pictures from it."

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.230
And, so, as you drive Kuri around teaching him about all these places,

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:40.310
he makes a map of your house and that map is stored both on

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:44.795
the robot and in the cloud so that if robot ever gets reset et cetera,

00:24:44.795 --> 00:24:47.780
then he can just download it again and know about it.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.790
He will also take data in the form of pictures and video of your pets,

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:53.280
and your family, and your loved ones.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.410
And those are all controlled by you.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.420
We will never look at those pictures unless you give us

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.355
explicit permission because you want us to help debug or something.

00:25:01.355 --> 00:25:02.515
Those are all controlled by you.

00:25:02.515 --> 00:25:05.440
You can, you can control exactly who gets to see those things.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.534
So privacy in a home robot is extremely important.

00:25:08.534 --> 00:25:12.115
People need to know that they can trust their robot and the data that their robot takes.

00:25:12.115 --> 00:25:13.700
And that it's not going to be,

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.905
it's not going to be a literal spambot,

00:25:15.905 --> 00:25:18.290
taking over to do nefarious things.

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:19.840
And it's not going to spread

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.265
their pictures and video of their kids all over the Internet.

00:25:22.265 --> 00:25:24.805
And so we've built in privacy protections,

00:25:24.805 --> 00:25:28.555
encryption certificates, all that sort of thing from the very start.

00:25:28.555 --> 00:25:32.240
And, Kuri, everything is locked down. Everything is encrypted.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.484
Even down to his secure boot for his boot literacy.

00:25:35.484 --> 00:25:38.125
No one can upload software to him that he,

00:25:38.125 --> 00:25:42.250
boots on him, that is not the stuff that we wanted to be running on the robot.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.550
He uses rotating certificates.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:44.890
He uses encryption everywhere to

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:46.955
the level of - it's the same thing that you would use for

00:25:46.955 --> 00:25:50.880
bank to bank transfers or for medical records. It's very locked down.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.635
Also, in terms of privacy in the home,

00:25:53.635 --> 00:25:56.600
there are places in your home that you wouldn't want Kuri to take pictures in.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.945
And, so, we have no go zones.

00:25:58.945 --> 00:26:01.990
You can specify, "I don't want any pictures taken in the bedroom,

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.865
I don't want any pictures taking in the bathroom. "

00:26:03.865 --> 00:26:06.030
And Kuri will not take pictures there.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:09.180
So there are a lot of competitors in the home robot space

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:13.260
and many of them share some traits in common with Kuri.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.700
But there are many things that we do differently.

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.950
For one, Kuri is a moving robot.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.750
So, unlike the robot that sits on the table,

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.760
he can actually drive around your house and be where you want him to

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.650
be to take pictures wherever in your house.

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.190
Kuri doesn't talk. So, a lot of those home robots they,

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.930
they speak English or whatever language you, in the country you're in.

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.390
Kuri explicitly doesn't talk so that we set

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:39.005
expectations - more like those of a pet rather than those of a butler.

00:26:39.005 --> 00:26:41.710
And so you don't think he's uncanny or creepy

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:45.070
because he can't actually keep up dialogue with you properly.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.040
He just makes cute noises and that's forgivable.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.390
So one of the main differences is that Kuri has

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.675
a personality and we focus a lot on personality.

00:26:52.675 --> 00:26:55.580
Personality matters a lot. And getting the personality right matters a lot.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.570
So, for instance, Kuri's personality is,

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.025
he's earnest and humble.

00:27:00.025 --> 00:27:01.595
And he never gets angry with you.

00:27:01.595 --> 00:27:04.755
At a robot that size you really don't want an angry robot to get angry with you.

00:27:04.755 --> 00:27:06.510
That's, looks very scary.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.445
A tiny tiny robot like Anki's Cozmo,

00:27:08.445 --> 00:27:10.630
it's OK if he gets angry and snarky or whatever because

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:13.120
it's kind of cute that see a little robot that size throwing a tantrum.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.800
But a robot our size is already,

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.015
it's too big to throw a tantrum.

00:27:16.015 --> 00:27:18.830
If you throw a tantrum, it's scary.

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.390
One of Kuri's other big features is that he will have over the air updates regularly.

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.490
And so what you get when you first get Kuri out of

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:27.280
the box is not what Kuri's going to be able to do forever.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.150
Kuri will gain in capability and intelligence over time.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:33.190
So, your robot grows with you.

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:36.070
In some sense, he's going to keep getting better.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:37.905
When we launched our robot at CES,

00:27:37.905 --> 00:27:39.800
we won a whole lot of awards.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.650
And the press coverage was incredible,

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:43.380
way more than I ever imagined we could get.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.390
And, for us, that was validation that our design really

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:49.600
speaks to people and something that they would really want.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.135
So, we got best of CES from Engadget,

00:27:52.135 --> 00:27:56.790
and from PC Magazine, and from Wired.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.445
So, if you want a Kuri, then you can go to our web site,

00:27:59.445 --> 00:28:02.155
heykuri.com, and preorder one now.

00:28:02.155 --> 00:28:05.950
For $100 deposit, you can reserve your place in line.

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.915
Our robots will start shipping in December but

00:28:07.915 --> 00:28:10.600
only for the people who preordered initially.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.800
People who preorder now will get their robots in spring of 2018.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:18.150
So my role as a CTO has changed a lot as the company has grown.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:21.835
When we first started and, we were a company of only seven people or so,

00:28:21.835 --> 00:28:24.685
I was lead of all things technical

00:28:24.685 --> 00:28:27.970
and in charge of kind of the general architecture of the robot.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.190
So, it was a lot of choosing what

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.030
processors do we use and what do we use for the drive chain.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:35.230
And what do we use for sensing,

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:36.520
for mapping and navigation,

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.825
and what algorithms do we use,

00:28:37.825 --> 00:28:40.085
and how do we hide the camera.

00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:41.303
And should we use a camera,

00:28:41.303 --> 00:28:43.480
should we use a screen versus eyes,

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.595
that sort of thing.

00:28:45.595 --> 00:28:48.350
And also I was just part of the software team writing

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:52.180
actual software for things like mapping and navigation or just robot functions.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.541
As the team grew,

00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:57.875
we hired a lot of more people to write software and to build robots.

00:28:57.875 --> 00:29:00.790
And so I passed a lot stuff off to those people and then

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:03.955
I was primarily managing people for a while to build robots.

00:29:03.955 --> 00:29:07.195
And then, finally, we hired managers to manage the people that are building robots.

00:29:07.195 --> 00:29:09.760
And, so, I no longer had to manage all the people.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.760
So, now, I'm actually back to writing code and I

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:16.330
lead a small team focused on mapping navigation localization software.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.645
And that might sound odd as a very narrow thing for a CTO to do.

00:29:19.645 --> 00:29:22.480
But that's actually a very typical CTO transition

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.120
from a small startup to a large company.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.422
We're over 50 people now.

00:29:26.422 --> 00:29:29.410
So we have a lot of people to build robots and do things.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:33.385
And another big part of my role is to get out there and evangelize our tech to the world.

00:29:33.385 --> 00:29:37.750
And let everyone know that Kuri is awesome and full of great technology.

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.630
My proudest thing as CTO is the choice that we

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:43.750
made for the eyes in deciding that Kuri wasn't going to have a screen,

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.540
Kuri was going to have actual physical eyes.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.585
And, I think, it makes Kuri look a lot more lifelike and compelling in this way.

00:29:49.585 --> 00:29:53.160
And it also makes us not just another tablet on wheels.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.655
There's a lot of parents who want to limit screen time for their kids and they say,

00:29:56.655 --> 00:30:00.090
"Oh you can play with this tablet that's fine but only for a little while."

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.200
And, another tablet on wheels,

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.845
maybe is more of the same whereas Kuri is definitely not in that category.

00:30:05.845 --> 00:30:07.230
Kuri is a pet,

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:08.310
a companion, a friend.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:12.680
For me, my favorite part is actually working on the robot's algorithms.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.610
Things like mapping and navigation that I get

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:16.255
to focus on these days which is a lot of fun.

00:30:16.255 --> 00:30:18.120
And the sensors involved in designing

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.980
the sensors and making sure all that sort of thing works well.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:24.690
I mean, I'm a roboticist at heart and that's the,

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:26.270
really, the most fun part for me.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.020
One of the things I was most surprised at,

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:32.415
was just how many people have the robot dream of, "I really want a robot.

00:30:32.415 --> 00:30:34.610
My own R2-D2 version et cetera"

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:37.095
And I thought that was kind of limited to,

00:30:37.095 --> 00:30:38.670
you know, geeks and engineers or something.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.050
And, it turns out, that's pretty widespread.

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:42.185
There's a lot of people out there who really have that dream.

00:30:42.185 --> 00:30:44.160
Other random things that we found through testing

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.055
that was really surprising to me are things like,

00:30:47.055 --> 00:30:51.261
a lot of people don't understand top down maps.

00:30:51.261 --> 00:30:54.390
So, as a roboticists we're used to seeing, for instance,

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.280
navigation maps from the robot and then

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.905
specifying where you want the robot to go by saying,

00:30:58.905 --> 00:31:01.177
"In the map I would like you to go over here".

00:31:01.177 --> 00:31:03.990
And when we first started,

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:05.670
one of the very first test we did

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.965
was with a functional prototype that looked nothing like Kuri.

00:31:07.965 --> 00:31:10.530
And just with an app and we had an interface where you

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:13.645
could tell the robot to go various places using a top down map.

00:31:13.645 --> 00:31:16.110
And, most people could not understand the map,

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.360
and could not understand where the robot was,

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.865
and where they were telling him to go.

00:31:19.865 --> 00:31:21.435
And, not even just,

00:31:21.435 --> 00:31:23.445
we're used to laser maps being somewhat difficult.

00:31:23.445 --> 00:31:25.188
Because, you know, it's only black and white,

00:31:25.188 --> 00:31:27.930
it's from the level of the laser it's a 2-D map.

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:31.455
It doesn't necessarily resemble what you think of as a floor plan for your home.

00:31:31.455 --> 00:31:34.200
Like you might see, like, on the wall - the emergency floor plan,

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.090
this is where the exit is, et cetera.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.680
But even the emergency exit plans,

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.210
a lot people can't understand those.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:45.230
And we actually took a top down color maps of

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:47.480
the room which Kuri could not ever actually

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.030
get because Kuri can't see above table height for instance.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:54.185
But, we took scanners that were able to scan the room from a much higher height

00:31:54.185 --> 00:31:56.270
and could make full color renders

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:59.180
of this is what your entire room looks like from the top down.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.065
And can people even use that interface?

00:32:01.065 --> 00:32:03.425
And the answer was, no. Most people can't.

00:32:03.425 --> 00:32:05.525
And, so, we had to upend the idea of

00:32:05.525 --> 00:32:08.900
specifying navigation waypoints by top down map entirely,

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:12.340
so that users who can't understand them can still use the robot.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.325
So we moved instead towards,

00:32:14.325 --> 00:32:16.175
you drive the robot to a place,

00:32:16.175 --> 00:32:18.605
and you see what the robot is seeing through his camera,

00:32:18.605 --> 00:32:21.560
and you can save that point as a location in your house,

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.889
and both has a name and has a picture.

00:32:23.889 --> 00:32:25.205
And that's very intuitive to people,

00:32:25.205 --> 00:32:27.815
if you just click on that then you know where you're sending the robot.

00:32:27.815 --> 00:32:30.400
And he will go back to where you put him in the first place.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.000
Another very surprising thing to me,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.920
in terms of user interfaces, was joysticking.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:40.025
A lot of people can't actually joystick the robot with a basic joystick interface that,

00:32:40.025 --> 00:32:42.410
you you press forward and the robot moves forward.

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:45.990
When they're looking at the robot and they press forward the robot,

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:47.820
they think it's forward from their point of view.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.370
They don't necessarily understand

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:52.040
the transformation of forward from the robot's point of view.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.385
And some people never get that even after a lot of practice.

00:32:55.385 --> 00:32:58.250
And, so, we're still working now on exactly

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:01.600
like what best interfaces to give people to allow them to move around.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.970
But some things that we've tried that people seem to enjoy are things like,

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.280
you can click in the image to make the robot drive there.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.570
And that's intuitive because you're

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:10.250
looking at an image and you know where you're clicking on.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:14.095
In the image you know where the robot's going to go. That's much more intuitive.

00:33:14.095 --> 00:33:18.230
In developing Kuri, I guess I've learned more about people than about robots even.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:19.685
I mean I have learned a lot about robots.

00:33:19.685 --> 00:33:21.575
Making robots is insanely complicated.

00:33:21.575 --> 00:33:24.060
And I like to say the devil's in the details.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:27.305
If you get any little detail wrong that could be the thing that sinks your robot.

00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:30.580
It's just useless if any one of those things is very wrong.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:34.865
But making Kuri successful is all about human-robot interaction,

00:33:34.865 --> 00:33:39.095
and about design, and about making things intuitive and compelling and lifelike.

00:33:39.095 --> 00:33:42.830
And a lot of that has to do more about how people actually are,

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.030
or how people react to things,

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:45.580
or what people can understand.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:49.720
And, a lot of that goes into making the robot successful.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.530
The key to success for a home robot, I think,

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:57.700
is in personality and in getting the robot to look lifelike and accepted in the home.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.690
And a lot of that has to do with getting the interaction right with

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.915
the people and getting the look of the robot's right so he looks lifelike.

00:34:03.915 --> 00:34:06.020
And so that he's accepted in the home

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:09.860
as a member of your family something that you see everyday trundling around.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.310
He has to be compelling. He has to be adorable.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:14.210
So my advice to you is,

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:15.710
robotics is a great field.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.285
There are a lot of fun jobs in robots,

00:34:17.285 --> 00:34:19.905
especially today roboticists are highly sought after.

00:34:19.905 --> 00:34:21.905
I know because I'm trying to hire and it's really hard.

00:34:21.905 --> 00:34:23.675
And there are a lot,

00:34:23.675 --> 00:34:26.625
you should go out there and build lots of robots and have lots of fun.

00:34:26.625 --> 00:34:29.630
One thing I'm looking for a lot in a roboticist right now is,

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:33.190
we're looking for software engineers and so we want very strong programming skills.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:36.338
And so a lot of roboticist coming out of school,

00:34:36.338 --> 00:34:39.980
they know how to program robots but they don't know much about software carpentry.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.200
So learning the basics of how to write tests,

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.805
and how to do continuous integration,

00:34:43.805 --> 00:34:47.990
and having really good skills in writing things like C++ and Python.

00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:49.570
Those are all very important to us.

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:53.995
So one of the biggest things I've learned about trying to start this company.

00:34:53.995 --> 00:34:55.265
I thought when we started this company,

00:34:55.265 --> 00:34:57.760
"Oh this is my chance to learn all the ins and outs on

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.450
how to make adorable consumer robots, awesome consumer robots."

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:02.270
And, what I've learned is the way you make

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:05.630
awesome consumer robots is by hiring a team that can make awesome consumer robots.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:07.940
It's all about the team and the people you work with.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.100
You have to have experts in so many different things to make

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.650
a successful consumer robot and hiring good people is everything.

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:16.970
And also I've learned it's really

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:19.970
important to make your company very diverse and family-friendly.

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:21.950
Those are some of the core values of our company.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:25.535
We care a lot about making sure people have good work-life balance.

00:35:25.535 --> 00:35:28.640
And that they take care of their families and that where,

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.010
we're a friendly place for people to work even when they have

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.945
small children and they need time to deal with their small children.

00:35:33.945 --> 00:35:36.763
And making a company diverse and family friendly,

00:35:36.763 --> 00:35:38.930
it's not just a better place to work but it

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:42.470
also helps you to make robots that appeal to everybody.

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:44.645
So you don't have robots that just appeal to, you know,

00:35:44.645 --> 00:35:46.020
a very narrow demographic of,

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.205
you know, focus engineers.

00:35:47.205 --> 00:35:51.580
You have robots to appeal to all different shapes and sizes of people.
