00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:07.179
CYP2C9, or C Y P 2 C 9, is a member of a class of enzymes called cytochrome P450

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:13.870
oxidases. This family of enzymes is expressed robustly in the liver. And

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.010
it's responsible for metabolizing a large amount of

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.720
the drugs and chemicals that pass through your

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.740
body. You can think of these proteins as

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.070
the detox proteins. because that's pretty much what

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.190
they do for you. They take all the nasty

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.580
stuff, all the bad stuff. All the drugs. All

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.509
the chemicals that get in your body. And over

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.900
time, sometimes faster, sometimes slower. They're able to break

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.370
them down, and get rid of them. Now, the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.790
shorthand notation for cytochrome P450 oxidase is, is just

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.900
CYP, or CYP. And there are many different specific

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.530
kinds of CYP proteins. Specifically, CYP2C9 directly breaks down

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.450
warfarin, making it a pharmacokinetic player in the warfarin pathway. So

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.700
based on this information, which of the following would result in

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.569
the most severe warfarin toxicity. An efficient CYP2C9 or an inefficient

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:10.790
CYP2C9? Remember, warfarin toxicity in this case would be too much warfarin.
