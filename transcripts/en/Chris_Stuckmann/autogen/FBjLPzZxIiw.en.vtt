00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900
a trailer and I found that odd and so I
 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.780
a trailer and I found that odd and so I
wasn't that surprised that they murder

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790

infinity war I really liked how that all
played out and that was sort of the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120
played out and that was sort of the
 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.600
played out and that was sort of the
movie we expected to see but maybe some

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610
movie we expected to see but maybe some
 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.800

towards the end sort of like the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550
towards the end sort of like the
 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.759
towards the end sort of like the
beginning of glass the first like 20

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769
beginning of glass the first like 20
 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.259
beginning of glass the first like 20
minutes of glass was how I thought the

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269
minutes of glass was how I thought the
 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.550
minutes of glass was how I thought the
whole movie would be but it was just the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560
whole movie would be but it was just the
 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.560
whole movie would be but it was just the
beginning and then we cut to five years

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570
beginning and then we cut to five years
 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.720
beginning and then we cut to five years
later and that was surprising and I

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730
later and that was surprising and I
 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.520
later and that was surprising and I
loved how Steve was part of a self-help
