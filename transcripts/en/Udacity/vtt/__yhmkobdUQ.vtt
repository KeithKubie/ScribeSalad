00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.726
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now that we've seen absolute value equations, let's try absolute value

00:00:03.726 --> 00:00:07.585
inequalities. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which of these number lines has the solution set that could

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:11.501
satisfy this inequality? Think about what absolute value means, &amp;gt;&amp;gt; That will

00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:12.817
help you find the numbers.
