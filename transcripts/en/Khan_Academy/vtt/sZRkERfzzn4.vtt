00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.055
I finished the last video
touching on the stimulus plan

00:00:04.055 --> 00:00:06.140
and whether it's going
to be big enough and

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.400
what its intent was.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.270
But I was a little handwavy
about things like savings and

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.230
GDP and I thought it would
actually be good to get a

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.010
little bit more particular.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.530
This isn't just me
making up things.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.220
So a good place to start
is just to think

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.540
about disposable income.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.530
And people talk about it without
ever giving you a good

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.020
definition.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.840
It's important to understand
what disposable income is.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.780
So this box right here is GDP,
so it's all the goods and

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.540
services, essentially all the
income, that we produce.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.610
The disposable income is
essentially the amount that

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.240
ends up in the hands
of people.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.870
So the U.S. GDP, I don't know
what the exact number is, it's

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:52.110
on the order of I think
$15 trillion.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.590
And so some of that money
goes to taxes.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.840
I don't know.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.950
Let's say $3 trillion
ends up in taxes.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.000
And these are round numbers,
but it gives you a sense of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.970
the make-up.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.050
Then maybe about another
$1 trillion is saved by

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.710
businesses.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.210
So let's say that I'm Microsoft
and I make a billion

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.790
dollars a share.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.440
Microsoft makes a lot more
than that, but I make a

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.320
billion dollars.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.170
And I just keep it in a bank
account owned by Microsoft.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.750
I don't give it to
my employees.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.840
I don't dividend it out
to the shareholders.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.620
I just keep that.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.760
So corporate savings,
let's say, is

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.570
another trillion dollars.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.970
These are roundabout numbers.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.910
And then everything
left over is,

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.160
essentially, disposable income.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.360
I'm making some simplifications
there, but

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.820
everything left over is
disposable income.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.850
And the idea is, what is in the
hands of households after

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.020
paying their taxes:
disposable income.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.720
That check that you get after
your taxes and everything else

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.030
that is taken out of your
paycheck, that money, that is

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.000
disposable income to you.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.710
So the interesting thing is
where this disposable income

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.270
has been going over the
last many, many years.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.050
So this right here, this
chart, is a plot of the

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.010
percentage of disposable income
saved since 1960.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.040
I got this off the Bloomberg
terminal again.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.580
And just so you get a good
reference point, let me draw

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.420
the line for 10%.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.730
Because I kind of view that
as a reference point.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.680
That's 10% personal savings.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.850
Actually, you could go back even
further than this, and

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.110
you can see from the 1960s all
the way until the early `80s,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.830
the go-go `80s, people were
saving about 10% of their

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.060
disposable income.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.470
Of what they got on that
paycheck after paying taxes,

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.860
they were keeping about 10% of
it, putting it in the bank.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.845
And, of course, that would later
be used for investment

00:02:42.845 --> 00:02:44.000
and things like that.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.330
But then starting in the early
`80s, right around, let's see,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.470
about 1984, you see that people
started saving less and

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.970
less money.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.660
All the way to the extreme
circumstance, to 2007, where,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.540
on average, people didn't
save money.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.540
Where maybe I saved $5, but
someone else borrowed $5.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.580
So on average, we didn't
save money.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.810
Actually we went slightly
negative.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.150
And all of this, and this is
kind of my claim-- and it can

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.230
be borne out if you look at
other charts in terms of the

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.580
amount of credit we took on-- is
because we took on credit.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.390
I guess there's two things
you could talk about.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.270
We took on credit and we started
having what I call

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.200
perceived savings, right?

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.090
If I buy a share of IBM a lot
of people say, oh, I saved I

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.670
saved my money, I'm invested
in the stock market.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.560
But when I bought a share of
IBM, unless that dollar I paid

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.460
for the share goes to IBM to
build new factories-- And

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.850
that's very seldom time.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.890
Most of the time, that dollar I
gave to buy that IBM share,

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.010
just goes to a guy who
sold an IBM share.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.340
So there's no net investment.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.460
It's only investment, it's only
savings, when that dollar

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.770
actually goes to invest in some
way, build a new factory

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.880
or build a new product
or something.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.490
So I think you had more and more
people thinking that they

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.820
were saving when they weren't.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.670
Maybe thinking that they were
saving, as their home equity

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.920
in their house grew, or
as their stock market

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.830
portfolio went up.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.330
But there wasn't actual
aggregate savings going on.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.500
In fact, if anything, they were
borrowing against those

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.070
things, especially
home equity.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.350
And the average savings rate
went down and down and down.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.890
So now we're here in 2007, and
maybe you could say 2008,

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.810
where this is the capacity.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.810
We should probably talk about
world capacity, because so

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.310
much of what we consume really
does come from overseas, but

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.780
this is the capacity serving the
U.S. And let's say, going

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.490
into 2007, this was demand.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.970
Supply and demand was, let's
say, pretty evenly matched.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.370
If you go to that top up here,
you see that we were at 80%

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.190
utilization, which
isn't crazy.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.180
So if anything, you could say
that demand was maybe right

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.630
around here.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.390
But that's a good level.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.280
You want to be at around
80% utilization.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.460
That's the rate at which you
don't have hyperinflation, but

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.190
you're utilizing things
quite well.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.180
Now all of a sudden, the credit
crisis hit and all this

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.590
credit disappears.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.890
And I'd make the argument that
the only thing that enabled us

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.530
to not save this money,
is more and more

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.680
access to cheap credit.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.390
Every time we went through a
recession, from the mid `80s,

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.500
onwards, the government
solution was to

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.520
make financing easier.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.280
The Fed would lower
interest rates.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.680
We would pump more and
more money into

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.790
Fannie and Freddie Mac.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.070
We would lower standards
on what it

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.990
took to get a mortgage.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.890
We would create incentives
for securitization.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.230
We would look the other way when
Bear Stearns is creating

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.510
collateralized debt obligations,
or AIG is writing

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.670
credit default swaps.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.120
And all of that enabled
financing.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.700
Until we get to this point right
here, where everything

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.020
starts blowing up.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.540
So you essentially have
forced savings.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.550
When people can't borrow
anymore, the savings rate has

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.250
to go to 10% because most of
this is just from people

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.730
taking on more credit.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.720
There were a group of people
who were probably already

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.730
always saving at 10% of their
disposable income.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.430
But there's another group of
people who were more than

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.100
offsetting that by
taking credit.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.260
Now that the credit crisis hits,
you're going to see the

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.750
savings rate-- and you already
see it with this blip right

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.780
there-- the savings rate is
going to go back up to 10% of

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.310
disposable income.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.080
Now if the savings rate goes
back to 10% of disposable

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.830
income, that amount of money,
that 10% of disposable income,

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.340
this gap, is 10% of disposable
income that cannot be used for

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.990
consumption.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.530
And let's think about how large
of an amount that is.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.480
Right now, the U.S. disposable
income, if I were to draw

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.280
disposable income-- this number
right here, I just

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.240
looked it up-- it's around $10.7
trillion, let's say $11

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.630
trillion for roundabout.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.250
So this 10% of disposable income
that we're talking

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.570
about, this gap between the
normal environment, the

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.960
environment that was enabled
from super-easy credit, that's

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.460
10% of disposable income.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:57.950
10% of $11 trillion is $1.1
trillion per year of demand

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.010
that will go away.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.440
That's per year.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.180
So all of a sudden, you're going
to have a gap where this

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.680
was the demand before
and now the demand's

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.710
going to drop to here.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.940
And all of this $1.1 trillion
of demand is going to

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.730
disappear, because credit
is now not available.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.410
And then you do get a situation
where you might hit

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.820
a low capacity utilization.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.990
Unfortunately, the capacity
utilization numbers don't go

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.820
back to the Great Depression,
and we could probably get a

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.750
sense of, at what point
does a deflationary

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.520
spiral really get triggered.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.390
But because that $1.1 trillion
in demand disappears, you're

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.530
going to see this orange line
just drop lower and lower in

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.900
terms of capacity utilization.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.310
And that's going to
drive prices down.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.480
And what Obama and the Fed and
everyone else is trying to do,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.030
is to try to make up this gap.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.950
Now, everyone else can't
borrow money.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.760
Companies can't borrow money.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.210
Homeowners can't borrow money.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.200
But the government can borrow
money, because people are

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.640
willing to finance it.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.640
At the bare minimum, the Fed's
willing to finance the

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.820
government.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.080
And so the government wants to
come in and take up the slack

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.930
with this demand and
spend the money

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.990
themselves with the stimulus.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.750
Now we just talked about, what's
the magnitude of this

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:06.240
demand shock?

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.500
It's $1.1 trillion per year.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.370
While the stimulus plan
is on the order

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.200
of a trillion dollars.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.850
And that trillion dollars isn't
per year, although I

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.660
have a vague feeling that we
will see more of them coming

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.010
down the pipeline.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.870
This stimulus plan that just
passed is expected to be spent

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.020
over the next few years.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.210
So in terms of demand created
over the next few years, it's

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.750
going to be several hundred
billion per year.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.409
So it's not going to be anywhere
near large enough to

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:39.280
make up for this demand shock.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.179
So we're still going to have
low capacity utilization.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:45.160
So the people who argue that
these stimulus plans are going

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.340
to create hyperinflation, I
disagree with that, at least

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.860
in the near term, because in
the near term it's nowhere

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.590
near large enough to really
soak up all of the extra

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.100
capacity we have
in the system.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.110
And if anything, it's going to
soak up different capacity.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.210
So the stimulus plan might
create inflationary-like

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.430
conditions in certain markets
where the stimulus plan is

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:07.150
really focused.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.060
But in other areas, where you
used to have demand, but the

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.470
stimulus plan doesn't touch,
like $50 spatulas from

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.380
Williams Sonoma or granite
countertops, that area is

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.860
going to continue to
see deflation.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.720
And I would say net-net, since
this thing this is actually so

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.300
small, even though we're talking
about trillion dollars

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.450
relative to the amount of demand
destroyed per year,

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.950
we'll probably still
have deflation.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.050
And, for anyone who's paying
close attention to it, and I

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:39.120
am because I care about these
things, the best thing to keep

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.350
a lookout for, to know when to
start running to gold maybe or

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.700
being super-worried about
inflation, is if you see this

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:50.020
utilization number creeping back
up into the 80% range.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.760
At least over the last 40 years,
that's been the best

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.070
leading indicator to
say when are we

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.960
going to have inflation.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.160
And for all those goldbugs out
there, who insist that all of

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.930
the hyperinflation or the
potential hyperinflation is

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.120
caused by our not being on the
gold standard, I just want to

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.170
point out that you can very
easily have-- we went off of

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.020
Bretton Woods and completely
went to a fiat currency in

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:18.240
'73, that right around here.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.740
But our worst inflation bouts
were actually while we were on

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.540
the gold standard.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.490
And that's because we had very
high capacity utilization.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.370
This is the war period.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:28.750
What happens during a war?

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.700
You run your factories
all-out.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.520
You run your farms all-out
to feed the troops.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.470
The factories, instead of
building cars, build planes.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:36.580
Everyone was working.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.180
Wages go up.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.440
Everything goes up and
you have inflation.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.460
A lot of people say, oh, the
war was the solution to the

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:43.870
Great Depression.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:48.260
And it is true in that it got
us out of that negative

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.000
deflationary spiral
that I talked

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.140
about in the last video.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.690
And it did it by creating an

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.700
unbelievable amount of inflation.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.780
And then after the war, you
could argue what allowed-- I

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.480
don't have GDP here, but the
U.S. GDP really did do well in

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.650
the postwar period-- it wasn't
the war per se, although the

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.920
war kind of did take us out of
the deflationary spiral.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.740
So after the war, you had
all of this capacity,

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.260
after World War II.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.270
So you had all this capacity
that was being used up by the

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.720
war, and then, all of the
sudden, the war ends.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.150
And you're like, well, we don't
have to build planes

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.650
anymore, we don't have to feed
the troops anymore, and now we

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.850
have all these unemployed troops
who come back home.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.540
What are we going
to do with them?

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.160
You'd say maybe, capacity
utilization would come back

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.280
down there.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.210
But what a lot of people don't
talk about is, the rest of the

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:35.220
industrial world's capacity
was blown to smithereens.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.960
At that point in time, the U.S.
was a smaller part of GDP

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.990
and the other major players
were Germany,

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.335
Western Europe and Japan.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.750
In the U.S., we didn't have
any factories bombed.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.100
The entire war took place
in these areas.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.040
And whenever people go on
bombing raids, the ideal thing

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.830
that they want to bomb
is factories.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.200
So what you had in the postwar
period, is you had all of

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.520
these countries that had their
capacity blown to smithereens.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.500
The U.S. was essentially the
only person left with any

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.240
capacity, and so all the demand
from the rest of the

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.750
world picked up the slack
in the U.S. capacity.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.430
And that's why, even though
there was a demand shock in

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:17.230
the U.S. after that, you also
had a supply shock from the

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.015
war where you had all of this
capacity that was blown to

00:12:20.015 --> 00:12:21.130
smithereens.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.590
In this situation that we
are in now, we have a

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.100
major demand shock.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.610
Financing just disappears and
the savings rate's going to

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:33.160
skyrocket because people
can't borrow anymore.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.620
But there's no counteracting
supply shock.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:40.160
Supply of factories making
widgets and all the rest is

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.910
staying the same.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.510
So the Obama administration is
trying to create a stimulus to

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.630
sop some of this up, but it's
not going to be enough.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.810
And my only fear is, with all
the printing money and all

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:53.340
that goes, once we do get
back to the 80% capacity

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.380
utilization, once we do go back
here, how quickly they

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.650
can unwind all of this printing
press money and all

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:00.390
of the stimulus plan.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:01.470
Because that's going
to be the key.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.880
Because, if we do get to 80%
capacity utilization or we

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.730
start pushing up there, and we
continue to run the printing

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.830
press-- because that's what,
essentially, government's

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.150
incentive is to do, because they
always feel better when

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.420
we're flush with money-- then,
and only then, you might see a

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.620
hyperinflation scenario.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.550
But I don't see that at least
for the next few years.
